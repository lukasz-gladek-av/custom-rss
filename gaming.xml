			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-gets-surprise-launch-on-nintendo-switch-2-takes-advantage-hardware/</link>
            <guid>1378078</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just surprised fans with the launch of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exceedingly popular Nintendo Switch 2 platform</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, the game was already available to play on the Switch 2 for those who owned the Switch version, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated-for-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated</a> in May 2022 and then <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-is-now-available-on-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> in September 2022. However, this native version offers various technical enhancements.</p>



<p>The developer says that it takes 'full advantage' of the latest Nintendo console's hardware, including NVIDIA DLSS support:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing</li>



<li>Improved load times</li>



<li>Optimized performance</li>



<li>Joy-Con 2 mouse control support</li>



<li>Motion controls</li>



<li>Amiibo support</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the technical improvements, Skyrim Anniversary Edition is exactly the same as it was on the original Switch. Just like with that version, Nintendo users can enjoy three exclusive in-game items inspired by The Legend of Zelda franchise: the Master Sword, the Hylian Shield, and the Champion’s Tunic. New users can purchase the game for $59.99, while existing Switch users will be able to upgrade to the improved version for free.</p>

<p>Beyond that, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Anniversary Edition includes the same content as it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-free-update-weighs-5-3gb-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when it first released</a> on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox consoles on November 11, 2021, on the 10th anniversary of the original game's launch. </p>



<p>That means the official expansions released by Bethesda Game Studios (Hearthfire, Dawnguard, and Dragonborn), as well as the following Creation Club items:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adventurer's Backpack</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Mail</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Daedric Plate</li>



<li>Alternative Armors - Dragon Plate</li>

<li>The Gray Cowl Returns!</li>



<li>Tundra Homestead</li>

<li>Vigil Enforcer Armor Set</li>



<li>Wild Horses</li>
</ul>



<p>That's the extent of the additional content you can get on the Nintendo Switch 2 (or the Nintendo Switch, for that matter) in Skyrim Anniversary Edition, since the game does not support the Creation Club menu on Nintendo's consoles, unlike PlayStation and Xbox consoles and, of course, PC. </p>



<p>By the way, if you've been hoping to see Skyrim's successor pop up any time soon, Bethesda's Todd Howard recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> that The Elder Scrolls VI is still 'a long way off', and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-will-release-before-the-elder-scrolls-vi-todd-howard-practically-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will launch after GTA VI</a> in any case (meaning in 2027 at the earliest). </p>

<p>Use these Roblox Midnight Chasers monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash and more.</p>



<p>Midnight Chasers is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-catch-a-monster-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game that immerses players in an exhilarating street racing experience where speed and skill determine a player’s success. Unlike most Roblox games, in Midnight Chasers, gamers drive supercars, hypercars, bikes or regular cars — weaving through traffic, cutting across highways, or just cruising and showing off their ride. The main objective of the game is to create the ultimate racing machine and test your driving prowess against friends or other players in high-speed competitions.</p>







<p>The more races you win, the better rewards you earn, which will help make your vehicle collection even more impressive. Because there’s a wide selection of vehicles, Midnight Chasers offers replay value. Thus, progression in Midnight Chasers revolves around collecting and using the game’s main currency: Cash. It’s the main resource within the game and allow players to purchase new vehicles and upgrades that can be used to enhance their racing capabilities. Thus, while these currencies can be earned during regular gameplay, redeeming codes will help give players a leg up.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-midnight-chasers-codes">How To Get More Midnight Chasers Codes</h2>



<p>Midnight Chasers codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the creator/developer’s social media pages. That includes Midnight In-Dev’s X account, as the team drops codes during game milestones and updates. However, keeping tabs on the various sources can be time-consuming, especially when there is no notification system in place when the codes expire.</p>



<p>Thus, we suggest bookmarking this guide in your browser, as we refresh it as soon as new Midnight Chasers codes are released and remove expired codes once they are no longer valid.</p>

<p>Is Larian's popular role-playing series back?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8199459c2ebe6"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8199459c2ebe6/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're just days out from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-game-awards-2025-time-date-and-how-to-watch">The Game Awards</a>, and one marketing stunt that's got <em>a lot</em> of attention in the lead up to the show is a mysterious statue located in the middle of the Mojave Desert.</p>
<p>It's ignited plenty of speculation online, and now a trio of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity</a> trademarks, which were filed in Europe on 9th December 2025, appear to confirm it's an announcement related to Larian's popular role-playing series. As you can see below, the symbols match the statue:</p>
<figure data-uuid="d33bce385024d"><a title="Divinity" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d33bce385024d/divinity.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: MP1st</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire is the news this week of a PlayStation 5 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition</a> being added to Sony's servers. Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse responded to this, mentioning how the team <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998477127478554899">wasn't "meant to announce that yet"</a>. Douse has also supposedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-divinity-original-sin-3/">ruled out Divinity Original Sin 3</a>.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series versions of Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition were <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/new-divinity-logo-and-symbols-trademarked-matching-mystery-the-game-awards-2025-statue#google_vignette">rated by PEGI in November 2024</a>, but they haven't been released.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vgqhpw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/12/mystery-game-awards-reveal-is-a-new-divinity-rpg-as-riddle-is-finally-solved">our colleagues at Push Square</a> note, this could even be a "double-header" of announcements including "a re-release of Original Sin 2 on new-gen consoles and a fresh announcement for the franchise".</p>
<p>If we hear anything on the Nintendo front, we'll let you know. Larian previously released Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition on the Switch eShop in 2019 (<a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/010027400cdc6000">and it's compatible with the Switch 2</a>), but we're sure many fans would embrace a next-generation upgrade.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#913)—Clues and Answers for Wednesday, December 10]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-december-10-913/</link>
            <guid>1378036</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another day, another dollar, right? Or in this case, another day, another round of much-needed NYT Connections hints and solutions. Today’s puzzle is waiting for you, and I’m assuming that you’re keeping up that all-important streak as we head towards the most exciting day of the year.</p>



<p>If you’re pressed for solving today’s NYT Connections puzzle and need the best hints and solutions around, simply read on.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>

<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-december-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (December 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #913:</p>



<ul>
<li>WHY</li>



<li>YES</li>



<li>DEAR</li>



<li>SWEET</li>



<li>YEAR</li>



<li>COPY</li>



<li>SUCKER</li>



<li>DUMMY</li>



<li>FAKE</li>



<li>GRACIOUS</li>



<li>YELLOW</li>



<li>CANDY</li>



<li>MERCY</li>



<li>LOLLY</li>



<li>DUPE</li>



<li>HEAVENS</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Exclamations of politeness or astonishment</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Something not real or original</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>Sweet treats and the people who fall for them</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Words that start with the same letter</em>, <em>kind of</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, December 10:</p>

<p>The Mega Dimension DLC for Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A has been released and it provides a welcome relief for those grinding for the Shiny Charm, removing a tiresome requirement.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shiny Charm in Pokémon<strong> </strong>Legends: Z-A</a> is unlocked by maximizing the level of Mable’s Research Tasks, and, in the base game, obtaining it required completing one of the most tedious grinds in franchise history. However, that has now changed.</p>







<h2 id="h-mega-dimension-dlc-removes-tiresome-shiny-charm-requirement">Mega Dimension DLC Removes Tiresome Shiny Charm Requirement</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Reduced grind. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>To obtain the Shiny Charm in the base game of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, players had to complete almost all of Mable’s Research Tasks, and it was impossible to claim the reward without completing one task in particular.</p>



<p>Players had to grind through a whopping 1,000 victories in the game, which required repeatedly churning through the Z-A Royale to defeat trainers before the final reward was dished out.</p>



<p>The launch of the Mega Dimension DLC changes that, however, as additional Research Tasks are provided by Mable, making it possible to obtain the Shiny Charm without having to secure 1,000 victories.</p>



<p>Though the new tasks come too late for those who have already grinded through the requirements to obtain the charm, which significantly increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon, it’s a welcome boost for those yet to complete the grind.</p>



<p>There’s still plenty to do, however, as the new Research Tasks require exploring Hyperspace Lumiose to catch new Pokémon, obtain new Mega Evolutions, and enter pockets of Hyperspace. However, they’re much easier to tick off than the 1,000 battles requirement.</p>

<p>From here on out, the team will "no longer do back-to-back releases" of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/call_of_duty_modern_warfare_3">Modern Warfare</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_black_ops_ii">Black Ops</a> games. The aim is to provide a truly "unique experience" in each entry and "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vgqhpw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>- We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p>
<p>- We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This update on the series' future follows <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">negative fan reception</a> to the latest outing <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/call_of_duty_black_ops_7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which launched in November.</p>
<p>Although this change could potentially impact the development cycle going forward, the Call of Duty team believes the future of the series is still "very strong". It also notes how it's already working on the "next era of Call of Duty", which it promises will deliver "precisely" what fans want, and some surprises to move the franchise "and the genre" forward.</p>
<p>Microsoft entered a 10-year commitment to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms in 2022, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/02/microsofts-commitment-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-is-now-legally-binding">deal made legally binding in 2023</a>. This followed with Microsoft being given the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/microsoft-given-all-clear-in-the-us-to-acquire-activision-blizzard">all-clear on the Activision Blizzard acquisition</a> in the same year.</p>
<p>More recently, Call of Duty job listings have popped up online seeking talent with Nintendo Switch experience.</p>

<p>Nintendo shared a massive surprise in September, revealing it would be reviving the Virtual Boy for 'Nintendo Classics'.</p>

<p>Of course, to purchase these items, you'll need to be a paid Switch Online member. The more expensive unit will set you back <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong>, and the cheaper cardboard model is priced at <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games</link>
            <guid>1377958</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The team promises "an absolutely unique experience each and every year."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty will no longer release multiple Black Ops or Modern Warfare games back-to-back, after two Modern Warfare releases in 2022 and 2023, and two Black Ops releases in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and negative feedback and concerning sales reports for the most recent release, Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news was delivered from "<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Call of Duty team"</a> (encompassing studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, Infinity Ward, and Raven Software) on the official website, in a post that acknowledged the criticism of Black Ops 7 as well as broader criticism of the franchise in recent years. As the post opens:</p><blockquote>First off, thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months. Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The post goes on to state a number of changes the Call of Duty studios will be making going forward. For starters, they're opening up Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week, in an effort to get those who have hesitated on Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves." They also are committing to "unprecedented season support," saying that they "won't rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, the team had this to say about future Call of Duty releases:</p><blockquote>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</blockquote><blockquote>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The note concludes by saying the team believes Call of Duty's "best days are ahead of us" and that the next era of Call of Duty will "deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes come amidst, and likely in response to, a rough couple of years for the Call of Duty franchise. The most recent entry, Black Ops 7, debuted last month to middling reviews, including our own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">6/10 campaign review</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">6/10 Zombies review</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">significantly better 8/10 multiplayer review</a>. This is also in the context of both Black Ops 7 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Modern Warfare 3</a> receiving poor reviews in comparison to their immediate series predecessors the year before, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Black Ops 6</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-ii-multiplayer-review">Modern Warfare 2</a> being received generally favorably. This likely accounts, at least in part, for the decision to stop the back-to-back releases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Black Ops 7, that lukewarm reception has also been reflected in the game's sales numbers, especially in relation to another recent major multiplayer shooter release, Battlefield 6. The game had a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">"terrible" launch</a> in Europe, down 63% versus Battlefield 6 and down by more than 50% versus last year's Black Ops 6 in the equivalent periods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that we don't have full visibility into Black Ops 7's sales data, as it launched day one on Game Pass, and a number of people likely played the game through the subscription service and didn't count as unit sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But nonetheless, the announcement today feels like an admission that something has gone wrong here. Whether or not the Call of Duty team can fix it will take a few years to truly comprehend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

                <p>Amazon has opened preorders for CRKD's next Gibson Guitar Controller. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FZTG1QK6?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gibson SG 20th Anniversary Edition</a> retails for $135 and is slated to launch <strong>December 19</strong>. Notably, this is the first wireless guitar controller in CRKD's catalog licensed by PlayStation. The Gibson SG syncs wirelessly to PS5, PS4, PS3, and PC via a 2.4GHz dongle. The multiplatform version of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DZ71SS97,B0DZ746LB9,B0DZ715FM4,B0DZ73PJNF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CRKD's Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controller</a> is limited to a wired connection on PS5 and PS4, so the Gibson SG is likely the better option for Fortnite Festival and Rock Band 4 players on PlayStation.</p><p>PS5 players now have two officially licensed wireless guitar controllers to choose from.

The original Gibson SG had a red body and black pick guard, whereas the new model has a black body, white pick guard, and brown neck. Still, it's rather fitting that the first officially licensed Gibson controller for PS5 pays homage to the most recognizable guitar in Guitar Hero history.</p><p>The 20th Anniversary Edition has Matte EZ Glide Mechanical Frets with RGB backlighting, a Hall Effect strum bar with the classic "clicking" feedback, a whammy bar, and a tilt sensor to activate Star Power. Like the Les Paul editions, the SG has a modular design with a removable neck. The controller's D-pad is located on the back of the headstock. The eight-button Navigation Hub has PlayStation input labels and a Hall Effect stick in the center. The dial with the PlayStation logo switches between wireless and wired connections, while the white dial lets you activate KEYJAM and Legacy modes. Legacy mode lets you use the controller wirelessly on PS3 to play old Rock Band and Guitar Hero games.</p><p>According to CRKD's compatibility list, KEYJAM mode on the SG is different from the Les Paul. It's likely due to the PlayStation license, but KEYJAM seems to only work for PlayStation consoles and PC. The Les Paul multiplatform guitars can play Fortnite Festival in wired mode on PlayStation and Xbox consoles in KEYJAM mode. It's also worth noting the Les Paul multiplatform editions support Switch 1/2 with wireless and wired connections and have Legacy mode for PS3. Both models support Bluetooth connections for mobile devices and are compatible with CRKD's free customization app.</p><p>Here's what you'll find inside the box:</p><ul><li>Black SG Guitar Controller Body</li><li>Brown OG Signature Pro Fret Neck</li><li>Black Shoulder Strap</li><li>2.4GHz Wireless Dongle</li><li>8.2-foot USB-C Cable</li><li>Removable Rechargeable Battery</li><li>KEYJAM Nav Hub Sticker</li><li>Quickstart Guide</li></ul></div>                      </div><h2>All CRKD Gibson Guitar Controllers</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620121" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620121"></a><figcaption>CRKD Gibson Les Paul Guitar Controllers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620121-crkdlespaul.jpg"></figure><p>The Gibson SG's $135 price point matches the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DZ715FM4,B0DZ73PJNF&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Les Paul Blueberry Burst Pro</a> that's officially licensed by Microsoft for Xbox consoles.

It's worth noting that the Blueberry Burst Pro Editions have strum bars with haptic feedback.

The past four releases in the series have been <em>Modern Warfare II</em> (2022), <em>Modern Warfare III</em> (2023), <em>Black Ops 6</em> (2024), and <em>Black Ops 7</em> (2025), but moving forward, Activision wants to offer “an absolutely unique experience each and every year,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">according to a blog post</a>.</p><p><em>Black Ops 7</em> came out in November to mixed reviews, and in Europe, the game had a “disappointing launch,” <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-drops-to"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. Ahead of the game’s release, Treyarch Senior Director of Production Yale Miller <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-7-devs-admit-theyre-worried-about-series-fatigue-after-back-to-back-games-3255551/">told <em>CharlieIntel</em></a> that he was worried about <em>Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Black Ops 7</em> being seen as too similar.</p><p>“We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental,” Activision says. “While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.” The post also notes that “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams” and that the “next era” of <em>Call of Duty</em> will “deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward.”</p><p>This year, <em>Call of Duty</em> is also facing competition from EA’s <em>Battlefield 6</em>, which sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/800922/battlefield-6-is-off-to-a-good-start">more than 7 million copies</a> in its first three days of launch and is already being <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825171/battlefield-6-had-a-big-launch-month">touted by EA as</a> the “best selling shooter game of the year,” and Arc Raiders, which has <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/lAG8/RG5i/c5pp.pdf">sold more than 4 million copies</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back]]></content:encoded>

Each action demands purpose; every misstep can be fatal.</p><p>After each victory, choose your next path and grow stronger. The mightier you become, the deadlier your future foes will be.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Since the day Onis rose from the depths of hell, calamity has plagued the land. Even on the rare occasion that one was slain, its soul would simply return to a new body, and the endless cycle of death and devastation continued without pause.</p><p>Amid this despair, a divine Sakura tree took root. Blessed by the Gods, this sacred tree is a divine vessel capable of sealing Oni souls and preventing their rebirth. This miracle came to be known as Onikura.</p><p>But the Onis still need to be defeated, so brave warriors from every corner of the land took up their swords and set out to destroy the Oni and deliver their souls to the great Sakura tree. But none ever returned—but one.</p><p>You are Tensai, the final Onikura Samurai—a human-god resonance born at the village where the divine Sakura tree took root. Your sword is the world’s last hope. You will hunt down the remaining Onis, seal their corrupted souls within Onikura, and bring an end to the cycle once and for all.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1012579"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Every time an Oni is sealed, its soul is purified by the divine Sakura tree, transforming into Omamori—talismans that bless Tensai with unique abilities. </p><p>Before each encounter, freely combine Omamori to forge your own combat style. Will you master flawless parries, sacrifice your life in exchange for deadly strikes, or channel spiritual energy to control the arena from afar?</p><p>There is no ultimate build—only your path as the true Onikura Samurai.</p><p><strong>Art Style</strong></p><p>Featuring meticulously hand-crafted, high-frame pixel art, <em>Onikura</em> fuses oriental elegance with a haunting post-apocalyptic world set in Ancient Japan. </p><p>Every duel with the Oni unfolds in a special arena—ruined shrines, war-torn villages, and blood-soaked sakura groves. Each Oni carries its own backstory. Beneath the petals of the divine Sakura Tree, only your brave sword can decide the fate of the world.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-gaming-laptop-with-solid-specs-40gb-ddr5-1tb-ssd-drops-70-off-amazon-goes-zero-profit-to-dump-stock-2000651754</link>
            <guid>1377880</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  The best value for money for a Lenovo laptop lately.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Amazon occasionally drops deals that seem too aggressive to be real and this Lenovo gaming laptop falls squarely into that category with specifications that cover gaming, entertainment and serious work tasks across the board. Lenovo’s own website sells this machine at full price without any discounts, but Amazon has slashed 70% off in what appears to be a final clearance situation: You’re looking at a laptop with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/">40GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor now priced at $899 instead of the typical $2,999 asking price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Handle Heavy Workloads</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 5 7535HS processor has six cores and twelve threads</strong> that run at a base clock speed of 3.3GHz and when you need extra power for heavy tasks, it can boost up to 4.55GHz. This chip architecture gives great single-threaded performance for gaming, and the multi-core setup can handle video editing, 3D rendering, or running multiple virtual machines at the same time without any problems. The 16MB L3 cache keeps data that is often accessed close to the processor cores which lowers latency and makes all applications more responsive.</p>



<p>The 40GB DDR5 RAM setup is very good for a laptop in this price range and gives the system enough room to grow, even though most users won’t use it all the time. DDR5 memory has a higher bandwidth than DDR4, which helps integrated graphics work better and speeds up tasks that move a lot of data around. You can have 50 tabs open in Chrome, work on several large files in Photoshop, and keep Spotify streaming in the background and you will still have resources available for whatever you want to do next.</p>
<p>With a PCIe NVMe SSD, the storage space can hold up to 1TB and it loads your operating system in seconds and opens applications almost instantly. The difference in speed between this solid-state storage and regular hard drives changes the way people use computers every day: You no longer have to wait for things to happen when you use your computer, and you can keep your whole game library, a big collection of photos, and work documents all in one place without having to constantly switch between external drives or cloud storage.</p>



<p>The<strong> 15.3-inch screen has a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which gives you more vertical space than a standard 1080p screen. This is helpful when working with documents, spreadsheets, or code. The IPS panel keeps colors true and has better viewing angles than TN panels. The 300-nit brightness rating makes sure that the screen can be seen even in bright places or near windows. Anti-glare coating makes it easier on your eyes when you work for a long time by spreading out reflections that would otherwise bounce off the screen.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is the newest standard for wireless networks, and it offers faster speeds and better performance in crowded network environments than older standards. Bluetooth 5.3 connects your peripherals with a longer range and more stability and <strong>the mix of USB-A and USB-C ports</strong> makes sure that both old and new accessories will work with it. The USB-C port supports Power Delivery 3.0, which lets you charge your devices quickly, and DisplayPort 1.2, which lets you connect external monitors so you can work at a desk. The<strong> HDMI output gives you another way to connect a display</strong>, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> makes it easier to transfer photos from cameras, and the <strong>headphone jack</strong> is for audiophiles who like wired connections.</p>
<p>A $2,100 discount on a laptop is the kind of deal that makes people raise their eyebrows, but looking at the specs shows that you’re getting real hardware instead of old parts dressed up with marketing language. Lenovo usually charges well into the thousands for laptops with this much RAM and storage, so the $899 price is almost too good to be true. The 70% off sale means that Amazon got too much stock and needs to get rid of it quickly.</p>

We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart World an 8 out of 10</a> in our review, with Logan Plant saying, “Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 has been flying off shelves despite a lack of Black Friday deals, and then even more so after retailers finally dropped the price by $50 off and on during Cyber Week.

But it also meant we didn’t get a lot of “crazy toy maker” experiments, like alarm clocks, cardboard backpacks, or micro-sized consoles. Which is why my pick for the perfect Nintendo fan gift this year isn’t exactly something truly new: it’s the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/metroid-prime-4-beyond/Amiibo_Functionality,_Rewards,_and_Unlocks">Metroid Prime 4 amiibo</a> triple threat of Samus herself, Samus &amp; Vi-O-La, and bounty hunter Sylux. Metallic paint amiibo are often some of the best – and I’m really liking the more aggressive stance of the standalone Samus and her shiny-red new suit and motorbike combo. Sylux himself looks a bit like an evil, blue Masterchief, rocking his trademark shoulder spikes. </p></div><div id="233483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Samus &amp; Vi-O-La - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233485"><div id="233485" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>amiibo Sylux Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Series</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Metroid amiibo are available now and Sylux is out now (as of December 4).</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>3.

Its matte material feels fantastic in the hands (and somehow never gets grimy), the control sticks have a great level of tension, the ZL and ZR triggers fit your fingers perfectly, and the new GL and GR back buttons add extra flexibility to whatever game you’re playing. Plus, it has a headphone jack, which was easily the Switch 1 Pro Controller’s biggest weakness. And, it has fantastic battery life – I’ve only had to charge mine a handful of times since the Switch 2 launched in June. Sure, Switch 1 controllers work on Switch 2, but the hardcore Nintendo fan in your life deserves this massive upgrade.</p></div><div catalogid="09569512-2c92-4dd0-88a7-4eb7d80358a4" id="224941"><div id="224941" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>4.

Characters of your choosing will watch over you while you sleep, and while that may sound creepy, it's not. They're actually collecting info on how well you're sleeping, and sharing it with you, because that's what friends do. Even if you don't use it for its intended alarm…o purposes, it's still an adorable time piece to keep on your desk. The screen is bright and crisp, and the dial on the top feels excellent to use and set. Best of all, they added Kirby with the most recent update, and who doesn't love Kirby? Don't answer that question, please. I don't want to know. </p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233486"><div id="233486" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alarmo</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>5.

We called Donkey Kong Bananza a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">10/10 masterpiece in our review</a> back in July, praising its destructible environments and incredible movement. It may not star Mario or Link, but this is a top-shelf first-party Nintendo game that got the Switch 2 generation off to a smashing start. It takes between 15 and 20 hours just to reach the credits, with dozens of more hours waiting for anyone that wants to see absolutely every banana tucked inside. If I were a kid, I can’t think of a game I’d have more fun with on Christmas morning than this one.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233487"><div id="233487" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>6.

Everything about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-the-lego-game-boy-set-72046">LEGO Game Boy</a> is delightful, from the screens you can change out to reflect the game you want to show off, to the replica carts you build with it. It's roughly the same size as an actual Game Boy, too, and the buttons feel almost identical to the ones on the real deal. It only takes around an hour to put together, and then you have this super cool collectible to show off to everyone who asks, and even people who don't ask. Stop people on the street, get their opinion of it.

I’ve played almost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">every mainline entry in the series</a> since then, and I was super excited to start playing Pokémon Legends: Z-A when it launched this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave the game a solid <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><u>8/10 review</u></a>, and I agree that it’s a great game overall. It takes bits and pieces of Legends: Arceus and Scarlet and Violet that brought new life to the series and flat out does those things better. The entire story takes place in a single location (Luminose City), which seems so small until the game starts to unfold and you meet new people and unlock new areas. It’s the urban Pokémon game I didn’t know I needed, and I’d recommend it to any fellow Pokéfan looking for their next obsession.</p></div><div catalogid="7a8f7e39-e589-4ac8-8cbf-ad5143b47287" id="233490"><div id="233490" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon™ Legends: Z-A</h3></p></div><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>8.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ignore-the-mini-4-pro-new-dji-mini-5-pro-bundle-with-3-batteries-drops-to-new-all-time-low-2000651747</link>
            <guid>1377859</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The DJI Mini 4 Pro held its position as the go-to compact drone for years but<strong> DJI released the Mini 5 Pro in September</strong> with upgrades that push the boundaries of what sub-250-gram drones can accomplish. Staying under that 250-gram threshold matters because it keeps you clear of FAA registration requirements in the United States which this an ideal drone for beginners and enthusiasts who want hassle-free flying.</p>
<p>This <em>Fly More Combo</em> bundle delivers everything you need for serious aerial photography right out of the box, including the DJI RC 2 controller with its built-in screen and three batteries for extended flying sessions. And right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $1,099, down from the usual $1,599</a>&nbsp;which makes this the perfect moment to invest in one of the most capable lightweight drones ever made.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional-Quality Video</h2>
<p>The 1-inch CMOS sensor is a big step up from the smaller sensors in older Mini models as it captures a lot more light and detail in each frame. With this bigger sensor, you can record <strong>4K video at 60 frames per second with HDR support</strong> and it gives you footage with a wide dynamic range that keeps details in both bright skies and dark landscapes. The Mini 5 Pro has color depth and clarity that are as good as or better than what you would get from much bigger, more expensive drones. This makes it a real tool for content creators who need professional results without having to carry around heavy equipment.</p>



<p>The <strong>225-degree gimbal rotation gives you creative options</strong> that fixed-angle gimbals can’t match: You can shoot true vertical content for social media without cropping or losing resolution, and you can tilt the camera to get dynamic establishing shots, follow subjects from interesting angles, or get footage from above that smoothly changes into footage from the front. This flexibility is especially useful when filming real estate, action sports, or travel videos, where different angles keep viewers interested. The gimbal stabilization system <strong>keeps the video smooth even when there is a little wind</strong>&nbsp;which is great because amateur drone videos are often shaky.</p>
<p><strong>Omnidirectional obstacle sensing</strong> uses both forward-facing LiDAR and vision sensors to find obstacles in all directions: This makes a safety net that keeps you from crashing even if you’re more focused on framing your shot than watching where you’re flying. The <strong>Nightscape feature</strong> improves this obstacle detection system for flights at night by using LiDAR to map your surroundings when regular vision sensors have trouble seeing in low light.</p>



<p><strong>ActiveTrack 360° has been improved to follow people more reliably</strong> with faster response times and different tracking modes that work in different situations. You can have the drone fly around you while you stay focused, follow behind at a set distance, or track from the side for dynamic parallel shots. The system is better at keeping cyclists and runners centered in the frame, even when they turn or speed up.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Flight Battery Plus that comes with this bundle gives you an extra 52 minutes of battery life, so you can stay in the air for a long time before you need to land and change batteries. With<strong> three batteries, you can fly for more than two and a half hours</strong> before you need to recharge. The charging hub charges all three batteries in about 193 minutes and manages the charging sequence well so you don’t have to wait hours between flying sessions. The <strong>internal storage space is 42GB</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with microSD cards before every flight, and you’ll never miss a shot because your card is full.</p>
<p>The <strong>DJI RC 2 controller has a bright built-in screen</strong> that you can see even in direct sunlight which means you don’t have to connect your phone and drain its battery while flying. It is easy to use the controls because there are separate buttons for key functions. You can change camera settings or start intelligent flight modes without having to go through menus. Both the drone and controller can be folded up and stored in a small bag or backpack, making it easy to take with you on hikes, road trips, or any other adventure where you want to get aerial footage.</p>
<p>It might seem like a lot to spend $1,099 on a drone bundle, but when you look at how much other systems with similar features cost, it doesn’t seem so bad. DJI usually keeps prices steady on new products, so this 31% discount on hardware that just came out a few months ago is a great deal.</p>
