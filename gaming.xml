            <p>True to the game's billing as the twistiest of duty-shooters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release date trailer appears to have leaked ahead of a possible <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> showing tonight. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will launch on 14th November, close to a month after rival Battlefield 6's release on October 10th. Also, it appears to have jet packs and mechs.</p><!--more-->
<p>The leak comes care of that ever-dependable source of military intelligence, a video advertisement that seems to have been accidentally published early. The ad has now been removed, but not before CharlieIntel spotted it and shared it on the Xeetbox, along with some <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957614174768689197?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">thoughts based on the user's own pre-release access</a>. "Just to tone down expectations, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 does not have jet packs or double jumps as part of its movement," CharlieIntel claims. Alas for Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a> players. Good news, I guess, for people who relish the 'omnimovement' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what we know of Call of Duty: Bleven for sure: it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">requires secure boot, to avoid cheaters</a>. It's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>. The campaign is set in 2035, hence the mechs and jet packs, and expands upon the global calamities unleashed in Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. It sees grizzly grumbleface David Mason chasing after an enigmatic new foe who "weaponise fear". There will probably be hallucinations and other Manchurian Candidate-esque horseplay to wash down the gadgets and gunnery.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-black-ops-7-video-features-mechs-jet-packs-and-a-release-date/">reported by VGC</a>, today's release date whoopsie corroborates a previous leak that also included a price tag for the Standard Edition - $70 or €80 - with a Vault Edition priced at $100 or €110. If legit, this means that Microsoft has still yet to cross the Rubicon and raise the game's base US price to $80, as they tried to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">until the internet started screaming at them</a>.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has announced that its RTX Hair feature will be added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on September 4. In a nutshell, RTX Hair uses Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS) to improve lighting and shadows in video game hair, which Nvidia says is a solution that doesn't require a lot of extra memory as opposed to using triangles to render hair for every frame.</p><p>By using linear swept spheres, hair will look more realistic because the geometry is naturally round, thus making it easier to avoid self-intersection when casting shadow and reflection rays. This will allow Harrison Ford's digital doppelganger in the Indiana Jones game to sport a fuller head of hair when the update to the real-time path tracing mode arrives next month. The feature will be available to RTX-50 series GPUs, and earlier this year, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/" rel="nofollow ">Nvidia added</a> that this is a "big step toward rendering high-quality digital humans" in real time.</p>

      </div>
<p>Hair and related elements like fur have been one of the more challenging things to accurately render in video games over the years. Fortunately, great strides have been made over the years as video game characters went from having what looked like static blobs of meat for hairdos--or buzz-cuts for many protagonists throughout the 2000s and early 2010s--to longer hair that moved realistically during gameplay.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched last year for PC and Xbox Series X|S--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">and in April 2025 for PS5</a>--and September will see the arrival of its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-dlc-the-order-of-giants-coming-in-september/1100-6532248/" data-ref-id="1100-6532248">The Order of Giants</a>. The DLC will see Dr. Jones embark on an expedition to uncover the secrets of the Nephilim Order.</p>

<p>Gamescom is set to unveil a flood of news, reveals, and trailers, with Future Games Show taking a central role with a lengthy livestream, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>The latter end of 2025 is shaping up to be a big one with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> among the big releases, though the calendar will likely be even more stacked following all the reveals at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opening Night Live</a> may take the majority of the headlines, plenty more will be shown at Future Games Show, so we’re providing the details so you don’t miss out.</p>

<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place on Wednesday, August 20, the day after Opening Night Live, with a host of new reveals and news.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a host of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several Future Games Show streams, though the main one is on Wednesday.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place at 8pm CEST, which is 11am PT. We’ve got a full breakdown of timezones below.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will start bang on time, with no countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in ahead of time. If you do miss any announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Check out the table below to see the start time of Future Games Show in your timezone.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How to Watch Future Games Show at Gamescom</h2>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom will be available to watch directly on YouTube and Twitch, along with TikTok, and plenty of other streaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>From experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/futuregamesshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow the live stream as it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZVRK-bSdkjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, so if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly recommend watching via Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform works for you, though, and keep Insider Gaming open to track all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show takes place on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, the home of the event.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will be hosted by David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, and Maggie Robertson, the star behind Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil: Village. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How Long is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<p><strong>The main Future Games Show stream is 90 minutes long, though it will be immediately followed by FGS Live, a 40-minute show with additional trailers and reveals.</strong></p>



<p>Given the show is set to be action-packed from beginning to end, I’d advise making sure you have everything you need to lock in for over two hours so you don’t miss any of the reveals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Let’s be clear, the Grand is definitely not haunted, but that doesn’t go for other parts of the British seaside town. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is a truly quirky mix of ideas, a real hodge-podge that blends hotel renovations, slice-of-life storytelling, horror mysteries and even reggae-infused musical numbers into something that’s quite unique.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2025 demo –&nbsp;playable at the Xbox booth this week –&nbsp;follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/no-ghosts-at-the-grand-is-a-musical-supernatural-hotel-renovator-with-a-talking-cat/">the game’s appearance during Microsoft’s summer showcase</a>, and gives a great serving of each of the game’s elements to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It starts with a bit of light renovation, as you look to refurnish and spruce up part of the lobby of the hotel that Chris David has just inherited. It’s in a bit of a state, but thankfully the multi-purpose DIY gun and the thoroughly helpful Robert C McBrushy is on hand to guide you through it. He’s a funny little AI DIY mascot, imbued with bags of personality thanks to the decidedly human writing that goes into his being. He’s sure to be a great source of humour and quirky oddities deep into the game.</p>
<p>The gun has multiple modes, right off the bat. A sandblaster can be used to basically shoot old wallpaper off and get back to the plaster underneath, ready for a very forgiving painting mode to spray and shoot globs of patterned paint at the wall – both of these modes autocompleting after you’ve dealt with around 80–90% of a section, and will neatly target through obstacles. A vacuum mode will scoop up plenty of large debris, and a furniture mode can pick up reorient the tumbled furniture and even hang paintings on the wall. Each mode has its own ping function to highlight what’s left to do. It’s all very slick and easy to get to grips with, and honestly, if this weren’t a physics-defying impossibility, I reckon Friday Sundae would make a killing on Dragons Den.</p>


<p>But there’s so much more to this game than just decorating. Miss Green, the town’s mayor hassles you until you answer the ancient Nokia-like brick phone, asking you to come out and help with a little something else around town? It turns out that there’s a mysterious black slime that’s been appearing on the beaches, and she thinks that it could be tracked, quite logically, to an old WW2 installation on the nearby Crammond Island.</p>
<p>So — much to McBrushy’s dismay — you drop what you were doing, hop onto her moped with her and her cat, Mr. Bones, and pootle along to the jetty, driving through some lovely autumnal scenery as you go, and even offroading down the path to get down to the sea shore.</p>
<p>The boat’s an absolute state, though, and needs a bit of help to get it into working order, with McBrushy more than willing to help. It gets even worse when you crash it into Crammond Island after a sudden fog rolls in. You can use the furniture grabber to pick up items like the front crane, railings and buoys to reattach them to the boat, while the vacuum gains a new feature to repurpose certain types of debris to fix up broken sections of hull or even create new furniture.</p>
<p>But getting to the island is an area where There Are No Ghosts at the Grand showcases its most distinctive element. Miss Green has a real chip on her shoulder about you taking over the hotel, stating that it really should be given over to the town to become a tourist attraction instead of being in your hands to mess around with and modernise — she expects the worst of Chris, since he is an American.</p>

<p>Her grousing bursts into song as you take to the water and pilot the boat through checkpoints, which I let wash over me while watching the demo be played by writer and game director Anil Glendinning — I rarely listen closely to song lyrics, and instead just appreciate a good tune, with her music having a bit of a folk reggae fusion to it. Each character in the game has their own theme tune and songs to unlock as you progress through the story, but it’s really all a part of the game’s dialogue system and relationships.</p>
<p>Where many video game dramas will give you dialogue options, here you’re given song options, the ability to respond with a verse of Chris’s own, bouncing the lyrics down a different path as the character then responds in kind. Each character has a relationship meter for you to build up, both through dialogue and completing tasks and missions, and this does feed into the game’s overarching narrative and some of the endings that will become available to you.</p>
<p>The team are aiming for a game that’s around 8–10 hours to complete, but there will be plenty of side content, people and jobs to take on. You’ll be redecorating so much more than the Grand in this… including a WW2 bunker, it turns out.</p>
<p>Stranded on the island and forced to wait for the low tide when a land bridge will appear, Chris has to make the best of the situation and spruce up a corner of the bunker to be a little bedroom. Anil went for more of a pink and flowery princess bedroom style here, with dressers, ornate lights, bright and colourful wallpaper, but you can obviously take it in some very different directions.</p>

<p>But suddenly there’s a sound. Miss Green said The Grand’s not haunted, but what about this island? Exploring the bunker reveals a shimmering ball of gold that expands as you get near, with humanoid forms within. It’s a memory, a portal back to historical events and people that you need to engage with in a number of ways to fix the scene and nudge the story along. McBrushy comes in all handy yet again, letting you move items back into place, to blast out-of-place boxes, and the other usual things. It gives a peek back into what the bunker’s true purpose was, though really you’re only left with more questions as you delve deeper and deeper into the bunker…. ably helped by McBrushy adding a little…. atmosphere.</p>

<p>Oh, and then Mr. Bones starts talking to you. What’s that? A talking cat? While he loves a good scratch and tickle round the ears during the day, eagerly hopping into moped basket and boat window to appreciate the journey, at night he speaks with an Aussie accent and encourages you as the more bizarre and surreal Lovecraftian horrors take hold.</p>
<p>Emerging from the bunker’s tunnels in another part of the island, you come across a bunch of red plush chairs set about the place. How charmingly odd, you might think, but you won’t for long. Mr. Bones hurries you along, cautioning you not to get too close — either way, they suddenly sprout extra legs and eyes and start chasing you, while McBrushy transforms into an actual gun to let you get blasting.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild turn, but just hints at the many more barmy twists and supernatural goings on that you’ll encounter through There Are No Ghosts at the Grand. After the music-filled announcement and the otherworldly twists that tail-ended that trailer, seeing the game in action, with the oh-so-easy to use redecorating tools, the characters and the ways that they’re brought together in inventive ways is a true delight. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand deserves its place on your wishlist for 2026.</p>

<p>There's just one thing bugging us...</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Gulikit - ES | ES PRO 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2304f4170f9b1/gulikit-es-es-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Gulikit has launched a new range of budget controllers with Switch 2 wake-up support.</p>
<p>The ES and ES PRO Wireless Controllers are out now and priced at <strong>£24.99 / $24.99</strong> and <strong>£29.99 / $29.99</strong> respectively (exchange rates working wonders there, we see). Aesthetically, both models are pretty similar and seem to be based on the overall design of the Xbox controller, with off-set concave analogue sticks, a faceted d-pad, and an almost identical shape.</p>
<p>The ES PRO comes in black or white, while the standard ES is more of a light grey colour with matching sticks and face buttons.</p>
<p>As for the specific features, the ES boasts Hall Effect sticks, while the ES PRO comes rocking 4000-level TMR anti-drift joysticks. Gyro aiming is supported along with d-pad directional adjustment, various vibration settings, and face button re-mapping.</p>
<p>The latter seems particularly important, since there's one thing about the ES and ES PRO that's bugging us. You've probably noticed it already, right..? Yes, the ABXY layout isn't suited to the Switch out of the box. They're the wrong way around! Oof, vexing... Still, the ability to re-map will likely resolve this issue, and let's face it, nobody stares down at their controller whilst playing a game. For the relatively cheap price, it's something we can probably forgive.</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab has finally revealed the answer to a question we've all been asking about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a>, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">surprise hit co-op climbing </a>collab with Landfall--is Bing Bong sentient?</p><p>The answer is yes, or at least, he used to be. The studio revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kgWKv_iQ1Vg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent video</a> that developers used to possess Bing Bong to talk to streamers, but no longer will be doing so. In a video that shows a look behind the curtain, Aggro Crab revealed that devs would talk to players through Bing Bong, but only in cases where they were publicly sharing their game.</p><p>"It was a really funny way to give creators a wild experience in the first few weeks of us releasing Peak," the video explains. Aggro Crab also clarifies that devs weren't able to join private games, and that talking Bing Bong was only really present in those first few weeks. "We removed this feature mid-June, so if you are seeing anyone claiming that the devs are joining them through Bing Bong or any other way, they're full of sh**."</p><p>Bing Bong, a lumpy green plushie, is found on the crashed plane at the start of Peak. Even though he may no longer be sentient, he has become something of a mascot for the game, and many players give up precious pack space just to cart him to the top of the mountain.</p><p>This kind of direct interaction with streamers isn't out of character for Landfall--on the studio's previous title Clustertruck, the developers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7xRFTlahU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"hacked" a version of the game</a> being run at Summer Games Done Quick, interacting with the speedrunner through messages on the screen and modifying game visuals on the fly.</p><p>Peak has been surprisingly successful for a game developed largely in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/" data-ref-id="1100-6532754">one-month game jam</a>, selling over a million copies in its first week and continuing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/" data-ref-id="1100-6533021">reach higher player peaks</a> over time.

                <p>Despite the legendary dragon Pokemon's popularity, a large number of Pokemon fans are going around pronouncing Rayquaza's name wrong--and The Pokemon Company is trying to teach us how it's actually said.</p><p>If you use the common pronunciation of ray-KWAH-zuh, you would be incorrect according to official sources. A reminder of this--and the correct pronunciation--was popped up on the big screen at the Pokemon World Championships 2025 over the weekend, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-weve-been-saying-this-pokemons-name-wrong-all-these-years" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a>. According to the "mispronounced Pokemon" graphic shared by The Pokemon Company, the correct pronunciation is ray-KWAY-zuh, sounding closer to the word quasar.</p><p>While some fans reacted with shock to the official pronunciation, others flat-out refuse to adopt it. The iconic legendary has been around for a long time, making its first appearance in 2002's Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, before becoming the mascot Pokemon for Pokemon Emerald two years later. Having been a part of the series for over two decades, it's no wonder players would refuse to change how they've been pronouncing Rayquaza all this time.</p><p>Of course, some fans on social media point out that they already use the correct pronunciation, which is used more often than not in Rayquaza's infrequent but memorable appearances in the Pokemon anime.</p><p>The next big Pokemon release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and while the game has more of a focus on Mega Evolutions as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/" data-ref-id="1100-6533977">major combat shakeup</a>, it's not clear if fan-favorite Mega Rayquaza will be making an appearance.</p>

Players can complete various quests themed after the Disney Pixar film, and build a remote Headquarters to invite Joy and Sadness to their Valley. Both characters have tasks they need help with in exchange for cute themed Friendship rewards--Joy wants to fix the Valley's mood swings, while Sadness needs help with a rainy day.</p><p>The Memory Mania Mini-Event will be returning between September 1 and 16, where players will have to track down Riley's phone when it spawns around the Valley in exchange for rewards themed after Inside Out 2.

The new guy is called Denari, and he's got the potential to be a game-changing defender thanks to his ability to lay down laser traps.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwW4zfpvE4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VuwW4zfpvE4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Denari is a Swiss military veteran who wields a Scorpion EVO 3 SMG or an FMG-9 SMG, and an optional P226 Mk 25 pistol in conjunction with his Glaive-12 shotgun sidearm. But the real attraction is his ability to use T.R.I.P. connectors to make laser grid traps that can slow down enemies or even temporarily trap them. The lasers do inflict damage, and simply powering through won't get rid of them because the devices reactive after a few seconds.</p><p>There are a few ways to counter Denari's T.R.I.P. connectors, including shooting them, melee attacks, or using explosives. Drones can also be used to dismantle the connections. However, the most effective tactic appears to an impact EMP grenade that can disable the laser field. Unfortunately, many of those options leave attackers wide open for a trap by Denari or his allies.  </p><p>Ubisoft also announced that Lair, Nighthaven Labs, and Consulate will be added to the pool of modernized maps. The Dual Front mode is also adding a safe room that will allow teams to regroup in the middle of a match to take the advantage. Some of the other balancing tweaks include the removal of magnified scopes from Doc, Rook, Frost, Echo, Castle, Tachanka, and Goyo. Sledge, Oryx, Pulse, Rook, and Ying will also be able to use the Reaper MK2 machine pistol, which was previously exclusively wielded by Rauora.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X: Operation High Stakes will begin on September 2.</p>

<figure><a title="Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e24551779a43c/silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure><p>With yet another major games showcase just around the corner, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> fans are once again hoping against hope that a release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> will be confirmed.</p>
<p>This time, however, something feels different. We're mere hours away from Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and host Geoff Keighley has posted a rather intriguing tease via <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">X</a>. It simply shows himself in what looks to be a rather fancy hotel room, looking in the mirror whilst wearing a clown nose (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>The accompanying caption reads "First time? See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL", with a clown emoji included for good measure.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tmxygk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, if you're unaware of what the heck this all means, it's essentially a blatant nod toward Silksong fans who have made it somewhat of a tradition to post clown memes and emojis during major gaming events, indicating their fruitless hope that Silksong might finally be showcased.</p>
<p>So, there are two possible outcomes here, as far as we can tell. Either Geoff is simply being a complete tool and purposefully winding up Silksong fans, or... Silksong will <em>actually</em> be shown during Gamescom ONL.</p>
<p>It seems wild to us that Keighley would go out of his way to procure a clown nose just to p*** people off, but who knows! We reckon he's fully aware of the intense backlash that would occur if that was indeed the case. So as it stands, we're leaning <em>slightly</em> toward the genuine possibility that we might finally get a release date for Silksong.</p>
<p>Or maybe the joke's on us.</p>

            <p>Review scores. Who needs 'em? Well, Valve reckon Steam didn't have enough two word verdicts on games, so they've introduced a "language-specific" scoring system, which offers separate ratings based on user reviews penned in certain tongues.</p>
<p>The goal's to paint a more detailed picture of what folks in different parts of the world think of what they've played, allowing you to see at a glance whether that game you've been putting off adding to your backlog is the bees' knees among Korean-speaking players. That's provided said game meets the threshold of having 2,000 publicly visible reviews in total and at least 200 written in the specific language you're looking for.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Steam's growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game," Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904530?utm_source=SteamDB">explained</a>. "There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the overall review scores haven't been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups."</p>
<p>"When there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," they added. "The Review Score displayed to users will be based on their primary language. What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, for the same game."</p><p>So, the usual scores you're shown when you first navigate to a game's Steam page haven't gone anywhere. To see the "language-specific" scores, which are enabled by default, you'll need to head into the game's reviews section, then sort via a new drop-down menu labelled language. Below is what doing so currently shows you for shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>

</figure>
<p>There's a reason I've picked that game too. Around the time the Illuminate faction invaded Super Earth, the game saw a spike in negative reviews specifically from Chinese players, rooted in an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">apparent translation mixup</a> specific to the version of the game in that language. The result was a bit of confusion as players in other regions struggled to work out why the game's overall rating had suddenly taken a hit. While scrolling back through recent reviews offered an idea of what had happened, in splitting up reviews like this, hopefully Valve have made it easier to tell when something like this has happened.</p>
<p>That'll probably be useful for developers, who'll be able to quickly see the change in sentiment among players speaking a certain language, and investigate whether the cause is something they can fix. On the other hand, there's the potential that in letting players see what certain regions think, we might get some hijinks or chicanery if folks decide to mess around in bad faith. For example, fomenting fresh culture wars by doing battle over which continent has the consensus, or otherwise trying to push verdicts in specfic directions just because of what other folks are doing.</p><p>People not using Steam reviews to offer straight-laced, in-depth analysis of a game's strengths and weaknesses? As someone who prior to getting into this profession left a sarky two line <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> review based entirely around disappointment that its character creator didn't boast an inch-based penis size slider, I can't imagine such a thing.</p>

<p>Kai Cenat has unveiled his Fortnite Icon Series skin and announced his next Mafiathon, both of which arrive in September.</p>



<p>Cenat used the Las Vegas sphere to show off the first look at his Fortnite skin, alongside announcing the start date of Mafiathon 3—with both landing on the same day.</p>



<p>Fortnite and Cenat had already teased the reveal of the skin, which came on the eve of the latest Fortnite update that drops August 19, and big things lie ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-kai-cenat-fortnite-skin-lands-september-12">Kai Cenat Fortnite Skin Lands September 12</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1957670133281018326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Las Vegas sphere unveiling</a> from Kai Cenat showed off the Icon Series Skin alongside what appears to be an aura emote, while his hamster, Lil Cenat, also featured—which may be a hint towards the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s leaked companion update</a>.</p>



<p>Releasing September 12, the drop of Cenat’s Fortnite skin coincides with the start date of his mega Mafiathon 3 streaming event. The previous event, held in December 2024, saw the streamer reclaim the Twitch subscriber record.</p>



<p>Mafiathon has featured a host of special guests in the past, with the next event set to be no different, and, with the start on the same date as the Fortnite skin drop, we can expect Fortnite to feature heavily.</p>



<p>Cenat is the third content creator to receive an Icon Series skin in 2025, following on from Clix and Sparx in March. Other Icon Series skins released this year include baseball star Shohei Ohtani, former Tottenham captain Son Heung-Min, and the stars of Fortnite Festival seasons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2025">Gamescom 2025</a> begins today, Tuesday August 19th, with Opening Night Live - the annual livestream showcase of trailers, teasers and release date announcements, in which helpless videogames are dragged on-stage and hacked into 90-second gobbets by Geoff Keighley. 
</p>
<p>
You can watch Gamescom Opening Night Live on this very page, care of the below video embed. The show starts at <strong>2pm EDT, 11 am PDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST</strong>, and should last around two hours, because that's approximately as long as the summoning magic can keep Geoff bound to our mortal plane. There's also a pre-show at <strong>1.30pm EDT, 10.30am PDT, 6.30pm BST, and 7.30pm CEST</strong>, but nothing noteworthy ever happens in those. Prove me wrong, host Kyle Boseman!

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance will receive DLC themed around iconic SEGA villains next year, it has been revealed, with the release date rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Set to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-release-date-revealed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, rebooting the Shinobi franchise that has lain dormant since 2011.</p>



<p>The initial release is not the end of the road, however, with plans to support the title moving forward with additional content, and the first DLC has been revealed.</p>



<h2 id="h-sega-villains-stage-to-release-early-2026">SEGA Villains Stage to Release Early 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More to come. Image via SEGA</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.sega.com/news/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-dlc-speedrun-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SEGA announced</a> the SEGA Villains Stage will be released in early 2026, featuring iconic Sonic the Hedgehog villain Dr. Eggman, with two additional villains due to be announced.</p>



<p>Although a precise release date for the DLC was not shown, more news could be on the horizon as the release date edges closer, and the news continues SEGA’s heavy crossover content.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds, another SEGA title due to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 25</a>, has already announced that characters from Minecraft, Persona, SpongeBob SquarePants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will feature.</p>



<p>SEGA’s push to revive its dormant franchises, like Shinobi, after over 14 years, could bring a new audience to the title, particularly with additional crossover content.</p>



<p>The announcement also included details of a Speedrun challenge to celebrate the upcoming launch, with players competing to set the best completion times in Shinobi 3: Return of the Ninja Master and the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> clown image has become a popular meme around every possible Silksong re-reveal, fans posting it every time they get their hopes up only for them to be dashed at lack of new info.</p>

Whether or not we get a release date alongside new gameplay, well, that might be asking for a lot, but if the game is going to release in 2025 we'd expect to be getting that info in the near future.</p>
<p>Gamescom ONL kicks off properly at 7pm BST today, with a pre-show expected beforehand.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel Rivals developer Netease has free rein to create and introduce original characters to the game, it has been confirmed.</p>



<p>Though the game already boasts a stacked roster of fan-favorite characters, alongside an almost endless list of Marvel names that could be brought into the fray, the door is open for the developers to create original characters.</p>



<p>Confirmation came via game director Guangguang, who didn’t confirm whether it was something Netease has planned, but it was clear there was a possibility—though it remains to be seen whether it could happen in the next year, a period in which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-marvel-rivals-devs-have-a-years-worth-of-characters-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters have already been prepared</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-stay-tuned-for-marvel-rivals-original-characters">‘Stay Tuned’ For Marvel Rivals Original Characters</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Original characters could be created. Image via Netease</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, Guangguang adopted his customary “stay tuned” response when asked if original characters were planned to be introduced, but confirmed Marvel has given permission for them to be created.</p>



<p>Though this might seem surprising given Marvel Rivals has over seven decades of comic book history and characters to fall back upon, it wouldn’t be the first time a new Marvel character has been introduced in a video game.</p>



<p>Luna Snow, who has become one of the most popular characters in Marvel Rivals, is the best example, having been created for Marvel Future Fight before making a comic book debut in 2019.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals has shown that it can bring lesser-known characters into the limelight to become household names, as shown by the popularity of Jeff the Land Shark, so there’s every chance an original character could make waves.</p>



<p>Another example of a successful character being introduced outside of comic books comes from DC with Harley Quinn, who is now one of the most popular characters under the DC umbrella. She was first introduced in the Batman Animated Series in the 1990s.</p>

            <p>PC gamers who are hoping Capcom updates <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> to improve performance will have to wait a little longer. A statement made on <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">X.com</a> via the official Monster Hunter account has told players that improvements are coming, but not until this winter.</p>
<blockquote><p>To our hunters playing #MHWilds on PC, we're committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game.</p>
<p>Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards.</p>
<p>We'll share more information on the specifics in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>The news comes alongside the release of <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.02.00.html">Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00</a>, which has dropped on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotfix patch Ver.1.021.02.00 details:</p>
<p>Bug Fixes and Balance Adjustments</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue that reduced the invulnerability window upon successfully performing the long sword's Iai Spirit Slash against monster attacks that have long hit detection durations.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Item Bar Display option is set to Type 1, if you select an item using the Item Bar while in Aim/Focus Mode and then release Aim/Focus Mode, the selected item would revert to an empty slot.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-trailer-leak-confirms-release-date-vault-edition-and-%E2%80%98mega-jump%E2%80%99-boost-pack.1273431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eagle-eyed users have found an ad for Black Ops 7 that seems to have aired too early, promoting the game’s pre-order availability, release date, and Vault Edition pack. In the short, fifteen-second ad, we get a first look at boost jump abilities, a mission containing hulking mech suits, and some kind of dream sequence pitting players against a human enemy several storeys tall.</p>



<p>This ad was mistakenly released mere hours before Black Ops 7 is set to be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-release-date-confirmed-in-leaked-ad">Black Ops 7 Release Date Confirmed in Leaked Ad</h2>



<p>On social media, users started circulating a screengrab of an ad for Black Ops 7. In this fifteen-second clip, we see highly vertical combat aided by ‘mega jump’ boost packs, <strong>not </strong>jetpacks. In the sequences that unfold, the player character leaps high into the air and coasts over the battlefield, which is a representation of the traversal in this year’s Call of Duty title.</p>



<p>We also see a snippet of a mission showing a fight against an enormous and heavily armed mech. In classic Black Ops style, things appear to get a little trippy as the player is forced into a battle against a Galactus-sized enemy in what looks like a dream sequence.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer (might have been removed by the time you read this):</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The screen grab is low resolution, but we get a look at the Vault Edition components, too. It looks like the skins that were previously leaked, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/">the Reznov Challenge Pack</a>, are all coming. When you pre-order, you’ll get early access to the beta, but the date for that test wasn’t revealed.</p>



<p>The release date was confirmed as November 14, which was suggested <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/">in an earlier leak</a>.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to Call of Duty: Black Ops 7? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Play like it's 1999</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nightdive has called on physical distributor Limited Run Games to help out with its latest hard copy release. This time it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a> and apart from the standard physical version, there'll also be a classic "Big Box Edition" on offer.</p>
<p>This will be available for Switch, PlayStation 5 and PC and is priced at $69.99 (or your regional equivalent), with pre-orders opening on 22nd August 2025 and closing on 21st September 2025. This package comes with the game, a booklet (for console only), soundtrack, keychain and a double-sided poster. Here's a look:</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3011afcd46c52/system-shock-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Limited Run Games, Nightdive Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The standard physical release available for Switch and PS5 will be priced at $39.99, with pre-orders opening and closing on the same date.</p>

<p>This game originally launched on Nintendo's eShop in July for $29.99 / £23.99, and we thought the remaster was the best way to play this sci-fi horror FPS. If we hear about anything else related to System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster physical release, we'll let you know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"System Shock 2's immersive mechanics will keep you hooked from start to finish, with Nightdive's enhancements and supplemental material providing ample bonus points. Now go play it, insect."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Here's the official comparison</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Bandai Namco recently confirmed it would be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO</a> to Nintendo platforms later this year, and it's now <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-details-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-frame-rate-and-resolution-official-comparison/">provided an official comparison</a> update on its Japanese website.</p>
<p>Here's how the new Unreal Engine 5 entry will supposedly perform on both the Switch and Switch 2. If we hear any developments about the game's performance and resolution for either platform between now and its November release, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, on Switch 2, the gameplay in Sparking! ZERO apparently runs at a maximum resolution of 810p (varying, depending on dynamic resolution) and is 30fps across both docked and portable modes. Additionally, this version of the game supports HDR.</p>
<p>As for the original Switch version, its gameplay will supposedly be "fixed" at 720p in docked and 480p in handheld, with both modes running at 30fps (although it's apparently "24fps in some menus").</p>
<p>The Nintendo versions of the game will also include local multiplayer and motion controls. There will be a Switch update as well for the physical and digital versions of the title, allowing users to experience an "enhanced" version on the Switch 2 console.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco has also released some comparison screenshots of the Switch and Switch 2 versions which you can see below.</p>

<p>This is the first update for August, and it's a small one compared to the previous updates, addressing some bug fixes. As usual, to continue playing online, you'll need to install this latest update.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown, courtesy of Nintendo's Japanese support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Version 1.2.1 (19th August 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where selecting "Ghost and Race" or "Watch Replay" immediately after downloading a ghost in "Time Attack" in "View Ranking" would cause a different Ghost to play than the one you downloaded.</li>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_music">Nintendo Music</a> is mostly known for regular retro soundtrack updates, but this week it's completely different, with the Japanese firm announcing we're actually getting some music from a game that's not even out yet.</p>
<p>It's songs from Masahiro Sakurai's upcoming release, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>. Of course, this links up with the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-direct-revealed-for-tomorrow-19th-august-2025">Nintendo Direct, which is airing later today</a> and will run for a <em>whopping</em> 45 minutes.</p>
<p>This "special release" also happens to be the first Nintendo Switch 2 song update for the Switch Online music app.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6pqBIEskk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>We don't know what exactly to expect from Kirby Air Riders just yet, but last week, Sakurai mentioned how he was aware fans hadn't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/we-might-be-getting-an-update-about-sakurais-new-kirby-game-soon">even seen gameplay footage yet</a>. The latest Direct announcement follows on from a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/kirby-air-riders-has-been-rated-for-switch-2">recent classification for the title</a> as well, with the game currently scheduled to launch at some point <strong>2025</strong>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creature-collecting-rogulike-morsels-from-toronto-based-indie-team-furcula-launches-this-november.1273368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Morsels, a top-down creature-collecting rougelike shooter from indie developer Furcula and publisher Annapurna Interactive, has a November 18, 2025 release date, the two companies announced today.</p>



<p>The unique and self-described "<em>oddball</em>" game was first showcased at Nintendo's Indie World Showcase in August 2024 and will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch when it arrives this coming November.</p>



<p><a href="https://furcula.ca/">Furcula</a> is a new Toronto-based indie developer, with Morsels being the studio's debut title from a three-person team made up of artist Toby Dixon, musician Sam Webster, and designer and programmer Iggy Zuk.</p>



<p>You play as a little mouse, diving into the sewers for scraps, who happens upon a magical frog-looking creature called a fatberg that transforms you into a Morsel, and grants you the power to swap between other Morsels you find along your journey, switching from one to the next to try and meet your situation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MORSELS | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fy4A0vHr6GU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I played Morsels earlier this year as part of my <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">Steam Next Fest round-up for the June 2025 Next Fest</a>, and highlighted it as my favorite of the demos I played while the festival was on. At the time, I wrote, "<em>If you don't play any other demos from Steam Next Fest in its closing weekend and only play Morsels, it will have been a Next Fest well spent. This creature-collecting rougelite is weird in all the best ways, with gameplay that feels fun to execute and a roguelite system that I can't wait to dive deeper into. I'm hopeful that this game does make its 2025 release window, only because I absolutely cannot wait to play the full game.</em>"</p>



<p>Thankfully for me, it will indeed be arriving this year, and thankfully for you, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">demo is still available to play on Steam</a> if you want to check it out ahead of release.</p>

There are four bosses and boss battles across 81 levels, with multiple secrets to discover along the way.</p><p>Allen has also shared a trailer for his next solo-dev game, Vein-Weaver Knitting.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-announces-brennan-lee-mulligan-as-campaign-4-dm-release-date-in-october" rel="nofollow">Critical Role not only announced the release date of their hotly anticipated Campaign 4</a>, October 4th, but also that Matthew Mercer would be joining the table this time around as a player and not as the GM. The role of GM would go to <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s" rel="nofollow">Brennan Lee Mulligan</a>, and Campaign 4 would be set in a completely new setting.</p>



<p>Last Thursday at the bottom of the regular Beacon and Critical Role newsletter an interesting image was included of a five by five square of letters, clicking on which would lead you to join the Beacon Discord and access the #what-do-you-seek channel.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-setting-5x5-letters.jpg?itok=Y4MBwSAS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/critical-role-campaign-4-setting-5x5-letters.jpg?itok=aDrTvph2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This led puzzle hunters down the rabbit hole to share word of this ARG, hunt for any other clues, and ultimately the answer. This puzzle was solved earlier today and led to the discovery of a secret page on the Critical Role website that contained a password field, and the password itself.</p>

<p>Travelling to <a href="https://critrole.com/unseal" rel="nofollow">https://critrole.com/unseal</a> and entering the password ARAMAN (in all capital letters) eager fans can get access to a 20 second recording of Brennan Lee Mulligan setting the scene for Campaign 4. The audio is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Within the world of Araman, there exists a growing darkness in the shadow of revolution. Seventy years ago were the Shapers cut down, those seven lords of creation that saw fit to cast their children into ruin and shadown forever..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Accompanying this audio file is the date: <strong>August 21st, 2025 10am PT</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of questions left to answer about Campaign 4 including who will be joining Matt and Brennan at the table, and what game system will be used. One or both of those might be answers on August 21st.</p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a> developer Funcom promised players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-will-receive-major-free-updates-every-three-or-four-months/1100-6532588/" data-ref-id="1100-6532588">that major updates to the game will be released every three or four months</a>. Now, Funcom has shared a broader roadmap of its plans for Dune: Awakening, including both free and paid DLC.</p><p>Funcom posted the Dune: Awakening DLC roadmap <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>, and the dev team noted it has been working to fix bugs and exploits while banning cheaters and improving the stability of the game. At GamesCom later this week, Funcom will debut new details about September's free update for Chapter 2 and the paid DLC, The Lost Harvest. These updates won't modify the endgame content of Awakening, because they were in development before the game launched.</p><p>The free updates for Chapter 3 and Chapter 4 will arrive between January and March 2026 and April and June 2026, respectively. Details about Chapter 4 are scarce, but Chapter 3 will feature a revamped endgame. In the meantime, Funcom is implementing some requested endgame changes, including improved player logging and deep desert loot, as well as a way to locate or salvage lost vehicles. Another new service will update players on the status of their bases via email.</p><p>Awakening's 2026 paid DLCs, Raiders of the Broken Lands and The Water Wars, will arrive in the first and second quarters of the year, respectively. The roadmap's info on the former notes that "The broken lands are shattered plains of broken rock, known for their fearsome raiders." The Water Wars will revolve around a conflict between the Water Shipper families over control of the polar caps of Arrakis.</p><p>Earlier this summer, Funcom refunded some players after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-after-accidentally-turning-a-pve-zone-into-pvp/1100-6533059/" data-ref-id="1100-6533059">a PvE zone was mistakenly transformed into a PvP area</a>. The developer also confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/" data-ref-id="1100-6532326">Dune: Awakening will come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> in 2026.</p>

                <p>A Fortnite Creative map caused a stir over the weekend by being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s most popular individual mode for a short period of time. Steal the Brainrot, a user-made competitive tycoon map that was ripped off from a massively popular Roblox game, managed to pull in just over 183,000 concurrent players on Sunday, making it the top mode in Epic's metaverse for a couple hours, and sparking <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a conversation</a> among players about what's going on.</p><p>Those are impressive numbers for a Creative island, though it's not <em>truly</em> accurate that it ever was the top Fortnite mode--the reality is that it peaked at number 3. At the time that Steal the Brainrot hit its top mark of 183k concurrent players, Fortnite's main Battle Royale mode had more than 300,000 people playing, split between build, Zero Build, and ranked. Likewise, Reload had about 200k players at the time spread across its variants. On Sunday, Epic even <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DNdhHZ8yOxz/?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">promoted the game on its social channels</a>.</p><p>In terms of how it stacks up against other Creative maps, Steal the Brainrot is only the third Creative island to pull at least 183k concurrent players. The top mark ever comes courtesy of the deathmatch map Super Red vs Blue, which had 235k players at once in May.</p><p>It's hard to say exactly why Steal the Brainrot blew up like it did on Sunday, but the mode has been steadily popular since it launched in early July. The Roblox version, called Steal a Brainrot, is currently Roblox's <a href="https://www.roblox.com/charts#/sortName/top-playing-now" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">third most-popular game</a>, as it regularly averages <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/109983668079237/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">more than a million players</a> at a time. Considering the <a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/3064994/roblox-stock-tanks-after-surge-of-lawsuits-and-global-bans?r=caf6fe0e0db70d936033da5461e60141" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">massive amount of legal heat Roblox is facing</a> at the moment, it could be that Fortnite is catching some players who are leaving that much more popular metaverse experience.</p>

That includes support for HyperSpeed Wireless 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections, a multi-function roller and 11 control buttons for easy access to your most-used controls, and textured doubleshot PBT keycaps that are built to be more durable than standard ABS caps. It also benefits from up to 980 hours of battery life, so you should always be ready for your next gaming session.</span></p><p>It should also come as no surprise that the keyboard is littered with RGB lights, so you can light it up with millions of different colors. Some games are integrated with Razer Chroma, allowing them to automatically change the lighting based on the in-game situation.</p><p>Razer rounds out the BlackWidow V4 Low Profile with a top-mounted steel plate for added durability, internal foam for reduced reverberation, and a low front height of just 18.5mm. So if you enjoy the slim form-factor of low-profile keyboards, this looks to combine the tiny footprint with the impressive gaming chops of the much larger V4 keyboards.</p><p>Opt for yellow switches to get a 1.2mm actuation distance requiring 40g of force, or the orange switches for a 1.6mm actuation distance requiring 45g of force.

However, it's missing the numpad, giving you a smaller footprint and freeing up space on your desk for sweeping mouse movements. You'll also lose a few control buttons (dropping from 11 to 3). It's a great option for a dedicated gaming station (or folks working with limited desktop real estate), and it doesn't hurt that you'll save $30, too.</span></p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>The Low Profile lineup joins several existing BlackWidow V4 keyboards. If the above options look enticing but you're not looking for a low-profile layout, consider exploring the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0FH7V1TRN,B0FH87T8S7,B0FH7QJ6QQ,B0FH7QYNRP,B0BV4BC7LV,B0BT3VC25K,B0D4NMMFXB,B0FCVB8QNR,B0DVDGC52L,B0CG7HQRCY,B0C8QYB8W6,B0FD5276Z6,B0CCFY349S,B0CCG2KHCB,B0DD5Q6XX9&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">many other models available in the lineup</a>.

While it's pricier than other models, that premium price tag is worth it based on our experience. The keyboard uses an aluminium chassis, doubleshot ABS keycaps, and an assortment of cool extras like features per-key RGB lighting, a magnetic plush wrist rest (also with RGB underglow lighting), and eight programmable macro keys. It's also available in three switch options, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BT3VC25K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Green</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0D4NMMFXB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Orange</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B0BV4BC7LV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yellow</a>.</p><p>If you're looking for a wireless option, there's the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable/dp/B0FD5276Z6?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlackWidow V4 TKL Wireless</a> model that's available for $180, and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BlackWidow-HyperSpeed-Wireless-Swappable-Keyboard-PC/dp/B0DD5Q6XX9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">V4 Mini Wireless</a> for $130. Both keyboards are smaller-sized models with fewer keys and streamlined layouts, making for a much more compact footprint on your desk--a nice complement to their wireless designs. The TKL option is slightly larger, while the mini is the smallest option available.</p><p>There's also the BlackWidow V4 X, a wired full-size keyboard available in multiple color options, including themed editions.

                <p>PlayStation is reportedly planning a live stream, either a State of Play or a showcase, for September.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb, who shared the information during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7KYP00kf4GM?si=4ofUddvkpykWVKG0&amp;t=1202">Game Mess Mornings</a>, PlayStation is planning on having a live stream during September. While Grubb said it will most likely be a State of Play and not a showcase, with the latter having a longer run time and more games featured, but he did not rule out a showcase as a possibility.</p><p dir="ltr">Grubb did not discuss any games he had specifically heard would be featured during the live stream, however the information came up during a discussion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jade-raymond-leaves-fairgame-studio-game-now-delayed-to-spring-2026/1100-6531583/">Fairgames</a>, one of PlayStation's in development live-service games. Grubb said he did not expect Fairgames to make an appearance during the show. Ghost of Yotei releases on October 2, so it could make an appearance during a September State of Play.</p><p dir="ltr">State of Play's typically feature both PlayStation first-party games and third-party partners, so there are tons of games that could potentially appear there. More information about already announced games, like Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> or Housemarque's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saros-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529491/">Saros</a>, the latter of which is slated for 2026, could also get some screen time. Insomniac's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-wolverine-gameplay-platforms-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516081/">Wolverine</a> could also have new information revealed, or another studio could announce an in development game.</p><p>PlayStation has had a rough track record during the PS5 generation when it comes to releasing first-party games. While its single-player output has been slow, the games have been well-received, but its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-admits-its-live-service-games-have-been-rocky-acknowledges-negative-news-about-marathon/1100-6533758/">live-service push has not gone smoothly</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sonys-live-service-game-status-report-canceled-released-shut-down/2900-6143/">Concord getting unreleased and canceled</a>, along with Marathon getting delayed indefinitely, leaving plenty of questions about the console maker's current projects.</p>

                <p>Not all games will land the same in all cultures across the world, and Steam is making a small change to review scores to reflect that. When accessing games with enough scores in your client's selected language, you'll see a separate score for that language alongside other metrics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543" data-ratio="0.22287390029326" data-width="1023" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551543"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551543-steam-review-scores.jpg"></figure><p>Valve published a news post for this change, which says that "when there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," with review scores displaying based the user's primary language.</p><p>"What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, even for the same game," the post explains.</p><p>With Steam's userbase exploding in places like China, it's not hard to see the utility of this. Things that work in games popular with one culture may not work well in another. Or a game may be written well in its developers' primary language but have a very rough translation--something that won't be relevant to the users who speak that native language.</p><p>This change will take effect for games with more than 2,000 publicly visible reviews, and at least two reviews written in at least one language. The post says Valve "purposely made these thresholds higher than the 10 reviews required to calculate the Overall Review Score" because it wanted to be "pretty confident" in the language-specific score before showing it to other users.</p><p>As shown in the screenshot above, provided by Valve, this isn't meant to take information away from users or manipulate scores. The score still shows the sentiment across all reviews alongside the reviews in your language, as well as all recent reviews, and a deeper language breakdown.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545" data-ratio="0.74222222222222" data-width="900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551545"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4551545-review-scores-2.jpg"></figure><p>The post says that Valve it knows any changes to review scores will concern users, and states the company has built a variety of features in User Reviews that can be disabled or enabled, should you want to only see the raw review information.</p>

But I was <em>all in</em> on <em>The Old Country</em> when it was announced. A new Mafia<em> </em>game set in Italy, in the early 1900s (the same fascinating period as the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, caught on the tracks between the 19th century and modernity), and best of all it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/short-smart-potentially-a-gamble-with-mafia-the-old-country-take-two-grapples-with-the-past-and-future-of-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> short</a>? Sign me up.</p><p>I wasn't sent any code for it, and I've been too busy to work on a full review of the game, so I've just been casually playing my way through it over the past couple of weeks. One thing keeping me from <em>rushing</em> were some early reviews;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eurogamer's</a> led with "by-the-numbers design", while<a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kotaku's</a> opens with "Rote, dated gameplay burdens this entry in the Mafia saga".</p><p>Which, whatever, reviews are reviews, I knew exactly what to expect from a Mafia game, and it was never going to be a revolutionary approach to third-person open-world gaming. Harking back to the first two entries in the series, with the added fact it’s trapped within the confines of a prequel, it was never going to be an innovative approach to genre story-telling either. Mafia<em> </em>(third game aside!) is a series born in tribute, an outline traced on butcher's paper over someone else's homage to <em>The Godfather</em>, and you'd be mad to go into this hoping <em>The Old Country</em> was going to be any different.</p><p>It's not even a proper open-world game! Again, like some of its predecessors, this is a fairly guided, level-by-level experience, which while featuring a world that's big and constantly asks you to drive across it, doesn't actually contain any of the trappings of a proper open-world game like exploration and sidequests. Don't think of this as a smaller <em>GTA </em>with nicer suits; think of it as a third-person shooter that just happens to replace loading screens with leisurely drives through the Sicilian countryside.</p><p>Because of my low expectations (complimentary, as we'll get to in a second!), I had a great time with <em>The Old Country</em> because all I ever want from a Mafia<em> </em>game is to kill some time with some run-of-the-mill mob stories (which are often the best kind!) and old-timey cars and work my way through an interactive soap opera interrupted by driving sections instead of commercials, which is exactly what this game delivered.</p><p>The whole thing is just so comfortably on-brand, both as a Mafia<em> </em>game and a mob tale. Its depiction of life in 1900s Sicily ticks every expected box: forbidden love, class warfare, loyalty, corruption and family tensions, with the addition of enough Catholic idolatry crammed into every room and street corner to make the Pope blush. I am not surprised by this but nor am I let down by it; <em>The Old Country</em> sets out to colour by numbers and it colours every one perfectly, right inside the lines.</p><p>I've never once enjoyed driving its lumbering cars or riding its horses, but I've craned my neck to admire the beautiful countryside every chance I've got (this is a <em>very </em>good-looking video game). I dozed off for half the story, but I remember so many snappy lines of dialogue, and everyone's handsome faces, luscious chest hair and wry smiles will live in me long after the credits roll. And a very big and special thanks to everyone who recommended I play the Sicilian dub; it's <em>transformative</em>, and helped set the mood more than any number of paintings of The Blessed Virgin Mary or overly-detailed bottles of olive oil ever could. If you haven't played the game yet, and ever do, playing in its native tongue--<a href="https://www.elalliance.org/languages/sicilian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is distinct from Italian, and extremely cool to see implemented so thoroughly in a video game</a>--is an absolute must.</p><p>The ways <em>The Old Country</em> is so predictable and yet comforting really got me thinking about all the stuff we're missing out on as the AAA games industry collapses into a flaming pile of wreckage. How I have, strangely, gotten to the point in 2025 where I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game.</p><p>As<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> studios close, projects are cancelled and developers laid off in their thousands</a>, we're losing tentpole shooters, licensed action games and multiplayer battle royales, sure, but we're also losing games like <em>this</em>. The kind you may never cosplay for, or put on your GOTY list, but which you were still happy to pay for, enjoyed your time with and left feeling better about at the end. A game that doesn't surprise you or have any tricks up its sleeve, but has enough production money and nice graphics behind it to put a smile on your face on the kind of day when you just want to play a video game, any video game, because video games are great.</p><p>So no, <em>The Old Country</em> is not a breakthrough in third-person action, or historical story-telling. It never needed to be. This is a good book on a rainy afternoon, the latest episode in a dependable, long-running soap opera, a ticket to the 117th <em>Mission Impossible</em> movie. It's fine, and sometimes fine is great.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fine-i%E2%80%99ll-admit-it-battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-open-weapon-system-is-good.1273284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When I first heard about EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to implement an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">open weapon system in the upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em></a>, I scoffed! And playing the game in Los Angeles for an event last month didn’t sell me on it, either; I still worried it would make classes feel less unique. Now, after playing the open beta for nearly 20 hours, I’m here to say: I was wrong.</p> <p>Let’s back up for a moment and explain, briefly, open and closed weapon class systems in<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"> <em>Battlefield</em>.</a> (I promise this won’t be too boring.) Basically, for nearly as long as the franchise has been around, classes were locked to certain weapons. Recon, for example, had to use a sniper rifle. Over time, developers at Dice tweaked this and added “neutral” weapons that could be picked by multiple classes, or they spread specific types of weapons across a few classes. <em>Battlefield 2042</em> threw a lot of this out the window when it launched without classes and let players essentially build custom heroes who could use any gadget or gun. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/dev-notes-classes-in-battlefield-2042">It then added classes back in when people got angry</a>. Anyway, <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to find a happy balance between <em>2042</em>‘s total, unbalanced openness and the classic closed weapon system of the past games. And I think, despite being nervous about the change and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/open-vs-closed-weapons/12440854?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ0MTg0MSwxMjQ1OTQ5MQ">all the debate raging online among players on both sides</a>, Battlefield Studios has mostly nailed it.</p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> any class can use any weapon. So you can spawn in as a recon soldier, but instead of a sniper rifle, you could bring an SMG. Engineers, traditionally a class that uses SMGs, can rock snipers and LMGs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384#:~:text=This%20is%20extremely,Lots%20of%20destruction">At first, this seemed like a bad idea to me</a>. I worried that players would just pick the class with the best abilities and pick the best assault rifle, and you’d lose all the uniqueness that comes from <em>BF’s</em> old-school class system. And in some smaller, more combat-focused modes, this is indeed the case. But in bigger, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">more <em>Battlefield</em>-y modes, like Conquest and Rush</a>, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how things have worked out.</p>

 <p>In my hours with the beta, I found that in many matches players were spread all around the four classes. In some past games (looking at you, <em>Battlefield 3</em>),&nbsp;people would pick whatever class had the best assault rifle, and that was that. During a Q&amp;A with the devs last month in LA, they talked about this and said that the open weapon system was partly designed to combat this. The idea is that now people will pick classes based on what the team needs and their unique abilities and tools, rather than the weapons they can and can’t use.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s exactly what I saw happening in many <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta matches. If the enemy team, for example, brought in a bunch of vehicles or tanks, I’d see players swap to engineers to use that class’s RPG to take all those machines out. Likewise, I saw players and friends swap to the support class to help hold a point and revive people, or swap to recon to help pin down a target. It seems now that weapons can be freely equipped on any class, people are far more open to playing different classes and helping out the team. Sure, maybe some of these players have just equipped the same assault rifle on all of the classes, but if it helps my team stop a tank from destroying us, I’m fine with it. That’s a much better scenario than in past <em>BF</em> games, where a whole team might be assault soldiers and you’d be unable to get ammo resupplies or fight back against helis.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> also rewards players for choosing a weapon that is more aligned with their class. Recon soldiers get a ton of exclusive sniper perks that make it almost silly to use a sniper rifle on any other class. But you can do it, if that makes you happy. And this is where I’d suggest some tweaks.</p>

 <p>I think rewarding players who pick class-specific weapons is a smart idea, but I almost feel like the devs could do more to make sure picking an assault rifle on every class isn’t an easy option. Perhaps class-specific weapon punishments could work? An assault class soldier picking a sniper rifle might mean they don’t get the recon benefits, and perhaps they also reload the big rifles more slowly. Or an engineer picking an assault rifle has more kick and can’t carry as much ammo for it. These tweaks would reward people playing classes more traditionally, could be overcome with skill or teamwork, and would still allow for the weapon freedom the devs want in <em>BF6</em>.</p> <p>But even if <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs don’t steal my totally-awesome-and-perfect idea, I think the open weapon system is a good change. It lets players enjoy all the classes without forcing them to play with specific guns. This leads to matches in which all the classes are used, and that leads to more enjoyable <em>Battlefield</em> action. And that’s what I’m looking for. Sure, maybe it means that I’ll be killed a lot by a few popular assault rifles, but it might also mean that there will be more medics running around who can heal me. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">That would be nice</a>. And don’t worry; if you hate the open weapon system, EA is going to offer playlists and modes that feature locked weapons, too. Everyone wins.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That would have been a sticky situation.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, rumors started swirling in some Magic: The Gathering circles that the upcoming Spider-Man set would be limited to just one print run across all of its products, including Play Boosters – but today, Wizards of the Coast unequivocally told IGN that is not the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked for comment on these claims, a WOTC representative told IGN “there is no truth to any rumors about SPM Play Boosters being a single print run,” with SPM being the set code for the Spider-Man crossover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s not uncommon for products like the more expensive Collector Boosters (which include special art and foil treatments) to be limited to a single printing, the rumors around Spider-Man set off alarm bells because of the inclusion of Play Boosters specifically (they're still available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgpy4?object_uuid=f3aa8b41-4030-47d9-a9a4-668076d0448a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder at Amazon</a>). Play Boosters are the basic, bread-and-butter booster packs of nearly every set, and are typically printed as needed to meet demand for sets that are legal in Magic’s Standard format, which Spider-Man is. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel's Spider-Man x Magic: The Gathering - First Card and Packaging Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If those packs were more limited than usual, it could have wreaked havoc on the supply of cards that are meant to be broadly accessible and empowered scalpers to jack up prices. For instance, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-final-fantasy-expansion-made-200-million-in-just-one-day"><u>WOTC CEO Chris Cox said</u></a> they “couldn’t produce enough” of the recent Final Fantasy set, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-most-expensive-cards-2025"><u>prices soared</u></a> as a result – and that was in spite of the fact that they increased the set’s pre-release production four times, Cox explained.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While false, one reason this rumor might have taken hold is because it wouldn’t have been the only atypical part of this release. WOTC <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/through-the-omenpaths-and-digital-universes-beyond-updates" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>previously announced</u></a> that the entire Spider-Man set will be reskinned with in-universe art and concepts for its digital release on both MTG Arena and Magic: The Gathering Online, which is a first for a Standard set. This isn’t the first time one of Magic’s Universes Beyond crossovers hasn’t been made available digitally, but those have generally been Commander products like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doctor-who-magic-the-gathering-commander-spoilers-reveals-dont-blink-weeping-angels"><u>Doctor Who</u></a>, whereas a Standard set has the potential to impact a wide variety of competitive formats.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“There is no truth to any rumors about SPM Play Boosters being a single print run.” - Wizards of the Coast</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While it’s reassuring to hear there is no limitation to a single print run in place, WOTC did not say what the supply of the Spider-Man set will look like overall, nor did it comment on part of the rumor claiming the limitations were due to the licensing agreement with Disney that allows them to use Marvel properties in the first place – although, that’s not exactly surprising given it is broadly refuting those rumors as a whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-card-reveal-spoiler-spider-verse"><u>Reveals for the Spider-Man set</u></a> started rolling out at San Diego Comic-Con late last month, with another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-magic-the-gathering-beginner-box-card-reveal-spoilers"><u>set built around Avatar: The Last Airbender</u></a> (which will be available digitally) hot on its heels. The Spider-Man set’s proper debut is scheduled for August 29, with a paper release the following month on September 26.</p><div catalogid="34de4cbf-b285-4ebc-9732-58541a51e336" id="226802"><div id="226802" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Play Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Marks is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.
