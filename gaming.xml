			<p>A new company comprised of members from Annapurna is set to take over games and franchises that were previously owned by Private Division, a<a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-sells-private-division-gta-vi-on-track-for-release/"> studio owned by Take-Two Interactive</a>. The staff that are creating the team are those who resigned last summer after it was said that there was a significant power struggle that led to the staff resigning. Now, they are taking over the portfolio that belonged to Private Division.</p>
<p>At the moment, the company that will be inheriting the Private Division franchises doesn't yet have a name, but it will gain access to the games and franchises created by Private Division.</p>
<p>The first information came from Take-Two Interactive in November 2024, where they announced that they had sold Private Division to an unnamed buyer for an undisclosed price. In the report <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division?leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Bloomberg</a>, it seems that private equity firm Haveli Investments was the "unnamed buyer" of the company, with Haveli then going on to make a deal with the Annapurna staff, which gave them the power to take care of the acquired franchises.&nbsp; According to the Bloomberg report, a spokesperson for Haveli was contacted, but they stated that "the firm did not immediately have comment."</p>
<p>Private Division was responsible for creating franchises and games such as Kerbal Space Program, Tales of the Shire, No Rest for the Wicked, and the untitled action-adventure game made in collaboration with Game Freak, which is currently codenamed Project Bloom. No Rest for the Wicked has been confirmed to continue getting support and updates, despite the uncertainty of Private Division at current. Tales of the Shire is the next game to be released, with it set to release on March 25. This game is highly anticipated by many, as it combines the farming game genre with The Lord of the Rings franchise for a cozy experience.</p>
<p>As Haveli acquired the company, they also inherited approximately 20 employees who were working at Private Division. Unfortunately, some of the staff that they've inherited will be laid off as the company gets settled and rearranged. The specifics of this arrangement have not been finalized, and staff have been told to explore their options regarding employment and instability in the company.</p>
<p>Private Division was founded in 2017 as a publisher of mid-sized indie titles. They've published games such as The Outer Worlds, Hades, and Rollerdrome.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-got-to-learn-about-smite-2s-new-gods-and-new-modes-ahead-of-jan-7ths-beta-release.1076334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a minute since we last caught up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/smite-2-preview-next-generation-of-moba" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite 2</em></a>. Announced a year ago, the MOBA sequel has seen its alpha test take flight during 2024 and is now nearing a beta period along with a wealth of new information. We had the chance to sit in on a presentation with all the details on what’s to come during Smite 2’s beta, including the scoop on a massive update.</p>

<p><em>Smite 2</em> is being primed to add five new gods as one of the biggest pieces of this update – including Aladdin, Geb, Ullr, Agni, and Mulan, along with three new modes including Joust, Duel, and Assault (which were popular modes in the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-celebrates-hitting-20-million-players-milestone" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite</em></a>). The team at Titan Forge will also be overhauling the core of Conquest mode, and adding 20 new aspects, which are game-changing play style twists for 20 gods.</p>

<p>There will also be several new items, performance optimizations, text chat, and more.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Smite 2</em>’s alpha test began eight months ago with only 14 gods available, with one mode, rough performance, and many systems lacking in depth. Since then, the development team has worked together with the community to improve the game by adding 45 gods, six modes, which lead to increased reviews and additional player feedback.</p>


<h2>How <em>Smite 2</em> Evolves The Original's Formula</h2>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Smite 2</em>, the core starting goals shared by the team include capturing the magic of the original <em>Smite</em> and its third-person MOBA formula. They also include making targeted improvements to refine a decade-old game for a new generation of gamers, and to respect and honor the community in the process.</p>

<p>In honoring the community, that meant having to over-deliver following the alpha testing weekends. What that means is that fixes were being shipped frequently to keep progress flowing, and focusing on favorite gods to add into <em>Smite 2</em>.</p>

<p>This also included three weekly live streams dedicated to covering player questions and providing a look behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This has culminated in several milestones for <em>Smite 2</em>. The game has 45 gods, increased from the original 14, six modes instead of one, a complete art overhaul, core combat improvements and FX readability improvements, a new HUD, a new conquest map layout, big changes to monetization, collaborations such as Lord of the Rings, and much more.</p>

<p>As <em>Smite 2</em> moves into its beta phase, there’s a lot to cover in terms of what is next. One of the biggest additions will be with the new god, Aladdin, who will arrive on January 14 as part of the new pantheon Tales of Arabia.</p>

<p>Aladdin, The Sultan, is a Magical Assassin who can use the ability Three Wishes – each with powerful effects but can only be used once for came. These include coming back to life instantly, earn bonus Gold, or resetting all cooldowns. Aladdin can also run on walls, which is a new piece of tech for Smite 2. His Ultimate can trap enemies in his magic lamp to fight them, and anyone can join, which allows Aladdin to split up a fight in his own unique way.</p>

For example, Ullr’s stance swapping is further enhanced, while Mulan can plant a Consumable banner that increases XP and grants allies Movement Speed.</p>

<p>New modes will be available including Joust, which is a 3v3 match including one lane and jungle camps. Teleporters have been added for easier traversal, and stealth grass for surprise engagements. The same map is available for the new 1v1 Duel mode.</p>

<p>The Conquest mode is also being updated, which is the premiere mode for <em>Smite</em>’s esports scene. There’s some layout changes (different pathing), new jungle camps, new vision-focused camps, new jungle boss pickups like the Obsidian Dagger (which deals 500 true damage to the user but grants 20% more damage and attack speed for six seconds) from the Fire Giant, and breakables like Healing Wisps in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Aspects mode will offer a new playable twist for gods in <em>Smite 2</em>. In the lobby, players will be able to play the god normally or Aspect enabled. With 20 of the 45 available gods enabled, more will be added over time. An example of this mode is with Athena, who can no longer teleport to allies, but instead to enemies and weaken them. So those types of trade-offs are in play.</p>

There’s also updates to auto builds, role guides for all roles, role filters in the item shop, UI features like PC text chat, balance passes to improve STR and Active items, ranked reset and matchmaking improvements, as well as performance optimizations and more.</p>

<p>As for when players will be able to get their hands on <em>Smite 2</em>’s beta – starting January 7 most of the content described in this article (aside from Aladdin on January 14) will be available, alongside a developer live stream, which will also discuss everything further detail and how 2025 will certainly be a major year for the game and its evolving community.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> features a rejig of the series' usual controls due to the addition of being able to go prone.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/news/4TA6gKaTvtOC1mOjZIxCZd">blog</a> published today that goes into detail on Shadows' parkour system, developer Ubisoft noted that the Assassin's Creed franchise's typical crouch and dodge buttons have been swapped. 
</p>
<p>
This change is due to the mapping of the prone ability to the same button as crouch, which now sits on the X button on a standard Xbox controller. Tapping X now makes your character crouch, while holding X will make you go prone. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to dodge, roll, and drop down while parkouring is now mapped to the B button instead.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows, dodge has been merged with parkour down mechanics, which unlocks a whole bunch of new parkour moves," Shadows' associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois said. 
</p>
<p>
"This new mapping also disconnects stance-switch (eg. standing, crouching, prone) from parkour, ensuring you can use any stances without accidentally going down a rooftop when you don't want to."
</p>
<p>
Many traditional Assassin's Creed parkour moves return as expected, including the ability to perform a recovery roll to reduce impact and noise when landing from height. 
</p>
<p>
The ability to climb down has been augmented by another, flashier, option to perform a directional dodge over a ledge, meanwhile:

<p>
If you're high enough to take fall damage, an additional prompt when parkouring downwards will be required. Of course, the franchise's handy hay bales are still present to cushion your fall in certain spots.

<p>
Finally, here's a look at Shadows protagonist Naoe demonstrating the new prone position. You can, of course, assassinate enemies while prone. Thus:

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTuL0Ob2EnU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
One other big change within Shadows is that only some surfaces will be climbable. This is a change to how various recent Assassin's Creed entries have let you scamper all over cliffs and up sheer rock faces, influenced in part by the Shadows' addition of a grappling hook. In short, it means you'll need to look more carefully for surfaces that have physical handholds.
</p><p>
"This is a pretty big deal for us," Lemay-Comtois says. "This means we had to be more thoughtful about creating interesting parkour highways and afforded us more control about where Naoe can go, and where Yasuke can't, making our two playstyles even more contrasted."
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will finally arrive on 14th February after last year's high-profile delay. We recently learnt that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-naoe-has-her-own-speedy-naruto-run">Naoe has a "Naruto run"</a> and that the game will have a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">"canon" story option for players who don't like making narrative choices</a>.

Former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> staff - who departed the acclaimed video game publisher last September as part of a "mass exodus" - have reportedly established a new company and will be taking over indie label Private Division's portfolio, which was sold by Take-Two last year.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna's entire video game division - responsible for publishing the celebrated likes of Cocoon, Outer Wilds, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sayonara-wild-hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">departed the company late last year</a>, reportedly following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison. At the time, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurnas-mass-exodus-of-staff-a-baffler-says-company-spokesperson">suggestion</a> all 25 former employees might reunite under a new name, Verset, which was originally intended to be an Annapurna Interactive spin-off before negotiations broke down.

And now, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">reports</a> former Annapurna Interactive staff are indeed working together again, as part of a still-unnamed new company, which is said to have inherited the games and franchises of Private Division - the indie-focused label behind the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">sold by Grand Theft Auto publisher Take-Two Interactive</a> in November.
</p>
<p>
At the time, Take-Two said it had made the decision to sell the label so it could focus its resources on "growing our core and mobile businesses for the long-term", and that the unnamed buyer had purchased the rights to "substantially all" of Private Division's live and unreleased titles - with the exception of Moon Studios' No Rest for the Wicked.
</p><p>
According to Bloomberg's latest report - which cites "people familiar" with the matter - Private Division's buyer was Texas-based private equity firm Haveli Investments. Haveli reportedly then struck a deal with ex-Annapurna employees to fund their new company and place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles. These are include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series, upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-studio-game-freak-creating-new-action-adventure-ip-with-private-division">Pokémon developer Game Freak's new action-adventure IP</a>.
</p>
<p>
Bloomberg adds the new arrangement will likely result in a number of layoffs among the approximately 20 Private Division employees Haveli inherited as part of its purchase,  although specifics are reportedly still to be finalised.
</p>
<p>
As for what remains of Annapurna Interactive, the publisher previously said it was hiring to fill vacancies left following last year's mass exodus, and that it was "focused on moving forward". Annapurna's future projects - which all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">appear to be unaffected</a> despite last September's events - include the likes of Mixtape from Beethoven and Dinosaur, Wanderstop from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a> creator Davey Wreden, and No Code's Silent Hill: Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Annapurna Interactive's first in-house title, Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, seemingly faces more significant challenges, however. Game director Chelsea Hash and all other full-time members of the development team reportedly left amid last year's departures, but the company said work would continue despite these setbacks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady Studios was apparently hit by yet more layoffs at the close of last year, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which cites "half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies", several Rocksteady staff lost their jobs at the end of 2024, although the report doesn't state exactly how many employees were let go.</p>

<p>According to the report, Rocksteady's "programming and artist teams" were affected by the layoffs, and yet more QA staff also lost their jobs after a round of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow">hit that very same department back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=izD__q8B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-2024-harley-quinn.jpg?itok=T-w-2p5E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady has been hit by yet more layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Eurogamer says it contacted Warner Bros. for a response but didn't receive one, which probably shouldn't come as a surprise; neither this round of layoffs nor the previous round in September were officially announced by the company.</p>

<p>Sadly, these layoffs also probably shouldn't be a shock, sad as they are. Back in December, Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">announced that it would end content updates</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>&nbsp;following the game's fourth season and that it would implement the offline mode it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-offline" rel="nofollow">promised in December 2023</a>.</p>

<p>That news came after Warner Bros. declared&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">to be a financial disappointment</a> in February last year, with the game representing an embarrassing $200 million loss for the company's gaming division. There's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">only so much&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>can do</a> to offset a loss like that.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut-report" rel="nofollow">a report in June</a>, Rocksteady employees are helping to develop a Director's Cut version of that very same wizarding RPG, although no such project has been officially announced by Warner Bros (are you sensing a theme emerging here?).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=aJMqi2vz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-wand.jpg?itok=a_uyAz-j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is reportedly working on a Director's Cut for&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>That same report also claimed that Rocksteady is preparing to pitch a single-player game that would be closer to its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>roots than the live-service experiment of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't clear whether these recent layoffs will affect the studio's ability to successfully make that pitch, but I can't imagine it's easy being at Rocksteady right now. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Rocksteady has been hit by another round of layoffs. As support for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes to an end</a> with the final season, the studio has seen a number of employees let go across various departments.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> was the first to report on the layoffs after “half a dozen staff” who were part of the layoffs confirmed to the outlet that they took place. According to the report, employees in QA, programming, and art have been let go.</p>



<p>An exact number impacted or when the layoffs actually happened is currently unknown. Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games and Rocksteady for comment on the layoffs. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>







<p>The latest layoffs mark the second in a handful of months as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">QA team saw staff reduced</a> by over 50% in September. Last May, during the company’s Q1 FY2025 earnings call, Warner Bros. revealed that Suicide Squad <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-cost-warner-bros-200-million-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost the company $200 million</a> in revenue due after a “disappointing” release. During its last earnings call, the company said that, moving forward, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’ll put more of a focus</a> on “strong” game franchises like Batman, Mortal Kombat, and Hogwarts Legacy.</p>

            <p>A new report from People Make Games has detailed disturbing allegations of abuse towards employees at Indonesian studio Brandoville, a company used for art and animation support in games such as Age of Empires 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>In 2021, People Make Games <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm7KUE1Kwts">reported on crunch culture and the industry's reliance on outsourcing</a> to external developers in order to meet deadlines. Brandoville Studios was one such developer. Little has changed in the industry since that report, but Brandoville's closure a few months ago has lead its employees to now share further stories of their experiences at the studio.</p>
<p>At the centre of this report is Christa Sydney, who worked at the company from 2019 until 2024 and says she was subjected to mental and physical abuse by commissioner Kwan Cherry Lai, wife of Brandoville CEO Ken Lai, who ran day-to-day operations.</p>
<p>The full report can be watched in the below video, though please note it contains some incredibly harrowing content and footage.</p>

<p>Sydney describes how Cherry Lai took her under her wing following a dispute early in her career, but how this led to toxic abuse. Initially, Lai imposed a strict working schedule on employees and would purposefully divide employees through gossip and demeaning words, Sydney said.</p>
<p>Sydney was actually part of People Make Games' previous report, but says she was later forced by Lai to film a statement in support of Brandoville against her will. Other employees felt she was being brainwashed, it's reported.</p>
<p>Sydney now says she was then continuously abused by Lai, including during a work trip to the XDS '22 conference where Lai micromanaged her time and only allowed her to sleep for a few minutes over the course of four days leading up to the event. Further abuse included imposing daily Christian worship, forcing Sydney to write lines like a schoolchild, daily check-ins over WhatsApp of her outfits as part of "quality control", and humiliating her in front of colleagues.</p>
<p>Eventually Lai's abuse became physical, forcing Sydney to film herself slapping her face 100 times as punishment, or hitting her head against a door frame until she was concussed before forcing an apology.</p>
<p>Another employee, Caesarion Balthazar, had an arrangement with Lai where she would take part of his salary to assist with his spending habits. This led to her, in Balthazar's words, stealing an amount of money equivalent to a month's salary. Additionally, Balthazar says he was told he owed money for expensive training programmes he hadn't yet taken when he tried to leave the company.</p><p>A third employee, Syifana Afiati, also says she was abused by Lai during her time at Brandoville from 2019 to 2024. Afiati fell pregnant, but was repeatedly overworked by Lai. At one point during the pregnancy Afiati says she was taken to hospital due to an issue, but was still asked to come into the office and work - to which she declined. Afiati's son was born two months prematurely and sadly died four months later in intensive care, however Lai still expected her to work and provided no sympathy or support from the company.</p>
<p>In August 2024, Brandoville Studios went into liquidation, though Cherry and Ken Lai convinced a handful of employees to stay and begin a new company: LaiLai Studios. Sydney was one such employee, but says she was subsequently subjected to direct physical violence from Cherry Lai on multiple occasions.</p>
<p>Sydney eventually escaped and compiled evidence against Lai. Media reports in Indonesia went viral, which finally lead to police investigations. This was required due to the local phrase "no viral, no justice", stemming from mistrust in the police and justice system.</p>
<p>In response to the allegations, Cherry Lai issued a statement to People Make Games, bizarrely stating: "To me my part of the story is not important, as long as my team are good and safe now." However, further discussion was declined.</p><p>Other employees claimed Ken Lai was Cherry's "biggest enabler" and should've done more to stop this abuse. Sydney and others however say they believe Ken is yet another victim of Cherry's abuse and his silence comes from a place of fear.</p>
<p>The report concludes by noting how the treatment of outsourced workers goes largely unnoticed and unremarked upon by the video games industry due to its discomfort discussing outsourced work, despite it being a crucial part of game development. Eurogamer has contacted Microsoft and Ubisoft for comment on their connections to Brandoville.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-annapurna-staff-private-division-ips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that an as-yet unnamed company comprising former Annapurna Interactive employees is set to take over publishing duties for franchises that would have been overseen by ex-Take-Two indie label Private Division.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, ex-Annapurna Interactive staffers have formed a new company following their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail" rel="nofollow">abrupt resignation in September</a>, which resulted from the failure of talks to spin the division off into its own entity.</p>

<p>The new company will, according to Schreier, "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division", which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale" rel="nofollow">sold off by former parent company Take-Two in November</a> to an unknown buyer. The report, citing "people familiar with the deal", names that buyer as the Texas-based Haveli Investments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=erjunmst 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-private-division-annapurna.jpg?itok=Je0mFceJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division's games and franchises include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Supposedly, Haveli will fund the new company and "place them in charge of distributing the former Private Division titles", which will include the likes of cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2" rel="nofollow">beleaguered</a> space sandbox&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program</em>.</p>

<p>According to Schreier, "an unannounced title" by&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>developer Game Freak will also be included in the deal. That game is almost certainly the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/private-division-pokemon-developer-game-freak-reveal-new-action-adventure-ip-project" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed&nbsp;<em>Project Bloom</em></a>, which doesn't have an official name yet, so hopefully we'll get to see a new reveal for it soon.</p>

<p>Schreier's report says that some of Private Division's 20 employees "will be laid off as part of the new arrangement", although we don't yet know which employees or in what departments those layoffs will be focused.</p>

<p>The writing was arguably on the wall for Private Division as early as April last year, when Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> and scrapped a number of projects. Following that, Private Division and Bloober Team <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership" rel="nofollow">ended</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-teams-up-with-private-division-for-new-horror-game" rel="nofollow">previously-announced partnership</a> for a new horror IP in May.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Chinese publisher Tencent are the biggest video game company in the world. Their wholly owned subsidiaries including League Of Legends developers Riot Games, Path Of Exile developers Grinding Gear Games, and UK outfit Sumo Group. They own shares in everything from Epic Games through Ubisoft to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> rebooters Bloober Team. Are you a game developer? Odds are that at least one percent of your body belongs to Tencent. Maybe one of your toes.</p>
<p>And now it turns out that Tencent are some kind of military operator, as well. Or at least, that's what the US Department of Defence would have us believe: they've just somewhat randomly added the firm to an infamous list of Chinese military companies, together with lithium-ion battery maker CATL. This potentially makes it difficult for Tencent to do business in the States, but Tencent say that it's all based on a "misunderstanding".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-06/us-adds-tencent-to-chinese-military-blacklist-shares-decline">Bloomberg</a>, the US DoD's list of Chinese military companies dates back to an executive order given by recently re-elected president Donald Trump in 2020, which sought to prevent US companies from investing in entities with ties to the Chinese military.</p>
<p>Formally known as <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/07/2025-00070/notice-of-availability-of-designation-of-chinese-military-companies">Section 1260H</a>, the list is updated annually and currently runs to 134 companies, including phone manufacturer Huawei. Being on there doesn't mean the companies in question are immediately banned from doing business with the USA, but it puts pressure on the US Treasury Department to sanction them. This might scare away investors: the BBC <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9q78wn9g8zo">reports</a> that Tencent has already seen a share price fall in Hong Kong as of today, Tuesday 7th January.</p><p>Tencent, naturally, say the whole thing is an error, and that the designation will have no material effect on their activities. "We are not a military company or supplier," Tencent spokesperson Danny Marti commented to the BBC. "Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business. We will nonetheless work with the Department of Defense to address any misunderstanding."</p>
<p>I'm no scholar of superpower geopolitics, but my understanding is that all this forms part of US efforts to contain China both economically, and in terms of the military applications and connections of Chinese tech companies and research organisations. Here's <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/article/3180636/dod-releases-list-of-peoples-republic-of-china-prc-military-companies-in-accord/">a US Department of Defence press release from 2022</a> which spells out the thinking. An excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>"The Department is determined to highlight and counter the PRC Military-Civil Fusion strategy, which supports the modernization goals of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) by ensuring its access to advanced technologies and expertise are acquired and developed by PRC companies, universities, and research programs that appear to be civilian entities. Section 1260H directs the Department to begin identifying, among other things, Military-Civil Fusion contributors operating directly or indirectly in the United States."</blockquote>
<p>Given the sheer scale of Tencent's operations - they also work in generative AI and cloud computing and own WeChat, one of the largest social media networks - it seems probable that they have military connections somewhere. But then again, so do many large US tech companies, like Activision-Blizzard and Microsoft. Many are the links between the tech biz and the world's armed forces.</p><p>All this comes amid news that Tencent are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">considering a buyout of Ubisoft with the aid of the founding Guillemot family</a>. It also follows the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-epic-games-directors-step-down-after-us-department-of-justice-investigate-games-companies-under-antitrust-laws">resignation of two Tencent-appointed Epic Games directors</a>, in response to a US Department of Justice investigation into potential antitrust violations.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We're back! Slowly. Surely. Truly, there was no better way to kick off 2025 than to message Rob on a sleepy Monday morning and ask "hey, do you want to record a podcast?" Which, naturally, turned into a discussion of Sports! or HOA, which, naturally, ended with us going "why not both?" You'll hear the trials and tribulations of contract work next week. (I have since mostly built out my new office, and while I touch on that in this episode, we'll mostly unpack in the next HOA, where we'll probably do some questions, too.) I hope your holiday was restful. Mine was mostly not? The holidays fell on weird times, which means my plan in previous years to have my kids stay at cdaycare a few times blew up in my face. They were fine...mostly. The whiskey helped.</p><p>-pk, who watched the sappy Zemeckis film <em>Here</em> over the holidays, and while he would not argue it was good, he did cry many, many times</p><p>P.S.

Minisode</em> – The Bears beat the Packers for the first time in [DELETED], which prompted us to talk a bit about where our terrible team stands as the playoffs begin to unfold.

But we'll record an episode before then.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Return of Infinity Nikki </em>– Look, I had more fun with this one that I'm willing to admit, and when the stream was ending, my thought was "you know, if we have a sleepy January, maybe I need to return to this one."</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>K.L.E.P.E.K.S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em> – I'm turning my homework from Rob into content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-ditches-episodes-for-yearly-season-model/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ahead of VALORANT’s fifth year anniversary, the live-service tactical FPS from Riot Games is pivoting its model away from its regular episode release calendar. Instead, VALORANT will utilize year-long seasons, each consisting of six two-month long acts.</p>



<p>VALORANT studio lead Anna Donlon recently <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1876644967466090569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered this change</a> ahead of what is set to be the first season under this new model: Season 2025, or V25 for short. During this season, players are hoping to finally get some of the features they’ve been waiting years for.</p>



<hr>



<p>The switch from episodes to calendar year seasons was spurred by a need to re-adjust the VALORANT content release schedule, says Donlon. With Riot also running a yearly schedule for the VALORANT Champions Tour, the game’s growing esports ecosystem, switching to a “perfectly curated season of VALORANT” affords the team more space and flexibility to plan out both game and esports projects.</p>



<p>Many of the in-game projects that players have been waiting for might (at last) be coming sooner than later. Donlon explained that “most of the [dev team] expansion work” is behind them, meaning the developers can work on some highly anticipated features. This includes the replay system, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-sunset-map-changes-in-valorant-patch-9-08/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworked map rotations</a>, ranked rollbacks (rating refunds), improved matchmaking, and less toxicity.</p>



<p>This first update of 2025 is setting the stage for a slew of updates to come:</p>



<ul>
<li>A dev update on upcoming gameplay changes and fixes is coming “in the next few days.”</li>



<li>An update on VALORANT mobile is coming some time in “the future.”</li>



<li>Head of VALORANT Esports, Leo Faria, will have more to share on VCT “in the next couple of days.”</li>
</ul>



<p>While Faria is expected to share more on the matter, Donlon did note that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan engagement</a> has prompted Riot to “continue investing heavily into VALORANT esports.”</p>

<p>A new company is set to take over the games and franchises that once belonged to former Take-Two Interactive-owned studio Private Division. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, former staff of Annapurna Interactive have formed a new company that will take over the franchises of Private Division.</p>



<p>The name of the new company is currently unknown.</p>



<p>The report states that private equity firm Haveli Investments out of Austin, Texas was the “unnamed buyer” of Private Division late last year. It continues to say that after the deal was closed, Haveli made a deal with the ex-Annapurna staff to place them in charge of the acquired franchises. Those games include Tales of the Shire, Kerbal Space Program, and the in development game from Pokemon developer Game Freak.</p>







<p>As part of this new deal, employees who were a part of Private Division when the deal was made will be laid off. It’s unclear how many of the approximately 20 employees will be let go.</p>



<p>“The current leadership of Private Division has told employees to explore their options due to the uncertainty surrounding their jobs,” the report reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of the changes happening at Private Division with this new company led by former Annapurna staff?

            <p>There’s a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a> on the way, and while it’s ditching the signature detachable controllers, it’s still got something unusual to stick on its CV. The Lenovo Legion Go S is a smaller, cheaper take on Lenovo’s portable gaming PC, and it’s on track to become the first officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steamos">SteamOS</a> handheld outside of Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> range.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First off: <em>finally</em>. Windows 11 is the obvious choice for non-Valve manufacturers to base their dinky rigs around, but it’s proven <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">time</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">time</a> again that its lack of natural affinity for small screens and thumbstick controls isn’t entirely made up for by its native games compatibility. SteamOS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-have-killed-apex-legends-steam-deck-support-in-the-name-of-anti-cheat">might not be supported everywhere</a> but UX-wise, it is a far better match for handhelds, while still offering <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-enable-desktop-mode-on-the-steam-deck">Desktop Mode</a> for more Windows-like flexibility. Its spread across third-party machines can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Legion Go S! It’s simplified and shrunk down considerably from the original Legion Go, adopting a more traditionaol fixed chassis, dropping the weight from 854g to 730g, and downsizing the display to an 8in, 1200p, 120Hz IPS panel. Fine by me – the Legion Go’s 1600p, nearly 9in screen was nice to look at but often too much for its own processor to handle. Speaking of, the Legion Go S will be powered by your choice of either the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme that the Legion Go had, or AMD's brand-new Ryzen Z2 Go. No word on how the latter will perform, though it's probably not as quick as the Z1 Extreme, as that one will send the Legion Go S's price up to $729 whereas the Ryzen 2 Go version will be just $599.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Speaking of choice, there'll also be a Windows 11 edition of the Legion Go S, perfect for those who rolled their eyes disapprovingly through that second paragraph. That will go on sale this January, several months ahead of the SteamOS version’s May release.</p><p>Either way, the Legion Go S will come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/should-you-bother-with-hall-effect-keyboards">Hall Effect</a> joysticks, a teensy lil’ trackpad on the right (which looks more like a navigation aid than the Deck’s big, gaming-ready haptic pads), and a 55Whr battery, which is 5WHr up on the original Legion Go. Between that and the lower-specced display, hopefully that will translate into lengthier battery life, another weakness of the bigger brother.</p>
<p>Hardware is rarely improved by removing its more unique and interesting features, but in the Legion Go S’s case, I do reckon it could get away with trading away those Switch-style controllers. SteamOS will just naturally make it a more comfortable handheld to use, and in offering 1TB of storage for $599, it even manages to undercut the $649 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> on its usual price advantage. It’ll still need to make a case for itself on performance and battery life, but it’s definitely an interesting prospect. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-enjoyed-the-lenovo-legion-go-right-up-to-the-moment-i-broke-it">Hope I don’t break it</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-devs-reveal-what-to-expect-from-season-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will begin on January 10, 2025, and the devs, Netease, have just revealed what content we can expect from the upcoming season, including new heroes, maps, game modes, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-marvel-rivals-season-1">What to Expect from Marvel Rivals Season 1</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will see the arrival of four new playable characters, the Fantastic Four. Three new maps will also be introduced: Empire of Eternal Night: Sanctum Sanctorum, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown, and Empire of Eternal Night: Central Park. Season 1 will include double the playable content of a regular season and will bring the total number of heroes in the roster to 37 by the end of it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The duration of Season 1 has been set at three months, and it will be divided into two halves of six to seven weeks each. The first half will see the arrival of two of the four playable characters, Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman. Additionally, Empire of Eternal Night: Midtown will be added as a new convoy map during Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 1, and a new game mode called Doom Match will be playable in the Sanctum Sanctorum.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-battle-pass-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Battle Pass&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The developers will provide <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNiYrOSLYD4&amp;t=146s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">double the content </a>of Season 0 for the Marvel Rivals Season 1 battle pass. The theme will be Eternal Night Falls, and players can claim 10 new skins through the pass. Season 1 Luxury Battle Pass will be priced at 990 Lattice, and players can claim 600 Lattice and 600 Units by completing it.&nbsp;The battle pass will not expire once obtained.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-season-1-balancing-changes">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Balancing Changes</h2>



<p>The developers are “toning down the prowess of formidable ranged duelists like Hela and Hawkeye”, meaning players will see these characters getting nerfed soon. The developers will provide buffs to mobile-type Vanguards like Captain America and Venom and characters that “shine in specialised compositions” such as Wolverine and Storm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Characters like Cloak and Dagger will also receive buffs to make them more “formidable in diverse team setups during Marvel Rivals Season 1. Lastly, Jeff the Land Shark’s ultimate range is also being fine-tuned to “better align with early warning signals.”</p>



<h2 id="h-pick-rates-and-win-rates">Pick Rates and Win Rates</h2>



<p>At the end of Season 0, Marvel Rivals developers will provide the pick and win rates for all characters across all available platforms. Players should know that the stats for PC and Console will be merged for quick matches as it features cross-platform battles. However, separate statistics will be available for the competitive mode. Players should expect these pick and win rates to be released every half-season.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-rank-adjustments">Rank Adjustments</h2>



<p>Lastly, the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1: Eternal Night Falls will reset competitive ranks, with each player receiving a drop of 7 divisions, depending on their end rank in Season 0. Additionally, Season 1 will see the arrival of a new major rank, Celestial, which falls between the Grandmaster and Eternity ranks. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-settings">Additional Settings</h2>



<p>Listening to player feedback, the developer will provide additional tools at the start of Marvel Rivals Season 1. A new option that allows you to boost frame rates will be introduced. Also, devs will introduce support for mouse acceleration settings for more customisation. A streamer mode will be introduced in the first half of Season 1 for upcoming and established content creators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Details about Marvel Rivals Season 1 Part 2 will be revealed later, where we will learn more about The Thing and Human Torch.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sega and Ryu Ga Gotoku have released footage of the upcoming Virtua Fighter project, which was first shown at CES 2025. However, they made it clear that the footage is not actual gameplay, and that it's just "in-game" concept footage before development began.</p><p>The quick 35-second video presents one stage that looks like a run-down city simply called The City, which is described as a "hotbed of vice, attracts both the wicked and desperate." The camera then pans out to show two characters fighting each other. Both of them are models of Akira, Virtua Fighter's mascot.</p>

<p>
Half a dozen staff impacted by the redundancies have spoken to Eurogamer to confirm the job losses, under condition of anonymity to protect their careers. 
</p>
<p>
Roles impacted include members of Rocksteady's programming and artist teams, as well as more QA staff. 
</p>
<p>
The job losses follow an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">earlier round of redundancies at Rocksteady that Eurogamer first reported back in September</a>, when the company's QA team was nearly halved in size from 33 to 15 people. One staff member made redundant at the time said they had discovered they'd lost their job in the middle of their paternity leave.

<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Warner Bros. for comment on this latest round of layoffs, but has so far not received a response. The publisher previously did not publicly acknowledge September's layoffs, either.
</p>
<p>
2024 was a difficult year for Rocksteady, as the company continued to support Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League with the remainder of its post-launch content schedule despite low player numbers.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. previously said it had lost around $200m (£160m) on the game. Currently, it's unclear what Rocksteady will work on next.
</p>
<p>
In early December, the developer acknowledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deathstroke-kicks-off-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-final-announced-season">it would not continue updating Suicide Squad with any new content in 2025</a>, though servers will remain online for the forseeable future.
</p>
<p>
The commercial failure of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has seen staff lose jobs on the other side of the pond, also. December also saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">job losses at Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights studio Warner Bros. Games Montreal,</a> where 99 jobs were reportedly eliminated. The majority of these positions are believed to have been supporting Rocksteady with additional content for Suicide Squad.

            <p>Horses - the cursed horror game from Saturnalia developer Santa Ragione and directed by Andrea Lucco Borlera - is still coming, it is just taking a little longer to get out of the gates than first anticipated.</p>
<p>Horses sees players take on the role of a summer worker at a farm. This sounds safe enough, and after all, it's only for two weeks - but there is something much darker and downright unsettling lying beneath the surface.</p>
<p>"Will you survive the summer, or will the farm claim yet another victim? In any case, we're sure your summer working experience will be truly unforgettable..." reads the official blurb.</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024 which, obviously, has been missed.</p>
<p>Thankfully though, Horses has not been silently cancelled. Santa Ragione has confirmed to Eurogamer the upcoming game will now be released this year, and a demo is also on the cards.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately we had to delay the game to 2025," studio director Pietro Righi Riva told me. "[We're] not ready to talk about the reasons for the delay yet, but will absolutely keep you posted. By end of Q2 2025 we'll have a date for both the demo and the full release of the game."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned for more information on Horses soon.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-indie-preview-special-edition">Chris had a go with Horses last year</a>, calling it "magnetically sinister" following time with the game.</p>
<p>"It's a simpler thing in practise than some of Santa Ragione's previous games - effectively you are waking up and slowly carrying out simple, if escalating strange tasks each day, like watering plants, feeding the dog, or, erm, burying bodies, as a story takes shape around you - but the magic here is in the atmosphere and tone," he wrote.</p>
<p>"It's also a rare attempt at using actual, suspended meaning in a game. You'll need to bring something of your own to the farmhouse table here, and meet this thing halfway."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lenovo is trying an experiment. In May, it will officially become the very first company outside of Valve to ship a handheld gaming PC with the Steam Deck’s wonderfully pick-up-and-play SteamOS instead of Microsoft Windows. And at $499, it’ll be a true Steam Deck rival, joining it as one of the lower-priced PC handhelds you can buy.</p><p>That handheld will be the 1.6-pound Lenovo Legion Go S, a new and improved version of the company’s eight-inch handheld that ditches the Nintendo Switch-like detachable gamepads and kickstand for a lighter and more traditional design, with a sculpted grip that felt supremely comfortable in my hands. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->10</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Legion Go S gallery, including size comparisons to the Steam Deck.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div></div><p>It’ll also be one of the few handhelds on the market to offer a 120Hz variable refresh rate screen — a highly desirable feature that lets low-power handheld gameplay feel smooth, even if it’s not generating lots of frames. That screen will be lower in resolution at 1920 x 1200, too, and feature a <em>hopefully</em> power-sipping <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">new AMD Ryzen Z2 Go chip</a>. (It’s a Lenovo-exclusive chip, by the way.)</p><p>In other words, it might address every major complaint I had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">in my Legion Go review</a>, while additionally adding fun configurable RGB lighting around the joysticks, a slightly larger 55Wh battery, a pair of levers to reduce the throw of the triggers, and a less obtrusive touchpad, too, while retaining the dual USB 4 ports.</p><p>But Lenovo isn’t going all in on SteamOS. Not only will it hedge its bets by shipping a Windows version of the Legion Go S as well but it’ll also ship with Windows <em>this month</em> — four months ahead of the SteamOS models. The Windows model is white:</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>Our Lenovo Legion Go S Windows gallery, including this comparison shot with the original Legion Go.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto</cite></p></div></div><p>It’s not like the SteamOS model is ready now anyhow. Valve codesigners Lawrence Yang and Pierre-Loup Griffais tell me they’ve only been working with Lenovo for a couple of months, and the integration isn’t quite done. The new touchpad, gyroscope, and both RGB lighting and TDP configuration options are among the things on their to-do list. </p><p>But the Windows version shipping in January will cost $729.99, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. In May, the true experiment will begin when gamers can pick between a $499.99 SteamOS version with 16GB / 512GB, a $599.99 Windows version with 16GB / 1TB, or the Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> at $399 and $549, respectively. </p><p>And it does sound like there will be one important reason to pick the Steam Deck over the Legion Go S and vice versa, because AMD’s Z2 Go is a different chip. While the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">Z2 Go announced yesterday sheds cores and GPU generations</a> to be slightly more akin to the Steam Deck’s semi-custom Aerith and / or Sephiroth parts, we noted that it targets higher power levels, and Legion Go product manager Alex Zhu confirms to me that the Legion Go S is aimed at 20-watt performance, 30-watt, maybe even 40-watt configurable performance, which will likely offer higher performance (and lower battery life) than the 15-watt-and-below Steam Deck’s chip. </p><p>Zhu says Lenovo is targeting between two and 2.5 hours of battery life in demanding heavy games — which lines up with the basic math of dividing a 55 watt-hour battery by 20 watts, assuming the rest of the system doesn’t eat up a lot more. Versions with AMD’s existing Z1 Extreme chip will also be available in some markets. All Legion Go S can fit full-length M.2 2280 solid state drives.</p><p>BTW, Valve isn’t keeping key Steam Deck features like precompiled shaders to itself, or anything else, for that matter. Yang and Griffais say it will be one SteamOS, and the Legion Go S and any future SteamOS devices will get the same updates as the Deck, minus hardware-specific tweaks.</p><p>Valve tells me Lenovo is currently its only partner for a SteamOS device — there are no other third-party SteamOS devices currently in the works. But Griffais hints that Valve is close to publicly releasing a new beta of its SteamOS that <em>just might possibly</em> start working on other handhelds as well. (Valve previously confirmed to us that it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">building toward some level of support for the Asus ROG Ally</a> in SteamOS as well.)</p><p>And it’s vaguely possible that SteamOS beta could arrive before the SteamOS Legion Go S — Valve says it’s slated to ship sometime after March. </p><p>But the real dream is to pull a PC handheld out of a box and have it just work, the way a Nintendo Switch works, not to shoehorn an operating system on it afterward, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">no matter how good the result</a>. That’s why Lenovo is working with Valve: Zhu agrees that SteamOS has the best out-of-box experience. But, he says, Windows offers a whole ecosystem of gaming and productivity that the company believes its customers still want.</p><p>Zhu agrees that SteamOS is an experiment for Lenovo and says it’ll look at the feedback and momentum before making its next move. Speaking of what’s next, Lenovo is also building a larger Legion Go 2 with detachable controllers and an 8.8-inch OLED screen, and it brought prototypes of that unit to CES:</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Legion Go 2 prototype, with a smaller kickstand and more sculpted grips.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Zhu tells me Lenovo doesn’t have “any specific plans” to put SteamOS on the larger Legion Go, just Windows — but perhaps it depends on what customers buy in May.</p><p>Meanwhile, Valve is still looking ahead to a future version of its own Steam Deck, saying that partnering with companies like Lenovo hasn’t reduced the desire to build its own. But AMD’s Z2 isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">the “leap” that Valve’s been waiting for</a>, Griffais tells <em>The Verge. </em>There won’t be a Z2 Steam Deck. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To anyone who hasn’t played the games and doesn’t know who Abby is, she’s the co-protagonist of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, though developer Naughty Dog kept her mostly a secret until the game launched in 2020. We see Abby walking down a dark hallway with a loaded pistol in hand. We get a brief glimpse of her Firefly tags hanging around her neck as a siren blares through the halls.</p><p>If you did play <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, you know this is Abby looking for her father in the aftermath of Joel’s escape, in the same hospital where Joel went on a killing spree at the end of season one. HBO’s marketing doesn’t seem to be playing coy with Abby’s Firefly ties like Naughty Dog did in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so we’ll see if it actually tries to maintain the game’s twists and turns.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-recommend-id="image://fd45770271a13c1a46cfd1890166114b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isaac looks up at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s not a lot of plot to glean from the action montage that follows this scene of Abby. We see more of the infected attack on the Jackson stronghold that is new to the show, what appears to be a Seraphite cultist picking up a sickle that I’m sure they’ll use for cutting grass and not people, a quick shot of Jeffrey Wright <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-show-jeffrey-wright-isaac-actor-1851499647">reprising his role as WLF leader Isaac</a></span>, a Seraphite member set on fire, and an infected person crawling toward someone like they’re stalking prey. But that’s less exciting than…</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5917cd93afca693de6ff356301df4bc5" data-recommend-id="image://5917cd93afca693de6ff356301df4bc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina and Ellie slow dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina and Ellie slow dance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5917cd93afca693de6ff356301df4bc5" data-recommend-id="image://5917cd93afca693de6ff356301df4bc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina and Ellie slow dance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We see two clips of Bella Ramsey returning as protagonist Ellie and Isabela Merced as Dina, her ride-or-die girlfriend and best friend in Jackson. Because of <em>events</em>, Dina accompanies Ellie on her revenge quest to Seattle, and we see the pair running from, presumably, infected in the city. However, we also see the two slow dancing and looking lovingly into each other’s eyes. Fans will know this scene as taking place at a dance in Jackson and as one of the first moments Naughty Dog released to the public <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">way back in 2018</a></span>. Chronologically, this happens just before the bulk of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> but isn’t shown to the player until near the end. The sequel is flashback-heavy, and this sequence is one of the last ones the player sees after Ellie returns home from Seattle where most of the game takes place, so if this scene is going to be in season two, it’s another implication that the show is tweaking the sequence of events. The first season was a pretty faithful retelling of the original game’s story (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">with a few exceptions</a></span>), so I expected the second season to follow suit. Across all three trailers, there haven’t been that many scenes that don’t seem lifted straight from&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s events beyond <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-two-hbo-max-joel-catherine-o-hara-1851612956">Joel’s apparent therapy sessions</a></span>, but it seems like it might be playing with the structure a bit. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-recommend-id="image://0b0a58dfa97ba26aba4baee352e2437f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ellie points a gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A lot of this trailer is re-used footage from the last two. We again see Joel crying in therapy, Ellie screaming out on what looks like a hospital bed, and the Infected attacking Jackson. Given that I was just giving the show shit for seemingly spoiling Abby’s identity in a trailer, I can commend the restraint. As for the flashes of new footage, there’s a moment that looks like it might be the scene in which Ellie tracks Nora, one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-manny-mel-nora-owen-abby-actors-1851300984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-manny-mel-nora-owen-abby-actors-1851300984">Abby’s friends</a></span> played by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128"><em>Intergalactic</em></a></span><em> </em>star Tati Gabrielle in the show, into an infected nest. We don’t see the WLF medic, but the scene is distinct for its use of stark red lighting and its focus on Ellie as she approaches. We can see Ellie pointing a gun at someone on the ground in front of her with this distinct lighting and framing. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-recommend-id="image://cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-recommend-id="image://cd221274492f95737044cc2abf1fcee8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cloud of smoke rises from the ground with black text reading &quot;SEASON II APRIL&quot; in front of it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The final shot shows a flare being thrown into an otherwise dark area. As the light flickers, it reveals that <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season will premiere on Max in April. HBO didn’t get any more specific than that, but the first season’s episodes premiered on Sundays, so we’ll see if the second season’s do&nbsp;as well.</p><p>For more on <em>The Last of Us</em>, check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-tv-review-pedro-pascal-joel-ellie-bill-1849969496"><em>Kotaku</em>’s review of the first season</a></span>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
