<p>Counter-Strike 2 has reached a new milestone today, setting a new standard for total players while still chasing the the all-time record for the series. The latest iteration of the Counter-Strike franchise reached its highest player peak ever.</p>



<p>Is CS2 perfect? No, but it couldn’t be further from “dead.”</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-strengthens-its-hold-as-the-most-popular-game-on-steam">CS2 Strengthens Its Hold As The Most Popular Game on Steam</h2>



<p>On February 16, 2025, Counter-Strike 2 reached a concurrent player peak of 1,744,015 players, according to the trusted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB database</a>. This occurred around 13:50 UTC: mid-to-late afternoon in Europe, night-time around Asia, and morning for the Americas. This number represents the most amount of players playing CS2 at once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-reaches-highest-player-peak-after-shanghai-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since just a couple months ago in December 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Since December, CS2 has averaged over 900,000 players, according to SteamDB. As impressive as the peaks and averages have been recently, they’re still just a bit short of the all-time records set by CS:GO. May 2023 saw the highest player peak ever in Counter-Strike history at 1,818,773 players, as well as the highest average ever at over 1.11 million players. Those historic numbers can be attributed to the announcement of the CS2 limited test and the start of the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>The slight dip in CS2 player peaks and averages in January 2025 could be attributed to the break in the professional circuit following the Perfect World Shanghai Major. As the schedule has resumes with events like BLAST and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Katowice</a> at the start of February, the player count swells once again. CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s player charts, as it has only been surpassed in active players in exceptionally rare circumstances.</p>



<p>While the game’s popularity and player base show zero signs of trailing off, there are still concerns that players want addressed. These range from the still-rampant cheating issue to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-launch-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems with FPS performance</a> to a lack of content such as operations or new modes. Still, outside of maybe League of Legends, it remains the most popular PC game in the world.</p>



<p>Will CS2 eventually beat the CS:GO player peak? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>During the championship weekend of the Six Invitational, Ubisoft has announced that it will be revealing a new era of Rainbow Six Siege on March 13 at the Siege X Showcase in Atlanta, Georgia. A new attacker operator named Rauora, who hails from New Zealand, will also join Rainbow Six Siege.</p><p>The teaser for the big upcoming Siege update describes it as the game's "biggest transformation" yet. This will include both graphical and audio improvements, as well as "deepened tactical gameplay," although no specifics were shared. Additionally, Ubisoft said there will be "new ways to play," but again didn't say if that would come in the form of new game modes or something else.</p><p>Rauora will be available to play at the start of the upcoming Year 10 Season 1 as part of the Operation Prep Phase battle pass, and will be unlockable with Renown or R6 credits after two weeks.</p><p>Rauora is equipped with the 417 designed marksman rifle or the M249 light machine gun as her primary weapon, and the GSH-18 9mm pistol or the new Reaper MK2 machine pistol as her secondary. The latter has a red dot sight and an extended magazine. Her special gadget is the Deployable Omnilink Mesh Launcher, or DOM. It's a smart bulletproof barrier that can only be used in doorways and reaches all the way to the ground. As a smart cover, DOM can sense when ally drones are nearby and will let them through by lifting itself up.</p><p>DOM also has a trigger at the top that can be opened by any operator through shooting it. While both attackers and defenders can open and close the barrier, the attacking side has more benefits. Defenders will be locked out for a short time when the barrier is first deployed or has just closed, and only an attacker's presence will open it again. It also opens up much faster when an attacker triggers it.</p><p>While Rauora's barriers are bulletproof, they are still susceptible to explosions. They also cannot remove Castle's reinforced barricades if it's already out or used while Tubarão's Zoto Canister is in effect. Jäger's ADS gadget can also take out DOM before it gets a chance to even deploy.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been one of Ubisoft's premiere live-service games since. It's gotten a ton of support of the years, most recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-finally-getting-full-cross-play-many-years-later/1100-6527826/" data-ref-id="1100-6527826">full cross-play</a> as well as stricter anti-cheat measures, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-cheaters-will-now-be-kicked-and-perma-banned-instantly/1100-6529011/" data-ref-id="1100-6529011">cheaters being instantly perma-banned</a>.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors of a sequel</a>, Rainbow Six creator director Alexander Karpazis claimed that its a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-can-last-forever-according-to-creative-director/1100-6521397/" data-ref-id="1100-6521397">game that can "last forever,"</a> which is good news for the nearly decade-old game. Separately, Ubisoft's executives said that they are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a> going forward.</p>

<p>In a recent interview on the XboxEra Podcast, Phil Spencer got talking about the future of Xbox showcases like the Developer Direct. In one segment, the conversation turned to Xbox using those stages to reveal multi-platform games, presenting both the Nintendo and PlayStation logos in trailers and title splashes.</p>



<p>It’s not the typical operating model, as most of these events are usually reserved for platform-specific trailers and promos. Recently, Xbox bucked that trend, showing off the PlayStation logo to let consumers know that whatever game is being showcased will be available on platforms <strong>other than </strong>Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-honest-and-transparent">‘Honest and Transparent’</h2>



<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the XboxEra Podcast</a>, Phil Spencer spoke about the recent inclusion of PlayStation iconography in Xbox-backed showcases. In his words, that’s the set standard going forward, and players should expect to see more multi-platform imagery in trailers and broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s just being honest and transparent about where the games are showing, and we actually even had this discussion last year for the June showcase, and by the time we kind of made our decision, we couldn’t get all of the assets done and it felt weird to have some of them in and some of them out.</p>



<p>But I just want to be transparent with people – for shipping on Nintendo Switch, we’re gonna put that. For shipping on PlayStation, on Steam… People should know the storefronts where they can get our games, but I want people to be able to experience our Xbox community in our games and everything we have to offer, on every screen we can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s all about openness and transparency, according to Spencer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/">Forza Horizon 5</a> will be zooming onto PlayStation platforms later this year. That follows a few titles that were once exclusive to Xbox making their way onto the platform. There have also been rumours that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/">Gears and Halo</a> might head over to  PlayStation and Nintendo Switch at some point.</p>

            <p>Almost six years on from its debut, Xbox CEO of Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has confirmed that Rare's mysterious fantasy deer adventure Everwild is still in development.</p>
<p>Despite being first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a> with a gorgeous teaser, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">shown again in summer 2020</a> with a slightly-more revealing trailer, we've heard very little about the game.</p>

<p>Talking to the XboxEra podcast, however, Spencer had good news for those who feared the game may have been quietly cancelled, revealing the team was making "progress".</p>
<p>"I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said, when asked reflect on what first-party games still in development he was most looking forward to (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>"It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported that in the same podcast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer said he's "not trying to move [PS5 and PC players] all over to Xbox anymore"</a>, acknowledging that players are "all so invested in where our games are", all he wants to do now is "allow more people to play" Xbox games on other systems.</p>
<p>Spencer acknowledged that whilst selling games on competitor devices means Xbox only recoups 70 percent of the sale, that 70 percent still helps Xbox "build great portfolios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>10:10 Games has initiated redundancies following the "complete commercial and critical failure" of Funko Fusion.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/">Insider Gaming</a>, where sources shared their experiences under the promise of anonymity, the lukewarm reception to Funko Fusion meant the UK studio struggled to secure funding for addition projects, and some colleagues were informed that there "isn’t enough work to give the whole team".</p>

<p>Sources intimate no meaningful severance support has been made available, with only "the bare minimum" entitlement offered, as well as payment of unused holiday. However, this, some speculate, is why colleagues were pressured into using up all their leave ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>Because of this, some colleagues were notified that their jobs were at risk whilst on leave. In some instances, these staff felt obliged to attend meetings about their future at the studio whilst on holiday, even if they were away in different timezones.</p>
<p>"Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board," said one source.</p>
<p>Whilst unconfirmed, it's thought around 20 people have been impacted by the cuts, bringing the estimated<a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025"> number of developers who have lost their jobs across the games industry</a> to around 900 in 2025 alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After 12 official matches as a team and only three during VCT Americas, NRG has benched Andrew “Verno” Maust and VALORANT coach Malkolm “bonkar” Rench. Following a strong performance at offseason events that resulted in high expectations, NRG has already made significant changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-verno-and-bonkar-out-from-nrg-after-only-a-dozen-official-matches">Verno and Bonkar Out From NRG After Only a Dozen Official Matches</h2>



<p>Roster changes to the NRG VALORANT roster had been rumored since the conclusion of Kickoff, but were confirmed by the organization today. NRG’s Chief Gaming Officer Jaime Cohenca <a href="https://x.com/bikeage/status/1891179079015285152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the benching is a result of a lack of cohesion that has been brewing for months.</p>



<p>“What I can say is that we put together a roster that was poised to contend for international championships but ultimately failed in terms of team cohesion,” Cohenca wrote on X. “Winning SEN City and SOOP [in the offseason] only delayed the effects of the issues brewing. The team no longer could function as constructed, so continuing with the current five players/head coach was not an option.”</p>



<p>“Given the nature of the VCT schedule, this break is pretty much the only window to make a roster move, so we are doing things now to be ready for when a Champs slot is on the line.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>VCT Roster Update: Verno and Bonkar have been moved to the NRG VALORANT reserve roster.

They will remain a part of NRG as we prepare for the remainder of the 2025 VCT season.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Long-time veterans of NRG in Sam “s0m” Oh, Pujan “FNS” Mehta, and Ethan “Ethan” Arnold will seemingly stay on the starting roster. Adam “mada” Pampuch, who joined the team during this past offseason, will also stay following an exceptional statistical performance at Kickoff. Some fans speculate that former coach Chetan “Chet” Singh could return when his suspension expires at the end of Masters Bangkok. Chet was suspended by Riot Games for streaming VODs deemed “confidential” on his personal channel.</p>



<p>NRG lost to Cloud9 and KRÜ at Kickoff, while managing to win against 100T in between those matches, but earned no points towards Champions qualification. Their season resumes when VCT Americas Stage 1 starts in late March.</p>



<p>Who should NRG bring on to the starting lineup? Let us know down below or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>"There are people - whether it's their libraries are on PlayStation or Nintendo, whether it's that they like the controller better, they just like the games that are there - and I don't want to then look at that and say 'well, there's no way that we should be able to build a business there, [or] find fans of our franchises there'.</p>
<p>"I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore. We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>That said, Spencer was pragmatic enough to admit that position may change, not least because yes, he would very much prefer to be making "all of the money for all the games that [Xbox] ship[s] right now".</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Xbox is about to give up its hardware endeavours, however.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Ristar is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, February 16, 2025. Below, we make the case that despite Sonic's breakout celebrity, Ristar really deserved to be the face of Sega.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that Mario will likely always sit on the throne as the most iconic video game mascot of all time, but Sonic the Hedgehog certainly gave him a run for his money back in the '90s. The lovable 'tude and blistering speed of the Blue Blur made him a cultural figure par excellence in the days of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and you can even argue that his signature velocity defined the idea of that Sega console in the average gamer's mind. That said, Genesis fanatics are well aware that Sonic isn't even the best platform star on his own console. That honor belongs to Ristar, who Sonic kneecapped like a coward 30 years ago so he could stay on the treadmill of producing endlessly mediocre spin-offs with no substance or new ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that is a bit harsh to Sonic--it's not his fault that Sega has dropped the ball with his games since roughly the turn of the century, with a few notable exceptions. But while Sonic's signature speed and beautiful pastel aesthetics never quite made the transition to 3D, mechanics-focused indie platformers similar to Ristar have continued to find an audience, from the gravity flip of VVVVVV to the no-jump gimmick of Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom. In this way, Ristar was a swinging star-man ahead of his time, and it's unfortunate that Sega didn't realize that.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't familiar, Ristar is a short but sweet platforming classic released by Sega in the waning days of the Genesis in 1995. You use the lovable mascot's stretchy arms to grab enemies, climb ladders, swing from bar to bar, and propel yourself through its many colorful worlds. The game features a variety of creative boss fights that culminate with a decisive battle with the cloaked Kaiser Greedy, who has kidnapped Ristar's father and taken him prisoner.</p><p dir="ltr">You'd figure that a first-party Sega game of this quality would at least get a sequel, and that observation gets at the heart of Ristar's biggest problem: timing. When Sega asked its staff to create a Mario-slaying mascot, Sonic won the day, but there were a lot of ideas left on the drafting table. One of them was "<a href="https://ristar.fandom.com/wiki/Feel" rel="nofollow ">Feel the Rabbit</a>," a proto-Sonic archetype that was spun out into a goofy-looking cartoon character that eventually became Ristar. By the time the game actually came out, critical and commercial eyes were on the cutting-edge Sega Saturn, which left our dextrous star friend in the lurch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-l8m-hkxo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mk-l8m-hkxo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">When I compare classic games like the original Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and Ristar, I think it's instructive to look at the gameplay "verbs" that are available to the player. Essentially, what do you actually do in the game? It's easy to enjoy the style and flow of the original Sonic trilogy, but in terms of verb count, they're pretty underwhelming: every button is jump, and your roll is nice, but not particularly useful. This is a big part of why Sonic struggled with the transition to the third dimension: besides running and jumping, you don't do a whole lot in his games.</p><p dir="ltr">By contrast, Ristar heavily relies on its one unique mechanic in the form of the grab, but the game maximizes it. You can send those stretchy arms out in eight directions, which makes for engaging combat and greater enemy variety. One of your character's basic moves is the ability to climb any wall vertically with the right timing, which is difficult to master but oh-so-satisfying when you finally pull it off. It features another memorable mechanic in the form of glowing poles that you swing around to gain momentum, then shoot off in the direction of your choice. Ristar is invincible during the initial surge of speed, but becomes vulnerable when he slows down, so you have to aim him well to avoid taking unnecessary hits.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Sonic and Ristar feature artful level design, but I would give our star friend the edge in that category. Ristar's stages simply brim with creativity; from the pulsing underwater sections of Undertow to the metronome puzzles of the musical planet Sonata, every one of the game's levels features new twists and mechanics for you to wrap your stretchy mitts around. Ristar has a core element that the Blue Blur only really figured out in Sonic 3: secrets with meaningful rewards. Each level has a hidden treasure that you access through a teleport pole hidden somewhere in the environment; given that Ristar's stages tend to be multipathed and require vertical thinking, it's unlikely you'll find all of them in your first playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">Ristar's unfortunate timing might have cost it commercial success, but it did give it one key advantage: It got the most mileage possible out of its console. It's the most complete audiovisual experience on the Genesis, featuring an impressive orchestral soundtrack that rivals anything on SNES, beautiful spritework, and boss designs that feel ripped straight out of a great Saturday morning cartoon. It's a feast for the senses you won't forget, especially the highly memorable level transition sequences, where Ristar blasts from planet to planet in a mesmerizing light show while one of my all-time favorite video game tracks plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbrh8c_NrHI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zbrh8c_NrHI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate argument in favor of Ristar over Sonic is perhaps the most obvious: When's the last time you really enjoyed a Sonic game? Sure, Sonic was a great piece of marketing, but it took less than a decade for the cracks in his facade to show. When speculating as to what a 3D Ristar game might have looked like, let's consider the humble grappling hook, perhaps the most ubiquitous gameplay mechanic of the past 10 years. It's easy to imagine an exploration-focused Ristar with plenty of climbing and grappling, similar to what we see in Jusant, or even Sonic Frontiers. Of course, in today's indie market, there's plenty of room for Sega to jump-start a Ristar reinvention in the 2D plane, but this seems relatively unlikely at this juncture. Still, remasters are quite fashionable these days, and it's definitely a prime candidate for nostalgic Genesis fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic may be an indelible piece of '90s pop culture, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened if Sega had put a little more juice behind a certain cute star rather than narrowly focusing on its golden goose. We'll never know if Ristar had the same potential to cross over into pop culture, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no doubt as to what the better game is, and that's really what matters.</p>

<p>"I don't have details. Just sadness. Brilliant and original. Made everything better."</p>
<p>Antonov moved from Bulgaria to Paris when he was just 17 and went on to work or consult on a number of notable games, including Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Half-Life 2: Lost Coast, Dishonored.

<p>After Valve, Antonov joined Arkane Studios, telling our Bertie: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-half-life-2-city-17-creator-viktor-antonov-left-valve">Valve is a great place, but I'm interested in projects, not in companies</a>. I went to Valve specifically for Half-Life 2. I went and I collaborated with Arkane to do The Crossing and Dishonored. I put the project above everything else."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h5><p><span>October 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Price</h5><p><span>$129.99 / €139.99 MSRP</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Back in July of 2021, Razer <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-x-lucidsound-ls15p-wireless-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released the Barracuda X multi-platform wireless headset</a>, and some months ago, the brand launched an updated version called Barracuda X Chroma. As I've been quite impressed with the original 2021 model, I was happy to test out the new X Chroma model. Here are my thoughts about this illuminated multi-platform model.</p>
<h4>Design and features</h4>
<p>I was supplied with the White Edition of the X Chroma, which matches the white design of both PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. For those who don't like the white version, there's also a regular black-colored model.</p>
<p>The X Chroma comes with a USB-C transmitter for wireless audio transmission on basically all devices that have a USB-C port. As Microsoft uses its own wireless audio solution, the X Chroma doesn't work on Xbox. Razer has also supplied a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable, which is ideal for PC or docked Nintendo Switch use. It's interesting to note that while the original Barracuda X came with a 3.5mm audio port, the X Chroma doesn't.</p>

<p>Like the original model, the X Chroma is made mostly from plastic, likely to save weight and cut down on manufacturing costs. It's not all plastic, though; Razer's offering has an inner-metal headband that makes the headset feel sturdy.</p>
<p>The earcups of Razer's new outing are wrapped in breathable memory foam cushions that twist flat to rest comfortably around your neck or lie down on a desk. Like its older sibling, the X Chroma comes with Razer's TriForce 40mm drivers</p>
<p>Compared to the original Barracuda X, the X Chroma packs an upgraded detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone for communication. In addition, as the name implies, the new Barracuda comes with Chroma RGB lighting. It's a nice new addition, although you don't see it while wearing the headset. For streamers, however, the RBG lighting does add to the overall appeal.</p>
<h4>Comfort</h4>
<p>The new X Chroma weighs 285gr, a few grams heavier than the original model but still lightweight and lighter than plenty of rival headsets.</p>
<p>Although the padding on the earcups is pretty thin, comfort is good—even during longer gaming sessions. Due to the materials used, there's not much heat build-up. The low weight adds to the overall sense of comfort, and I would say that comfort is on par with that of the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-ps4-switch-amazing-all-round-on-the-go-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless</a>.</p>

<h4>Performance</h4>
<p data-start="0" data-end="278">The Razer X Chroma headset is an excellent plug-and-play option, much like its predecessor. It's incredibly easy to set up, and the mobile Razer app provides a nice touch, allowing users to tweak settings such as lighting, EQ presets, Do Not Disturb mode, and Bluetooth options.</p>
<p data-start="280" data-end="808">When it comes to wireless performance, the X Chroma is on point. The signal remains clear, even when you're farther away from the transmitter, making it reliable for long gaming sessions. The sound quality is lively and engaging, with a solid overall experience. As expected from gaming headsets, the mids are a bit subdued, and some of the higher frequencies can get a little lost in the low-end sounds. However, much like the original model, the X Chroma delivers a balanced sound profile that works well for various gaming genres.</p>
<p data-start="810" data-end="1093" data-is-last-node="">One of the most notable upgrades in the X Chroma is the microphone. The new detachable boom mic performs impressively, offering clear, natural voice capture with excellent background noise reduction. This makes it a standout feature, especially considering the headset's price range.</p>

<h4>Battery</h4>
<p>The 2021 model of the original Barracuda X lasted around 23 hours on a single charge, but the 2022 model came with considerably longer battery life - around 50 hours with normal volume levels. With the new X Chroma model, Razer boasts that it can last around 70 hours on a single charge; that's around 40% more than the 2022 model. Hence, this is with Chroma RGB lighting disabled. During testing, we managed to get around 71 hours of juice out of the battery when not using the Chroma lighting. When turned on, battery life drops to roughly 30 hours on a single charge. Pretty impressive, especially compared to other outings in this segment.</p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The Razer X Chroma builds on the strengths of the Barracuda X, offering impressive wireless performance, a much-improved microphone, and exceptional battery life. Despite its lightweight construction, the headset feels sturdy and remains comfortable for long gaming sessions, thanks to its breathable memory foam ear cushions and minimal heat build-up. Setting it up is effortless, and the Razer app provides useful customization options. Sound quality is well-balanced and engaging, while the detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone delivers clear voice capture with excellent noise reduction. The real standout is the battery life—lasting up to 70 hours without RGB, far exceeding many competitors. For its price, the X Chroma delivers a strong mix of comfort, features, and longevity, making it a great option for gamers looking for reliability and value.</p>
