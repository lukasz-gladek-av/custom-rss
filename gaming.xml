<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>One of the most pleasant surprises of this month’s Partner Direct was the reveal and shadow drop of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-bomberman-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Super Bomberman Collection</a>, a compilation of some of the eponymous hero’s earliest games with some extra goodies thrown in. Though it’s ultimately little more than the sum of its parts, Super Bomberman Collection does a great job of presenting these timeless games in their best possible light. If you’re looking for a great game to play with others for some excellent competitive couch multiplayer, read on.</p>
<p>So, let’s run through what’s included here. The headlining games are <strong>Super Bomberman 1-5</strong> for the SNES, the latter three of which never even saw an official release in the US, while the first two NES Bomberman games and some boss rush modes are included on the side as fun extras. Additionally, there’s some cool museum content on display between an art gallery, music player, and original scans of the boxes and instruction manuals. It's a comprehensive and content-rich package; retro collections like these are increasingly more common these days, but you don’t always see developers going the extra mile to include as much as Konami did here.</p>

<p>Gameplay across all five of the SNES titles is roughly the same, with more features and gimmicks as you move through each sequel. If you’re playing in single player, the aim is typically to navigate the mazes and either trip switches or defeat all enemies on-screen by dropping bombs at intersections that send fiery might in every orthogonal direction. With each blast, more breakable walls fall away and leave more of the field open, and if you happen to get caught in a blast, Bomberman goes down.</p>
<p>It can be very easy to not realize until it’s too late that you didn’t leave yourself an exit after dropping a bomb, and there’s something delightfully thrilling about tensely tracking the movements of Bomberman, enemies on the field, and various hazards as you try to navigate safely while knocking everyone else out. These single player modes are <em>fine</em>, but it doesn’t take too long before the maps start to get a little repetitive and samey. Plus, there’s just something about the generally slower pace of these levels that makes them feel more like training for the <em>real</em> game that picks up when you have some friends nearby.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Bomberman Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/162065/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Multiplayer is where the compilation really shines, pitting you and up to four other friends against each other in a brutal contest to be the last one standing. Balancing careful strategy with quick skill is necessary to win a given match, as you plot out how to box your foes in without accidentally blowing yourself up in the process. There’s something about the snappy nature of a two minute battle, fighting for control of power ups and scurrying away from bomb blasts left and right, that gets the blood pumping. Every match begins roughly the same, but it rapidly gets much more dynamic as the powerups keep accruing and opponents start finding increasingly more aggressive ways to corral each other into an early death.</p>
<p>It'd be enough fun on just “The Classic” map, but different stages add all sorts of new gimmicks, such as an ice level where cracks in the ice can destroy backtracking routes or a mining stage where mine carts allow players to zip around to different points. These go a long way in adding variety to the gameplay without distracting too much from the core mechanics, heaping on lots more replayability and naturally leading to the emergence of some favorites with a given friend or family group.</p>
<p>I think the real brilliance of Bomberman lies in the genius of its simplicity; although the powerups and environmental gimmicks add some welcome depth, anyone can pick it up and learn how to play in a matter of minutes due to the simple controls and concept. This makes it a very easy party game to break out when others are over, and it doesn’t take long for things to get joyously competitive in all the best ways.</p>

<p>Yet, the main drawback with the multiplayer is that there’s a puzzling lack of a native online component. which feels like something that would’ve been relatively easy to implement here and would’ve gone a long way in adding to the replayability. The main caveat to this is the Switch 2 version has GameShare functionality, which allows you to play online if you set up a GameChat room with friends, but this feels like a hokey way of implementing something of that should be simpler.</p>
<p>This being an emulated collection, Konami also saw fit to include some welcome quality-of-life updates to present these games in their best possible light. Not only do you have an array of display options such as different borders and screen filters, but there’s also support for save states and an easily toggled rewind feature. The save states help to get around the somewhat antiquated password system for marking progress through each story mode, while dropping a bomb in the wrong spot is now something you can cleanly erase by just holding down a button to rewind time a few seconds back for a do-over.</p>

<p>And though it’s certainly not the main draw of the experience, I want to point out the special attention that went into the museum content. Little touches like being able to ‘unbox’ each game and see a render of its original cartridge alongside the original box show how much the developers cared about small details. Plus, it’s really fun seeing all the handmade concept art from around the time each game launched. Game preservation is a big point of discussion these days with many games at risk of becoming lost media, and I think supplementary content like this museum is an important part of ensuring that future generations can receive these games, too.</p>
<p>One topic that bears discussion are the (few) upgrades you get with the Switch 2 Edition. Alongside the aforementioned GameShare functionality, the expected resolution bump is pretty forgettable given that you only really see it when you’re in the menus between the games themselves, and while the online gameplay via GameShare and GameChat is nice, it should’ve been in the base game to begin with. It’s only five dollars to upgrade, but I think the base <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_bomberman_collection">Switch version</a> is perfectly fine to play on either console.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Super Bomberman Collection showcases some of the very best gameplay that Bomberman has to offer. Between the various games on offer, there are dozens of hours of exciting couch multiplayer battles to be had, demonstrating that it doesn’t take the latest and greatest tech for a game to simply be <em>fun</em> to play with others.</p>
<p>Though the lack of native online is disappointing, the great gameplay coupled with some robust museum content that honors the legacy of these games makes this one a no brainer—especially given the relatively cheap price. If you’re looking for another game you can pull out on game nights with friends, I’d highly suggest you pick this one up.</p></section>

Video game updates are an incredibly funny thing, mostly because I come from a time where they weren't a thing at all, apart from the odd second printing that patched some things here and there. Which is why my humerus has been particularly tickled by the news that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has arrived today that, amongst a couple of other things, add in the ability to simply let you jump.
</p>
<p>
Yes, that's right, you can finally make like the red (or green) plumber and leap into the air with the press of a button. It's actually an option that you'll need to turn on manually in the gameplay section of the options menu, under the advanced parkour option. As silly as an addition as this genuinely does sound, I can imagine it being a minute more freeing in turns of doing sick flips, et cetera, et cetera. And there's a parkour challenge thingy you can do now too if that takes your fancy! It does not take mine, because I don't own this game, but you can get a fancy signed vinyl, a statue, and some other bits if you win.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, those other two small update bits! You can now check a detailed stat page for your loadout to get into those microdetails regarding mostly pointless decimal point percentages. The other small change with this update is that the visual feedback for critical hits has been improved, though the only change I can personally notice is that the enemy's health bar flashes red to suggest you've done one. Perhaps I should go for an eyetest soon if I'm missing something.
</p><p>
It's also probably worth reminding you all of that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/1200-ubisoft-staff-go-on-strike-against-assassins-creed-companys-massive-cutbacks">1200 person strike</a> that took place last week over Ubisoft's recent cutbacks, i.e. those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">big proposed job cuts</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">recently cancelled games</a>, which includes the remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>.

              <p>Just a few weeks after launch and less than three months after it was first announced at the Game Awards, <em>Highguard&nbsp;</em>is…still alive. But its official website is suddenly down, sparking online rumors that the game is not long for this world.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/2023787343409205651?s=20">As spotted by Rebs Gaming</a> and others, earlier today, <a href="https://playhighguard.com/">the official PlayHighguard.com website</a> was replaced with a simple static page, featuring the game’s logo and a message that says: “This site is currently unavailable.” Below that is a support email to ping about the down site. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Wildlight Entertainment for more information.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HighGuardgame/comments/1r754vn/the_website_is_down/"> It seems the site has been down since at least 7:50 am EST</a>.</p>

A period of radio silence followed, leading to content creators filling the void with endless amounts of negative videos and online speculation running wild.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> finally did launch in January, it kicked off with over 90k concurrent players on Steam before <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">losing nearly all of them within 48 hours</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-odds-red-blue-moltres-crystal-2000669729</link>
            <guid>1438402</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve watched a lot of </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>shiny hunt</span></a><span> over the years, but somehow I’ve never actually witnessed what gaming YouTuber RaidAway just pulled off. Shiny Pokémon, the rare, alternate-colored version of the series’ monsters, were introduced in </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>, but because of how these rarities spawn in the early games, it’s possible that a Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon who originates from the first generation games can turn out to be Shiny when they’re traded over. RaidAway encountered an example of exactly that, and he did it with not just any monster, but a Legendary one from </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Moltres, like the rest of the Legendary Birds in </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, only spawns once per save file. You’ll find this flame-covered fowl late in the game at Victory Road, and if you fail to capture it the first time you approach it, you won’t get a second chance in that playthrough. Shiny hunting Legendary Pokémon is notoriously a hassle, as you have to reset your game multiple times, retriggering the same battle over and over, to see if you can find a rarer version of the most sought-after monsters in the game. RaidAway didn’t have to do that with Moltres on </span><i><span>Pokémon Blue</span></i><span>, and wouldn’t have been able to, as there was no indication that the bird was Shiny in the old game. However, when he traded it over to </span><i><span>Pokémon Crystal</span></i><span>, he saw the Moltres for what it truly was.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I ACCIDENTALLY FOUND A SHINY MOLTRES IN POKEMON BLUE TRANSFERING TO CRYSTAL</p> <p>THIS IS THE MOST INSANE SHINY EVER.. <a href="https://t.co/cSqFR4wRN5">pic.twitter.com/cSqFR4wRN5</a></p> <p>— Rich (@RaidAway) <a href="https://twitter.com/RaidAway/status/2023570861320548712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>How is this possible? Back in Generation II, Shiny status was determined by a Pokémon’s Individual Values, which are essentially the monster’s genetic disposition toward certain stats. So if your IVs for Attack, Speed, Defense, etc. landed on a specific number combination in the back end, they’d show up in a new color. These points still existed in the first-gen games, but it wasn’t until the sequels that they gained this additional trait. So that’s why a monster traded up can still end up being Shiny, even if you can’t clock that when you catch them in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Shiny Moltres trades the yellow body of the original for a pink one, which means not only that this statistical anomaly is an impressive stroke of dumb luck, but that RaidAway also wound up with a prettier version of the bird. He explains on X that he was working on a </span><i><span>Crystal</span></i> <a href="https://x.com/RaidAway/status/2023783654636556441?s=20"><span>Living Dex</span></a><span>, which is a term for when a player has captured one of every Pokémon in one game. Typically, Shiny hunting is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344"><span>an arduous task</span></a><span> that can take hours of banging your head against a wall until one shows up. But sometimes you get lucky and find one by accident. It’s just not often that it’s a Pokémon as rare as Moltres.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hasbro has provided confirmation that the highly anticipated GI Joe game featuring Snake Eyes has not been cancelled. </p>



<p>Atomic Arcade’s GI Joe Snake Eyes title is something that players have heard close to nothing about since its announcement. We have only heard that the game moved to pre-production in 2023, and there was a listing in 2024 that hinted at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gi-joe-could-be-an-open-world-game-according-to-recent-job-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world setting</a>. No other update since then, but it seems the title has survived. </p>

<p>A LinkedIn update reveals that PlayStation’s God of War 2018 and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarok, have generated over $1.4 billion in revenue. </p>



<p>God of War is easily one of the most popular franchises on Sony PlayStation, as was evident at the latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a>, where both announcements from the franchise stole the show. Now, we have received some numbers on how the recent games in the series have performed. </p>







<h2 id="h-god-of-war-2018-and-ragnarok-have-made-over-a-billion">God of War 2018 and Ragnarok Have Made Over a Billion</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/god-of-war-reboot-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richfleider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> update by the Senior Managing Producer for Art at Santa Monica Studios, Rich Fleider, reveals that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok have easily crossed a billion dollars in sales. The update on their profile states, “God of War (2018) &amp; God of War: Ragnarök (Sony PlayStation) – Record-breaking Metacritic scores &amp; $1.4B+ combined sales.” Fleider was responsible for the studio’s largest art team, 70+ internal artists + 100s of external partners worldwide.</p>



<p>Both God of War (2018) and God of War Ragnarok have been released for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and PC via Steam. The 2018 title marked a significant shift for fans, as their beloved character Kratos returned on a new console while exploring a brand new mythos: Norse mythology. The sequel, Ragnarok, built upon the original game’s foundation, offering players an even deeper narrative and introducing additional gameplay elements.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-final-preview-turning-every-race-into-a-street-fight</link>
            <guid>1438390</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer doesn't ease you in. Within seconds of the first race, a car zoomed past me and detonated — parts scattering across a rain-slicked tunnel — because an opponent activated Strike mode and clipped the wall at full speed. That's the tone of this anime-inspired combat racer, which is kind of like Wipeout meets Mario Kart, but instead of picking up shells to shoot at the competition, every vehicle is equipped with a powerful device called the Echo, which gradually converts defensive energy into offensive firepower. Here, you have to weigh your decisions carefully instead of hoping to drive over a particular item. The satisfyingly complex resource management system underneath gives Screamer a tactical backbone that neither of those games attempted. After a few hours with a pre-release PC build, the arcade racing already has a confident mechanical identity — fast, physical, and surprisingly deep — and while the story mode serves primarily as a tutorial for those systems, the arcade racing is where Screamer's identity truly shines. What I played suggests that Screamer's combat racing foundation is strong enough to carry the weight the developer is placing on it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sync or Swim</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer's central system is built around two resource meters that sit on opposite sides of the HUD, and the interplay between them sets it apart from the combat racing pack. On the left, Sync — the defensive resource — builds passively over time and actively through skilled play: cornering well, timing gear shifts, maintaining speed through turns. Sync powers your Boost (hold LB for a sustained speed increase) and your Shield (tap RB, which costs one full Sync tank and provides temporary protection against incoming Strikes and Overdrive hits). When you spend Sync on either of those actions, it converts into Entropy, the offensive meter on the right side of the screen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Entropy is where things get dangerous. Two bars of Entropy activate Strike (press RB), which grants a temporary speed burst during which any opponent you collide with explodes — a full KO that removes them from the race temporarily. Fill all four Entropy tanks and you unlock Overdrive (click both thumbsticks), which turns your car into a flaming battering ram that detonates everything it touches. The catch is lethal: during Overdrive, hitting any track barrier detonates you instead. It's the most powerful tool in Screamer, and it punishes even a slight misjudgment with the same instant death it dishes out.</p><p>I felt like I was making real decisions at 200 miles per hour, not just button mashing.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The conversion loop is what makes this more than a standard boost-and-shoot racer. Boosting spends Sync but generates Entropy, which means aggressive drivers who constantly burn speed are also passively building toward their combat abilities. Shielding spends Sync and directly banks one tank of Entropy, so even a defensive play feeds the offensive meter. Every race becomes a rolling calculation: do you burn Sync on a boost to close the gap, or bank a Shield to both protect yourself and charge toward a Strike? Do you spend two Entropy bars on an immediate KO attempt, or hold out for the full Overdrive? The system teaches restraint through its own logic rather than through punishment, and even on balanced difficulty, the races produced a rhythm that felt strategic rather than purely chaotic — I felt like I was making real decisions at 200 miles per hour, not just button mashing.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The right thumbstick handles drifting, and this is the control that makes Screamer's handling feel distinct. Rather than braking into corners, you pull the right stick to execute a drift that whips the car sideways through turns without losing meaningful speed. Once you internalize the two-stick rhythm — left for steering, right for drifting — the movement stops feeling like you're fighting the car and starts feeling like you're commanding it. There's also an upshift system: over the course of a race, you manually shift gears to increase your top speed, which layers a progression curve onto each race rather than just the meta-game. The cars have weight to them, too. Not the sluggish, input-delay kind — more like the satisfying heft of something that wants you to feel every collision and every wall scrape. Consecutive clean upshifts without collisions also accelerate Sync generation, rewarding precision beyond individual inputs. Meanwhile, hitting a barrier at speed costs you momentum but doesn't destroy you (unless you're in Overdrive), which keeps the racing forgiving enough to stay fun while the combat systems layer on the tension.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Built Different</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Screamer's initial boot experience demonstrates surprising care. Players can choose between a Quick Start, which throws them directly into the action, or a Guided Setup that walks them through video, audio, and accessibility options. The accessibility suite is particularly comprehensive, featuring: full one-handed control remapping for either the left or right hand, complete with automatic throttle and the ability to reassign every input to a single side of the controller; deuteranopia, protanopia, and tritanopia colorblindness filters with adjustable intensity on a scale of one to ten; independently scalable subtitle and menu text sizing; and a tinnitus reduction filter with configurable frequency (default ten kilohertz) and gain (default negative twelve decibels). This level of audio accessibility is rare in racing games, and its upfront inclusion, rather than being buried in a submenu, is commendable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Streamers, meanwhile, will immediately appreciate the licensed audio content toggle. A single switch disables copyrighted music before going live, eliminating the need for third-party workarounds. This small inclusion demonstrates an understanding of how people actually play and broadcast games in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This preview was played on PC at a 3440x1440 ultrawide resolution, where the visual style looked impressive. The arcade modes ran smoothly on medium settings with DLSS set to balanced, delivering solid visuals: neon-soaked tracks popped with color, car models showed visible collision damage, and the sense of speed remained strong even without maxed-out post-processing. The graphics menu is highly granular, offering individual sliders for anti-aliasing, post-processing, effects, shadows, reflections, global illumination, texture quality, foliage, and shading, as well as upscaling options across Nvidia DLSS, AMD FSR 4.0, and TSR, with frame generation support for compatible hardware.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One final note: Screamer offers five AI difficulty tiers, ranging from Very Easy to Very Hard, along with driving aids, including arcade throttle (automatic full acceleration), neural throttle and brake assist, neural steer and drift assist, and neural handling for cornering and wall avoidance. While these are useful options, they are hidden within the custom game settings rather than being presented during the initial setup. For a game that otherwise prioritizes accessibility so effectively, burying the driving aids behind layers of menus feels like an oversight that could unnecessarily challenge less experienced players during their initial races.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Full Roster</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of the fifteen characters is split across five teams of three — one Leader and two Members per squad — and brings a unique passive ability that meaningfully alters their playstyle. For example, Frederick's Reaper's Dance empowers his Strike and grants bonus Sync on KO, but makes him explode on contact with track barriers while Striking — a high-risk, high-reward tradeoff. Hiroshi's Unstable Boost extends boost duration the longer you hold it, rewarding players who can maintain clean racing lines. Roisin's One More Freckle reduces Strike's Entropy cost and allows it to chain continuously, turning her into a relentless close-range threat. Only a handful of characters were accessible in the arcade build, but the differences between them were pronounced enough that swapping rosters changed your approach to the same tracks.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The character and world design leans heavily into an anime aesthetic, which sets the tone for Screamer's hero shooter-esque vibe. Screamer's opening cutscene uses fully animated, cel-shaded sequences to introduce its tournament cast — veterans and newcomers assembling for the Screamer Tournament, run by a figure named Gage who installs the Echo device on every vehicle. The voice acting, at least in the brief cinematic that played before the crashes began, is standard English-dubbed anime: serviceable, occasionally cheesy, and tonally consistent with the art style.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Echo system — which in gameplay terms is the Sync-to-Entropy resource loop — is positioned in the lore as the bridge between narrative and mechanics, justifying why these racers can blow each other up. It's an ambitious framework. However, the preview build’s story mode, which includes six episodes of anime-driven narrative with special race rules, functions effectively as a tutorial for Screamer's systems but struggles with pacing and presentation. The dialogue frequently interrupts races mid-action to deliver exposition, and at least from my first impressions during the opening segments, the character writing lacks the personality needed to justify the dramatic framing. It's functional, but the arcade modes remain the stronger draw.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rules of the Road</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Arcade mode, where I spent most of my time for this preview, offers substantially more customization than the genre typically provides. Three preset race types — Free For All (all fifteen racers on the grid), Leaders (just the five team captains), and Members (the ten sidekicks) — each produce distinct competitive dynamics. Free For All is maximum chaos, with fifteen vehicles jostling for position as Strikes and Overdrives erupt across the pack. Leaders is tighter and more personal: a five-racer sprint where every KO matters. Members sits in the middle, offering ten-racer fields with a different tactical flavor, since sidekick abilities tend toward more specialized functions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The custom ruleset editor is the real surprise. You can adjust lap counts up to nine, set competitor numbers up to sixteen, and toggle from a long list of modifiers that reshape the racing experience: deactivate Overdrive entirely for a pure racing mode; disable all fighting mechanics to remove Strikes; toggle off individual character skills; force permanent Overdrive for every racer from the opening lap; adjust passive Sync generation rates; activate Power Shift (where Active Shifting unleashes a massive speed surge); enable Volatile Ecosystem mode where all racers are permanently vulnerable to KOs; or turn on Gage's Finest, which prevents vehicles from losing parts on collision — essentially a no-destruction cosmetic mode. I didn't test every permutation, but the breadth suggests serious potential for community-driven rulesets and custom competitive formats.</p><p>There's also an upshift system: over the course of a race, you manually shift gears to increase your top speed, which layers a progression curve onto each race rather than just the meta-game.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Race adds another layer. Duo and Trio variants allow mixed teams across factions, as long as a Leader is present, and scoring combines final placement points with KO tallies. Smashing your own teammates hurts your combined total, which creates an interesting wrinkle when everyone is fighting for position in the same pack. The map selection across the preview's initial tracks — Port, Downtown Run, Route 1N, Stadium Olympus — offers a strong mix of environments, and I even noticed a fifth map unlock as a reward for playing the mode. Tight urban corridors lined with neon signage give way to wider circuits with sweeping elevation changes, and day versus night settings noticeably affect visibility and atmosphere. Repeated arcade play also unlocked a new character, new music, and cosmetic items, hinting at a progression system that rewards continued engagement — though how deep that progression goes remains an open question.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Waiting for Green</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">After spending a few hours exploring the arcade modes, what emerged is a combat racer with a genuinely clever resource system, meaningful character differentiation, and a custom ruleset editor that could give Screamer real longevity. The Sync-to-Entropy conversion loop forces players to think two steps ahead, spending defensively to build offensively. This tactical layer elevates Screamer's racing above the typical grab-a-pickup-and-fire template. Milestone's expertise in crafting racing games shines through in every drift, boost, and well-timed Strike.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, some big questions remain. It's unclear whether the writing of the much broader campaign arc ultimately does justice to the character-driven structure, whether the pacing between cutscenes and races ends up feeling earned, and whether the campaign's special rules add meaningful variety beyond what exists in the arcade mode. These unanswered questions are central to Screamer's overall appeal, but for now, Screamer's strong racing foundation warrants attention, and I look forward to its upcoming March 26 release on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/screamer-final-preview-turning-every-race-into-a-street-fight]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Soulframe, the upcoming fantasy action RPG by Digital Extremes, has totally overhauled its progression system as part of the latest Preludes alpha update. Whereas before player progress involved a more traditional skilling system, a more intuitive alternative has been integrated.</p>
<p>This comes in the form of the three in-game Virtues - Courage, Spirit, and Grace - which to put simply represent melee, magic, and ranged respectively. Prior to this update, you could invest points into these Virtues to build towards the kind of playstyle you want.</p>
<p>With the latest update, players can instead see their virtues shift automatically with each level up. In addition, they can equip a 'Virtue Prism' to concentrate on a particular direction for their character, which will result in the virtues shifting manually. In addition, a new armour system attaches virtue scaling to equipment, the idea being a full set of melee armour will work better with more Courage, etc.</p>
<p>Alongside these drastic changes to player progression, more customisation options have been added to the game. These include face, hair, and weapon customisation, all of which can be played with via the Verminia in the Nightfold hub. There are also three new weapons to unlock: the Clivers, Basker's Wrest, and Seathorn.</p><p>Finally, there's a new mission type in which you destroy polluting towers dotted across the map. Also,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026"> if you watched the Tennocon trailer last year</a>, you may remember a big bear boss battle! Beating that now unlocks a more challenging open world bear boss that you can take on for tantalising rewards.</p>
<p>When Soulframe will leave this period of Prelude alpha tests remains a mystery, though it's clear the team at Digital Extremes is cramming as many updates to the game as they can before a big launch event, perhaps a smart move <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframes-leads-dont-know-if-itll-survive-the-brutal-live-service-market-so-theyre-betting-big-on-a-community-first-approach">given how treacherous the live service space is</a>. That being said, players have been able to spend some cash early to support development, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-is-getting-founders-packs">Founders packs offering exclusive cosmetics and more</a>.</p>

</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="4db50b949082a"><a title="Mewgenics" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4db50b949082a/mewgenics.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Edmund McMillen</em></figcaption></figure><p>14 years after it was first revealed (yes, <em>14 years</em>), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/binding_of_isaac_afterbirthplus">The Binding of Isaac</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_meat_boy">Super Meat Boy</a> co-creator Edmund McMillen finally launched <strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/">Mewgenics</a></strong> last week. This turn-based tactical roguelike where you breed cats has been a huge hit on Steam, selling over 500,000 copies and taking the crown for the highest concurrent player count for a roguelike of all-time <em>ever</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II.</a></p>
<p>Naturally, desire for a console port has only grown since release, but McMillen has reassured fans on <a href="https://x.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2022933090423968119">social media</a> that the team is "working on" a console release (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-console-release-for-steams-cat-breeding-roguelike-hit-mewgenics-is-currently-in-the-works">Eurogamer</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="8i2vvu-qeBQ" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8i2vvu-qeBQ" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8i2vvu-qeBQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4c3af8sjwvzl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>That surely includes either Switch 1 or Switch 2, and thanks to some digging by <a href="https://nintenduo.com/mewgenics-juego-mejor-valorado-2026-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintenduo</a>, Switch 2 is absolutely in consideration, depending on the publisher.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/comment/o4aw6ju/">r/SteamDeck</a>, McMillen held an AMA right before the game's 10th February release date, and when someone asked about a PlayStation 4 or 5 version, the developer confirmed "we are deciding on a publisher now and defer to them when it comes to what they feel is worth developing for".</p>
<p>But of all the consoles out right now, McMillen thinks that "Switch 2 seems like the front runner right now".</p>

<p>That sounds extremely promising, but as mentioned, it really does depend on who the publisher is and what they recommend. Regardless, it's not going to be a super quick progress, but we hope Mewgenics makes it to one of Nintendo's hybrid consoles.</p>
<p>And we think it's pretty likely given that McMillen's other games are already available on Switch. Mewgenics is currently the highest-rated game of 2026 on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20055/mewgenics">OpenCritic</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/">Metacritic</a>, so getting it on even more eyes feels like a no-brainer.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Will Hand Out Suspensions to Players Who Took “Severe” Advantage of ARC Raiders Coins Duplication Exploit]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-suspend-arc-raiders-players-severe-cases-coins-duplication-exploit/</link>
            <guid>1438363</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Embark Studios</strong> has just <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/an-update-on-recent-exploits-and-corrective-actions">issued a statement</a> regarding a major glitch in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> that players have been exploiting recently, which allowed players to duplicate their <strong>coins</strong>, essentially destroying the in-game economy and allowing players to buy their way back to full strength and then some, if they lost their gear while <strong>Topside</strong>.</p>



<p>Whether the statement will apply to you or not depends on how much you took advantage of the exploit. For "<em>severe cases</em>," the players who took huge advantage of it will be <strong>suspended</strong> from the game. How long those suspensions last is currently unclear, but that is the action Embark will go with if it deems your abuse of the exploit to have "<em>had a significant impact on the in-game economy or other players’ experience</em>."</p>



<p>If you just dabbled with it, then you'll simply be issued a warning. Also, it should go without saying that all players who took advantage of the exploit will have the coins earned through the exploit removed from their accounts.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>Thank you to everyone who sent us reports of the recent duplication exploit, and to everyone who continued playing in good faith while we took the time to properly investigate the issue.<br>Starting this week we will begin issuing enforcement actions to… <a href="https://t.co/VatYFM7ljV">pic.twitter.com/VatYFM7ljV</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2023752363853463637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 17, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>Though these exploits stemmed from a design flaw on our part, the way they were used had a real impact on the game’s economy and the way the community experienced ARC Raiders. It's on us to address that and work to restore balance</em>," writes Embark Studios. "<em>Over the course of this week, we will begin issuing enforcement actions to accounts that we can confirm took advantage of these exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark goes on to explain that it took as long as it did to respond to these exploits because it wanted to do a thorough investigation to not only discover and fix the issue, but to make sure that it fairly addressed the players who abused the exploit without over-punishing those who perhaps used it once or twice.</p>



<p>"<em>We want to act once, with intention, and with confidence that we’re doing the right thing. This is the first time we’ve handled an incident of this nature at such scale in ARC Raiders. Rather than rushing, we chose to take the time needed to fully understand the situation and make sure our response was consistent with our values and expectations.</em>"</p>



<p>Embark continues, "<em>It's our hope that this response provides a platform for future action, and we’ve already improved our detection and tracking, internal review tools, and safeguards to limit the impact of similar exploits.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We take this incident seriously, and we’re approaching it as both a corrective effort and a learning opportunity to strengthen the systems that support fair play.</em>"</p>



<p>So if you had your fun with the exploit, it's clear to say that not only is that done, but Embark has no time for players who look to these exploits. With how well ARC Raiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">continues to sell</a>, these kinds of problems are bound to pop up, and it's good to know for the players who want an even playing field that Embark does not play around with these kinds of problems.</p>

			<p>Although <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2026</strong> has already seen the release of some excellent games, with many more on the way, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> is poised to dominate the gaming year in terms of sales, as the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">double dela</strong>y</a> did not dampen the excitement surrounding the highly anticipated next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The next entry in the popular series is not the only open-world game launching this year, and of them, <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>' <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/crimson-desert-everything-we-know-about-the-new-open-world-fantasy-action-adventure-game/">Crimson Desert</a></em></strong> could be the <strong>Game of the Year</strong> if, by any chance, <strong><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></strong> ends up failing, according to a former <strong>Rockstar Games</strong> animator.</p>



<p><em>"This game, this could be Game of the Year, okay. Mark my words,"</em> former <strong><em>GTA V</em></strong> and <strong><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></strong> animator <strong>Mike York</strong> stated in a recent breakdown of <strong><em>Crimson Desert</em></strong>’s features. <em>"And the reason for that is because of how much you can get lost in this game... it really is a contender when it comes to all the cool stuff all this game kind of has to offer."</em></p>



<p><em>"If GTA VI drops the ball, this could be Game of the Year,"</em> <strong>York</strong> added during the recent analysis. <em>"If GTA VI wasn't here at all this year, this (Crimson Desert) would probably take Game of the Year, from what it looks like."</em></p>



<p>Clearly, there's a lot that is still unknown about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crimson Desert</em></strong>, especially how such a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/"><strong>diverse set of features and mechanics</strong></a> will come together, and if the game's story will be memorable. However, from what has been seen so far, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Mike York</strong> feels <span><strong>cautiously optimistic</strong>&nbsp;about the game, especial</span>ly regarding its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">physics-based interactivity</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">mechanical depth</strong>, with an impressive level of detail in the world-building. Coming from someone with <a href="https://mikeyork.wixsite.com/demo/resume"><strong>an impressive resume</strong></a> who has worked on some of the best games ever, this sounds like some very high praise.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Last June, Jagex - the developers of medieval MMO Runescape - found themselves at odds with players after deciding not to create any new content for Pride Month. Disputed internally at the studio before the discussion then leaked online, the decision appeared to be a retreat in the face of a world turning on minority groups.</p>
<p>Following up in September, Games Industry asked Jagex CEO Jon Bellamy if he stood by the call to simply re-run existing Pride-themed quests and events. "Ultimately, my job is governance and protection as much as anything else, and so sometimes those kinds of harsh decisions have to be made to protect the imminent future of the game," he told them. "If there are tough decisions to be made next year, we'll make them. If the world has changed a bit and the environment is different, we will react accordingly."</p>
<p>Five months on and with this year's Pride Month on the horizon, we've asked if the environment is different.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I must admit there's another reason why I'm asking these questions of Jagex now. When I visited the developer's Cambridge studio last month to hear about their plans for Runescape, its Old School release, and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valheim">Valheim</a>-like spinoff, Runescape: Dragonwilds, I didn't ask about Pride or last year's controversy, focusing instead on its 25th anniversary.</p><p>When I published my article on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-tried-to-fight-for-runescapes-sharksuit-but-jagex-were-having-none-of-it-its-for-the-greater-good">changes Jagex are making to Runescape</a>, I was asked in the comments why there was no reference to the studio's decisions last June. In light of that oversight, I've gone back to ask Jagex's plans for Pride this year and if their decision was influenced by plans to hold in-person events in the US.</p>
<p>You can find the questions I asked and Jagex's answers below. But if you're not familiar with the context, let me give you a rundown of what happened.</p>
<figure>
 



</figure>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.thepinknews.com/2025/06/10/runescape-pride-2025/">PinkNews</a> reported that Jagex's then new CEO, Jon Bellamy, told staff in April they would not be running any Pride Month content in Runescape or Old School Runescape in June, instead focusing more on "what players wanted". The report quotes one staffer saying the decision showed the company was "catering to American conservatism", connecting the announcement to the fact Jagex's new owners, CVC Capital Partners, have a portfolio with many US investments.</p><p>Following Bellamy's initial message and pushback internally, the CEO held a Q&amp;A with the team.“I understand that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a>… is precious because it is a safe space, it is an escape from reality, and the reality that we find ourselves in is changing," Bellamy is quoted as saying. "It is getting stranger, more troubling, less moral, I would argue. Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect."</p>
<p>In response to an open letter from staff, Jagex said they would run pre-programmed Pride content. That June, Jagex reactivated the <a href="https://runescape.wiki/w/Tales_of_Pride">Tales of Pride event</a> in Runescape. First added in 2022 and re-run every Pride Month since, this is a questline that sends players to different people within the world to hear stories about asexual, bisexual, gay, and trans characters who have played a part in Gielinor's world. Completing the quest earns you a set of cosmetics, such as a banner, a shift, and a flower crown.</p>
<p>Separately, the community organised the Community Pride Event within Runescape, something they have been doing since 2020. As in previous years, this began as an in-game parade and ended in an after party. A similar parade was held in Old School Runescape.</p>
<p>In previous years, Jagex have run Pride-themed quests in Old School Runescape. In 2017, there was <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Gilbert%27s_Colours">the Gilbert's Colours event</a>. Then new quests in <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2022_Pride_event">2022</a>, <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2023_Pride_event">2023</a>, and <a href="https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/2024_Pride_event">2024</a>. Unlike Tales of Pride, each quest was unique and provided players newly-created cosmetic items. There wasn't a new quest added in 2025, nor was an old quest reactivated.</p><p>When our colleagues over at <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it-why-jagexs-new-ceo-is-happy-for-it-to-be-the-runescape-company">Games Industry</a> spoke to Bellamy in September, he told them, "I totally sympathise with what's being said. At the top of my totem pole will always be the continuity and operation of our games as apolitically as possible, because ultimately our games offer escapism to many hundreds of thousands of players every day. If that escapism opportunity is compromised, there's a very real risk to the business."</p>
<p>That brings us up to date. And so this is what I asked after posting my article last month.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Last year Jagex paused development of its Pride month content. Pink News reported that Jon Bellamy said Jagex would stop supporting the event to avoid a "backlash" and that "Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be ‘woke’ or representative. The pendulum is swinging back in a way we didn’t expect.” He also is reported as saying that “The content.. is now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously, risk that I’m personally responsible to protect against.” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Is that an accurate account of what he told staff? </strong></p>
<p>This was part of a broader discussion about a rapidly changing global environment and Jagex’s responsibility to protect the long-term health of the game and safeguarding the studio and staff.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be supporting Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>Will Jagex be developing any new content for Pride in 2026?</strong></p>
<p>The Tales of Pride seasonal quest will reactivate in game and we will continue to support community-led Pride activity in-game. In addition, the studio will continue to offer events and support as part of local celebrations around Pride.</p>
<p><strong>What pressure was Jagex feeling that it needed to stop supporting Pride? Or, if it wasn't feeling pressure, why did it volunteer to stop supporting an event that celebrates a minority group?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>What message does it send that Jagex wasn't willing to withstand the fear of a backlash for supporting a Pride event in-game? </strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p>
<p><strong>In my discussion with Ryan Philpott, he said "Some of the changes we're going to make might make some of our current players less than happy, but it's for the greater good of the game long term." Is cutting Pride an example of this?</strong></p>
<p>No – given nothing has been “cut” from the game in terms of inclusive representation or existing Pride-related content.</p>
<p><strong>Jagex is running an event in the US this year. Would Jagex be able to run Pride events in RuneScape and host an in-person event in the US, or does one preclude the other?</strong></p>
<p>The two are unrelated. In-person events are about celebrating our community and engagement; in-game content decisions are about what fits the world and how we develop it.</p>
<p><strong>In his opening speech at the event, Jon highlighted the success and growth RuneScape is enjoying. Would that growth and success not have been possible if the developer supported Pride?</strong></p>
<p>We have not stopped supporting Pride and we will continue to celebrate Pride this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>As in 2025, then, Jagex will be running the Tales of Pride event in Runescape. They will also support community run events in Runescape and Old School Runescape. However, and I've been back to confirm this, they will not be creating any additional quest content for Pride Month in 2026.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows">Resident Evil</a> franchise is the <em>bad </em>kind of nightmare when it comes to adaptations. The movie series kickstarted by Paul W.S. Anderson back in 2002 found tonnes of success, but it's hard to suggest it was quality blockbuster filmmaking. Then came an <em>even worse </em>(despite all the reverence for the source material) movie in 2021, that failed to create a new continuity. And let's not talk about Netflix's 2022 series... Now, in 2026, we're waiting to see whether <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-snapped-up-by-sony-and-it-already-has-a-release-date">Barbarian and Weapons director Zach Cregger can right this ship</a>.</p>
<p>Alongside Sinners, it's safe to say Weapons was one of 2025's biggest and most celebrated horror movies, mixing refreshing thrills, raw horror, unexpected comedy and wild twists in a way we rarely see these days. By all accounts, Cregger <em>should </em>have the sauce to make a very fun Resident Evil movie even if he chooses to completely step away from what's been done before in movies and video games. (And it sounds like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-resident-evil-film-lives-in-the-world-of-re2-and-re3-but-with-the-tone-of-4">he's doing exactly that</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, during a <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/oliver-berben-constantin-film-resident-evil-berlin-efm-1236718667/">chat with Deadline</a> (hat tip to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/weapons-director-had-carte-blanche-to-do-whatever-he-wanted-with-resident-evil-movie-reboot-studio-ceo-says/">VGC</a>), Constantin Film CEO Oliver Berben, who stepped into the role nearly two years ago, elaborated on how the team is approaching this new attempt at 'cracking the code' of the enduring horror franchise. First, he doubled down on the idea that it's "far away from everything that is connected to Resident Evil, only because Zach Cregger has his own style".</p>
<p>Like horror aficionados who have been keeping track and loving the last few years' best flicks in the space, Berben is also of the opinion the genre needs voices willing to take a handful of risks with every project. Of course, Cregger's body of work in the genre so far perfectly embodies that spirit, so it was "a no-brainer" to give him "the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted to do with that IP".</p><p>"With Resident Evil, we have had an incredible journey with one of the most successful international IPs of more than a billion dollars in box office for many years and now we are creating something new, not just a new story idea, but to allow a new generation to take the IP into their own hands and form something different," Berben added.</p>
<p>The next Resident Evil movie, which doesn't have an official title yet, was also co-written by Cregger alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">John Wick</a> veteran Shay Hatten. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-film-will-rip-director-says-as-plot-spoilers-leak">stars Austin Abrams (who already was a fan-favourite in Weapons)</a>, Paul Walter Hauser, Zach Cherry, and Kali Reis, among others. It's set to be distributed theatrically by Sony Pictures and will invade cinemas on September 18, 2026.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> is a pretty sweet co-op game full of surprises. It also has one of the best original soundtracks of 2025, and that includes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3531720/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN_The_Forsaken_Hollows/">Forsaken Hollows</a> DLC. Sadly, we were barred from putting together the ultimate FromSoftware-made Soulslike playlist until the expansion's music was made officially available. Now, the wait is finally over.</p>
<p>On 16th February, the <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/2023396957709058235?s=20">Elden Ring social media channels</a> announced The Forsaken Hollows' unique tracks were free and out in the wild after a longer-than-desirable wait. It's no secret one of the most celebrated aspects of FromSoftware's output is the amazing compositions that accompany every banger, and Shoi Miyazawa's work on the DLC deserved to be fully released too.</p>
<p>You can find all the available options to listen to the full soundtrack <a href="https://lnk.to/vfQOnLvR">here</a>; Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, Line Music, and more are included, so co-publisher Bandai Namco and developer FromSoftware went big with the release once again. The full album runs slightly over 44 minutes versus Nightreign's 2 hours and 24 minutes, fitting the DLC's size when compared to the full base game.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-composer-on-marilyn-manson-myst-and-more-ign-first">IGN interviewed Miyazawa</a> about his work on Nightreign and experience working for FromSoftware. He admitted he was an Armored Core fan first and foremost, well before joining the studio's efforts, and said King Crimson and Marilyn Manson are some of his key musical influences. For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> and Nightreign, however, the vibes were understandably more dark fantasy-like, and most players would agree he's created legendary soundtracks for these games alongside the other credited composers. Let's hope this isn't his last rodeo in the Lands Between.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Screamer Preview – How Milestone built their arcade racer for combat]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/17/screamer-preview-how-milestone-built-their-arcade-racer-for-combat/</link>
            <guid>1438315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You probably know Milestone best for their long lineup of motorcycle racing games, from MotoGP through Ride and on to Motocross, but that’s not where the studio started. No, the studio’s big break came in 1995 with the arcade-style racing game Screamer, which went toe-to-toe with Ridge Racer as a PC alternative. Over a trio of games in the 90s, the series drifted towards more rally racing, before petering out at another studio, but now in 2026? Screamer’s back, and it’s a refreshing new take on the arcade street racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="SCREAMER - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mm2ljVET8A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The immediate and most obvious shift from the 90s is that the graphics are so very different. Obviously, they are massively higher fidelity, there’s none of the early 3D polygon wibble, and the gameplay is built around more nuanced physics and handling models… but the art direction has shifted towards anime cutscenes, and there’s a drama-filled story to sink into alongside.</p>


<p>Michele Caletti Creative and Development Director discussed the game’s blend of visual styles: “We took inspiration from things like Akira, from Ghost in the Shell, from Bubblegum Crisis, from Cyber City Oedo, from Cowboy Bebop, and many more, but one of the things that we had to take a very strong decision was not to make the game cel shaded.</p>
<p>It would have been the easy choice –  It’s an anime, so you make the game cel shaded – but if you do so, you have to oversimplify some details, you cannot go into fine details with cel shading. So the art direction was bold enough to try to blend the anime and the realistic or quite realistic rendition of the world. And then take some other moves like that there’s not onlythe city setting, there are many other settings that try to portray a different but familiar world.”</p>

<div id="attachment_469002"><p id="caption-attachment-469002">You know it’s anime sci-fi when you have a dog that can drive a car.</p></div>
<p>The Tournament is a long-running illegal street racing competition, but this latest edition is for a huge $1 billion prize, drawing in teams from all kinds of backgrounds. For the Banshee PMC, Hiroshi, Roisin and Frederick are looking for revenge on Anaconda Corp and their distinctly fascist-coded leader, Gabriel. The best way to get close is to enter the same tournament, with the possibility that Gabriel’s demise could be made to look like an accident… But it’s also a story that won’t take itself too seriously. I mean, there’s a dog that can drive a car, and whose owner has fitted it with the same universal translator that everyone else uses to communicate using their native tongues – “This is another choice that we made early,” Michele said, “because we wanted to have cultural melting pot of different characters, of different ethnicities and this was important to convey the fact that in this near future the culture is something like what we have today, but even more diverse, even more varied.”</p>
<p>They won’t be the only team that you race as, though, with five teams competing and the story hopping back and forth, putting you in control of various racers, cars and their specific abilities. Even in the opening few story chapters, there’s races where you just need to finish, where you’re driving as a team, where you’re regularly jumping via cutscenes between different cars.</p>
<p>“We wanted to go away from the pure racing focus and jargon and dialogue and always thinking, always about [winning].” Michele explained. “So you see the characters are not even dressed like drivers, because they are something else, then they are drivers. So their goal is to win, yes, but everyone has also another goal. So you will see that during the story, they’re focus shifts towards their inner goal. Then you’ll be playing in the role of all the characters of the game. So everyone has the goal to be first, yes, but from different perspectives.”</p>
<p>What’s particularly striking about the racing is how it reimagines the controls. The right and left trigger make you go and stop, of course, and the left stick is for turning, but drifting is on the right stick, you have a timing minigame for upshifts to give you boost charges, and those feed into a bull-rushing attack to destroy other competitor cars.</p>

<p>It’s quite a lot to get a handle on, and the way you can counter-steer while drifting felt a bit like rubbing my head and patting my tummy at the same time, so it makes sense that the story mode adds these concepts one at a time. When you wrap that around the mix of lavishly produced anime cutscenes and the character portrait dialogue scenes, though, that does lead to a pretty slow feeling rollout over the course of the opening hour or two. I was really waiting for it to give me all of the gadgets and toys to play with.</p>
<p>Michele admitted “The story takes you that slowly, yeah. It takes hours to get to all the mechanics in place, and the point is, you’re never thrown multiple things together to you.”</p>
<p>He continued, “We thought and we discussed a lot about how to lay out the default controls, how to favour the most intricate actions, because you might want to do strange stuff and we want to allow you to do so. I think we’ve reached the balance where it’s not overwhelming. Give yourself some time to get into the mechanics and it’s not about much about the fingers, but the strategy in order to understand and being in control of when to do things, not to overuse the systems.”</p>

<p>The macguffin that makes all of this possible is the ECHO, a device fitted to each and every car like a super sci-fi MGU-K from Formula 1. Fitted by Gage on behalf of the tournament’s enigmatic host Mr. A, it gradually accumulates Sync, both passively over time and when tapping the Active Shift to shift up a gear in time with the rev limiter –&nbsp;don’t worry, it’s still an arcade game and you won’t be asked to downshift at all. This builds up to grant you boost charges, which you can then deploy, and even strengthen by holding and releasing with another mini timing challenge.</p>
<p>As you Boost, this takes that energy and transfers it over to the second meter of the ECHO device, building up Entropy. This gives you charges to use defensively, to create a temporary shield for a few moments, or to unleash as a Strike, boosting forward again and destroying any car that you hit from behind. Save up the Entropy to fill out the meter, and you can enter into Overdrive, putting you in a much longer-lasting Strike boost that can blast multiple rivals into smithereens, and eventually leaves you vulnerable to destruction just from hitting a wall. You can technically outlast the Overdrive, but I would explode my car every time…</p>
<p>That’s where the ECHO’s final trick comes in, as destruction just respawns your car and body, and gets you racing again. There’s no moral quandary over whether or not this new car and person is the same as the one that died – Milestone seem to be leaving that philosophical debate to the Ship of Theseus and the Star Trek teleporter – and instead it’s just a canny way of keeping the action rampaging along.</p>
<p>“We didn’t want to have this pattern of side-striking the cars,” Michele said. “We tried different things like because the hot part is that it’s easy to strike on a straight, it’s harder to strike into a corner, so the more the intricate the trucks, the more it’s complicated to strike. But we experimented with many things like a semi-automatic strike that drives you toward your opponent, but it didn’t work. We tried something like a seeking missile, but it didn’t work. So we ended up with this where you’re still in control, so you if you hit, you feel like you’ve done it. If you miss, you understand what you have done wrong.”</p>

<p>It all blends into a rather unique take on the arcade racer. Combat is direct and to the point, with just the Strike as your only option for attack – no side-swiping and no missiles or energy abilities like in Wipeout or Blur – and there’s a technical depth to master with the drifting and boost timing, not to mention juggling energy.</p>
<p>In one race, I was able to break away in the lead, conserving my boosts in a way that meant I couldn’t be caught, but it felt much more likely to be caught in the middle of the pack and really have to scrap and fight. That ties in very well with the team race mode, with duos or trios battling for victory. This isn’t about the first across the line, and it’s not even just the combined finishing positions that determine the winning team, as every KO also awards points, so that the highest-placed racer might have finished eighth and outscore the winner that didn’t have a single KO to their name.</p>
<p>After adapting to its style of racing, Screamer really started to speak to me. I’m definitely curious to see how the game will blend together its anime narrative and single-player racing scenarios, but that combination of racing and combat? Well, it makes perfect sense for anyone who watched the F1 movie.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the surface,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans" rel="nofollow"><em>Relooted</em> first appeared to be a very intriguing game</a> to be introduced to the industry, solely based on its overarching narrative. Since its reveal during the Day of the Devs showcase last year, there have been increased yet negative conversations regarding the controversial subject matter of cultural repatriation, rooted in misinformation and racism.</p><p>As such, one was quite cautious, maybe concerned about how nuanced developer Nyamakop will present its story and how it approached tackling this conversation, one that is still ongoing today.&nbsp;After hours of playtime,&nbsp;what&nbsp;it&nbsp;did was leave&nbsp;one feeling frustrated while raising some important questions regarding preservation and the future of modern museums&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;African art repatriation.</p><h2>Pulling Off Africa's Biggest Heist Of The Century</h2><picture>

  </picture><p>Nyamakop's 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, is set in a semi-futuristic&nbsp;city&nbsp;of Johannesburg, South Africa, where&nbsp;we find&nbsp;the game's protagonist, Nomali,&nbsp;embarking&nbsp;on a&nbsp;dangerous mission to rescue her younger brother, Trevor.&nbsp;What follows is Nomali being convinced by her art historian grandmother,&nbsp;Professor Grace,&nbsp;to form a ragtag group of vigilante thieves in a high-stakes mission to reclaim stolen artifacts from the African continent and beyond in an effort to return them home.</p><p>Within the context of&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em> in&nbsp;the 21st century, the Transatlantic Returns Treaty has been&nbsp;put into power, operating as an intermediary body to ensure that African artifacts&nbsp;will be&nbsp;safely returned to their place of origin.&nbsp;As expected, there is one major caveat, largely due to some interesting phrasing, that this is only applicable to cultural artifacts that are being publicly displayed in museums globally.</p><p>As such, some Western museums have opted to quietly remove the artifacts in question and place them in secure vaults,&nbsp;while&nbsp;private collectors have&nbsp;continued&nbsp;to keep theirs behind locked doors in&nbsp;private&nbsp;collections.&nbsp;Sure, those museums aren't committing anything illegal, but morally, it's quite a heinous thing to do if one isn't planning on returning them.</p><p>This is where Nomali, Trevor, and their team come&nbsp;into play, as they've been tasked&nbsp;to&nbsp;"bypass" the&nbsp;Transatlantic Returns Treaty by acting outside the law and reclaiming those artifacts.&nbsp;From the many great heist films,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Italian Job</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Ocean's trilogy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Inception</em> as examples, planning a heist&nbsp;looks&nbsp;almost&nbsp;near&nbsp;effortless with careful planning, reconnaissance work, and exceptional&nbsp;team building by using&nbsp;every member's strengths to their advantage.</p><p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, the&nbsp;team Nomali builds&nbsp;are not hardened criminals nor have criminal backgrounds, but are skilled in their respective areas of expertise, which adds a shade of unpredictability that gives&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em> that&nbsp;thrilling charm.&nbsp;As the game progressed, more members were added, but with these additions came a greater risk of carelessness, overexposure, and&nbsp;failure that jeopardized their plans, team morale, and overall mission of returning priceless cultural artifacts to their native homelands.</p><h2>Reclaiming Africa's Cultural History</h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Relooted</em> looks and plays like a well-designed side-scrolling platforming game, but due to the immense amount of research into the game's development lies a game with plenty of heart, soul, and reverence. Relooted features 70 cultural artifacts from the African continent and a few from other cultures outside Africa.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144812/relooted-is-a-stylish-and-topical-heist-game-about-doing-crime-for-the-right-reasons" rel="nofollow">a Shacknews interview with Nyamakop's Creative Director Ben Myers</a>, the team employed full-time researchers who assisted and advised the development team with deciding which historical and cultural artifacts would be included in-game. <em>"Not a lot of people realize the scale of African artifacts that aren't in Africa,"</em> and as such, for the developers, <em>"a lot of the research was finding the most interesting stories, trying to find artifacts that had huge cultural [or] spiritual importance to the people they were taken from."</em></p><p>Within the context of <em>Relooted</em>, Nomali's art historian grandmother mentions that any and all African artifacts that are returned under the&nbsp;Transatlantic Returns Treaty are granted once a deal is brokered. However, much like in real life, where certain bodies and countries just outright decline to return these historical and cultural African artifacts back to their place of origin, the same situation is being played out in-game.</p><p>It has been publicly documented within the media over the last few decades that many African countries have pleaded with museums, private bodies, and organizations to return stolen artifacts to Africa. An example was 39 pieces that were returned to the Ugandan government by the University of Cambridge in 2024; however, the condition was that they were loaned back to the government for a three-year period, which can be extended,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/africa-stolen-artifacts-colonial-deaccessioning-repatriation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to a news report from CBS News</a>.</p><p>Similarly, Germany has promised to return 1,130 artifacts to Nigeria in 2022, with 22 Benin Bronzes already back in the country, based on&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-germany-berlin-13e1a65da1b08644d3c5d5032d24e426" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reporting from the Associated Press</a>. Sadly, not all requests have been approved, as in 2018, <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2018/01/12/pariss-dapper-foundation-stalls-talks-over-cameroonian-sculpture" rel="nofollow">the Dapper Foundation has stalled talks to return the&nbsp;Bangwa Queen</a>, which is featured in&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, and is still being held in France despite requests for it to be returned to Cameroon.</p><p>These cultural pieces still hold great religious significance in their respective countries in today's modern times, yet despite being looted as rewards for the violence invoked across the continent, the request for them to be returned is being denied on the basis that they best belong in the gilded halls of museums around the world. <em>Relooted</em> greatly emphasizes the need for increased dialogue surrounding cultural repatriation by placing&nbsp;a lot of care, dedication, and great detail into highlighting and restoring the historical significance of these artifacts.</p><p>Not only are the artifacts intricately recreated by talented 3D artists, but each artifact has well-researched descriptions and is accurately pronounced in the dialogue. <em>"And then we also had a woman who produced our pronunciation guide to make sure the way the artifacts and ethnicities are pronounced is correct and accurate, too,”</em> Myers explained in the&nbsp;Shacknews interview.</p><h2>Error Controls In The Planning Phase</h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Relooted</em> has many tremendous components to love and appreciate, especially given the great level of detail that went into the research and development of the game. While <em>Relooted</em> offers a new, fresh, and nuanced experience that one has never seen in the industry to date, the game is held back by some technical and creative issues that were annoying or confusing at times.</p><p>A combination of controller issues, gameplay bugs relating to the parkour movement and wall-jumping, and game crashes were the most prevalent technical issues that had one forcibly close the game before relaunching. Sadly, this meant having to backtrack on progress, as the auto-save feature didn't kick in to advance the game and its narrative.</p><p>Dealing with controller issues was annoying at times, as some incidents were isolated from other issues. However, it becomes&nbsp;frustrating when it snowballs&nbsp;with other problems, resulting in lost gameplay time and important saved progress if the auto-save wasn't triggered.</p><p>The game's platforming was quite an arduous experience, especially in certain locations like the House of Horrors and the Shiny Place heist locations, as timed jumps and speed boosts felt like they were on a delay or couldn't clear gaps with free-running and jumping distance. There were some hilarious ones to boot, like during the Maiden Voyage training session, where, during the Ndedi training session, smashing into a window left one in a glitched state and suspended mid-air, which surely was added to the <strong>"Funny Screenshot Moments"</strong> folder.</p><p>As an addendum, one noticed the disconnect between the planning phase and the heist itself, as many of the questions raised and inquiries asked didn't correspond to the plans that eventually unfolded in the subsequent heist mission, other than finding the artifacts and marking a path to the exit. It is certain that some technical issues are likely to be patched in the coming weeks; what could be slightly improved on is the disjointed character interactions and dialogue options during gameplay.</p><p>Some of the performances didn't feel compelling enough to care about certain characters, and there wasn't enough natural or organic chemistry where actors would play off of each other. This wasn't the case in a handful of the cutscenes, naturally, as the interactions were more convincing and well-performed, but the gameplay performances left more to be desired, which is not the fault of the actors but possibly the voice direction that was given.</p><h2><em>Relooted</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relooted_review_screenshot-1281-nomali_scouting_nyamakop.jpg?itok=fSC7CXxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1408" height="792">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relooted_review_screenshot-1281-nomali_scouting_nyamakop.jpg?itok=ElpJjFRt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Undoubtedly, <em>Relooted</em> is a game unlike anything we've seen in today's gaming landscape, which is certainly needed. As a heist sidescrolling platformer, it checks most of the boxes, providing a decent platforming experience, albeit with some technical issues hindering it.</p><p>Where it shines the brightest is that it serves as a historical reminder of the continual aftermath of colonialism by illustrating the broad scale of the violent plundering of cultural artifacts by its oppressors. While some have made their way back home, there are still thousands of artifacts that are being withheld by museums, private collections, and other institutions.</p><p>In the end, the game recontextualizes the "treasure hunter" trope we see all too often by giving us, the players, the power to do the right thing in reclaiming artifacts and returning them home. This may be some kind of dream come true, but maybe, just maybe, getting to make history by writing a new chapter illustrating that taking back what belongs to them is the right and honorable thing to do.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Relooted</strong> was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/relooted-review-restoring-pride-ownership-to-african-art-history]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I wake up at 3AM. Do 50 pull-ups on a halberd wedged in the door frame. Do 50 push-ups on the cold stone floor. A servant hands me my protein mead and a wine frappamachiato. I violently double fist the two beverages. I don't eat breakfast, because food that isn't flavourless cup gruel is the enemy of productivity. Then, I'm dressed in my robes for the commute to the throne room. The magic starts. It's 5AM in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and I'm on my medieval monarch grindset.</p>
<p>I pull out Paradox's <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-192-spring-cleaning.1902372/">latest dev diary</a>. Oh, look at that, they're working with a mystery modder on bringing exactly the sort of big number tables to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> that I need to tell at a glance whether I'm out-grinding my inbred wealth-creating cousins who rule other nations across the world.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These big number tables are dubbed The Ledger, and once added to CK3 as part of the game's next major update, they'll give you a big spreadsheet to delve into if you're keen to look up certain aspects of your kingverse. For example, you can quickly check which ruler across the world has the most gold without having to click on them all, or see which of the current crop of wars has been running the longest.</p>
<p>Handy, and according to Paradox design manager Riad Deneche it's the product of some direct collaboration between the studio and a mystery modder whose identity will be revealed in a future dev blog. "Much of their work had already inspired us internally and influenced changes we’d made to the game," the developer wrote. "When I reached out, instead of assigning a predefined task, I asked a simple question: what would you like to work on? They came back with a list so large it genuinely shocked the team. Some of it overlapped with things already in our pipeline, but a lot of it made us collectively ask, 'How did we not think of this?'"</p><p>The Ledger was one of those ideas, and the initial version of it's set to include tabs covering characters, artifacts, ongoing Wars, and houses. All things you might want to sort through, compare or just check up on if you're loading up a save you've put a lot of hours into for the first time in a while. I can't say I've been playing CK3 long enough to have any properly ancient games to return to, but even a couple of weeks gap between checking on my weird Scottish co-monarchy can leave me struggling to remember off the top of my head what's going on.</p>
<p>The likes of counties, titles, holdings, faiths and cultures are also being considered for tabs of their own, and Deneche points out that modders will likely come up with ones the developers don't think to add. Quite frankly, I'll be happy if I can sort monarchs by their percentage of inbredness or courtiers by how much they hate me.</p>
<p>The update that'll bring the ledger and a number of other quality-of-life additions/fixes is currently slated to arrive at the start of Q2, which if my understanding of corporatese is right will put it around the beginning of April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Two of the biggest, most popular and most utterly enormous RPGs of the recent era are coming to Xbox Game Pass in the next few weeks. First, on February 19, the Complete Edition of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> arrives on Microsoft’s gaming subscription platform, followed by&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> on March 3. And that’s alongside a bunch of other games of note.</p> <p>February has already seen the arrival of a preview build of RTS <em>Menace&nbsp;</em>and the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Diablo II: Resurrected&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em> to Game Pass, which is hard to sniff at (until you remember that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">Microsoft increased the price</a> of the subscription from $20 to $30 a month last year). But the second half of the month is much more busy, starting today with the addition of&nbsp;<em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-avatar-game-is-so-much-better-than-fire-and-ash-2000659445">surprisingly great</a>&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>. Additionally, Obsidian’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">wonderful RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is brought down from Ultimate to Premium, to let more people in.</p>

 <p>Coming up in a couple of days is&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a deckbuilder that was already on PC Game Pass and is now spreading its spiritual wings to console, joined by last July’s <em>EA Sports College Football 26.</em> And then there’s the rather large matter of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>‘s return to Game Pass after leaving way back in 2021. This time the CD Projekt RPG is in its updated Complete Edition form. (It’s worth noting you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/124923/">can grab the same from Steam</a> for just $10 right now.)</p> <p>Another game preview arrives Feb 24 with&nbsp;<em>TCG Card Shop Simulator</em>, which hopefully won’t include regular break-ins from which to recover. The next day, PC Game Pass gets dice-rolling roguelike <em>Dice a Million</em>, and the day after that, on Feb. 26, action-RPG <em>Towerborne</em> comes out of early access as a fully finished release.</p>

 <p>Jump to March 3 (presumably February is just too short of a month to cram it all in) and two more big names get squished in. First is <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, and then the headliner, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Last year’s action-RPG from Warhorse was a smash hit, and despite the company’s CEO and director Daniel Vavra having been <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-e3-meeting-with-a-pro-gamergate-developer-1715511964">a consistently destructive</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-keep-having-the-same-video-game-arguments-and-its-dr-1841027051">voice</a> in the industry, the game somehow managed to piss off all the worst people for its more progressive values. Hooray!</p>

 <p>Anyway, if&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> and&nbsp;<em>KCDII</em> aren’t enough to keep you busy on top of <em>High on Life 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Avatar</em>, I dunno how to help you.</p>

<p>The Pokémon franchise is set for arguably the biggest year ever, with the 30th anniversary celebrations coming alongside major releases, significant changes to the competitive scene, and there’s likely to be even more on the horizon.</p>



<p>After the success of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a/" id="2273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> last year, a boom in the TCG hobby, and two releases already confirmed for the year ahead with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-champions/" id="2457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Champions</a>, 2026 is set to be a big one, and Pokémon EUIC displayed the very best that the franchise has to offer.</p>



<p>Across four action-packed days in London for Pokémon EUIC, here are the main takeaways I learned from the event.</p>







<h3 id="h-pokemon-s-growth-shows-no-signs-of-stopping">Pokémon’s Growth Shows No Signs of Stopping</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The boom continues. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon’s boom in the past decade, following the release of Pokémon Go, has been well-documented, and excitement for the franchise has reached fever-pitch levels heading into the 30th anniversary. However, it’s clear that this isn’t the height of the peak.</p>



<p>The attendance at Pokémon EUIC was over 17,000, including over 7,000 competitors, numbers that dwarf the Pokémon World Championships attendance from London 2022. Around a third of ExCel London was taken over by Pokémon, and there’s still plenty of room to grow.</p>



<p>With the VGC format moving to Pokémon Champions, lowering the barrier of entry as the title will also be available on mobile devices, and the Pokémon games venturing into new genres, Pikachu and the gang are here to stay.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokopia-could-be-the-next-pokemon-go-like-hit">Pokopia Could Be The Next Pokémon Go-Like Hit</h3>



<p>The release of Pokopia is now just a few weeks away, and the latest entry in the Pokémon franchise blew me away in my <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/" id="176556" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview</a>, showing it can have the same sort of momentum that Pokémon Go did a decade ago.</p>



<p>Pokémon Go was a title that spread like wildfire across the world, bringing new fans into the Pokémon franchise, and Pokopia has the ability to do the same. With an Animal Crossing-like approach and a clear cozy vibe, new gamers could be attracted, and diehard fans will also be thrilled with the experience.</p>



<p>The Pokémon Company has not been afraid to venture into new genres and try out new things in recent years, and fans can reap the benefits.</p>



<h3 id="h-lego-pokemon-sets-are-incredible">LEGO Pokémon Sets Are Incredible</h3>



<p>Ever since the first reveal of the debut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-scavenger-hunt-codes/" id="169235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> sets, it was clear that they were going to make waves, but having now seen the sets in person, they completely blew my socks off.</p>



<p>There are no stickers on the sets, with the eyes and any other accents all printed directly to the bricks, showing a more premium approach to the set. Of course, with the high prices of LEGO, fans will expect the very best, and this is exactly what they are getting.</p>



<p>It’s not long now until the LEGO Pokémon sets will arrive in the hands of fans worldwide, and I can’t wait to see what other sets are on the horizon this year.</p>



<h3 id="h-competitive-pokemon-is-much-tougher-than-i-imagined">Competitive Pokémon is Much Tougher Than I Imagined</h3>



<p>I’ve always been more of a collector in the world of Pokémon, both in the games, hunting down everything needed to fill out my Pokédex and in the world of the TCG, and I truly had no idea just how tough the competitive scene truly is.</p>



<p>The tactical approaches in the VGC scene were far beyond what I could envision, with competitors always trying to be two steps ahead, and my head was spinning with the knowledge those in the TCG had. Add in the quick reactions of those playing UNITE and Go, and it was incredible to witness.</p>



<p>Esports continues to grow and will have greater prominence in the years to come, and Pokémon will certainly have a big part to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-world-championships-is-a-bucket-list-addition">Pokémon World Championships Is A Bucket List Addition</h3>



<p>The one major thought that stuck with me throughout the weekend at EUIC and since I returned home is that I need to attend a World Championship, and I’ve got my eyes on San Francisco in August.</p>



<p>I loved every single second of Pokémon EUIC, and attending such a huge event has immediately led to attending Worlds jumping into my bucket list.</p>



<p>I highly recommend that any Pokémon fan look to attend one of the major events, and to keep an eye out for Pokémon Play! Schedules, to meet other members of the community and have an experience you’ll remember for the rest of your lives.</p>







<p>There’s no denying there’s a lot of negativity often spread around Pokémon, particularly on the TCG side of things, and the difficulty getting your hands on sealed product, but there was zero sign of this at EUIC.</p>



<p>Instead, the weekend was filled with moments that show the very best of the Pokémon community. One parent of a competitor in the Junior TCG category told me about how other parents rallied to help create a replacement deck after an initial one was lost, ensuring they wouldn’t have to exit the tournament. While the original deck was found, the new deck, including cards from a variety of languages, showed the very best of the community.</p>



<p>Throughout the entire event, everyone I spoke to was welcoming, there was absolutely no gatekeeping, and every attendee was there to share their love of the Pokémon franchise.</p>
