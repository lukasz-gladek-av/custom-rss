            <p><em>Hello! Eurogamer is once again marking Pride with a week of features celebrating the intersection of queer culture and gaming in all its guises. Things get underway today as James Croft ponders the particular magic of LGBTQIA+ gaming groups.</em>
</p>
<p>Reh is slaughtering Cabal as he battles Destiny 2's Emperor Calus in the heart of the Leviathan. He's throwing grenades at packs of space dogs, headshotting Psions, and double-jumping over flames as his fireteam attempt the tricky shadow realm raid once more. Calus' health is low, and the tension mounts - if they pull this off they'll finally defeat this fiendish boss, otherwise it'll be back to the start yet again. But their rockets fly true, their supers crash into his mechanical body, and - at last! - Calus is felled. But Reh's elation is short-lived. "Wow," says a fireteam member over comms. "I can't believe my first clear was with a faggot."</p>
<p>That was the last straw for Reh. Sick of the homophobic commentary and eager to find a place he would be accepted, Reh took to Facebook - ISO queer Destiny clan! - where he discovered Guardians of the Rainbows, a group founded by two gay men in 2016. He's been involved ever since, graduating to admin and de-facto clan leader. To Reh and many more of its members, Guardians of the Rainbows - which has grown into a thriving international community over the years - is a haven, a safe space away from the toxicity of gaming. But more than that, it's a place of queer joy, and even the source of some of its members' deepest friendships.</p>
<p>I can relate. In December 2022, after 15 years in the US, I returned home to the UK and moved to Brighton on the south coast. I was new to the city, so I did what I've done before when I wanted to meet new people: I found a local gaming store and played Magic: the Gathering. By pure chance, I sat down with Louie who, just after the Covid lockdown, had brought together a few MtG friends he'd met in person and on Grindr (they literally shared deck pics) to create a regular cadre of LGBTQIA+ players. That informal cluster has grown into the group that now calls itself Tragic: the Gathering - and its members have swiftly become some of my closest friends.</p>
<div data-domain="www.youtube-nocookie.com"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/A8Jeyfyk4Ck?si=ReXG5q1E89FWrg2n" frameborder="0" height="315" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p></div>
<p>Louie admits he was initially worried how the group would interact outside the boundaries of the game. "If we're not playing together," he recalls wondering, "do we actually get on?" But we've started to see each other more and more outside our Magic-time, going to the movies, meeting up at the pub, even visiting an improvised Dungeons &amp; Dragons show at the Brighton Fringe together. We've become a community, and it's made me wonder about the relationships that LGBTQIA+ gaming groups tend to foster: why is it that I feel so close to these people even though I've known them for such a short time? What makes these groups feel like home - like family - for so many of their members?</p>
<p>ManicPixyGirl joined Guardians of the Rainbows for much the same reason as Reh. She's trans, and frequently faced harassment and toxicity while playing first-person shooters online. "If I'm playing with random people I generally will keep myself muted to avoid experiencing misogyny or transphobia," she tells me. In Guardians, by contrast, she knows that if anyone says anything out of line, others will call it out. Everyone works to make the space safe for queer people of all types, and it makes all the difference. "I feel safer talking on comms," she says.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>James, who regularly plays Overwatch with a group of gay friends, agrees. "Gaming with LGBTQ people feels safer", he says. "There's a lot of hate online - you still get people who say derogatory things." But as a group, it's easier for James' team to confront the homophobia they sometimes face. And although everyone I spoke to had experienced queerphobic harassment while gaming, James says he's noticed allies are increasingly speaking up."You do get quite a lot of people who are supportive in the chat", he observes. "We like to help them out, heal them more or protect them." In this way queer gaming groups like James' Overwatch gang and Guardians of the Rainbows can help make gaming feel safer and more welcoming not just for LGBTQIA+ players but to everyone.</p>
<p>But it's not just about safety. "I find in queer spaces in general there's so much joy," ManicPixieGirl tells me. "We're all able to be fully ourselves. I've experienced it going out to gay bars, and I've experienced it in this clan. Everyone is so authentically themselves and it brings this joy out." And for queer nerds, finding a group which affirms both their queer identity <em>and</em> their gamer identity can feel especially powerful.
</p>
<p>
Lee, a member of Tragic: the Gathering and an up-and-coming MtG YouTuber (one of relatively few openly gay creators in the space) put it like this: "Gay and nerd, that's a bit of a double whammy in life - how many more detractions do you need?" But when he plays games with his Tragic friends he gets to share both of these parts of himself. "I feel pure joy [playing with Tragic]", he says, "because they accept my joy around this hobby because they understand it."</p>

</figure>
<p>Perhaps the joyous exuberance that comes from this double blast of affirmation is the reason why these LGBTQIA+ gaming groups can be so good for non-queer people too. Guardians of the Rainbows, while still explicitly a clan for LGBTQIA+ players, has always welcomed straight cis members. "It's good not to segregate ourselves," Reh explains, "because when we play with allies they stand up for us when they come across things that aren't right."</p>
<p>While the majority of Guardians' clan members are part of the LGBTQIA+ community, it's not uncommon for three or four members of a six-strong raiding fireteam to be straight. I asked Reh if he feared this might impact the nature of the clan, but the group is careful to ensure all potential members understand who the clan is for and the queer ethos it promotes. And if you're wondering why a straight person might want to join an LGBTQIA+ clan, the answer, I think, comes back to that queer joy.</p>
<p>I know from personal experience that a queer fireteam is a <em>fun</em> fireteam, and there's a sort of freeness that rubs off. Reh gives an example: there's a notorious jumping section in the Kings Fall raid in Destiny requiring players to leap from platform to platform while avoiding a series of thrusting pistons. Incautious players can get shoved into the abyss by the pounding poles. "They're very phallic", Reh says, "and the straight guys will make jokes about the 'penis wall'. 'You got slapped with a dick!'"</p>
<p>This might seem like typical straight male ribaldry, but I think something deeper is going on here: the exuberant and unapologetic authenticity of LGBTQIA+ people can, in a sense, liberate straight cis people, allowing them to explore aspects of themselves they otherwise find difficult to fit within society's rigid scripts of gender and sexuality. Thus, LGBTQIA+ gaming groups (like all queer groups) can be spaces where everyone - not just queer people - can be a little freer and more honest.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/pride-week-2024-james-croft-agm.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Yes, our Magic: the Gathering group had a genuine AGM. | <span>Image credit: <cite>James Croft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But perhaps even more heartening are the kinds of genuinely deep relationships these groups so often facilitate - with members even becoming chosen families. James' Overwatch team originally formed as a board gaming group, but they wanted to stay in touch during the pandemic - so they picked up Overwatch as a relatively easy game they could all play together online. And they played <em>every day</em>. "It saved my sanity during a lockdown," he admits - and now his team are some of his closest friends. "Gaming together accelerated our closeness."</p>
<p>It's a similar story for Guardians of the Rainbows. Reh tells me a number of clan members have difficult relationships with their birth families, who don't always accept them for being queer - yet they've found a place for themselves by gaming together. And the community built in Destiny 2 is slowly extending beyond it: after some Zoom meetings during the pandemic, a group of Guardians will soon share a cabin in Michigan, meeting for the first time offline. Reh's excited, but nervous: his social anxiety is kicking in. But the clan has helped him with that, too.</p>
<p>The final word, though, must go to my Tragic: the Gathering friend, Lee. "My real family could not understand me at all growing up", he tells me. "I was a weird arty gay kid in a family where no one understood the weird arty gay kid." For him, "it was a lifeline to find groups where people understand what you're talking about. You spend your formative years feeling so deeply alien, then suddenly shared references make you feel like there's a little group of aliens running around together. I don't feel so alone. I've found more solace in these people I've known for two years than my family I've known for 45."</p>
<p>That's a special sort of closeness - the magic created when queer gamers, sharing both a minority identity and a passion, find each other and say "I choose you!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-are-japanese-developers-not-undergoing-mass-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>On 14th June, <a href="https://x.com/KidTak/status/1801460369971679402">Tango Gameworks employees had a pizza party</a>. It was the studio's final day following the announcement of Microsoft's decision to close the studio behind games like Ghostwire Tokyo and the award-winning Hi-Fi Rush, a decision that surprised many across the industry.</p>
<p>The game had been released on platforms beyond Xbox for the first time mere weeks earlier as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-announces-slate-of-four-titles-launching-on-non-xbox-systems">the company's new initiative to bring their titles to more platforms</a>. As the company's only Japanese studio in <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202310/31321751.html">a region of growth for Xbox and Game Pass</a> after decades of struggling to break into the gaming market in the country, the decision also appeared counterintuitive.</p>
<blockquote>If you focused solely on the Japanese industry, you would be forgiven for forgetting the crisis that has subsumed the wider industry</blockquote>
<p>Layoffs and studio closures have been an unfortunately-common occurrence across the industry since last year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">layoffs in 2024 already matching 2023's total of over 10,000 developers</a> being put out of work. Yet if there is one bright spot to find in this bleak reality, it is, ironically, in the same city as the departed Tango. Its closure, undeniably tragic, is an exception in a country seemingly insulated from the industry-wide devastation occurring beyond its borders.</p>
<p>Indeed, if you focused solely on the Japanese industry, you would be forgiven for forgetting the crisis that has subsumed the wider industry.</p>
<p>FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki recently came out to vehemently support his team, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-layoffs-at-fromsoftware-wont-happen-as-long-as-this-company-is-my-responsibility-says-miyazaki">no layoffs planned</a>. Konami have once again been growing their gaming business after making a retreat in the 2010s for the land of pachinko, while Capcom have recently raised wages far above the recent inflation stats of 2.5% by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/capcom-increasing-all-salaries-by-around-5-28-rise-for-new-graduate-hires">increasing base salaries for new employees by 28% starting in fiscal year 2025</a>, one of numerous the company has enacted since 2022.</p>
<p>All this has occurred while increasing employment and development amidst record profits.</p>
<p>And let's not ignore Nintendo, which ever since <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/nintendo-satoru-iwata-pay-cut/">Satoru Iwata's 3DS-era wage cut to avoid cutting staff</a> has enjoyed impressive growth, hiring more employees and <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2023/qa2306e.pdf">increasing base wages</a> to make the company more enticing. <a href="https://biz-journal.jp/company/post_358805.html">The company boasts an impressive employee retention rate of 98.8%</a> with an <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/csr/en/esg_data/index.html?active-topics=topics02">average tenure far above the industry average of 14.3 years</a>.</p>
<p>It's a trend across the industry in the country. In my own conversations with Japanese developers, many have acknowledged the concerns for friends in the industry internationally while admitting a level of confidence and job security that simply no longer exists no matter the company beyond Japanese borders.</p>
<p>It's not that the country is entirely immune from strife – Square Enix recently admitted in a shareholder meeting a new change in strategy to target a wider range of platforms for future releases while <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/square-enix-takes-140-million-hit-on-cancelled-games">canceling some unannounced projects</a>. Even then, these cancellations have not been followed by layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-square-enix-to-lay-off-workers-in-european-and-american-divisions">at least in Japan</a>. On the whole, employment is stable and investment is growing, with everyone from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/shueisha-games-quest-to-become-the-japanese-devolver">larger domestic companies entering publishing in the independent space</a> to companies like NetEase investing and working with industry veterans and even nation states like the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crown-prince-of-saudi-arabias-foundation-now-has-a-96-percent-stake-in-snk">Saudi Investment Funds buying 96% of SNK</a>, all paint a rosier picture than seen elsewhere.</p>
<p>What's different? Why is Japan seemingly immune to many of the layoffs and trends seen further afield?</p>
<p>While cultural differences play a part in retaining employees, it's not entirely benevolence keeping Japanese employees in a job. Employee protections are also a major factor in ensuring stability for employees. Under Japanese employment law, layoffs are incredibly difficult to implement – unless the company is under severe financial difficulty and at risk of insolvency in a manner layoffs could alleviate, after other cost-saving measures have been undertaken, layoffs for permanent employees are all-but impossible.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean there aren't other ways to reduce the workforce, whether that be in not renewing or canceling work for contract employees. While this is possible, this can reflect poorly on the company's reputation with the public and prospective future employees if employment isn't deemed stable, so is generally avoided if possible.</p>
<blockquote>"It's almost night and day. In Japan, the law protects the employee. In the US, [it] protects the company. For Europeans, it's somewhere in the middle"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Japanese law also prevents many roles from being classified under non-permanent employment. Employment, on the whole, is far more stable and secure than seen in Europe, the US or elsewhere.</p>
<p>As industry analyst Serkan Toto (CEO of Japan-focused games industry consultancy Kantan Games) puts it, "It's almost night and day. In Japan, the law protects the employee. In the US, the law protects the company. For Europeans, it's somewhere in the middle. It's not as easy [in Europe compared to] the US to fire people, but it's also not as easy as in Japan to keep your job once you have it as a full time employee."</p>
<p>When layoffs are so difficult, why was it possible for Tango Gameworks to be shut down by Microsoft in the manner that it was?</p>
<p>"A closure where you lay off people through that method is different than going in and that same amount of people and ten people stay," explains Toto. "You have to explain yourself in court, because there will be lawsuits and that's a very difficult case to make as a company. But if you close the entire company outright, get rid of everything inside the company including the staff, office, the rent, the equipment, it's a different story."</p>
<p>Another factor in Japan's strength amidst ongoing turmoil is the fact the country is insulated from many of the issues facing companies elsewhere. <a href="https://gamedevreports.substack.com/p/sensor-tower-mobile-gaming-market-4b7">Outside the United States and China, Japan has the largest market for mobile gaming</a> in the world, with many of its biggest titles like Uma Musume, the recently-launched Gakuen Idolmaster, Puzzle and Dragons, and Dragon Quest Walk being domestically-developed and published by Japanese companies. Other new releases primarily target and seek to make a profit from domestic audiences without relying on global success to turn a profit.</p>
<p>"Mobile gaming is three times bigger than console gaming in Japan," explains Toto. "People outside Japan always think about Sega, Nintendo, and so on, but inside Japan 70% of the market is controlled by mobile game companies. CyGames is a big one, and they're also doing console games now, but then there's primarily-mobile companies like Gree, DeNA, Akatsuki. These companies have 1,500 [to] 2,500 employees, and nobody's talking about them, but these guys also don't fire anybody.</p>
<p>"Mobile gaming is not exploding anymore like it used to about ten, 12 years ago when smartphone gaming came and conquered, but for the last five or six years, mobile gaming in Japan has been quite stable. If you look at the revenue size across the industry, it is not really changing that much, although PC gaming is becoming bigger."</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Hi-Fi-Rush_TjqTonN.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Exporting work to cheaper countries is also far more challenging for Japanese developers. Such routes to accomplish this are not only not established, language barriers make communicating with foreign workforces more difficult, protecting domestic labor. This also contributes to the circumstances fueling wage increases, as companies compete for a shrinking working-age population.</p>
<p>"Japan is an island nation where the language is only spoken inside the country and nowhere else – you can't sack 500 Japanese people and then outsource that work to 500 people in the Philippines," as Toto summarizes it. "And the population in Japan is graying and shrinking at the same time, you have less talent. Companies like Bandai Namco, Nintendo, and Capcom are not paying people more because they want to share the wealth, they do it because they have no other choice! Otherwise, these software engineers working at Capcom might go and work for Toyota in the AI business."</p>
<blockquote>"People outside Japan always think about Sega, Nintendo, but inside Japan 70% of the market is controlled by mobile game companies"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Even then, rising wages still doesn't make game development prohibitively expensive in Japan, opening up space for games to fail or companies to take more risk. A lower cost of living coupled with lower average wages compared to those seen in the likes of the US – <a href="https://www.orixbank.co.jp/column/article/189/#:~:text=%E9%9B%87%E7%94%A8%E5%BD%A2%E6%85%8B%E5%88%A5%E3%81%AE%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8E,-%E5%89%8D%E8%BF%B0%E3%81%AE%E5%9B%BD%E7%A8%8E%E5%BA%81&amp;text=%E3%81%A8%E3%81%8A%E3%82%8A%E3%81%A7%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F%E3%80%82-,2022%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%88%E4%BB%A4%E5%92%8C4%E5%B9%B4%EF%BC%89%E3%81%AE%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%87%E5%B9%B4%E5%8F%8E%E3%81%AF,%E5%86%86%E3%81%AE%E5%B7%AE%E3%81%8C%E3%81%82%E3%82%8A%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%80%82">according to Orix Bank</a> the average yearly income in Japan is ¥4.58 million (around $28,000), and <a href="https://hr.geeq.co.jp/tocreator/career/gameprogrammer-income">research from Imagica GEEQ</a> placed the average wage for game programmers at ¥5.23 million (around $32,000) – help reduce overall budgets.</p>
<p>Compared to titles like <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/insiders-blame-suicide-squads-failings-on-changing-vision-and-lack-of-live-service-skills#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Warner%20Bros%20CEO,impact%20the%20company's%20Q1%20performance.">Rocksteady's The Suicide Squad, which reported major losses of over $200 million for Warner Bros</a>, Toto estimates factors like wages mean even the biggest titles in Japan can be produced for "30-40% less, maybe more" than seen internationally, reducing risk.</p>
<p>Morale is low across the global industry, and for good reason. The post-COVID and post-growth shock fueling layoffs means that regardless of the size of your company or talent in releasing critically-acclaimed games, no job is safe in the pursuit of endless growth.</p>
<p>Even companies making record profits deem it necessary to make the line go up further, slashing jobs with abandon. This can be seen with Tango Gameworks and recent Microsoft layoffs: the company had an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar23/">operating income of $88.5 billion in 2023</a> and increased profits, yet enacted company-wide layoffs including 1,900 under the Xbox brand.</p>
<p>"Nobody thinks about the people who are still working there," laments Toto. "If I was an artist at Ubisoft, for example, I would be scared. Ubisoft is one of the last big companies that haven't pulled out the hammer yet. They've cut some people, but it's a drop in the ocean when you have over 20,000 total employees. Even if you're one of the remaining employees [after a layoff], I wouldn't feel secure at any games company right now."</p>
<blockquote>"Japan is an island nation where the language is only spoken inside the country – you can't sack 500 Japanese people and then outsource that work to 500 people in the Philippines"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>Layoffs of this magnitude feel counterintuitive. When so many developers are thrown out of work, the brain drain means many years of experience will likely leave the industry for good, and companies will lose access to the generational knowhow of company workflows and tools new hires will be forced to learn from zero. Growth may have slowed, <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/video-games-in-2023-the-year-in-numbers">but it is still growing</a>, and the industry remains larger than film, TV and music combined. The crushing reality is that, while you can't prevent every job loss, many layoffs are avoidable.</p>
<p>Employees simply <em>must</em> take the hit to add a few extra dollars to the end-of-year shareholder dividend though, right?</p>
<p>Japan's alternative approach has long-term merits in ensuring companies have retained the talent needed to react to any revitalization for the industry, as Toto explains.</p>
<p>"If there's a new bull run in the video game industry, which I think will come, then I think Japanese companies will be in a better position. They have retained their talent, and it builds trust. I fear that Western game companies have overdone it, and there's a danger that if the game industry revitalizes in one or two years that these decisions might come back and bite them.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Serkan-Toto.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japan-focused games industry consultancy Kantan Games</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"I think there's a big philosophical difference between the Japanese and the Western world. Japanese game companies really think long term, a lot more long term than their American counterparts. For a lot of the American companies, they are basically characterized by American capitalism, where everything's profit, profit, profit, profit, and if the line goes downward everybody starts panicking."</p>
<p>When the never-ending tide of layoffs finally subside, many developers will have left the industry for good. It will take years to regain that experience, and what's to stop another run of job losses tossing all that progress aside once again? How much strain can the industry hold before it all crashes in on itself? And even if things recover, without a change in mindset, will another collapse in jobs 10 years down the line remain not only possible, but inevitable?</p>
<p>"Will you be able to get the ideas of American capitalism out of the minds of the CEOs at Activision or Electronic Arts? Probably not," ponders Toto as we wind up our conversation. "I think it's always a battle between the American system and the Japanese system, with the American system very much focused on profitability and short term thinking and making everything as efficient as possible, whereas in Japan the thinking is different."</p>
<p>After one last opportunity to share pizzas as a company on Microsoft's dime, Tango Gameworks closed its doors for the last time. Perhaps on some spreadsheet thousands of miles away, the thought of a games company far from home a few years out from releasing a new game is the most efficient way to make the line rise just that little bit further. Not everything of value can be quantified on a graph, nor does massaging one quarter of growth for short-term gain mean the decision won't adversely impact another quarter in the future.</p>
<blockquote>"I think it's always a battle between the American system and the Japanese system, with the American system very much focused on profitability"<cite>Serkan Toto</cite></blockquote>
<p>But who cares about that? The line must go up, the concept of endless growth viewed not as an impossibility but a rational objective that must be achieved at all costs. And the people suffer.</p>
<p>It's not even that Japanese companies are all that much different from their American counterpoints. Many are publicly traded, and you can be assured, private or public, they all still love money. In some ways, you can't help but wonder if things would be different if employment protections were different, or if employees didn't benefit from the language barriers making it more difficult to ship their efforts elsewhere. Yet whichever it is, their difference in approach makes the grass much greener for those plying their trade in the country, if just for the fact they aren't as worried about not having their job in a week's time.</p>
<p>Perhaps for now, we should merely take solace in the fact that, in a seemingly-never ending world of layoffs, there are at least some people still in a job.</p>

        <p>Reorganisation within studio has resulted in 33 redundancies</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Ubisoft has announced layoffs at its Toronto studio following a restructure, with 33 staff affected.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/less-than-a-month-after-joining-work-on-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-toronto-lays-off-33-employees-to-ensure-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap/">PC Gamer</a>, the developer announced it had conducted a "targeted realignment" of its team resulting in redundancies, in order to "ensure it can deliver on its ambitious roadmap."</p>
<p>"We are committed to providing comprehensive support to [employees], including severance and career assistance, to help through this transition," it said.</p>
<p>Ubisoft Toronto noted that the layoffs will not impact ongoing projects, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and Splinter Cell remakes.</p>
<p>This is the second Toronto-based studio hit by layoffs this month. Last week, <em>GamesIndustry.biz </em> reported that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-of-mass-layoffs-at-gameloft-toronto">staff at Gameloft were affected by redunancies</a> due to current market conditions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-hit-with-another-wave-of-layoffs">45 Ubisoft staff were affected by layoffs</a> across its global publishing and Asia-Pacific divisions following a reorganisation.</p>
<p>In its 2023 fiscal year report, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023">Ubisoft recorded a 27% growth in sales</a> to €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion) driven by the performance of its Rainbow Siege and Assassin's Creed franchises.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, you sneaky sausage, clandestine chorizo and, possibly, underhand cumberland! In keeping with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>’s tradition of hiding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/parry-like-youre-sekiro-with-this-one-weird-trick-that-shadow-of-the-erdtree-bosses-hate">entire new systems behind tucked-away items</a>, a hidden NPC quest in the DLC gives you access to a special raisin that allows Torrent. your steed, to charge your foes with its big fat forehead. A delicious ‘fruit and nut’ bar, if you will.</p>

<p>The Spirit Raisin is an item you’ll first need to grab a certain cookbook to craft, so do have a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-moore-questline-walkthrough">Keira’s guide to Moore’s quest</a> if you’re curious. Craft the raisin, feed it to your spectral steed, and you’ll grant torrent to ability to yackety-smack into foes, knocking them back during galloping. It doesn’t do any damage to speak of, but it does stop you getting mobbed as you saunter about the land of shadow.</p>

<p>Also, it’s just nice to see Torrent getting in on the action. Personally, I’d have added a makeshift saddle with two of those greatbolt jar cannons on either side, but I am not a famous gamesmaker. I am simply a man, looking at a spirit yak, asking very nicely if someone will make a mod that lets it wear a very small mech suit.</p>
<p>May as well go out with a bang, right? Especially as this could be the last time we even get a mount in a FromSoft game, since it doesn’t sound like more open worlds are on the cards for the developer. “Where FromSoftware is right now, in terms of scale, I would say Elden Ring is really the limit," Miyazaki <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-is-the-limit-for-from-software-project-scale-says-miyazaki-multiple-smaller-games-may-be-the-next-stage">said recently</a>. "We’ve tapped every resource and talent that we have access to… scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns."</p>
<p>Ah, but you see Miyazaki, you already have<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon"> Armored Core VI</a>, do you not? Anyone who complains about 'asset flips' when the end result is giving your yak a mech suit is not someone worth taking seriously. It wouldn’t even be the first time someone tried <a href="https://youtu.be/2vO2SOqO7cs">something so foolish, yet so utterly sublime</a>. Until then, at least we have the headbutt raisin. I relate, Torrent, I honestly do. If someone tried to feed me a raisin in lieu of the infinite better snack options available, I'd want to wreck shop too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin.915888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-movie-or-tv-series-seemingly-being-teased-by-george-r-r-martin/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Would you fancy a movie or TV series based on FromSoftware's latest masterpiece, Elden Ring? Because that seems exactly what George R.R. Martin is teasing in his latest blog update <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2024/06/29/lose-one-win-one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> on Saturday.</p>
<p>The author of A Song of Ice and Fire famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-george-r-r-martin-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaborated</a> with the Japanese studio on the new fantasy franchise, laying down the mythology, worldbuilding, and characters that the game's plot is based upon. Many had called this a match made in heaven and, indeed, Elden Ring went on to be an outstanding commercial and critical success.</p>
<p>In May 2023, the game even <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won</a> the Nebula Award for Game Writing. The prize, which cited both George R.R. Martin and Elden Ring game director Hidetaka Miyazaki, was shipped to Japan only recently. The author said that's where it belongs since FromSoftware did the heavy lifting on the story after he had prepared the groundwork.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Then, out of the blue, he wrote:</p>
<p><em>Oh, and about those rumors you may have heard about a feature film or television series based on ELDEN RING… I have nothing to say. Not a word, nope, not a thing, I know nothing, you never heard a peep from me, mum mum mum. What rumor?</em></p>
<p>To be fair, we haven't really heard much in the way of rumors about an adaptation. In fact, Martin's peculiar wording is inevitably going to start its own rumor on the subject, and we can't imagine it was unintentional for a man whose job is to choose the right words. However, publisher Bandai Namco <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-has-sold-over-12-million-units-ip-to-expand-beyond-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> in March 2022 that Elden Ring could expand beyond games.</p>
<p>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa Corporation (which was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-parent-company-gets-hacked-will-have-to-pay-a-ransom-to-avoid-1-5tb-of-data-to-be-released-on-july-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacked</a>, by the way, and must pay a ransom by today or face the dissemination of the stolen data) regularly produces anime, so it would make sense for the feature film or TV show to be animated rather than live action. The alliance with Sony, <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-software-owner-kadokawa-corporation-alliance-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> three years ago and strengthened last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-gets-new-investments-by-sony-and-tencent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new investment</a>, might be related to the project.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion already sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units</a> in the first three days on the market. On PC, fans can also use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated Seamless Co-Op mod</a> to play the whole game with friends.</p>

            <p>Happy this week, everybody! Not going to lie, it's a dry one. Drier than a doldrum dunked in silica gel packets, dustier than Death's doorstep. There are precious few eyebrow-raising new PC games on the cards, but I have swaddled my head in wet blankets, braved the desert and returned with a small handful of dreams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Monday 1st July is a day of immaculate blackness and creepy lo-fi linework, care of space station spook-a-walker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044970/Vorago/">Vorago</a>. Tuesday 2nd July is a time of much free-to-play schlooting, care of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2074920/The_First_Descendant/">The First Descendant</a> - and of much pay-to-play mmorpging, care of <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/product/">Final Fantasy 14's Dawntrail</a> expansion. On Wednesday 3rd July there... is... <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2729720/4_in_a_row/">Connect-4, but inside a computer</a>? On Thursday 4th July therrrrrrrrre isssssss... a game literally just called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3054680/Multiplayer_RPG/">Multiplayer RPG</a>? That's like naming your dog "Dogs". And on Friday 5th July, a relatively electrifying shmup called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717610/Void_Reaper/">Void Reaper</a>.</p>
<p>You may not get to play that last one, because odds are high that the Maw, our resident dark god of video game news, will have blossomed in outrage and swallowed the world by Thursday. Please: if you spy any headline-worthy new PC games anywhere, perhaps sheltering from the summer torpor on Itch.io, sing out in the comments. Please. The Maw's shadows are growing clearer and sharper, lengthening like silences. Our generators agonise, struggling to fill the calm. It may already be too late.</p>

Perhaps due to the dreadful lassitude, this week's liveblog has frayed away from the timeline and become entangled with last week's. Either that, or Graham accidentally popped Friday's updates in the draft liveblog I'd set up, because I did not tell him I was setting up a draft liveblog. I know which explanation <em>I</em> prefer.

            <p>Happy Monday all! Yes, I wrote that with total sincerity. We all deserve a happy Monday - perhaps video games can help with that. As you'd expect, Elden Ring's recently released <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> DLC remains this week's Big Kahuna, with no obvious mega releases in the offing to break its chokehold on the discourse, but I have dipped my latex-gloved hand into the gestation pools and fished out a few promising oddities.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 24th June kicks off with bone-throwing dungeon solitaire <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2693930/Dice__Fold/">Dice &amp; Fold</a>. On Tuesday 25th June, we've got the remake of mystical 90s point-and-clicker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712350/Riven/">Riven</a> - now with real-time 3D environments, shock - together with magic realist high school visual novel <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574820/Until_Then/">Until Then</a> and Argentinian folk horror <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2761100/Pomberito/"> Pomberito</a>, in which a farmer must survive five nights while investigating a local beastie. Skipping forward to Thursday 27th June, there's some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2807170/Stray_Gods_Orpheus/">Orpheus DLC for RPG musical Stray Gods</a>, and the early access launch of 30 player last-person-stand 'em up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2287920/BATTLE_CRUSH/">Battle Crush</a>. On Friday 28th June, there's the early access release of tornado-chasing simulation <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1107320/OUTBRK/">OUTBRK</a>, which has you monitoring rogue weather on a 625 square kilometre map. </p>
<p>Here at the RPS Treehouse we'll be spending a fair bit of the week feeding the Maw freshly-hewn pieces of Erdtree, but we'll also be running our mitts over a co-op anime shooter I won't spoil, dredging up long-forgotten Aliens games, and possibly finding time for a stylised retro FPS or two. The Maw would typically consider this spartan fare, but there's so much molten Elden Ring DLC running through its cyclopean veins I think we'll get away with it. Even the Maw needs time to digest.</p>

    From <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">The Guardian</a> via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/hidetaka-miyazaki-says-elden-ring-might-be-as-big-a-game-as-he-ever-wants-to-make-where-fromsoftware-is-right-now-in-terms-of-scale-i-would-say-elden-ring-is-really-the-limit/">PCGamer</a>, From's Hidetaka Miyazaki has said that Elden Ring possibly represents "the limit" for From Software in terms of project scale. "Scaling it even bigger, I’d have my concerns," he said. "Perhaps having multiple projects is the next stage, where some of the other younger talent can have the opportunity to manage and direct game design for a smaller project."

    Surprising no-one: big game sold very well. Or, big expansion more accurately. Shadow Of The Erdtree has sold 5 million copies in just 3 days, meaning about 20% of the playerbase picked it up, going by the 25 million total sales figures for the base game. Cheers, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/with-5-million-sales-in-3-days-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-rivaling-the-outstanding-success-of-the-witcher-3-and-cyberpunk-2077-dlc/">GamesRadar</a>!

    <p>Ari Buktu and the Anytime Elevator (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2184020/Ari_Buktu_and_the_Anytime_Elevator/">Steam link</a>) is a side-scrolling 3D platformer in the spirit of 80s Hollywood action films, which is being directed by Jeff Ashbrook, one of the minds behind Disneyland's Millenium Falcon ride. The trailer doesn't wow me that much, but I'm curious about the overlap between game design and themeparks.</p>

    I played a bit of knightly platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/662340/Renaine/">Renaine</a>'s demo over the weekend and enjoyed it. While Shovel Knight is the obvious comparison, I also get a very faint Mystery Dungeon vibe from it.

<p>In a recent video published by Sega, the team working on the new Crazy Taxi game spoke about pivoting from a core single-player experience to an online multiplayer game built around a vast open-world environment. In the seven-minute breakdown, we’re treated to glimpses of the developing title, which showcased several game modes, vehicles, and some energetic and punchy visuals.</p>



<p>It was explained by the team that there have been some difficulties in pivoting from a single-player experience to a live-service multiplayer model, but they’re making great leaps in the development process as we speak.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crazy-taxi-but-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi – But Multiplayer</h2>



<p>In the video (which you can see below), Sega’s Sapporo Studio talks at length about the city, stressing that it has been designed with realism and a sense of freedom in mind, with players being given a plethora of activities to explore in a ‘theme park-like environment’. </p>



<p>Here’s the video:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="「クレイジータクシー」開発者インタビュー" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLQsitFYpg8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>In the trailer, there are shots of police chases, stunt-based modes, and general exploration with other players zipping around the world taking on their tasks all at the same time. Sega’s team explained that car design and customisation will also be a thing, and there were shots of artists working on character models, which leans into the suggestion that players might be able to travel on foot. </p>



<p>Ultimately, the video was something of a recruitment campaign, with the various teams working on the game – from art to level design – talking about what they do and how they interact with this developing game. The studio’s head asked interested parties to apply for a job at Sega as the video came to a close.</p>

  <p id="XIrYTo">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2 episodes 3 and 4.]</p>
<p id="PY3SUF"><em>House of the Dragon</em> is no stranger to the supernatural. Not only does the HBO fantasy drama series boast plenty of low-key magic — not to mention, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">y’know, <em>dragons</em></a> — but it’s also the prequel to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/24157742/game-thrones-finale-anniversary-next-show-like"><em>Game of Thrones</em></a>, a show loaded with snow zombies and smoke monster babies. Clearly, this is a universe where otherworldly forces are at play. Even so, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176417/house-dragon-dunk-egg-game-thrones-connections">Daemon Targaryen’s (Matt Smith) unsettling stopover</a> at Harrenhal in season 2 arguably marks <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s most overtly supernatural subplot to date.</p>
<p id="nZ15rX">Everyone’s favorite sassy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23310439/house-of-the-dragon-sex-scenes-matt-smith-interview">sadboy prince</a> sets up shop at the supposedly cursed castle in episode 3, and strange goings-on start stacking up soon after. It certainly seems like he’s caught up in Westeros’ answer to <em>Ghost Hunters</em>, but is he (and everyone else) just jumping at shadows? Just how cursed is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>’s Harrenhal, really?</p>

<p id="d1hqgl">One of the few things Westeros’ high- and lowborn folk seemingly agree on is that there’s been a curse upon Harrenhal since its foundations were laid. Why? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>books</a>, <em>House of the Dragon</em>, and <em>Game of Thrones</em> chalk up Harrenhal’s dubious reputation to two main factors.</p>
<p id="NijYJh">The first is the Olympic-level arrogance of Harrenhal’s founder, King Harren Hoare, in the lead-up to the castle’s ribbon-cutting ceremony. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-thrones/2019/5/13/18617829/game-of-thrones-scorpions-dragons-strategy-aegon-harrenhal">Harren made a big deal of how invincible</a> his generations-in-the-making fortress was going to be — and, on paper, his boasting made sense. Harrenhal is almost comically supersized, and its battlements (allegedly made from mortar mixed with Harren’s blood) can theoretically shrug off any conventional attack.</p>
<p id="7VYSc4">The bad news for ol’ Harren was that dragons are decidedly unconventional. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23668840/game-thrones-hbo-spinoff-house-dragon-aegon-conqueror">King Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters</a> swooped into Westeros literally the day Harren moved into Harrenhal and promptly torched the joint. The Targaryens’ dragons barbequed Harren and his sons during the assault, and Harrenhal itself was never the same again. Unsurprisingly, rumors that Harrenhal was cursed, haunted, or both sprung up soon after.</p>
<p id="Nj1ekJ">The second factor contributing to Harrenhal’s shady rep is that almost everyone who succeeded Harren as lord of the castle didn’t fare much better. We saw some of this misfortune in <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ eight-season run: Tywin Lannister, Janos Slynt, and Petyr “Littlefinger” Baelish wind up shot dead on the toilet, exiled and then beheaded, and Pez dispenser-ed, respectively. <em>House of the Dragon </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23365909/larys-strong-house-of-the-dragon-character-explained">season 1 adds Lyonel Strong and his boy Harwin to the Harrenhal curse’s supposed victims</a> as well.</p>
<p id="O18i0G">Frankly, it’s hard to blame folks for believing the place is jinxed!</p>
<h2 id="xzwmdW"><strong>What happens at Harrenhal in the Game of Thrones books?</strong></h2>

<p id="SYesBR">Both the core A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>novels and <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23292279/house-of-the-dragon-mushroom-canon">source text, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em></a>, stop short of showing any outright paranormal activity at Harrenhal. Sure, we hear legends of the fortress’s various horrors, such as the flaming phantoms of Harren and his kids, a child-eating ghoul named Mad Lady Lothston, rafters full of raven spirits, and household staff crumbling to ashes in their sleep. We never actually <em>see</em> any of this stuff, though.</p>
<p id="0QX6xs">At one point, Littlefinger complains about Harrenhal’s ghostly lodgers; however, this is probably just the ex-Master of Coin’s signature snark. Similarly, while various characters (including Jaime Lannister and Arya Stark) acknowledge that apparitions of Harren and his sons supposedly roam the castle’s corridors, nobody actually witnesses this phenomenon firsthand. What’s more, Westerosi rumblings that Harren’s ghost bumped off a pair of Lannister-affiliated lowlifes in <em>A Clash of Kings</em> are flat-out wrong; Arya’s mentor, Jaqen H’ghar, is the one actually responsible. There’s a similarly prosaic explanation for the eerie shrieks that emanate from Harrenhal’s aptly named Wailing Tower: It’s just wind blowing through cracks in the walls.</p>
<p id="neEO4K">Even so, <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> also details other, less easily hand-waved supernatural chicanery on Harrenhal’s grounds. Notably, the castle’s Heart Tree not only has a scary-looking face, but also “bleeds” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">from dragon claw marks</a> in its trunk every spring. Admittedly, Heart Trees are a whole separate branch (pun fully intended) of magic in A Song of Ice and Fire<em> </em>lore, and don’t necessarily fall under the curse umbrella. Yet this definitely fits the definition of “spooky” — and arguably confirms there’s something fouler afoot at Harrenhal.</p>
<h2 id="jOu5ae"><strong>So, is Harrenhal really cursed? Or is that just Westerosi superstition? </strong></h2>

<p id="DvdmOQ">Honestly? No one knows for sure. Ambiguity is a key part of Martin’s take on magic, the supernatural, and religion in A Song of Ice and Fire. As such, the specifics around all three — including curses, real or imagined — is intentionally fuzzy. Harrenhal <em>could</em> be haunted by a malevolent force out to destroy Daemon, but don’t hold your breath expecting <em>House of the Dragon</em> showrunner Ryan Condal to say for sure.</p>
<p id="aMFVe9">Certainly, nothing in episode 3 or 4 categorically confirms or rules out Harrenhal’s curse. Yes, Daemon sees his bedchamber door shaken by unseen forces; however, Harrenhal is drafty as fuck. Our guy’s (admittedly messed-up) visions of younger Rhaenyra aren’t exactly reason to call an exorcist, either. For one thing, Rhaenyra’s still alive (so this <em>ain’t</em> a ghost), and for another, season 2 is littered with clues Daemon is losing his grip. It’s the classic “Is this all in his head?” trope.</p>

<p id="ggfd2a">But even though Harrenhal’s curse remains up for debate in <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2, one thing’s clear: Haunted or not, the castle is Westeros’ least desirable vacation spot. </p>

  <p id="3unrz8">War has officially arrived in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24183267/house-dragon-episode-season-2-review"><em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2</a>. And much like the second season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, that means <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/7/4/12093570/game-of-thrones-map-westeros">Westerosi geography</a> is about to play a much bigger role in the show and our ability to understand it. In fact, the Greens’ war council in this season’s third episode is probably just a preview of the important wartime tactical discussions to come. </p>
<p id="Bu88WZ">The series has never been shy about piling on the details and leaving viewers to piece things together, but with war looming, it’s extra important to keep track of exactly what people are fighting over. So to help get you ready for the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23322393/house-dragon-houses-characters-explained">Targaryen civil war</a>, here’s a quick explanation of what everyone was talking about in episode 3, and why fighting over the Riverlands is so damn important to both sides. </p>
<p id="WFEbDW">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This story contains spoilers for <em>House of the Dragon</em> season 2, up to episode 3.]</p>
<p id="n7EUqr">The first key to understanding the importance of the Riverlands in the Dance of Dragons is understanding its geographic place in the story. Here’s a map in case you need a refresher: </p>

<p id="fX1Rt0">As we can see, unlike with the season 2 battles between the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24182763/house-dragon-king-aegon-2-joffrey-game-thrones">Lannisters in King’s Landing</a> and the Starks in Winterfell in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, there isn’t much distance at all between <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s two Targaryen factions. In fact, all that lies between them is Blackwater Bay on one side and the Riverlands on the other. And the Riverlands practically surround the small islands of Dragonstone and Driftmark, where Rhaenyra and her allies currently reside. </p>
<p id="9fhNsc">Another important facet to understanding the Riverlands is understanding the Tullys. House Tully are the lords of Riverrun, and are traditionally the stabilizing force in the region. However, as Jason Lannister points out in the King’s Landing small council meeting, the Tullys are led at this moment by Grover Tully, an old man incapable of holding his own house together, let alone the rest of the Riverlands as they progress toward open war. This means the region is almost entirely up for grabs, and in very open conflict — as we see at the beginning of the episode with the Blackwoods and the Brackens.</p>
<p id="iddq9a">This power vacuum is exactly what leads Ser Criston Cole, the newly promoted Hand of the King, to the conclusion that he should embark with a small team to the Riverlands by force, bringing the different castles and their lords in line under the crown. To cap off his plan, Criston says that he’ll take Harrenhal, rendering the region completely in King Aegon’s control. </p>
<p id="oLa6cu"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24178649/house-dragon-season-2-daemon-assassins-prince-blood-cheese">Daemon</a>, on the other hand, simply flies straight to Harrenhal, deciding that he and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23381183/house-dragon-all-dragons-riders-vhagar">his dragon Caraxes</a> were likely enough to take the castle by surrender. When he arrives, he learns that he was both entirely right and maybe wasting his time. The dark, damp corridors of Harrenhal are just as ruined as they’ve been since the death of Harren the Black, and the castle doesn’t seem to offer much martial strength at all. </p>
<p id="H2uaPg">Harrenhal’s general lack of strength means that Criston is marching toward an essentially worthless prize, but the allies he picks up along the way are what really matters here. As you can see if you look back at the map, controlling the Riverlands for the Greens would essentially mean cutting the Blacks’ stronghold at Dragonstone off from the rest of Westeros. Sure, they can reach allies by sea, but the only port nearby for Rhaenyra is at Rook’s Rest — which could be another potential Riverlands prize for Criston to win. But without those few cities in the region, the Blacks would be quarantined to their tiny islands and hard-pressed to survive for long. </p>
<p id="qFOiwR">If all this is sounding rather dire for the Blacks, that’s because technically it is. Their side has the strongest navy, which is why Ser Corlys Velaryon is running a blockade at the entrance to Blackwater Bay, effectively stopping shipments from entering King’s Landing. But that’s their only real strength. Of course, if Daemon is able to somehow muster an army at Harrenhal, or bring his massive dragon to bear on Criston’s force, their fortunes could certainly start to shift. </p>
<p id="XTCoJv">But wars are very complicated things, both in real life and in the world of Game of Thrones, and very few of them ever go exactly according to either side’s plan. So, no matter how dire things may seem, there are likely to be a few twists in the near future to keep the conflict close. </p>

<p>On Friday, Twitter users were treated to <em><a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806687243819790723">The Bear The Game</a></em>, a comedy sketch in the form of a first person cooking/life simulation game. It’s also a shooter. It’s also kind of like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. It’s also like <em>Shenmue</em>. At least I see <em>Shenmue</em>. I think most things can be traced back to <em>Shenmue</em>.</p>



<p>Anyway.</p>

<p>Something I love very deeply about the modern internet are interpretations and expressions of game design tropes from people who aren’t dyed in the wool game developers or games media figures. Fashion TikTokers doing <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@lemonxde80s/video/7369623269978410286?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">“Choose Your Fighter”</a> style videos. Elaborate <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@panterbanter/video/7150745454437977349?is_from_webapp=1&amp;sender_device=pc&amp;web_id=7318443315601622558">physics-bending death</a> animations from <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls.</em> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CmzvcztPoa5/">Point-and-click adventure horror</a> (a real game came out of her stuff, although she eventually dropped out and <a href="https://airdorf.itch.io/excuse-me-sir">only the demo remains</a>).</p>



<p><em>The Bear The Game</em> is just the latest, and <a href="https://vgbees.com/the-bear-the-game-a-review/">perhaps most elaborate</a>, version of this trend. Michael Kandel and Joe Miciak make sketch comedy together as Hotel Art Thief, but the 3D animation seen in <em>The Bear The Game</em> hasn’t always been part of the process.</p>



<p>“We both were unemployed/underemployed and started writing sketches together to pass the time,” Miciak told VGBees via Twitter DM about Hotel Art Thief’s genesis. It wasn’t until 2022 when Miciak began experimenting with Blender, a free 3D modeling tool, for a sketch called “Drench.”</p>

<p>“It was really half-baked,” said Miciak of this first attempt at creating 3D animated faces. It wasn’t until “user:Brian(box)” in 2023 that Miciak got comfortable crafting 3D heads and placing facial textures. “It’s a chatroom sketch Mike (Kandel) wrote during (the Covid) shutdown,” Miciak recalled, which originally was envisioned in 2D with ASCII art — “I eventually learned how to make the heads, and decided to make it more of an N64 aesthetic.”</p>



<p>You might recognize some of the environmental art from the sketch, as well, which was lifted directly from Nintendo 64 classic <em>Perfect Dark</em>. Even though Miciak has gotten comfortable and confident enough to make sketches using Blender, he’s not a big fan of the software itself.</p>



<p>“Mike will sometimes come up with an idea for a sketch involving 3D objects, and can see me debating with myself whether I want to subject myself to it,” he admitted, “But I break pretty easily.” For <em>The Bear The Game</em> and other sketches with 3D heads featuring facial textures, Miciak uses FaceBuilder, a popular add-on for Blender.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“Mike helped out by taking a bunch of screenshots from <em>The Bear</em>,” he explained, “and I did some photoshopping to make sure all the angles were roughly the same color temperature and in the same outfit.” That process of plastering the different-angled photos to the models is fairly automatic, though it’s not perfect by any stretch. “I did some texture painting in Blender to fix any glaring issues,” he noted, “but as you can see in the video, I kind of like when the faces look a little fucked up/asymmetrical.”</p>



<p>Once the faces are (mostly) in place, the animation process can begin. Animation is all about keyframes, anchors in time where all the parts of an image have to be to create movement. Fortunately, tools exist that facilitate this often painstaking task. One of those powerful tools is Live Link Face, a mobile app created by Epic that records video then sends keyframe data back to a program like Blender.</p>



<p>“So Mike recorded all the <a href="https://x.com/K_A_N_D_E_L/status/1806710629840851362">actors’ audio</a>, and I got my Andy Serkis on and read all their lines to my iPhone,” said Miciak. In case you’re envisioning elaborate and expensive motion capture equipment on a sprawling Hollywood soundstage, Miciak quickly dispelled the notion. “I was running out of time at the end, so I was on the subway taking these weird videos of myself.” The whole thing came together in about three weeks and was timed perfectly for the Season 3 premiere of the show.</p>



<p>Clearly the duo understand <em>The Bear</em> and cooking tropes enough to create an incisive and thorough parody of one of television’s most lauded shows, all the way down to the much-discussed needle drops like the <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/let-down-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">cover of Radiohead’s “Let Down”</a> that hits toward the end of the sketch.</p>



<p>Even in the music choices are a signpost to the games and moments that inspired the aesthetic and mechanical qualities of <em>The Bear The Game</em>. Both major tracks in the “demo” are covers of 90s songs with Nintendo 64 soundboards by artist on4world — the aforementioned Radiohead song as well as the super ambient <a href="https://on4word.bandcamp.com/track/rhubarb">“Rhubarb” by Aphex Twin</a>.</p>

<p>Miciak mentioned licensed games from the PlayStation 2 era as strong influences on this style, listing <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, and the <em>Batman Begins</em> movie tie-in as major contributors. This era represents “games that really try to lazily shoe-horn plot from the movie into the game, to the point where it gets distracting” to Miciak. Arguably the most interesting of these inspirations is <em>Enter the Matrix</em>, a game happening parallel to the events of <em>The Matrix Reloaded</em>, which struck a chord with Miciak.</p>



<p>He recalled that “you only get to play a vague, random character <em>[editor’s note: I know Jada Pinkett Smith’s Niobe isn’t random but I get this 100%] </em>and you’re sort of like ‘But… I just want to play as the main character?'” Playing around the events of the popular film released simultaneously was an ingenious and, often in hindsight, deeply interesting move, but it was also a big swing! And this was part of what inspired the character select screen of <em>The Bear The Game</em>, which has you inhabiting original characters that will interact with the ones you’re far more familiar with from the show’s story. This creates a tension from the outset by putting yourself in a place you don’t really feel like you belong.</p>



<p>I think these specific examples serving as a reflection of what could have been if television and film tie-ins continued with this trajectory is fascinating. I also love learning about what people latched onto that aren’t in our specific bubble; often too close to every new release and cultural moment that we lose sight of what millions of people who come in contact with games actually remember and hold onto.</p>



<p>“I have a long history of watching my friends play video games because I was so bad at them,” Miciak concluded. “Maybe that’s why I like making fake ones so much.”</p>

            <p>Listen up, Tarnished - Elden Ring worldbuilding writer George R. R. Martin has given his strongest hint yet that the critically acclaimed game may be getting its own "feature film or TV" spin-off.</p>
<p>Whilst Hidetaka Miyazaki has only teased that he and FromSoftware would be open to a live-action adaptation, Martin goes just that little bit further courtesy of his the-lady-doth-protest-too-much-me-thinks protestations he recently shared on his <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/">personal blog</a>.</p>

<p>Is it concrete proof an Elden Ring movie or show is on the way? Not even slightly. But it's hard to imagine someone as prolific and revered as George R. R. Martin would put <em>anything</em> in his blog that he didn't expect ravenous fans to dissect and overanalyse, so make of that what you will.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide</a>, in just three days of release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring had shipped 25m units</a>, meaning 20 percent of all players have already jumped back in for the DLC in its opening weekend.</p>
<p>"To the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella, we extend our heartfelt gratitude," FromSoft said in a celebratory social media.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we reported that one savvy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> player believes they've found a way to find enough <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-player-shares-how-to-level-up-scadutree-blessings-without-fighting-a-single-boss">Scadutree Fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24189436/demon-slayer-infinity-castle-final-arc-movies-trailer-trilogy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="l5lIXr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22933948/demon-slayer-entertainment-district-arc-history"><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em></a> just wrapped its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23979916/demon-slayer-season-4-everything-we-know">Hashira Training arc</a> but the (Mugen) train isn’t slowing down: on the heels of the finale, Crunchyroll that <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s next arc, Infinity Castle, will roll out in theaters as an “epic trilogy of films.” In a news release, Crunchyroll notes that “the three-part cinematic movies represents the final arc and culmination of the hugely popular award-winning anime shonen series.”</p>

<p id="YPPM2c">Based on the manga series by Koyoharu Gotoge, published under Shueisha’s Jump Comics, <em>Demon Slayer</em> currently consists of 23 volumes that have sole upward of 150 million copies, a number that turned it into one of the most popular anime on the planet. For Crunchyroll, nabbing the worldwide distribution rights (excluding a few Asian territories) to <em>three</em> additional Demon Slayer films is a major boon; the 2020 film <em>Mugen Train</em> remains the highest-grossing anime movie of all time, the highest-grossing Japanese film at the global box office of all time, and the second-highest grossing anime film in U.S. box office history (having earned $49.5 million, more than <em>Madame Web </em>made in 2024!). Sony’s recent acquisition of the Alamo Drafthouse theater chain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177134/sony-alamo-drafthouse-theaters-purchase-crunchyroll-anime">expressly for the purpose of platforming anime films in America</a> makes the trilogy a major milestone in Crunchyroll’s campaign to be a one-stop shop for all things anime in the U.S..</p>

<p id="IXncEa">After training with the Hashira in the previous arc, <em>Demon Slayer</em>’s majin protagonist Tanjiro is off to the Infinity Castle to take on Muzan Kibutsuji, the Demon King. A teaser for the movie trilogy is light on footage from any of the Infinity Train films — it’s light on animation in general — but it gives fans who only know the anime a taste for what’s next.</p>
<p id="A6GqgG">The untitled first Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle movie is currently undated. All of <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is streaming on Crunchyroll.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead's fantastic alien-shooter Helldivers 2 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, Steam numbers continue to dwindle, plummeting to around 10 per cent of its all-time concurrent Steam peak of 458,709 players.</p>
<p>As Victoria reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">at the end of May</a>, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3m">SteamDB</a> showed Helldivers 2's peak at that time had dropped 64 percent to 166,305.</p>
<p>Today, that has dropped to 35 percent again, falling to a 30-day average of 41,860 concurrent players on Steam (thanks, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/06/29/after-initial-success-helldivers-2-has-lost-90-of-its-players-with-no-signs-of-recovery/">Forbes</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, that number only represents players on Steam, and – as it's published by Sony – there's plenty more Helldivers saving the world on PS5.</p>
<p>However, a litany of errors from Sony – starting with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a> – not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but also saw the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-accidentally-leaks-unannounced-helldivers-2-strategem">unannounced Helldivers 2 stratagem leaked online</a>, seemingly by a Sony email. The unforced error – which came via an official marketing email sent out to Helldivers – proudly introduces the Airburst Rocket Launcher players unlocked after they successfully liberated Penta during Operation Legitimate Undertaking.</p>
<p>The other problem was, the weapon in the image accompanying the email, however, wasn't the Airburst… or, indeed, any weapon known in the game at that time.</p>

			<p>Today, LukeYui has updated his <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Seamless Co-Op mod</a> to work with the newly released Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. Here's the changelog shared by the modder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatibility with Elden Ring App Version 1.12, including Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</li>
<li>Completely rewritten code; some old bugs (e.g., enemies falling through the floor) do not occur anymore * Items gained in conversations are now given to all players</li>
<li>Event flags are properly synchronized now</li>
<li>Enemy scaling options have been added</li>
<li>Player death count is now a player banner option</li>
<li>Have the option to view the current session password in-game</li>
<li>ModEngine 2 compatibility</li>
<li>Matchmaking verification: only people with the same mods will be able to connect to each other</li>
<li>Added invasions (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p>The modder also clarified there are currently some bugs still:</p>
<p><em>While not perfect, it has reached a state where it can be used to play Elden Ring and the DLC in coop. I'm aware of some bugs still present in it, and will continue working on it past the initial release - the next few days will be crucial so that I can work on fixing any problematic issues quickly should they arise.</em></p>
<p>The Seamless Co-Op mod was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-creator-says-seamless-co-op-mod-may-be-added-as-a-feature-in-a-future-fromsoftware-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by none other than Elden Ring creator Hidetaka Miyazaki, who said that such a freeform cooperative system could well be implemented in future games made by FromSoftware.</p>
<p>For more on the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion (which already <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-has-sold-5-million-units-in-3-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> 5 million copies), read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market.</em></p>

            <p>Scadutree Fragments are critical for levelling in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>, but one savvy player believes they've found a way to find enough fragments to reach level 14 without taking on a single boss.</p>
<p>Redditor Galdiuz2 posted their method to the Elden Ring subreddit earlier this week, including an image depicting where, exactly, Tarnished can locate Scadutree Fragments without encountering any bosses.</p>

<p>Interestingly, u/Galdiuz2's post says you could use this map to get to level 12, but u/gilgabroVII points out that you can actually get to 14 – "17, before any remembrance boss" – as there's at least one more fragment in the starting zone not indicated on the map, "two more in the Scadu Altus, and two in the [Cerulean Coast]."</p>
<p>Later, Galdiuz22 returned to the post to acknowledge that there were "even three accessible in the south, for a total of six extra not on [the] map".</p>
<p>Be careful if you choose this route, however; doing this may mean you'll end up perma-skipping interesting NPC quests.</p>

<p>Another commenter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dodp8f/comment/lab38tv/">added</a> that you could get 20 Fragments without fighting anything or entering a legacy dungeon, 34 without killing a boss, and 44 Fragments by taking down just three main bosses and one remembrance (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-level-14-no-bosses/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>ICYMI, a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has been released that revises the scaling of the Shadow Realm Blessings. The DLC includes this new scaling system to boost the attack and defence of both your character and your spirit summons, by collecting Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes respectively.</p>
<p>Now the scaling has been revised so that the effects are greater for the first few levels, before becoming more gradual later.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-hits-5m-sales">Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree has reached 5m sales worldwide</a>, in just three days of release.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-has-shipped-25m-units-worldwide">Elden Ring had shipped 25m units</a>, meaning 20 percent of all players have already jumped back in for the DLC in its opening weekend.</p>
<p>"To the many who tread the path left by Kindly Miquella, we extend our heartfelt gratitude," FromSoft said in a celebratory social media.</p>

More than two decades, in fact. But there's a new ray of light on the Nosgoth horizon in the form of a graphic novel called Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise.</p><p>As the first new Legacy of Kain content since 2003's Legacy of Kain: Defiance, The Dead Shall Rise serves as a prequel to the Soul Reaver games. The book flashes back to Raziel's human past as a Sarafan warrior and reveals how he came to be a vampire serving under Kain. The goal is to answer some long-running questions about the Legacy of Kain/Soul Reaver mythos while also introducing a major new vampire character with close ties to both Raziel and Kain.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/30/placeholder-logo-1719713665411.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: Crystal Dynamics/Bit Bot Media</figcaption></figure></output><p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver – The Dead Shall Rise is a collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media. The book is written by Joshua Viola (True Believers, It Came From the Multiplex) and Angie Hodapp (Unioverse, Shadow Atlas), with interior art by Juan Samu (Star Wars, Godzilla), letters by Jeremiah Lambert (Masters of the Universe, Transformers), covers by Dave Rapoza (Destiny, Magic: The Gathering) and Aaron Lovett (Monster Train, Inkbound). The book features additional art by Jonny Bush (Rob Zombie, Ghost) and Ninja Jo (Star Wars, Stranger Things), with Brent Friedman (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Call of Duty) providing narrative guidance, and Crystal Dynamics has also provided creative direction based on unreleased elements of Soul Reaver lore.</p><p>“In college, I created a Soul Reaver poster for a class project, never imagining I would one day officially contribute to the franchise,” said Viola in a statement. "Even today, Raziel graces my tattoo sleeve—a testament to my deep connection with this universe. Fans can expect a project infused with that same passion. Working directly with creatives from Crystal Dynamics and reuniting with former collaborators makes this a truly special endeavor."</p><p>The Dead Shall Rise will be crowdfunded on Kickstarter. <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/ec6d71d7-3906-45d4-aaab-40fc1a372416/landing?preview_mode=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans can sign up on BackerKit</a> to be notified by email when the campaign launches later this year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>With any luck, this won't be the only new Legacy of Kain content fans can look forward to in the years ahead. Embracer Group, which currently owns the IP, received an overwhelming 100,000 responses to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crystal-dynamics-asking-fans-new-legacy-of-kain-game">a 2022 survey about the franchise</a>, suggesting that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-legacy-of-kain-looks-likely-as-embracer-receives-strong-fan-response">new Legacy of Kain games could be in the works</a>.</p><p>"We saw the news of our survey shared across social and press platforms and really felt this was a great way to reignite this passionate fan community with this legendary PC console game series," said Phil Rogers, CEO of Embracer's 12th operative group. "Rest assured, we hear you loudly and clearly and will continue to update you on the 'What if?' possibilities ahead for Legacy of Kain in the future." </p><p>Are you excited for this new chapter in the Soul Reaver saga?

					<p>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally heading toward its long-awaited release, this article will bring you up to speed on every facet of the action RPG, from its troubled development to its confirmed features, story beats, and setting.</p>
<p>The project has had multiple iterations over time. Shortly after the successful release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in late 2014, BioWare's Game Director Mike Laidlaw outlined plans for a new installment codenamed Joplin. This would have been a smaller game focused on a 'heist' in the region of the Tevinter Imperium magocracy. This iteration was <a href="https://wccftech.com/mike-laidlaw-bioware-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> in late 2017 (with Laidlaw leaving the company around the same time) as Electronic Arts attempted to pivot the game to a live service design. Back then, this new Dragon Age (codenamed Morrison) was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-anthem-tech-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as 'Anthem with dragons'.</p>
<p>That wasn't the last major change in direction. Following the massive failure of Anthem and the success of Respawn's single player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, EA eventually reconsidered its own stance and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-4-will-be-a-single-player-only-rpg-multiplayer-has-been-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">allowed BioWare to ditch live service elements</a>, resuming development as a single player only title.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-more-info-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously known as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>, but the team has recently decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-veilguard-is-the-new-name-of-dreadwolf-reveal-scheduled-for-june-11-with-15-minutes-of-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change the name</a> to reflect the game's focus on the player's companions rather than on one of the (supposed) villains.</p>
<h2>Release date, platforms, pricing, editions</h2>
<p>BioWare and Electronic Arts have not announced a definitive launch date (nor pricing or the available editions) yet. However, they confirmed the game will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X this Fall.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-is-officially-in-alpha-playable-from-beginning-to-end/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached the Alpha milestone</a> nearly two years ago, allowing a far longer time for polishing than any previous BioWare game. Between that fact and Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Shadows already securing a November 15 date (which would have been near the 10-year anniversary of Inquisition), there's speculation that the developers may be targeting a launch in late September or early October. More official information may be released in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>As with all EA games, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be playable right away (probably even ahead of the official release) with the EA Play Pro subscription.</p>

<h2>Genre, setting, and story premise</h2>
<p>The new Dragon Age installment is a single player third-person action roleplaying game. Unlike Inquisition, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-mission-based-rather-than-open-world-sex-scenes-will-have-nudity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it won't feature open world-like zones</a>. BioWare said it is a highly curated and handcrafted experience to better serve the needs of the narrative, which has been central to this project. That said, they also <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-opens-up-dramatically-after-a-certain-point-says-bioware-rpg-skill-tree-is-enormous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the game would 'open up dramatically' after a certain point, allowing exploration off the beaten path within some 'fairly wide spaces.'</p>
<p>The setting may be the only leftover from earlier stages of the project. For the first time in the franchise, players will head to the Tevinter Imperium; in fact, the very beginning of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as shown in the 15-minute gameplay</a>, takes place in the capital of Minrathous. However, players can expect to visit a greater amount of the continent of Thedas than ever before, including locations like Weisshaupt (the fortress of the Grey Wardens, located in Anderfels), Rivain, the Arlathan Forest, and the Deep Roads.</p>
<p>The story of Dragon Age: The Veilguard picks up around eight years after the events seen in the Trespasser DLC for Dragon Age: Inquisition. Solas, now fully unmasked as the elven trickster god known as Dreadwolf, is hellbent on tearing the Veil to restore immortality to the elves, no matter the consequences for the world. The player character named Rook (the surname will vary depending on the race, selected between Qunari, Dwarf, Elf, and Human) gets wind of the situation and rushes alongside Varric, Harding (the female Dwarf scout from the previous game), and a Mage detective called Neve to stop Solas. Rook successfully disrupts the magic ritual but, in so doing, frees two extremely dangerous elven deities previously stuck behind the Veil: Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. It will be up to Rook and their Veilguard (composed of seven companions: Harding, Neve, Lucanis, Bellara, Davrin, Taash, and Emmrich) to protect Thedas from the aftermath.</p>
<p>In Dragon Age: Inquisition, players imported save states from previous games via the dedicated Dragon Age Keep software, allowing them to maintain the world states spawned by their choices and consequences. For Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare opted for a different approach. Players will build key choices from previous games directly in the new character creator, with tarot cards providing context for each decision. They'll even get to recreate their own Inquisitor (the main character in the third installment), who will appear in the game in some capacity. The character creator itself was described as the most powerful ever made by BioWare, featuring extensive body customization options (including 40 different skin complexions and as many Qunari horn types, as well as more than 30 makeup styles), the ability to choose pronouns separately from gender, and one of four voices out of English masculine, English feminine, American masculine, or American feminine. Character creation also includes background roleplaying options such as the faction, with six available options: Grey Wardens, Antivan Crows, Shadow Dragons, Lords of Fortune, Mourn Watch, and Veil Jumpers.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The combat system is more action-focused than in previous Dragon Age games, and the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-lets-you-switch-between-2-weapons-mid-combat-is-about-being-in-control-of-every-single-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> the goal of letting players feel in control of every action, be it parrying, dodging, or blocking.</p>
<p>Players will select three active abilities per character to bring in their weapon loadouts (two can be swapped mid-combat), in addition to Ultimates (which change based on specialization) and runes. However, some skills have been baked into the core moveset for all classes. Each class now has light and heavy attacks, which can be used strategically depending on the situation, and some abilities can be charged. Moreover, there are combo opportunities between certain abilities, and combos can be 'paused' to dash away when needed and resumed afterward.</p>
<p>Players will select their main character's class between three options: Warrior, Rogue and Mage. Each of the classes comes with its own set of specializations. Warriors can become either Reapers, who use night blades to siphon health from foes, risking death to gain supernatural abilities; Slayers, who wield two-handed weapons for straightforward but strong attacks that deal increased damage; or Champions, who are equipped with one-handed weapons and shields, focusing on tactical defense and taking hits from enemies on the group's behalf.</p>
<p>Rogues can pick between Duelists, who dual wield blades for rapid strikes and have the fastest movement with a focus on dodges and parries, Saboteurs, who use a mix of traps and tricks to control the battlefield, and Veil Rangers, a more classic ranged style of combat to hit enemies from afar with a bow. Lastly, Mages can be either Death Callers (basically, necromancers), Spellblades (warrior mages who infuse their melee attacks with magic), or&nbsp;Evokers, masters of elemental fire, ice, and lightning magic. Blood Magic won't be available in Dragon Age: The Veilguard for a narrative reason, according to BioWare.</p>
<p>Players can customize their character to their heart's content thanks to the 'enormous' skill trees that the developers said were inspired by Final Fantasy X's Sphere Grid. With every level up (the max level is 50), the game will provide a skill point that can be used in the tree to unlock active abilities, traits, minor passives, and major passives, which can include jump attacks and guaranteed critical hits after specific triggers. BioWare also said that players would be able to branch out of their chosen specialization around mid-game to pick other stuff from the skill trees to complement their playstyle.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has reduced the group from four to three characters due to the increased action focus. You also won't be able to control companions directly, but you can issue them orders to execute specific abilities against specific targets via the ability wheel, pausing the action. The companions can act on their own, but at harder difficulties, strategic play of the whole party is recommended.</p>
<p>Speaking of the main character's allies, they will gather at a social hub called Lighthouse (located in the Fade). It's here that most of the conversations between them and the player character will occur. Each companion can be romanced regardless of gender and race, and if you won't romance them yourself, they may find their match elsewhere in the group.</p>
<p>Lastly, crafting and transmogrification (the ability to wield some gear and show a cosmetic skin instead) are confirmed to be in the game.</p>

<h2>Technology &amp; Specs</h2>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is powered by the Frostbite engine, like Dragon Age: Inquisition, Mass Effect: Andromeda, and Anthem. BioWare said this is the first game in which they've felt in control of the engine. On consoles, the game will offer performance and quality mode options.</p>
<p>We don't have any details on the PC version yet, including system requirements. However, BioWare's Mike Gamble has <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1800665572042236364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that PC-related announcements are coming soon, hinting at a collaboration with either Intel, NVIDIA, or AMD.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki "Youshi P" Yoshida offered his "sincere apologies" for "issues" identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published on the <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/09598d1b4efffdc7cdc3360d32bf2086026761b6">official website</a>, Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

<p>"We have confirmed an issue in the Xbox version where the game client may become unresponsive when transitioning between locations, such as field areas and cities," Yoshida explained. "Our preliminary investigation suggests that this issue is likely due to a phenomenon known as memory fragmentation.</p>
<p>"We are currently conducting a comprehensive investigation into the matter, which we have prioritised to ensure a swift resolution. However, rectifying this issue requires the deployment of a patch to update the client. This process involves rigorous checks by our QA team, among other procedures, which means it may take several days to address."</p>
<p>Yoshida said that the team was working to expedite a patch to address this, but as "this process will take some time", he "apologised for the inconvenience caused".</p>
<p>Similarly, issues in the Dragonsong’s Reprise (Ultimate), the Minstrel’s Ballad: Shinryu’s Domain, and Delubrum Reginae (Savage) where "mechanics related to freezing are not functioning correctly" will be resolved via a "client patch", although it's not yet clear when that will be deployed.</p>
<p>"The aforementioned issues are being classified as a high priority," Yoshida added. "They are under investigation on our development server and are being addressed in a systematic manner. We are considering the release of a hot fix, which is likely to occur sometime this week, which would be accompanied by a brief maintenance period.</p>
<p>"I would like to extend my apologies once again for the occurrence of these issues. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing issues such as these that occur after the release of an expansion and will continue to promptly correct any urgent issues that may arise."</p>
<p>"So far, Tural's environments feel rich and warm, existing in a perpetual summer haze," Ed wrote in his wonderful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail preview</a>. </p>
<p>"Zoom in close, though, and the real difference from the graphical update is apparent. The texture work on armour and weapons is a vast improvement, while animal races - like the new female Hrothgar - seem more realistically furry."</p>
<p>In 2015, the MMO had four million players for the Heavensward expansion; this has grown to 30 million registered accounts by 2024's Tokyo Fan Fest. Even by 2021 it had become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-xiv-the-most-profitable-game-in-the-series">the most profitable game in the long-running series</a> and that will only have increased since, not to mention the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-purchases-on-xbox-require-an-extra-currency">game's release this year on Xbox</a> and the likely boost to sales Dawntrail will provide.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">Yoshida told Eurogamer there's "almost no chance" of server woes at launch</a>" when the expansion goes live on 2nd July, 2024.</p>
