<p>It'll come as no surprise to hear that there are a few different purchase options from <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/ren-stimpy-happy-happy-joy-joy-collection-standard-edition-switch-ps5-pc?variant=44905135308853">LRG</a> (once pre-orders open on 30th January), including a 'Classic Edition' for <strong>$69.99</strong>, which comes with a retro VHS cover and a steelcase, and a 'Collector's Edition' for <strong>$109.99</strong>, which packs in a bunch of extra merch like a CD, poster, mini cartridge replicas, an acrylic standee and more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/poweras-alternative-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-is-a-no-brainer-at-less-than-half-its-price-2000663633</link>
            <guid>1418470</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the release of the Switch 2 last year, Nintendo simultaneously refreshed it’s Pro Controller to release alongside the new console. The aptly-named Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with some big upgrades including a better HD Rumble system, the dedicated C-Button for GameChat, and rear GL/GR buttons that can be mapped to any button you choose. It’s a handy controller to add to your rotation, but it doesn’t come cheap. It’s list price is a whopping $89.</p>
<p>You can get a controller with really everything you actually need for less than half that price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">The PowerA enhanced wireless controller for both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 normally goes for $70, but has come down to just $40 after a 43% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>While the PowerA controller doesn’t have the C-button to launch GameChat directly from your gamepad, I also don’t know many players who would even miss that all too much. What the PowerA controller&nbsp;<em>does</em> have is comfortable ergonomics for long game sessions and wireless connectivity. It’s even got motion controls. What more do you need?</p>
<h2>Advanced Gaming Buttons</h2>
<p>The PowerA controller even has the same two customizable back buttons that Nintendo added to its second generation pro controller. The AGR and AGL buttons can be pulled with your trigger fingers to activate a function of your choice. You can map these buttons to mimic any other button on the controller, making it easy to jump or reload without having to take your thumbs off the sticks. These back buttons can even be programmed on the fly, mid game. No backing out of the game into system settings required.</p>



<h2>Never Stop Playing</h2>
<p>The controller is powered by an internal lithium rechargeable 900mAh battery, so you’re not dealing with double-As like you might with some other third party options. The PowerA controller fully charged could last you up to 30 hours on a single charge. Then when the battery does get low, just plug in the included 10-foot USB-C charging cable so it can recharge while you can keep playing.</p>
<p>The PowerA controller can also be way more fun than the first-party option from Nintendo. Along with the standard black version, PowerA has a wide selection of designs featuring artwork of fan favorite characters. Lots of Mario and friends designs as well as some options from Kirby, Metroid, and Zelda. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">Most of which are currently marked down to the same $40 price tag as the standard version.</a> That’s $49 cheaper than the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Side-Scrolling Robo-Shooter Remake 'FZ: Formation Z' Blasts Onto Switch 2 This May]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/side-scrolling-robo-shooter-remake-fz-formation-z-blasts-onto-switch-2-this-may</link>
            <guid>1418449</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>City Connection and Granzella have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fz-formation-z">FZ: Formation Z</a>, the side-scrolling robot shooter from all the way back in the perm-riddled dark days of 1984 (so long ago this writer had a full head of hair!), is to be resurrected on Switch 2 this very year (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2026/01/city-connection-and-granzellas-formation-z-remake-finally-has-a-release-date">Time Extension</a>).</p>
<p>Now, 1984 is a long time ago, yes, and so you may be thinking 'meh' to the idea of resurrecting something so very antiquated. Until you check out the trailer at the top of this article, that is. Also, you may have already played the OG game already on Switch via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/arcade_archives_formation_z">Arcade Archive re-release</a> and are now just a rabid fan. Welcome, either way!</p>
<p>It does seem as though the devs here have gone to town with this remake of a Jaleco golden oldie, with a full revision of everything from the graphics, gameplay, and sound, whilst "staying true to the classic gameplay and intuitive controls of switching between Robot and Flight forms". They've even brought new weapons to the table. It certainly looks like a good time, judging by the intense and colourful action on show in the gameplay vid, with some very nice <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/r-type_dimensions_ex">R-Type</a>-but-with-big-stonking-robots vibes that this writer is here for all day long.</p>
<p>The remake will release in Japan on 21st May across multiple platforms, and although a Western release hasn't been officially confirmed for Switch at the time of writing, the trailer above does contain the Clear River Games logo, who were attached to publish the game in Europe according to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/11/embracer-group-interim-report-leaks-fz-formation-z-western-release-plans">a release plan leak from Embracer Group</a>. So, fingers crossed, then.</p>
<p>More good news: It'll arrive in both digital and physical forms, and the physical isn't a Game-Key Card, either. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Digital editions will set you back 4400 yen (so roughly £20 or whatever that is where you're located). The physical edition comes in two flavours: a fancy Limited Edition for 14,850 yen (around the £70 mark) which includes a soundtrack, robot-making kit, bonus weapon content and a fancy box for presentation, and a slightly less snazzy standard physical for 5,940 yen (almost 30 British pounds).</p>
<p>Finally, here's some more official details, as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2728420/FZ_Formation_Z/">the Steam page</a>, and some screens:</p>

            <p>What Steam operators Valve are and aren't prepared to allow onto their storefront has been a major talking point for the past year or so, especially when it comes to mature or sexually-themed content. Our Edwin's done some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-payment-networks-control-the-definition-of-acceptable-sex-in-videogames">fine reporting on the topic</a> and how it relates to payment processors, as well as delving into individual cases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saturnalia-creators-santa-ragione-will-wind-down-operations-after-valve-ban-horror-game-horses-from-steam">Santa Ragione's Horses</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the developers of point-and-click comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/point-and-click-adventure-game-filled-with-ah-yeah-them-british-actors-earth-must-die-is-out-later-this-month">Earth Must Die</a> say things looked "unclear" for a bit in terms of whether they'd be able to launch on Steam, with the platform then offering a thumbs up after reviewing footage of an "alien orgy".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Up until a few days ago, it was unclear if we were actually going to be allowed to launch Earth Must Die on Steam, as Valve had told us that they were 'unable to verify' the context of the alien orgy," publishers No More Robots told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/valve-needed-to-verify-footage-of-the-alien-orgy-in-earth-must-die-before-it-was-allowed-to-launch-on-steam/#viafoura-comments">Painting Collection Gamer</a>. "We were required to record and send footage of said orgy for their verification."</p>
<p>Thankfully, once that footage was sent over, approval was forthcoming. That said, whether on Valve's orders or by No More Robots' own volition, Earth Must Die's Steam page bears a mature content warning specifying that "there is a puzzle that takes place in an alien adult bookshop, and an alien orgy depicted as a gyrating lump on the floor".</p><p>As much as it's funny to imagine a Valve staffer examining footage of cartoon extraterrestrials going at it, No More Robots' retelling of the events paints what's turned into an amusing anecdote as something that could potentially have thrown a major spanner in the works. If games that dabble in jokey depictions of shagging face that sort of gaze into the void, right up until they're sure Valve are 100% satisfied, one can only imagine the uncertainty more serious explorations of mature themes might encounter.</p>
<p>On one hand, Valve have a right to apply the rules they decide to enforce on their storefront, even if said storefront's domination of the PC space makes such calls far weightier than they might otherwise be. On the other, as Edwin's reported, the matter of credit card companies and payment processors influencing what those rules - and the rules of other storefronts - are when it comes specifically to adult content complicates the matter significantly.</p>
<p>At least in this case, the alien orgy made it through whatever contextual hoops it needed, so that No More Robots' game about British actors and comics quipping their way through a tale about a martian ruler doing quirky stuff could drop as planned this week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-stop-girlypop-is-a-wild-looking-shooter-that-isnt-much-fun-to-play-2000663619</link>
            <guid>1418437</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-fps-shooters-2025-borderlands-battlefield-doom-first-person-shooter-2000653497">A good first-person shooter</a> doesn’t need to look hyper-realistic, include actual military weaponry, or feature massive levels. Really, all a shooter needs to nail in order for it be considered damn good in my book is simple: Moving and shooting in it should feel great. That’s it. And sadly, recently released “Y2K arena movement shooter” <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> doesn’t accomplish that, despite a wild and memorable art style and soundtrack.</p> <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an indie FPS starring a super soldier of compassion and kindness trying to fight back an alien invasion of corporate-obsessed evil bastards who want to steal and exploit the very love you defend. So you do like any soldier of love and hope would: You grab a wild shotgun that you can freely bedazzle and start blasting fools.</p>

  <p>The FPS is built entirely around moving fast and killing lots of enemies in various arena encounters. Shooting shit is 80 percent of this game, and on paper, that sounds like a great video game to me, a person who loves boomer shooters and most FPS adventures. However, to achieve max speed in <em>GirlyPop,</em> you must repeatedly slam, jump, and dash. And you’ll want to go fast in this new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2610650/Dont_Stop_Girlypop/">FPS launching on Steam on January 29</a>, because the faster you move, the more damage you do and the more quickly you heal. The problem is that repeating this bunnyhopping-like maneuver requires pressing three different buttons over and over and over again, and it quickly started to tire my fingers out.</p> <p>Worse, when I was at top speed during fights, I felt out of control and not in a fun way. Instead, it made fights turn into a blur of neon colors and random shapes. Slowing down, while it made combat easier to parse, also made me a sitting target. And you move so slow in this game when you aren’t bunnyhopping around that not speeding through fights and platforming sections is a drag.</p>

 <h2>Bad combat, but good music</h2> <p>And as I ping-ponged around the bizarre low-poly arenas that make up most of <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em>‘s world, I often struggled to spot baddies as their models are often made up of thin shapes roughly collected into something that resembles an enemy. If I had a nickel for each fight that lingered on because a few flying bastards were hiding in the garish textures or low-poly environment around me, I’d have enough money to buy a small soda. When I did find them and shoot, I’d often be unsure if they were even taking damage until they died, making guns feel weak in the process.</p>

 <p>But don’t get me wrong, I enjoy how <em>GirlyPop</em> looks! A lot. The mismash of 2000s-era tech and game visuals with bright pink colors and oddly shaped levels is a standout element of the game. It reminds me of some of the weird mods I’d play back in the day in games like <em>Unreal Tournament </em>and <em>Half-Life.</em> It’s just a shame that <em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> sometimes goes too far with how much digital junk and neon it tosses on the screen, such that it can become downright unplayable until the action calms down a tad. A more successful example of a game tapping into this same era of gaming is <a href="https://kotaku.com/quake-2-brazilian-drug-dealer-3-favela-steam-review-fps-boomer-shooter-weird-2000628167">last year’s <em>Brazilian Drug Dealer 3, </em></a>which isn’t nearly as hard to look at when combat happens.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663627">©Kwalee / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>At least, throughout all of this, the music slaps. A few of the battle tracks got stuck in my head long after I stopped playing, which is a very good sign that you’ve made some awesome tunes. I just wish the game’s later levels were as rad as the music. Instead, the more I played, the more I started to dislike my time with <em>GirlyPop</em> as areas became messier and harder to navigate, like I was playing someone’s first draft and not a finished level.</p>

 <p><em>Don’t Stop GirlyPop</em> is an example of a shooter that oozes style and has some cool ideas, like using a flip phone to communicate with your handler, a woman who appears in live-action video clips on your phone’s screen. But its visuals get in the way, and its combat is too focused on chaotic speed and screen-obscuring effects. Perhaps I could still enjoy all of this if the guns were satisfying to use and the enemies fun to kill, but more often than not, I wasn’t sure if I was doing well in a fight or if my guns were even hitting anything. So I’m sorry to say I stopped playing <em>GirlyPop</em> before the game ended. But hey, at least I’ll have the music to jam out, too.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-its-latest-anc-headphones-to-a-record-low-the-wh-1000xm6-is-now-priced-below-the-xm5s-original-cost-2000663639</link>
            <guid>1418404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Techies and audiophiles are both notoriously fickle crowds, and they love a good debate about the best this or the best that. But they’re overwhelmingly on the same page when it comes to over-ear noise-cancelling headphone: Sony’s WH-1000XM6 are hands-down the very best you can find on the consumer market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">That’s very relevant right now, because these otherworldly cans are back down to their holiday pricing at Amazon, with a limited-time deal dropping them to just $398.</a></p>
<p>When the WH-1000XM6 headphones dropped last May, our compadres at Gizmodo called them “damn near perfect,” and they were far from alone in that opinion. Sony had set an extremely steep bar for itself when they announced a successor model to the wildly popular WH-1000XM5 headphones, but they cleared that bar with plenty of room to spare by taking all of the WH-1000XM5’s best features and upgrading them even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Faults Found</h2>
<p>When Sony went back to the drawing board, their opening move was to give the WH-1000XM6 an improved foldable design to make them even better travel companions. The headband was widened for greater comfort, a 10-band EQ was added to the Sony Sound Connect app for a deeper level of customization, and the battery life was boosted to an almost unheard of 30 hours even while the best-in-class active noise cancellation is engaged.</p>
<p>But the real draw to the Sony WH-1000XM6 wireless headphones is, of course, that noise cancellation. To quote the opening words of every KISS concert: <em>“You wanted the best, you got the best.”</em> Sony’s new QN3 processor is joined by 12 upgraded microphones and AI Noise Optimization to create the absolute best Active Noise Cancellation of any set of wireless headphones anywhere. That title was probably held previously by — you guessed it — Sony’s WH-1000XM5. But those had “only” 8 microphones, and its QN1 processor gets absolutely blown out of the water by the QN3, which is fully 7x faster and therefore far more effective in eliminating external sounds.</p>



<h2>You’re In Control</h2>
<p>Toggling between ANC and Ambient Sound, which allows in enough outside noise for you to be aware of your surroundings, is a simple one-button action in the upgraded interface of the WH-1000XM6. Between the buttons built into the cans and the exceptionally robust set of controls that reside in the Sound Connect app, there are more modes and adjustments available to you than you’ll ever use, but better too many than too few.</p>
<p>The word on the street is that Sony won’t be releasing a WH-1000XM7 wireless headphone in 2026, meaning you can feel free to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">grab the WH-1000XM6 for just $398 during this limited-time Amazon deal</a> with full confidence that you’re getting the absolute best noise-cancelling over-ear wireless headphones on the market.</p>

              <p>A team lead at beleaguered Ubisoft has claimed (thanks <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>) that he’s been placed on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension after he made public remarks criticizing the publisher’s recent return-to-office mandate. David Michaud-Cromp says he was told by bosses that this was because of “an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p> <p>In amongst <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">last week’s shock announcement</a> that Ubisoft was cancelling a number of games (including the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia:</em> <em>The </em>Sands<em> of Time</em> remake), delaying others, and restructuring itself such that even more studios would be closed, was a demand that all employees return to their local Ubisoft office five days a week. After this new plan was sprung on 15,000 staff at the same time as it was made known to the public, Michaud-Cromp took to his LinkedIn account on January 23 to vent.</p>

 <p><span><span dir="ltr">“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they ‘believe in collaboration,'” wrote the Ubisoft Montreal level design team lead, “but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office… (Spoiler alert: it’s not about efficiency or collaboration).”</span></span></p> <p>Michaud-Cromp is not alone in his criticism of Ubisoft’s declaration that all employees must now return to working full-time in offices. Many Ubisoft staff took to the company’s internal message board to vent their feelings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">as seen and reported on by&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> last week</a>, not least because Parisian employees in particular had only recently completed negotiations to ensure they could maintain two work-from-home days a week.</p>

 <p>It seems Michaud-Cromp’s initial comments did not go down well with his bosses. He now claims that his remarks have led to being disciplined. “P<span><span dir="ltr">rofessional update,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.” He says this was “presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy,” alongside the astonishing phrase, “and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.” He concluded, “I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</span></span></p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s latest plan to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">reverse its rapid decline</a> is a restructuring that will simplify development via the creation of a collection of “creative houses,” which appears to be further consolidation of its many teams around the world, and thus another raft of inevitable job losses. In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">announcement</a> (a pdf) it adds, “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days.” Why? “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.” Um, what? “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p> <p>Staff appeared to receive this with some hefty cynicism, including Michaud-Cromp’s. Another staff member told <em>Kotaku</em> the move was being made “with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing.”</p>

 <p>Due to covid, when everyone was forced to work from home, it became apparent how flexible work arrangements actually lead to <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/study-shows-working-from-home-has-potential-to-significantly-boost-productivity">improved</a> <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/">productivity</a>, but bosses at many big companies whose roles are perhaps somewhat threatened by this revelation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/amazon-in-person-office-policy">have been pushing back</a>.</p> <p>Ubisoft staff are deeply unimpressed by this new announcement and the threat of yet another round of job losses, and <em>Kotaku</em> has seen at least five unions representing Ubisoft workers call for a three-day strike by all employees in February.</p> <p>We have reached out to both Ubisoft and Michaud-Cromp for further comment.</p>
                          </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-punishes-developer-union-strike-return-to-office-2000663771]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 250 hours I've logged in extraction shooter Arc Raiders tell you I'm hooked, but last week I read a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q3fgds/the_downsides_of_using_purple_weapon_mods_reveals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment on the game's subreddit</u></a> that perfectly encapsulated one of its few flaws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If the game is about getting good loot, but the good loot is actually bad, what are we doing?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you're searching a container, a rare augment – the devices at the heart of your loadout — or epic gun reveals itself in a burst of purple, a catchy jingle, and a big boost to the value of your stash, the place where you hoard and organise your items. But actually using<em> </em>these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_Weapons_Tier_List">weapons</a> and augments is far less satisfying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rarest guns in Arc Raiders <em>should</em> feel like a glorious reward for all that time you spent hunting blueprints, or for that risky fight you picked with a fellow raider. But the epic weapons are barely better than common ones – and in certain situations, they're actually worse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ss-cb49dfbcd7175c86e297b35ffc54cf779708f0ae-1920x1080-1768299969996.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's very little to choose, for example, between the ultra-rare Vulcano shotgun and the Il Toro, which you can find all the time across Arc Raiders' maps. Yes, the Vulcano kills quicker when you spam the trigger. But the Il Toro deals more damage per shot, so when you're dancing on the edge of cover, peeking out and firing before slithering back again, it shines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty more examples. The Bobcat, the epic SMG, shreds up close. But so does the Stitcher, which you can get as part of a no-risk free loadout or craft for next-to-nothing in your workshop. The Sticher's "effective DPS", taking into account reload time, is actually <em>higher </em>than the Bobcat's, and against certain shields the Stitcher can kill in one magazine where the Bobcat can't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don't even get me started on the Bettina, a weapon endlessly memed  the community. Yes, I get that it's for killing Arc, but you need to take <em>eight stacks </em>of ammo for it to be worth equipping. Give me an Anvil or Trailblazer grenade instead.</p><p>If these epic guns were 10% more lethal, 15% less expensive, and wore out 20% slower, they'd feel so much better.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cost-should-not-inherently-fill-a-skill-gap-arc-raiders-dev-admits-were-definitely-a-bit-off-on-some-of-the-cost-to-benefit-ratios-for-guns-like-the-bobcat-and-tempest-but-says-all-weapons-have-to-be-usable/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>, lead designer Virgil Watkins said that "any given weapon in capable hands should be capable of winning a fight if you're playing smartly". That makes sense. Newer or more casual players shouldn't lose just because they're carrying a worse gun. But this also isn't a team-based shooter that requires perfect balance. When you find something rare, it'd better feel special to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't help that maintaining these weapons is so expensive. Despite being the most polished guns in this apocalyptic world, their durability burns fastest, and repairing them munches through ultra-rare crafting parts. So rather than leveling the playing field, the current status quo actually does the opposite: the only players that can afford the risk of using and losing these weapons are people who, like me, have spent far too much time topside, have found the blueprints of these guns, and have a mountain stash of rare crafting parts ready to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Watkins did say "we're definitely a bit off on some of the cost to benefit ratios." It's promising to see him recognise that, and I actually don't think it needs a massive adjustment to fix. If these epic guns were 10% more lethal, 15% less expensive, and wore out 20% slower, they'd feel so much better.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The rarest augments pose a different problem, though. Before Tuesday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/ARC_Raiders_Headwinds_Patch_Notes_and_Update_Roadmap">Headwinds update</a> arrived, only two out of the six epic augments were strong – the Looting Mk 3 survivor can stop you bleeding out so that you have the chance of crawling to an extraction point with your loot, and the Tactical Mk 3 defensive has a built-in shield recharger for PvP runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other four aren't worth the crafting components once you finally find their blueprints. I've equipped them when I've found them, but never felt compelled to actually make one. The so-called "aggressive" combat augment, for example, regenerates a mere two health every five seconds. On top of that, it pauses for 30 seconds when you take damage, rendering it virtually useless for its one purpose, aggressive combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the weapons, augments don't need a rebalance. They need a total rethink. Top-tier augments should have a defining attribute that enables new playstyles, and Embark knows this: the studio added two new epic augments as part of the Headwinds update, including one that lets you stick a gun in your safe pocket. That's a start, but I think the useless ones need to be culled and replaced by more imaginative ideas. I love the fact that the more common tactical augment deploys a smoke when your shield breaks, and that the level-two looting augment makes you immune to face-hugging ticks. More of that, please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, I find Arc Raiders compelling despite this problem with rare loot (and despite its insistence on genAI voice acting). But there's no doubt in my mind that late-game balance is a problem, one Embark needs to get a grip on as new players continue to join and as experienced players, like me, look for reasons to stick around beyond its first few months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Horti is a journalist with bylines at the BBC, IGN, Insider Business, and Edge. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-good-loot-is-actually-bad-loot-and-that-needs-to-change]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1418389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a> 1.4.5 — dubbed the Bigger and Boulder Update — is finally here, and it's welcoming in thousands of new and returning players alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/105600/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, up until the new update, Terraria averaged around 20-30,000 players at any one time, with the occasional spike in interest when new content dropped over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">1.4.5, however, has seen one of the biggest spikes in over a decade, hitting a release day peak of almost 165,000 players on Valve's platform. This is second only to the release of Update 1.4 in May 2020, although that coincided with lockdown, of course, which gave millions of gamers around the world a little more time to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The true number of players will be even higher, given Terraria is also available on console and mobile, and 1.4.5 was released across platforms at the same time. The console and mobile makers do not make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, 'Bigger &amp; Boulder!', why 'Bigger &amp; Boulder' you ask? Beyond a good bit of additional content, a lot of effort with this update went into rounding out and expanding on existing experiences," developer Re-Logic said in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/105600/view/511853946447332034" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>. "Things like making inventory management and crafting easier than ever. We expanded upon secret world seeds - something that we feel greatly expands the replayability/freshness of the game - while also making them more accessible than ever before. We also had a focus on improving things like atmosphere on top of our continual polish/quality of life/balance efforts - which is getting harder and harder as Terraria gets bigger!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Oh, and you might encounter some new boulders... or existing boulders in new ways. Don't say we didn't warn you!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As always, we never share everything that is in each update - not even in the "full" changelog. Part of the fun is in the discovery! Good luck and happy adventuring, Terrarians!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terraria is pretty old at this point; IGN reviewed it 15 years ago(!), way back in 2011. Even then, though, we thought it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>amazing, scoring it 9/10</u></a> and writing: "Though on the surface it looks like just another 'me too' indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying. That's rare indeed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have the full — and very long! — rundown of the patch notes below, courtesy of <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-bigger-boulder-available-now.145773/#post-3386339" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Terraria forum</a>, <strong>but be very cautious, as there may be some unmarked spoilers here!</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Terraria Bigger and Boulder 1.4.5 Patch Notes:</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>Seeds</u>​</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added the Skyblock seed, where you start out on nothing but a small floating island.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has just received a massive new update called The Toxic Tangle, which is adding a new Garden biome, new enemies, and a rideable ladybug with a gun mounted on it. Obviously!</p>
<p>The Toxic Tangle update is the first major update to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-is-celebrating-its-release-with-a-chance-to-win-a-10-foot-fluffy-ant-you-can-use-to-frighten-a-child">since its Early Access release back in 2025</a>. The Garden, overgrown with vines and towering structures, is a messy new addition that players are now able to explore. It's also littered with new enemies and resources to collect, so you'll need to keep an eye out as you venture between the pumpkins.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will also let people ride a new Ladybug Buddy, which should help you navigate through this new landscape. It's packing a mounted water cannon on its back which you can use to fend off all manner of creepy crawlies, and is itself a tough creature to take down.</p>

<p><a href="https://grounded2.obsidian.net/news/update-0-3">The official blog post announcing the update</a> has also teased the return of both the Masked Stranger and the Snake Colossus, which you'll have to track down with an updated mutation system allowing you to further customise your ability to build or fight in Grounded 2.</p>
<p>The team at Obsidian also stated it's working on Playgrounds mode, a fan-favourite from the original game.</p>
<p>If you've not played Grounded 2, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's review of its Early Access release</a>. In it, Robert Purchase wrote: "The ant-sized thrills of Grounded return in a sequel which lays exciting foundations for the future. There's work to do but, already, an exciting adventure to have.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/</link>
            <guid>1418371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, 2020's <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> was finally launched on <strong>Xbox Series S</strong>, <strong>Xbox Series X</strong>, and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> by developer and publisher Square Enix. </p>



<p>Early user impressions based on the demo <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were very positive about the Nintendo Switch 2 version</a></strong>. However, the folks at Digital Foundry have now <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-7-remake-series-s-beats-switch-2-texture-quality-with-less-ram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published their detailed analysis</a>, and it seems like the most impressive version of the bunch is actually the one running on the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>Over the course of this console generation, Microsoft's cheaper Xbox Series console <strong>was often criticized by developers for its hardware deficiencies</strong>, especially in the RAM department. Indeed, even the Nintendo Switch 2 console has more RAM (<strong>9GB</strong> versus <strong>8 GB</strong>) dedicated to its games, and yet <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake shows better texture quality on Microsoft's console</strong>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version appears to mix up assets from the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions, the Xbox Series S deploys the full asset quality seen on its bigger sister, the Xbox Series X, and on the PS5. Digital Foundry postulates that, despite having less available RAM, the Series S achieves this result <strong>thanks to texture streaming powered by its CPU</strong>, a custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 chip which is nearly identical to the Series X's, except for a slightly lower clock speed. By contrast, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a noticeably less powerful CPU, the <strong>ARM Cortex-A78C</strong>. It has the advantage of <strong>NVIDIA DLSS support on the GPU</strong>, but it can't help it here.</p>



<p>That said, the graphics settings used for the Series S version, such as shadow quality, <strong>are somewhere in the middle between the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions</strong>. When it comes to resolution and frame rate, Xbox Series S owners can choose between running the game at <strong>1080P resolution and 60 frames per second</strong> or <strong>1440P resolution and 30 frames per second</strong>. The Xbox Series X, on the other hand, uses the same targets as the PS5 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake: <strong>1512P at 60 frames per second</strong> in Performance Mode, and<strong> 2160P (native 4K) at 30 frames per second</strong> in Quality Mode.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the next chapter in the remake trilogy, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is also rumored to be launching this year on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, <strong>it's a much more taxing game than the first installment</strong> due to its vast open areas. Even on PlayStation 5, it was known to be blurry because the developers had to reduce the resolution to keep the frame rate smooth. It'll be interesting to see whether the developers can strike a good balance between visuals and performance on the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In other Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy news, Square Enix <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed that even the third part will be made with Unreal Engine 4</a></strong>, rather than switching to the newest Unreal Engine 5, as the team is more familiar with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has confirmed that recent server issues in ARC Raiders are due to DDoS attacks. </p>



<p>Since the new Headwinds update, players have been reporting several bugs and glitches, most notably one that causes a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive drop in looting speed</a>. Additionally, several players observed stability issues, including being unable to move in the game. It seems the cause of the server issues has been found. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-hit-with-ddos-attacks-hotfix-arriving-later-today">ARC Raiders Hit with DDoS Attacks, Hotfix Arriving Later Today </h2>



<p>As revealed on the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/arc-raiders-server-issues-caused-by-mass-embark-ddos-attack-as-devs-warn-players-not-to-login-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FRVR</a>), Embark Studios recently acknowledged the server issues in ARC Raiders and stated that they were actively investigating the issue. Now, it seems they have found the cause of this problem, as a new statement on the game’s official Discord says both ARC Raiders and THE FINAL are experiencing extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team is working to solve the problem, but at this moment, they are still facing attacks. </p>



<p>The developers have confirmed that a Hotfix will be released later today to address the bugs and glitches introduced by the Headwinds update, and the strike team is making “good progress” towards fixing the problem. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress – but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing. </p>



<p>Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in yesterday’s update, we hope to have that available later today. </p>



<p>We’ll update you all on progress as we have more information to share! </p>



<p>Stay vigilant, Raiders – and we’ll see you Topside when we’re through this.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> has a new Headwinds game update that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">amongst many other things</a>, removes an extravagantly drawn-out puzzle from the game’s Buried City map. Introduced in December, the puzzle in question saw people tracking down and pushing 15 buttons in a certain order to unlock a secret chamber containing an actual, strummable guitar. As of this updating, you’ll now be able to buy that guitar at Shani’s, like a millionaire tourist paying to be flown to the top of Mount Everest. </p>
<p>I regard this as a dilution of the game, on paper, but I am not one of the players who’ve driven themselves crackers trying to get hold of the instrument (or paying real money for the battle pass to unlock it). Arc Raiders is a multiplayer game, of course, so even if you survive being shot at while stampeding between buttons, it’s possible another, distant player might innocently press one and reset your progress.</p><!--more-->
<p>I really like multiplayer puzzles, in general, especially when the game isn’t really designed for this kind of trickery. It’s hard enough lugging loot back to the elevator in Arc without getting a bellyful of bullets. One can only imagine the feats of cunning required to track down a bunch of buttons in parallel. One can only imagine the elation of bringing home the prize.</p>
<p>Still, reactions to the tweak on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pp7gdr/how_to_get_guitar_buried_city_music_puzzle_and/">Reddit</a> are mostly a mixture of contempt and relief. As one user points out, even if you unearth the guitar, there’s no guarantee you’ll have enough time to extract. Perhaps turning the guitar into a purchaseable item was all part of Embark's plan, after milking community desperation for a few weeks? It <em>is</em> a very nice guitar. You can play up to seven tunes with it. The difficulty of obtaining the thing may explain why so many wasteland buskers are getting shot in the head.</p><p>Read more about this and other Raider business in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0">the full changelog</a>. The devs have “fixed the Seedvault extraction glitch on Stella Montis that allowed players to remain in the extraction point after it had closed”. They’re also in the process of implementing a three strikes progressive ban system for cheaters, with bans progressing “from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders”.</p>
<p>Any successful examples of puzzles in multiplayer shooters to share? I guess the obvious ones to beat are still Destiny’s Raids, hashtag Vault Of Glass. There’s probably some good stuff in certain editions of Fortnite, but I forget.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Need a Mini Gaming PC Instead of the Mac Mini, This KAMRUI Hyper H2 Is 40% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-need-a-mini-gaming-pc-instead-of-the-mac-mini-this-kamrui-hyper-h2-is-40-off-on-amazon-2000663599</link>
            <guid>1418338</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re not a fan of bulky and noisy PCs taking over your entire workstation, switching to a mini PC makes sense. These offer reliable performance for everyday tasks in a much smaller (and quieter) form factor. Today is a great time to pick one up, all thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">The retailer is offering the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini PC for $460 right now, after knocking a whopping 40% off its usual $769 price</a>. And as if that wasn’t enough, you’ll also enjoy an extra 5% discount at checkout with free delivery, which brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time offer that expires soon. If you’ve been eyeing a portable, yet powerful mini PC, this is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>The PC is compact, so can easily fit into tighter spaces and cluttered desktops. You can even mount it under the desk or behind the monitor for a cleaner setup. Performance, however, is seriously impressive. The thing runs on a 14450HX processor with 10 cores (6P + 4E), and turbo speeds up to 4.8GHz. Expect roughly 60% higher multi-core performance than the i5-12450H and up to 180% higher than the i7-1185G. Translation? Smooth performance for everyday tasks such as browsing, streaming, and light office work, along with headroom for demanding projects that require more resources.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16GB of DDR4 memory to keep things running smoothly as you use the PC for a variety of needs. It’s not massive, but it still lets you multitask through busy days without experiencing slowdowns. Storage, on the other hand, is taken care of by a high-speed 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4×4 SSD, which offers enough space to house larger files, media libraries, games, and more. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage capacity are expandable, with support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and as much as 4TB of NVMe SSD storage, if your needs grow in the future. Basically, you won’t have to rely on external solutions with this at hand.</p>



<p>The system is capable of supporting a triple-display setup with HDMI 2.0, DP 1.4b, and a full-featured USB-C port that also supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, 10Gbps data transfer, and 15W power delivery. With this, you can use your primary screen to get work done, while the others for team meetings and displaying reference material. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), and USB 3.2 Gen1 ports (5Gbps). This selection makes it incredibly easy to connect all your essential peripherals like printers, keyboards, mice, and more, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Kamrui has also packed the PC with a dual-fan cooling system, which is paired with full copper heat sinks and dedicated aluminum heatsinks to ensure consistent performance, even under heavy loads. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this mini PC, especially now that it’s down to just $460.</a> This 40% discount makes the purchase a lot more affordable, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to grab the offer soon, as it could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players have observed looting speed drops and server stability issues after the latest Headwinds update. </p>



<p>Embark Studios put out the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders yesterday, introducing new features and systems like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo vs squads, Bird City, Open Parties, and more</a>, along with new content. However, some bugs and glitches accompanied the new features and system, with several players experiencing issues. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-headwinds-update-impacts-looting-and-server-stability">ARC Raiders Headwinds Update Impacts Looting and Server Stability </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-new-update-broke-looting-speed-and-made-it-a-lot-slower-the-team-is-aware-of-this-as-its-not-intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the recent Headwinds update for ARC Raiders has significantly affected looting speed. Players have reported a 30% decrease in looting efficiency when using a skill designed to speed up the process. </p>



<p>This issue has been brought to the attention of the game’s official Discord, where community managers have responded. Community admin Ossen mentioned that Embark is “actively investigating” the problem, while community manager Boirdie confirmed that the “team is aware of this, as it’s not intended.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the Headwinds update appears to be causing the servers to become unstable, with players reporting multiple glitches and being unable to move once they load in. Embark has stated that this issue is under investigation as well, according to a post by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2016474456655323351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). </p>







<p>In other news, Embark Studios is preparing to implement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new anti-cheat ban system</a> in ARC Raiders, but players don’t feel it’s close to being enough.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense</link>
            <guid>1418332</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“It's downright horrible."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of high-profile video game developers have defended <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> amid an online backlash during the game’s launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play “PvP raid shooter” was the big new game reveal at the end of last month’s The Game Awards, but developer Wildlight then went dark until the January 26 release date in a bid to channel the successful shadowdrop of Apex Legends back in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, Highguard hit a peak of 97,249 concurrent users on Steam — a significant number for any new game launch on Valve’s platform — but at the same time Wildlight has had to contend with a “mostly negative” user review rating. Meanwhile, Steam concurrents have fallen, and Highguard has slipped out of the top 100 most-played games list on Valve's platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief among the criticisms from players is that the size of the map feels too big and empty for a 3v3 competitive shooter. You’re able to summon a mount to get about faster (the mounts are one aspect of Highguard that players seem to universally like), but some believe a 4v4, 5v5, or even 3v3v3 mode would have been a better fit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also complaints about the resource-gathering phase of each map, which involves what some are calling boring mining and loot farming. The gist here is there is too much downtime and a lack of excitement, although players seem to be enjoying the raid phase of each match, where combat is concentrated. There is also criticism of the design of the playable characters, Highguard’s art direction, and a lack of content — as well as performance problems particularly on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all is a feeling that Highguard perhaps suffered from being the “one more thing” reveal at The Game Awards, where it might have better managed expectations in a slot earlier in the show. Wildlight staff have indicated they originally planned a true Apex Legends-style shadowdrop for Highguard, but The Game Awards chief Geoff Keighley asked the team about featuring it at the end of the show. Keighley has subsequently suffered a backlash of his own, with some feeling Highguard’ position in The Game Awards’ running order overly hyped the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Opening X this morning! <a href="https://t.co/NQXGvOvjYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NQXGvOvjYL</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2016245348210245655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, developers from the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian as well as Fortnite maker Epic have hit out at the discourse surrounding Highguard, and the internet’s capacity to “hate” on video games at launch. Developers like Cliff Bleszinski of Gears of War fame, Epic executive Mark Rein, and Larian boss Swen Vincke spoke up against, in particular, negativity from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t like people s****ing on things others have created,” Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016287197490491396" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to suggest</a> a Metacritic-style scoring system for reviewers, based on how others evaluate their criticism. “I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint,” he said. “The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want  to publish something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016292319658410345" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “And yes — I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say — I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough. No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.“</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016317086465749120" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up post</a>, Vincke added: “What I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are  sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most. When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care. The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's other ways of dealing with player exploitation. Not playing the games is probably the best one. You don't have to verbally hurt the people behind the game to express your disdain. If enough people stop playing the games that don't respect players, those in charge will get the message and change course soon. There's enough other games there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cliff Bleszinski, whose own live service shooter LawBreakers was a commercial failure, leading to the closure of his studio, <a href="https://x.com/therealcliffyb/status/2016245017073877329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a>: “When did it become trendy to hate on a new game? Been seeing it more and more in recent years. It's exhausting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s downright horrible,” Mark Rein, vice president and co-founder of Epic Games, <a href="https://x.com/MarkRein/status/2016346300367729008" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commented</a>. “Especially a FREE game from a new studio. Just so sad. This is a hobby for people, they should approach with joy not hatred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that Wildlight faces an uphill challenge turning online sentiment about its live service shooter around, and the studio will be particularly concerned by Highguard’s Steam user review rating, which remains ‘mostly negative.’ Currently, 37% of the 19,439 user reviews are positive; Wildlight plans to continue to update Highguard with various patches, and has announced its 2026 roadmap of content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to one person on social media who asked if he had a financial stake in Highguard’s success. “lol absolutely not,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
