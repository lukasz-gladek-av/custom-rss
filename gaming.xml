It’s the big one, folks. Please leave all your golf clubs at the door on your way in so as not to impart any more emotional damage to your fellow readers. Get your “Fore!” or “birdie” jokes out of your system.  Anyone who played <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> knew what was coming, but there’s still a lot to unpack in how HBO’s live-action show adapts one of the most harrowing moments in the series.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197530" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 28 Years Later Trailer Feels Like The Leftovers Meets Survival Horror" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="135" data-playlist="197530,197527,197525" data-current="197530"><div><p>The 28 Years Later Trailer Feels Like The Leftovers Meets Survival Horror</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197530/197530_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23061.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h312786"><a id=""></a><strong>A never-ending nightmare</strong></h2><p>We start with Abby (Kaitlyn Dever) walking through a dark hallway, the very same hallway that Joel (Pedro Pascal) walked down to save Ellie (Bella Ramsey) in season one, unknowingly sealing his fate. At first, it seems like she’s alone, but then we hear another voice. Well, it’s her own voice, but from another version of her who knows what awaits her if she presses on. She tries to tell her to turn back, even going as far as to tell her that “his” brains are on the floor in an attempt to scare her off. But Abby doesn’t believe her other self and heads in anyway, and we hear her crying as she finds the scene on the other side. She then wakes up on the cold floor of an abandoned cabin outside of Jackson. It was all a dream. A nightmare, really.</p><p>Abby walking down that hallway in her nightmares is a recurring sequence throughout <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. Every time she does it, there’s something slightly different to illustrate her mental state. The major difference in the show is the presence of this second Abby, who tries to steer her away from the door at the end. Whereas in the game Abby’s motivations aren’t revealed until much later, the show makes it clear almost immediately that she’s an ex-Firefly with very personal reasons for wanting to kill Joel for what he did at the end of season one. I’m still baffled by this choice, when withholding these details from us was a key source of narrative tension in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p><p>After <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994">season two’s first episode premiered</a></span>, I saw several people online echoing this sentiment. <em>The Last of Us </em>laying everything bare this early isn’t just an embellishment of the sort you might see in most adaptations; it fundamentally undermines the core dissonance of the story it’s recreating for a new audience, without offering anything new to replace it. Abby is a divisive character by design. The game forces you to play as her, do things you might not agree with, and <em>then </em>it tells you how she got to this point. The show, meanwhile, seems uninterested in maintaining that suspense. It would rather skip to the end and tell you that Abby is a sympathetic figure without giving you a chance to believe anything else.</p><p>In fairness, the internet has made this story and Abby’s place in it a dumpster fire to engage with. Game actor Laura Bailey received <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">threats to her family</a></span> for playing the role, and the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-part-2-abby-actor-joel-spoilers-1851624206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-part-2-abby-actor-joel-spoilers-1851624206">beefed up security for Dever</a></span> when she shot her scenes this season. I understand the inclination to try and mitigate any of the backlash, but this is one of the most regrettable examples of <em>The Last of Us </em>show feeling shaped by discourse rather than being the daring narrative trailblazer the games were.</p><p>As Abby wakes up, she finds Owen (Spencer Lord) has already been up and scouting out Jackson while everyone else has been sleeping. He’s discovered the town is heavily guarded and nearly impossible to infiltrate. But patrols are coming in and out of the enclosure, and Abby suggests they find one of them and threaten them into revealing where Joel is. Mel (Ariela Barer) immediately objects. The plan was to take out Joel and no one else. Abby backtracks and says her threats would be bluffs, but it’s clear her bloodlust outpaces everyone else’s. Owen breaks the tension by saying he has a concept of a plan that he’s working on, but Abby can’t just stand around and goes to keep watch with an assault rifle in hand. Wherever she and her friends are coming from, they’re heavily armed.</p><p>Owen’s plan, however, doesn’t end in Joel’s death. It ends with the group heading back to wherever they came from by convincing Abby to abandon this vendetta. The rift between Abby and her friends was apparent last episode, in which everyone else was more concerned with their survival while Abby was solely fixated on revenge. But will the fact that not everybody is as gung-ho about killing Joel at any cost be enough to pull Abby out of this blood rage?</p><h2 id="h312787"><a id=""></a><strong>Bridges mended(?)</strong></h2><p>We now see Ellie’s hut in Joel’s backyard, and the camera notably lingers on her acoustic guitar. The last time we saw the instrument, Joel was playing it on his back porch as Ellie walked past him, and now it’s back in her home. Put a pin in that for a few paragraphs. Jesse (Young Mazino) is here to collect Ellie for her patrol and also give her a hard time for her kiss with Dina (Isabela Merced) the night before. As the two head to get their horses, Jackson is gearing up for something big. Infected are showing more signs of intelligence, including using their own dead as insulation against the cold weather and as a decoy to draw in prey. Between this and the Stalker Ellie encountered last episode, Jackson is on high alert for infected, and not even considering what other dangers might be lurking outside the wall.</p><p>Ellie attempts to get away from Jesse’s older-brother condescension by saying that she wants to do a patrol with Joel instead. This sets off alarm bells for Jesse, as the last time anyone saw the two interacting, it was with Ellie screaming at him in front of a crowd of drunken townsfolk. Ellie puts her foot down and tells Jesse that everyone in Jackson can stop whispering about her tense relationship with her father figure because they’re working shit out. It’s a notable departure from <em>Part II</em>, in which Ellie only gestures at this reconciliation in a brief exchange with Dina, where she says she’s thinking about having a movie night and watching some <em>Curtis and Viper</em>, Joel’s favorite action flick. But this is HBO’s <em>The Last of Us, </em>in which subtext must be written out in giant neon signs for an audience the show doesn’t trust to follow along. With Ellie trying to go on a patrol with Joel, expressing to Jesse that their relationship is complicated but they’re working it out, and the guitar he was re-stringing being returned to her room, it’s clear <em>something </em>positive happened between them, but the only mystery that’s left is the specifics. It’s typical of how <em>The Last of Us </em>shows its cards without much consideration for how doing so cuts off the story it’s adapting at the knees, but what else is new? Ultimately, it doesn’t matter, as Joel has already left with Dina for his patrol.</p><figure id="" data-id="18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-recommend-id="image://18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-recommend-id="image://18990cefc38f3d3c473b21f834c0700d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tommy addresses a crowd inside a bar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ellie and Jesse head into one of the town’s restaurants and find Tommy (Gabriel Luna) preparing to run a drill with Jackson’s civilians for what to do if an infected horde comes a-knockin’. And as people head to their battle stations, Maria (Rutina Wesley) pulls Ellie aside for an unpleasant interaction. Seth (Robert John Burke) wants to apologize for his homophobic outburst at the dance. Or maybe Maria is forcing him to, who’s to say? Ellie wants no part of it, but Maria forces her to stand there while he says he’s sorry and hands Ellie some sandwiches. Ellie rightfully refuses to pick them up, so Maria does for her.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em>’ handling of the homophobia that has persisted through the apocalypse has always fascinated me because, depending on which interaction you’re examining, it can come off as either meaningful worldbuilding or as if showrunner Craig Mazin is kinda just winging it like a well-meaning dad trying to illustrate the struggle in ways that are often more tragic and don’t make quite as much sense as the games’ take on the subject. (The Bill and Frank episode, with all its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-bill-frank-gay-nick-offerman-bartlett-1850035741">themes of growing old in a post-AIDS crisis world</a></span>, is an example of Mazin’s take on the series getting it right.) We’ll get to examples of the latter down the line, but this scene between Seth, Ellie, and Maria that originates from <em>Part II</em> is so true to life that I and plenty of other queer people have experienced the dynamic it depicts. Maria cares less about Ellie’s righteous anger than she does about keeping the peace in Jackson. Forcing your surrogate niece to stand there and listen to a bigot who, not nine hours ago, called you and your friend a slur in front of god and everyone, is now pulling out a flimsy excuse for his behavior, is the opposite of allyship. It’s the same feeling as when your homophobic uncle says some bullshit at Thanksgiving dinner and your parents expect you to grin and bear it so you don’t ruin the holiday. No wonder this version of Ellie is so jaded at the notion of Jackson’s “community” when, at every turn, she’s being undermined by those claiming to be protecting her.</p><p>As Ellie and Jesse head out on their patrol, they see a snowstorm in the distance. They’re not concerned that it will reach Jackson, though; it should stay in the mountains. Good thing no one lives there for them to worry about, right?</p><h2 id="h312788"><a id=""></a><strong>The wolf circles her prey</strong></h2><p>Back in the mountains that are supposed to be uninhabited, Abby shivers as she keeps watch. Just as the cold is finally getting to her and she starts to head back, she hears a horse neighing in the distance. If that horse had shut the fuck up, maybe she would have turned around and went home and we could end the season here. But no. Abby sees a pair of Jackson civilians on patrol and heads in to get a closer look.</p><p>The snowstorm may not have reached Jackson proper, but it’s still interfering with the town’s radio signals. Tommy orders the patrols to come back, but Ellie and Jesse are too far out to head back through the blizzard. The pair takes shelter in an abandoned 7-Eleven once occupied by Eugene, Gail’s late husband. It’s full of weed and Firefly paraphernalia. Eugene was apparently part of the resistance group in its early days, but left when he grew tired of all the violence it entailed. We still don’t hear much about Eugene here, but Jesse does lament that Joel had to “put him down” and that he “couldn’t be saved.” All signs point to Eugene maybe having been infected, but considering Gail’s conversation with Joel last episode, it must be more complicated than that. Ellie doesn’t protest too much, but it’s clear the situation affected her. Whatever it was.</p><figure id="" data-id="91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-recommend-id="image://91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-recommend-id="image://91c891f7142574417bfa42a0259a502a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby cowers behind a collapsed fence as infected try to reach her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Back with our heavy-artillery-sporting queen, Abby is still tracking the Jackson patrol pair below the mountains. At one point she tries to scale the side of the mountain with nothing to grab onto, further driving home that she’s perhaps too committed to this mission, even at the risk of her own safety. For her recklessness, she tumbles down into a pile of frozen infected, just like the ones Jesse was warning Ellie about. Now hundreds of these fuckers are chasing her down the side of the mountain, eventually pinning her down underneath a broken fence. This scene is genuinely terrifying, and manages to capture the claustrophobia of the game’s setpiece to a fucking tee. All that tension is broken by a gunshot as an unknown gunman saves Abby from an infected that has her pinned down. Then that tension is immediately replaced by a new one as it’s revealed that Joel has unknowingly saved a woman hellbent on killing him.</p><p>The trade-off in the show revealing Abby’s intentions before this moment is that this segment is now dripping with the dread of knowing that Joel has no idea what he’s gotten himself into. Abby hears Dina call out his name, and it all clicks. Even in her adrenaline rush, she can assess the danger in front of her rather than whipping out her gun and popping a cap in her target. Instead, she takes advantage of the infected banging on the door of their shelter to lure Joel into a more secure location: the lodge where her friends are waiting.</p><p>It’s kind of a bummer that the audience watching this show already knows who Abby is, because the entire thing reads as overtly sinister in a way that you would otherwise only catch on a second viewing. When you’re playing this segment in the game, Abby is still an unknown, disorienting addition the game refuses to explain. The adrenaline is pumping, and you might not catch on to the little hints of her intentions. It makes what comes next a true gut punch. But here you’re just screaming at the TV for Joel not to go into the dark closet, which is fun in its own morbid way, but it’s at odds with the story at large. We’ll get more into this as we go through the season, but large swaths of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season lack the mystery that made the story compelling, and made dragging yourself through some heinous acts of violence to see it through worthwhile. By the end of this episode, you’re fully aware of the dynamics at play that led to this moment, and you knew it was inevitable last episode. So much of the season just ends up making you watch the brutal aftermath of something you already saw coming rather than a tangled web of grief, anger, and forgiveness to unravel and dissect as Abby and Ellie exact their pounds of flesh. I’m sad that new fans who haven’t played the games are being denied the mystery of Abby’s motivations and the speculation this allowed for, but HBO probably didn’t want to leave all those questions unanswered for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">the years between seasons</a></span>, when people who played the game lost their minds because they had to wait a couple dozen hours.</p><h2 id="h312789"><a id=""></a><strong>Danger approaches</strong></h2><p>Tommy’s retreat order has made it to every patrol except Joel and Dina’s, prompting him to tell Jackson’s radio tower to dedicate all their resources to finding them. I appreciate the brotherly love, Tommy, but you’re about to have a way bigger problem on your hands than a missing patrol. In their efforts to reach Joel, the Jackson crew starts contacting other patrols to see if there’s been any sign of them. Once Jesse and Ellie hear that those two are missing, they don’t hesitate to get on their own horses to start searching. Jackson, meanwhile, has finally found active cordyceps tendrils in its piping, and there’s a massive horde just outside the town’s perimeter. This town is about to get hit from multiple angles, and none of them have any idea.</p><p>Meanwhile, Joel, Abby, and Dina are still trying to outrun the horde on their horses, but the crowd of infected is gaining on them. That is, until the tendrils in Jackson start signaling to their pursuers, who then lose all interest in pursuing Joel and company and break off to converge with another group and head toward the town. Time to see if all of Tommy’s drills could prepare Jackson for a threat of this scale.</p><p>Citizens hunker down in underground cellars as anyone who can hold a firearm prepares to face the infected. We saw Jackson mobilize to fight bandits in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>, but the show goes out of its way to show you just how coordinated and militarized this town of survivors can be when they’re not hosting dances or throwing slurs at the local gays. <em>The Last of Us </em>is usually so focused on intimate acts of violence carried out by the player, so it’s not often that the series shows a whole community coming together to fight the infected. This is probably the largest battle ever shown in this universe, and a lot of Jackson’s defenses are made up of whatever the citizens could piece together, like makeshift barricades of heavy pickup trucks and tractors, and gasoline barrels that get pushed down rusty slides.</p><figure id="" data-id="a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-recommend-id="image://a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-recommend-id="image://a9147d551e8e6fefc390ef0ab4dbd187" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at something off-screen with a concerned expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Something I’ve always loved is how the contrast between Jackson and the Washington Liberation Front, Abby’s faction back in Seattle, also spotlights how different <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s leads are. Ellie’s kit is made up of ramshackle traps and the kind of firearms you’d expect the average gun nut to have kept around their house before the world went to shit, whereas Abby has military-grade weaponry that would shred through infected without much effort. Even when society has collapsed, <em>The Last of Us </em>has signifiers of status and wealth, it just manifests itself in militarized weaponry rather than a hastily made nail bomb. Seeing Jackson have to make do with whatever it has on hand while Abby and her crew are carrying around killing machines on their backs is an early reminder of the disparity between these two women that only becomes more clear when you play as them. I’m curious to see how else the show can make those different approaches to violence and survival these two women have been taught clear when we’re only able to watch them rather than inhabit them.</p><p>As Joel sees the carnage surrounding Jackson from a distance, he nearly turns back to help with the fight before Abby once again lures him away with the promise of ammunition and manpower to take to the infected. They sure could use their help down there as the horde breaks through the defenses thanks to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hbo-last-of-us-bloater-infected-kills-perry-explained-1850089658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-last-of-us-bloater-infected-kills-perry-explained-1850089658">giant bloater</a></span> joining the pack. The infected assault on Jackson is pretty disheartening to witness, as they tear through one of the only known functioning civilizations we’ve seen in this world. Buildings that were just full of people are torn asunder, and people who were ready to defend the community run away in fear, taking valuable weapons with them. By the time Tommy manages to peel off the bloater from the horde it feels desperate, a last-ditch effort to save <em>anything</em> in what starts to feel like a lost cause. As the giant infected endured an endless stream from Tommy’s flamethrower, for a moment I thought the show might take a big swing and kill Joel’s brother in a tragic big hero moment, but eventually the infected succumbed to the fire, and Benji still gets to have a dad. Hey, at least someone gets to have one in this story, am I right?</p><h2 id="h312790"><a id=""></a><strong>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned</strong></h2><p>Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself. Back at the lodge, Abby’s friends are searching for their missing leader, only for her to show up on horseback with her prey in tow. She ushers the group inside the shelter and attempts to warm herself. Mel gets a chance to show off her medical skills by helping Dina with some frostbite. Even as she’s being treated, Dina keeps her wits about her and realizes she doesn’t know where any of these people came from. They have wolf patches on their gear with a “W.L.F.” logo, but when Dina asks who they are, Abby offers no explanation beyond their names. When she tells the room that these two are Dina and Joel, the temperature manages to drop below the freezing cold of the blizzard outside. Joel is too preoccupied with trying to reach Jackson to notice the tension in the room until Manny (Danny Ramirez) puts a gun to Dina’s head. Abby says no harm will come to her if Joel cooperates. She orders Mel to drug Dina to put her to sleep, and when the doctor shows hesitation, Abby says she’ll “smash [Dina] in the fucking head” if she doesn’t. Mel promises the panicking Dina that this will only put her to sleep for an hour, and then she even looks to Joel to reassure him. This group came to Jackson intending to kill Joel, and everything else this has required of them was not part of the plan. Except for Abby, that is.</p><p>Nora (Tati Gabrielle) disarms Joel, and as a brief aside, her shaved head in the present day makes her look pretty much identical to her character Jordan from Naughty Dog’s upcoming PS5 game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a></span>. That’s brand synergy if I’ve ever seen it. Hopefully, <em>Intergalactic</em>’s writing has some of the subtlety of the <em>Last of Us</em> games because my god, the way this whole scene just lays it all out is so tiresome. Joel pieces together that Abby’s crew isn’t a group of common raiders; they’re military, but they’re also Fireflies. Well, ex-Fireflies, as Abby clarifies. The resistance group pretty much dissolved after Joel did mass murder in Salt Lake City last season, and now we get Abby whipping out a villain’s monologue to tell Joel about everything he put her through when he decided to kill dozens of people to save Ellie’s life.</p><figure id="" data-id="55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-recommend-id="image://55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-recommend-id="image://55b7fc7721d1e278f8667e3df2e33ff2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joel looks down at something off-screen from a balcony." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She verifies every part of the description she was given five years ago, including reminding everyone in the room that Joel is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479">“pretty handsome.”</a></span> At this point, I’m convinced that line is part of Pascal’s contract because why is Abby saying this shit to the man who killed her father? I admit I’m nitpicking this line, but it’s just a microcosm of my biggest problem with how this scene drags out what was a vicious, unrelenting moment in the source material. Abby had no desire to explain herself to Joel in <em>Part II</em>, and it felt pretty meaningful that even by the time that game was over, Joel and Ellie didn’t know who she was or why this vendetta was so important to her. But again, that’s not speaking intention into the camera, and that kind of unspoken storytelling has no place in HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em>. Instead, we get dramatic theatrics so Dever has more lines to read and everyone is on the same page about what we’re supposed to feel.</p><p>As Abby continues monologuing, she finally gets a confession out of Joel for what he did in Salt Lake City, and then she gets to work. She shoots him in the leg with a shotgun, knocking him to the ground, and demands that Mel tourniquet his leg and stop the bleeding. Mel once again hesitates. This is far beyond what she signed up for, but Owen tells her to just do what they came here to do. Abby gets in close here and tells Joel what her damage is. Her father was the surgeon who was supposed to operate on Ellie before Joel’s violent intervention. Then she fills us in on what she’s been doing for the last five years: living in Seattle as part of the Washington Liberation Front. There, she and the other soldiers have a code not to kill people who cannot defend themselves. But what Joel did was wrong, and so the code goes out the window.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>The Last of Us </em>launched in 2013, I have always found Ellie to be the character I related to most. She’s an angry queer nerd who has a fraught relationship with her family, has had so many things she wanted in her life denied to her, and is more or less dragging herself through life in hopes that one day she will find meaning again. That being said, even with all those parallels between me and her, I have never resonated more with a <em>Last of Us </em>character than when Joel told Abby to “just shut the fuck up and do it already.” All this theater and undoing of what made the original story compelling, and for what? Easy answers spoon-fed to the audience like they’re babies eating slop? What a shame. I’m so disappointed that this will be the version of this scene so many people will see first, if they even go looking at the original, that is.</p><p>I’m probably going to keep pontificating about the goals of video game adaptations in these weekly recaps because <em>The Last of Us</em> remains one of the oddest case studies in the growing, lucrative business of repurposing video game stories for other media. All the claims that <em>The Last of Us </em>is a no-brainer for a TV or film adaptation often boil the games down to the cutscenes, as if all the hours between those moments weren’t adding anything to it all. If there was nothing to be gained by actually playing out Joel, Ellie, and Abby’s actions, then what purpose would there have been in making it a video game to begin with? <em>The Last of Us</em> is so preoccupied with recounting plot points like a Wikipedia summary that it lacks any real insight into why those events were arranged in a way that made them meaningful to play through.</p><p>Maybe you can’t completely recreate the sense of betrayal the player experiences when Abby blows out Joel’s knee because it feels so personal. After all, you were made to inhabit that role without knowing where it would lead. The quickness with which it happens is disorienting and you’re left with no answers, only a lingering sense of shock and deception, and you have to sit with it for <em>hours </em>of game time before you’re given any explanation. Sure, that’s not easily translated to a TV show, but you can replicate some of that uncomfortable dissonance by keeping viewers in the dark in the same way you did players. Watching Ellie slaughter people who, unbeknownst to her, were also grieving someone they cared about, and only later revealing the truth of Abby’s motivations might not evoke the same guilt and complicity that the game attempts to by making you play out those actions, but it can still approximate the crucial elements of how the story was constructed rather than haphazardly telling a new audience the chronological events with no real vision.</p><p>That’s lost here, however, as Abby tells Joel everything she’s been feeling for five years, and it makes me wonder what Mazin thinks <em>The Last of Us </em>games were. Are they just a series of events that happened that you could watch with a controller in your hand, or were they a crafted experience meant to invoke specific feelings about our connections to the characters as whom we play? Yeah, maybe you can’t imitate that feeling exactly in passive media, but you sure as hell don’t have to pretend it was a negligible part of what made the story effective. <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>is a thorny, divisive tale <em>because </em>it’s a video game, not despite it. But in this moment, I don’t believe the team behind the show views it that way. This kind of translation feels like they view the attachment (or, in some cases, the deliberately cultivated distance) between player and protagonist as a fun bonus rather than something integral to its DNA; almost like they didn’t even think it was worth attempting to emulate for viewers.</p><h2 id="h312791"><a id=""></a><strong>“If I ever were to lose you…”</strong></h2><p>Ellie finally happens upon the lodge and notices Joel and Dina’s horses outside. As she enters, she hears screams from the upper floor and walks upstairs with her gun at the ready. But as she enters, she’s shocked by the bloody sight in front of her and doesn’t notice Manny at the door. He knocks the gun out of her hand and throws her to the ground, but she does get in a good cut with her switchblade before she’s restrained. She calls out to Joel to get up, but all he can do is watch her from across the room. Owen, clearly shaken by how slowly Abby has dragged this out, tells her to end it. Ellie begs for Joel’s life, but Abby uses the now-broken golf club to stab him in the back of the neck. It doesn’t have quite the impact of her caving his skull in with the club, but it gets the job done, I suppose. Part of me wonders if this is just a tweak made to avoid showing Pedro Pascal’s head caved in, but he was already bloody and swollen at this point. Or maybe it was an attempt to make sure the golf memes don’t break containment for the general audience. Either way, weird deviation.</p><p>As Ellie’s ears start ringing from the adrenaline flowing through her veins, Owen and Manny argue about something, but we can’t hear what. Ellie shouts to the room that she’s going to kill all of them, prompting Manny to kick her in the chest and knock the wind out of her. She crawls to Joel’s corpse as the group leaves. They said they were only here to kill Joel, and despite everything, that seems to be true. When she reaches him, she removes the broken club from his neck and then cuddles up against him, which is when I raised my eyebrows and laughed uncomfortably to no one. Again, it feels like this show cannot just let a moment or feeling be expressed without laying it on thick, even if it starts to feel morbid and performative.</p><p>Then, like an angel descending from the heavens to remind me that a better version of this story exists, original Ellie actor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOpj33AbXxI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOpj33AbXxI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashley Johnson’s cover of “Through the Valley”</a></span> plays over the final scene. Abby and her crew silently walk away, presumably back to their home in Seattle; the people of Jackson slowly pick off the remaining infected; and Jesse arrives at the lodge to help bring Joel’s body back to Jackson.</p><p>When I played this segment for the first time in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> back in 2020, I bawled in the way that leaves you feeling like shit the next morning. When I watched HBO recreate it, I couldn’t stop laughing. Maybe this is one of those things that will always just be poisoned by me having such a vivid recollection of the original scene. If this is your first time finding out about what Abby did to Joel, I hope it still hits for you. For me, it was just another succinct reminder that this show doesn’t have a strong understanding of the work it’s adapting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And on the keyboards side, for instance, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23858523/logitech-pro-x-tkl-lightspeed-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date-specs-features">Pro X TKL</a> has <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-keyboards%2Fpro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.html" rel="sponsored">gone up to $219.99</a> from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250303235239/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/pro-x-tkl-wireless-keyboard.920-012154">$199.99 before</a>. One keyboard Dougherty calls out, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250321205050/https://www.logitech.com/en-us/shop/p/k400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119">previously $27.99</a> K400 Plus Wireless Touch, <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fp%2Fk400-plus-touchpad-keyboard.920-007119" rel="sponsored">went up by $7 to $34.99</a> — a relatively small increase that, at 25 percent, is one of the higher price bumps Logitech made.</p><p>Dougherty notes a few products that didn’t see price increases, including the MX Ergo mouse and the G703 gaming mouse. And according to the video, a handful of products have actually dropped in price, like the Pro X Superlight mouse, which <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207231555/https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/pro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html">was $159.99</a>, but is <a href="https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/482924/499820/8585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitechg.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-mice%2Fpro-x-superlight-wireless-mouse.910-005940.html" rel="sponsored">now $149.99</a>.</p><p>Logitech doesn’t seem to have publicly announced the price changes, so we can’t say for certain when or why it made the changes. The most likely explanation is that it’s a response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">President Donald Trump’s global tariffs</a>, which the company cited earlier this month as it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647130/logitech-has-withdrawn-its-fiscal-year-2026-outlook-because-of-tariffs">withdrew its financial outlook</a> for fiscal year 2026. Logitech didn’t immediately respond to our request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We might be mere hours before the announcement and simultaneous release of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914036912509407602" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Detective Seeds</a> (the post has now been removed <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1914046038907772973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at someone's request</a>), the game could launch tomorrow at 12 PM Eastern Time. Meanwhile, the excited community <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1k3kq3i/page_on_virtuous_website_for_oblivion_remastered/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found traces</a> on the Bing search engine of a dedicated game page on the website of Virtuos, the studio behind the remaster.&nbsp; Whether it's really coming out tomorrow or not, multiple insiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">concur</a> that Oblivion Remastered should shadow drop sometime in the coming week. Let's recap its history of leaks and rumors, then.</p>
<p>In September 2023, an internal document shared as part of the FTC vs. Microsoft trial <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Bethesda planned to make an official Oblivion remaster (as well as a Fallout 3 remaster, which, however, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-fallout-3-remaster-anytime-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is further away from release</a>, according to the latest rumors).</p>
<p>After well over a year of no further info, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new report in January 2025</a> (based on the resume of a former Virtuos employee) not only discovered that Oblivion Remastered was indeed coming, but also revealed a lot of its features. It would be powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and it would feature improvements in six key areas: HUD (Heads-Up Display), Stamina, Sneak, Blocking, Archery, and Hit Reactions. Earlier this week, the first screenshots were found online on a Virtuos webpage, previewing the massive graphics improvements that players will be able to witness.</p>
<p>Now that the remaster is nearly official, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got a comment from Rebelzize</a>, Project Leader of the total conversion mod Skyblivion, also scheduled to launch in 2025 after nearly a decade of work in the team's spare time. Rebelzize maintained a positive outlook, focusing on the experience gained and on the project's uniqueness instead:</p>
<p><em>Luckily, this thing was all about passion from the start, and it still is. I've gotten more out of this than I ever imagined: friends, experience, and it made me realize I wanted to work in the gaming industry, which I ended up doing, and at the end of the day, it only exists because Bethesda allowed it, so I guess if the official remake is real, it's good that we were still allowed to exist at all. Gonna focus on the release of our own version and stay positive.</em></p>
<p>Are you eager to step back into Cyrodiil once again? If so, do you plan to play the official remaster or the fan-made one? Let us know below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 Is the First Nintendo Switch 2 Game Confirmed to Use NVIDIA DLSS]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-first-nintendo-switch-2-game-confirmed-to-use-nvidia-dlss.1169004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is the first game confirmed to use NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch, despite the currently available footage not featuring any indication of the upscaler being used.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> revealed they received official confirmation from CD Projekt RED that <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-development-more-seven-weeks-the-witcher-3-nintendo-switch-2/">Cyberpunk 2077 on Switch 2</a> uses a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. DLSS is reportedly used in all four display modes - docked Quality and Performance, and handheld Quality and Performance.</p>
<p>After having received confirmation, Digital Foundry went back to the footage available in the best possible quality to see if there's any clear indication of the upscaler being in use, but the low post-processing quality, which is at a lower resolution than the rest of the footage, makes it difficult to spot some of those DLSS "edges" that show the upscaler being in use, although some were still found upon a closer inspection of the footage.</p>
<p>Besides confirming that Cyberpunk 2077 uses NVIDIA DLSS on Nintendo Switch 2, CD Projekt Red also confirmed that, while all modes target 1080p resolution, except for handheld Performance mode, which targets 720p, dynamic resolution scaling is in place, and the scaling can range from 2x and up per axis, meaning that we are looking at a 540p to 1080p range for the display modes targeting 1080p and a 360p to 720p range for Performance handheld.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #210: Next-Gen Sony Handheld , Cyberpunk DLSS on Switch 2, Docked VRR In Question" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z44nLuk4m-8?start=1216&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 launches on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5th, the same day the console launches in most regions. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One.</p>

This time, it’s through the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle, a new Battle Royale season that starts May 2nd and features Darth Jar Jar and the debut of Force Lightning, a new in-game ability. The news was appropriately <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">revealed at Star Wars Celebration</a> in Japan. As with most <em>Fortnite</em> seasons, this one had been heavily rumored in the runup.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Darth Jar Jar is a <a href="https://screenrant.com/star-wars-darth-jar-jar-theory-explained/">goofy fan theory</a> that holds that Jar Jar Binks was secretly a Force user and possibly the real villain of the <em>Star Wars</em> prequel trilogy.</p><p>Ahmed Best, the voice of Jar Jar Binks since <em>Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace</em>, said on stage at the event that he improvised some Darth Jar Jar lines for the portrayal. When asked to list any of his favorites, he said, “‘I am the phantom menace’ was totally [improvised],” adding that the line was something he’s “been meaning to say for over 20 years.”</p><p>Galactic Battle will include X-Wings and TIE Fighters that players can pilot, themed maps, and “all-new Item Shop offerings including Mace Windu.” Players will also be able to buy put their hard-earned Fortnite V-Bucks towards a <em>Star Wars-</em>themed Battle Pass with characters like Emperor Palpatine and Wookiee Cuddle Team Leader. Galactic Battle will play out over five weeks with different themes leading up to a narrative live event. Here’s the schedule, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/swcj-2025-fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle">from StarWars.com</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>Imperial Takeover – May 2, 2025</p><p>The Pull of the Force – May 8, 2025</p><p>Mandalorian Rising – May 22, 2025</p><p>Star Destroyer Bombardment – May 29, 2025</p><p>Death Star Sabotage – June 7, 2025</p></blockquote></div><div><p>Of course, this is far from the first collaboration between the two pop culture behemoths.

<p>Whilst Fortnite has teamed up with Star Wars before, this marks only the third time in Fortnite's storied history that it has dedicated an entire season to a specific IP, and both prior instances were focused on Marvel.</p> <div>

<p>Right now, the details are pretty sparse - for instance, we don't yet know what characters will, or will not, be added to the battle pass, but there's a number of familiar faces in the teaser above - and it's thought this season will run a little shorter than usual, possibly clocking in at around 30 days. We'll confirm when we know for sure, of course.</p>

            <p>Pocketpair has responded to Nintendo's legal action by asserting the patents The Pokémon Company believes Pocketpair has contravened are invalid due to other games that came before it, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, Tomb Raider, and even Nintendo's own Legend of Zelda series.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/pocketpairs-defenses-against-nintendos-patent-lawsuit-unpacked-ark-craftopia-zelda-ff14-etc-may-render-asserted-patents-invalid/">Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-dev-fights-nintendo-lawsuit-with-comparisons-to-fallout-monster-hunter-and-more/">VGC</a>), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair challenged Nintendo's patent applications which were reportedly filed between February and July 2024, several weeks and months after the monster-collecting game debuted in January of that same year.</p>
<p>Pocketpair maintains through prior preparatory briefs that Nintendo's patents-in-suit shouldn't have been granted given games using the systems and art protected by the patents were already in existence.</p>

<figcaption>PALWORLD Early Access Review: Is It Worth It?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmZl10Mlc7I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Specifically, the developer said the patents contravene art already in place in Ark: Survival Evolved, Pocket Souls, and its own Craftopia, as well as a whole list of other notable references, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/far-cry-5">Far Cry 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, Octopath Traveler, Pikmin 3, Monster Hunter Ultimate, and a range of prior Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Pocketpair states that games like Rune Factory 5, Titanfall 2, and Pikmin 3 Deluxe "make it easy to see how a player character can perform an action to release a monster or a capture item (like a ball) and fire in a direction by releasing a button", whilst Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Far Cry 5 and Tomb Raider "already showed that there can be different types of throwable objects".</p>
<p>Furthermore, Pocket Souls, Octopath Traveler, Monster Super League and Final Fantasy 14 "made it easy to imagine that one could pick targets on the field and then show an indication of how likely the capture operation is to succeed", and "generally speaking, it has been an element of the Pokémon series for more than 30 years that different capture items have different success rates".</p>
<p>If, like Pocketpair believes, all these games already invalidate Nintendo's patents, "it doesn't matter whether Palworld does what such a patent describes: you can infringe an invalid patent all you want".</p>
<p>"There is no question that Pocketpair and its lawyers have made a huge effort to develop many invalidity and non-infringement arguments," the briefing by Games Fray - prepared by a patent-specialist Japanese lawyer - states.</p>
<p>"Again, a single such argument for a given patent is enough to be cleared with respect to that patent. But Nintendo is suing over three patents, and Pocketpair won’t want to lose over any single one of them."</p>
<p>As Eurogamer sumarised recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a> ever since Palworld was first revealed. Dubbed "Pokémon with guns" ahead of its early access release last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a> before Nintendo finally announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a> in September. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular.</p>
<p>As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a> but despite this, Pocketpair <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">has released a game on Nintendo Switch</a>, and is considering bringing Palworld to Nintendo Switch 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Nvidia's machine learning upscaler is used in both docked and handheld modes.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>One of the most ambitious titles lined up for the launch of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt RED</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has been showcased via work-in-progress code seen at the console's launch tour. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">Digital Foundry had the chance to go hands-on at the recent London event</a> and while our initial impressions are on the record, many questions remained unanswered. Is the port using Nvidia DLSS? CDPR has now confirmed that the answer is yes, making this the first known title to use the machine learning-based upscaling technology.</p>
<p>"We're using a version of DLSS available for Nintendo Switch 2 hardware, powered by Nvidia's Tensor cores," the firm told us. "The game utilises DLSS in all four modes: in handheld and docked, and the performance and quality variations of each."</p>
<p>DLSS has been viewed as a 'magic bullet' of sorts in the run-up to the Switch 2's unveiling. In a world where developers are pushing visual technology to the next level, running games at full native res with consistent performance becomes unviable, so rendering at lower rendering resolutions is commonplace, with upscalers used to produce the final output image. These upscalers can range from basic bilinear scaling to more advanced techniques, like TAA upscaling - where information from prior frames is fed into the current one to improve detail.</p>
<p>DLSS is a form of TAA upscaling, but with a twist - by feeding the lower resolution frame along with history from prior frames and other data, such as motion vectors - a neural network is then used to reconstruct the image. As the Switch 2's GPU includes machine learning tensor cores, there's no reason why any DLSS technology couldn't come to the Nintendo hybrid - the caveat being that there's still a computational cost to using it.</p>

<p>CD Projekt RED also confirmed that the current target for the Switch 2 version of the game is to offer different graphics modes - a quality and performance toggle for the handheld and docked versions. When connected to a TV, there's the choice of a 30fps quality mode and a 40fps performance mode. The latter would presumably operate only with the TV in 120Hz mode - a new frame for every three display refreshes, up against the 30fps quality mode which delivers a new frame for every other refresh. With consistent performance, both should look smooth, with the 40fps mode sitting between 30fps and 60fps in terms of fluidity. Both modes are using 1080p as the output resolution with dynamic resolution scaling in effect in combination with DLSS.</p>
<p>The handheld mode - as things stand - is slightly different. Necessarily so as system performance is lower. In this scenario, the quality mode is still outputting a 1080p image with DLSS and dynamic resolution scaling, again targeting 30fps. The performance mode sees the output resolution drop to 720p, with the handheld screen in 120Hz mode and 40fps as the target.</p>
<p>In terms of input resolutions, our initial pixel counts from the very, very short snippet of footage seen in the Nintendo Direct delivered readings from 540p to 1080p - and the fact we could pixel count it at all made us doubt whether DLSS was in play at all. CD Projekt RED has also confirmed that "scaling can range from 2x and up per axis", so depending on GPU load, the DLSS upscaler will be fed with anything from 540p to 1080p in the 30fps quality modes and the docked 40fps performance mode. For the handheld iteration of the performance mode, the 2x and up scaling would suggest DRS between 360p and 720p, depending on GPU load.</p>

<p>DLSS compatibility had been mentioned by Nintendo and Nvidia in previous PR, but its use in Cyberpunk 2077 (and in both handheld and docked configurations, no less) is our first confirmation of the technology being used in a launch title. However, we are seeing a slightly different utilisation of DLSS compared to PC. There, it's typically the case that post-processing elements are rendered at the same output resolution. So, if you're outputting 1080p from a 540p image, there are still components of the image that should be rendered at full 1080p.</p>
<p>It may be the case that Cyberpunk 2077 is still rendering those post-processed components at input resolution instead, which may explain why we're able to see obvious stair-stepping edges that make pixel-counting possible. As you'll see in the DF Direct posted today, it does look to be the older convolutional neural network version of DLSS that's being used - not Nvidia's freshly minted DLSS 4.0 transformer model.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">hands-on with Cyberpunk 2077 at the Switch 2 London event</a>, our impression was that CDPR's work-in-progress code was recognisably Cyberpunk, but we encountered many situations where it appeared both CPU and GPU were over-taxed resulting in some lurching drops to performance. However, the code was seven weeks old at that point with a good deal of development time remaining until the Switch 2 launch on June 5. We view Cyberpunk 2077 as something of a benchmark game - and can't wait to see final code on the new Nintendo console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/interview/649723/henk-rogers-tetris-book-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Henk Rogers first read the script for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23650577/apple-tetris-movie-taron-egerton-review">the <em>Tetris</em> movie</a>, he was shocked. “There was so much Hollywood in the movie,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “It just drove me nuts.” The film largely follows a pivotal period in Rogers’ life, when he traveled to the Soviet Union to navigate the complex rights issues for <em>Tetris</em> to bring it to platforms like the Game Boy. There, he connected with game’s creator Alexey Pajitnov, with whom he eventually formed a lifelong friendship, and turned <em>Tetris </em>into a global phenomenon.</p><p>The movie turned this experience into something resembling a high-stakes spy thriller — and while Rogers ended up loving the final product, that initial experience inspired him to tell the story of what really happened. “While reading the script I said, ‘I have to set the record straight,’” he says.</p><p>That story now exists in the form of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Perfect-Game-Tetris-Russia-Love/dp/1962603202?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored"><em>The Perfect Game</em></a>. While Rogers originally sat down to write about the events that transpired in the movie, he soon realized the story was much bigger than that. “I started writing it, and somebody looked at it and said, ‘That could be a book, it’s just not big enough,’” he explains. “I didn’t want to rewrite that part and add water, so to speak, so I added the before and after. So it ended up being about my game career.”</p><p><em>The Perfect Game</em> starts out by exploring Rogers’ early life, bouncing around from the Netherlands to New York City to Hawaii, before eventually landing in Japan, where he founded Bullet-Proof Software and went on to release the influential RPG <em>The Black Onyx</em>. Even before the book gets to the <em>Tetris</em> part of the tale, it’s filled with fascinating insight into the early days of game development. Rogers talks through the many complications and nuances of dealing with publishers and funding, as well as releasing and marketing a game in Japan despite not speaking Japanese.</p><p>But things really kicked into gear at CES in 1988, when he flew to Las Vegas in search of a new game to publish and stumbled on a puzzle game about falling blocks. As he tells it, he knew immediately that he found something special. “I left the Consumer Electronics Show with a sense of purpose,” Rogers writes in his book. “I was determined to publish <em>Tetris </em>in Japan.” That proved tricky, of course, due in large part to the web of copyright laws in the Soviet Union at the time. Rogers found himself traveling back and forth between the Soviet Union and Japan, dealing with everyone from the higher-ups at Nintendo — including legendary designer Shigeru Miyamoto — to the intimidating employees at Soviet trade organizations.</p><div><p>“There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p></div><p>Rogers’ account is a detailed one, and he says that he wrote the book entirely from memory. That said, he did check with his friend Pajitnov on a few details, which resulted in one of the book’s more charming features. At various points, Pajitnov’s thoughts are inserted into the book, where he often disagrees with Rogers on small details, like how impressed he was by the Famicom version of <em>Tetris</em> or the quality of the elevator in his apartment building.</p><p>“Alexei read my manuscript and was writing in the margins where his memory is different, so I decided to keep those and put them in the book,” Rogers explains. “There’s times when my memory is a little shady, but it was such an exciting time that I pretty much remember.”</p><p>Even if it’s missing the Hollywood thrills of the script that inspired Rogers to write in the first place, <em>The Perfect Game</em> is a fascinating read, particularly if you’re interested in game development anecdotes. And because the story covers the entirety of Rogers’ career to date, which includes setting up The Tetris Company and bringing the game to just about every platform imaginable, there are a lot of stories about pivotal points in the medium, from the launch of the Game Boy to the burgeoning days of mobile gaming.</p><p>The story is especially notable as<em> Tetris</em> continues to thrive. In addition to the movie and book, Rogers was also featured prominently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24291537/tetris-forever-review-ps5-switch-pc-xbox">Digital Eclipse’s playable documentary <em>Tetris Forever</em></a><em>,</em> and the game still pops up frequently in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/636581/nintendo-music-app-tetris-dr-mario-kirby-edit-share-playlists-update">places like Nintendo’s new music app</a>. Rogers has largely stepped away from the business, which is now run by his daughter Maya. So now when he sees the game appear somewhere surprising, it elicits a different kind of feeling. “It feels like success,” he says. “Every time <em>Tetris</em> pops up somewhere, or a new deal comes down the pike, it’s like, ‘Wow, she’s killing it.‘”</p><p>As for that movie, Rogers changed his mind when he actually saw it, describing the film as “emotionally correct,” even if it didn’t get all of the facts right. “The first time I saw it I cried about things that never actually happened,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For years, I’ve cared a lot about my wallpaper. Sometimes it’s a photo of a place I love, sometimes it’s a shot of my family, sometimes that all just looks kind of aesthetically busy and I go for something minimalist. I find a lot of wallpapers just by Googling words, but in case you’re curious, here are a few sources of stuff I’ve liked over the years:</p><div><ul><li><span><a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy"><strong>Aestheticsguyy</strong></a><strong>. </strong>I don’t know anything about this person, their account, or where these wallpapers come from, but they post a <em>ton </em>and I find myself scrolling their page at least every couple of weeks. I’ve been really enjoying their <a href="https://x.com/aestheticsguyy/status/1907914130625003910"><strong>Formula series.</strong></a></span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://bento.me/papers"><strong>Papers</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> The mobile app, like most wallpaper apps, is pretty ad-riddled, but there’s a lot of good stuff in there. But honestly, I’ve found most of the stuff I like by following <a href="https://x.com/papers_app?lang=en">Paper’s X feed<strong>,</strong></a> which is just a giant stream of wallpaper options.</span></li><li><span><a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/category/Wallpaper"><strong>Basic Apple Guy</strong></a><strong>.</strong> As you’d expect, there’s a lot of Apple-related stuff, but some of his more abstract stuff really works for me. I really love the <a href="https://basicappleguy.com/basicappleblog/liminal-spaces"><strong>Liminal</strong></a> set.</span></li><li><span><strong>The </strong><a href="https://www.backdrops.io/"><strong>Backdrops</strong></a><strong> app.</strong> This is one of the nicest selection of wallpapers – and one of the most usable wallpaper apps — I’ve found anywhere. (In the email version of this newsletter I said this was Android only, but I was wrong! It’s just harder to find on iOS.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://onlockscreen.app/wallpapers"><strong>On Lock Screen</strong></a>. I don’t tend to find all that much truly unique stuff here, but it’s a fun website to poke around every now and again. (A lot of good stuff <a href="https://x.com/on_lockscreen">on the X feed here</a>, too.)</span></li><li><span><a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/pages/wallpapers"><strong>The Verge Shop</strong></a>. This is not just a plug! I mean, it <em>is, </em>but I mean it sincerely: I got our <a href="https://shop.theverge.com/products/cellular-wallpaper-pack"><strong>Cellular Wallpaper pack</strong></a> for free because I work here and it’s still my favorite wallpaper. And if you don’t want to pay, we have<a href="https://shop.theverge.com/en-usd/products/the-verge-wallpaper-pack"><strong> a whole archive of free ones</strong></a> to poke through.</span></li></ul></div><p>I should say two things about all this. One, the wallpaper world has long been a mess when it comes to ownership and copyright — people just share these things willy-nilly. And two, there is a <em>lot </em>of generative AI at work in the wallpaper game right now. I always try to track down wallpapers I find (a reverse image search on Google often does the trick), but it’s messy.</p><p>Anyway, the reason I bring this up is because I had a conversation with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/swolewoman/?hl=en"><strong>Casey Johnston</strong></a> from <a href="https://www.shesabeast.co/"><strong><em>She’s a Beast</em></strong></a> the other day (coming soon to <em>The Vergecast!</em>), and she made a surprisingly compelling case that actually, wallpapers are bad. She argued that you don’t want your lockscreen and homescreen to be peaceful or exciting or enticing — they should be ignored as much as possible, because you should either get to what you’re doing or get off your phone. This strikes me as a very good argument! I’ve had an all-black wallpaper going ever since we chatted, and, well, I don’t know how I feel about it. I certainly don’t like looking at it as much as I used to.</p><p>So here’s what I’m wondering: what’s your wallpaper strategy? Have you had the same one forever? Do you rotate daily? Hourly? Where do you find stuff? I want to hear all about it — and also, I want to start sharing more of your homescreens in this space, too. So if you have a good one, send it my way. And we’ll be back to our regular programming next week.</p><div><p id="crowdsourced"><h2>Crowdsourced</h2></p></div><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week.

            <p>Capcom is once again warning that players cheating on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> will find some sections "unplayable" if they persist in using unsanctioned mods.</p>
<p>Taking to social media, the publisher/developer revealed it had confirmed the "unauthorised modification of game data in Monster Hunter Wilds for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more" and warned players to "stop playing immediately" if they suspect a quest has been modified after applying patch 1.010.</p>

<p>"Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game unplayable. If you suspect a quest has been modified, please do not play it, or stop playing it immediately," the statement said.</p>
<p>Capcom then posted an image to help players identified modded data, such as missing monsters, too many item limits per slot, or "bonus rewards with six or more slots in quests for one target monster". You can see it below:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>❗Unauthorized Data Modification Warning❗</p><p>We have confirmed the unauthorized modification of game data in Monster Hunter Wilds for High Rank environment Investigations, Field Surveys, and more.</p><p>Modified data can interfere with normal gameplay and even render the game… <a href="https://t.co/Z9HZuigQQZ">pic.twitter.com/Z9HZuigQQZ</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1913216880795410834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 18, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>A website <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/topics/unauthorized-modification-data/">update</a> admits that Capcom "cannot individually determine whether a specific quest has been modified", but <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1913216880795410834">added</a> in a subsequent post: "We plan to implement additional countermeasures in future updates to detect users who have engaged in unauthorised modification of game data to prevent other players from being implicated in such actions".</p>
<p>If you do suspect that a quest you are participating in has been modified, Capcom recommends you leave "immediately" and "quit the game without saving".</p>
<p>The free Title Update 1 for Monster Hunter Wilds was released at the beginning of this month, April, bringing with it new quests where players compete for the fastest hunt time. However, even then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-warns-of-monster-hunter-wilds-cheaters-as-new-update-arrives">Capcom warned of potential cheaters, which will lead to account suspension and invalid completion times</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement shared on social media, Capcom warned against cheaters and the use of external tools. "To ensure a fun and fair experience for our players, we will take action against accounts participating in fraudulent ranking activity, such as the use of cheating or external tools," it said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/19/star-wars-zero-company-details-first-screenshots-emerge-from-star-wars-celebration-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>During this weekend's Star Wars Celebration Japan in Tokyo, the team behind the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/04/14/star-wars-zero-company-a-turn-based-tactics-game-announced">recently announced Star Wars Zero Company</a> delved deeper into what fans should expect from the upcoming tactics game. Developed by Bit Reactor in collaboration with Lucasfilm Games and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor/capturing-the-fantasy">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> and Apex Legends developer Respawn Entertainment, Star Wars Zero Company puts you in control of Hawks, a former Republic officer, in a gritty story starring an original cast set during the waning Clone Wars.</p>

<p>As Hawks, you command a ragtag group of mercenaries and bounty hunters from across the galaxy to combat a dangerous, emerging threat. Hawks' appearance and class are fully customizable, and the operatives you recruit come from a wide array of original Star Wars character classes and species, including Clone Troopers, astromechs, Jedi, and more. Your squadmates are also customizable through their appearances, loadouts, and abilities.</p>



<p>While in the field, players engage in turn-based tactics missions. Player choice looks to play a role in shaping the narrative and gameplay. You can also increase the bonds between your squadmates, unlocking powerful combat synergies. Between missions, you can build up your base and leverage your intelligence network of informants to stay on top of your enemies' moves.</p>

<p>"Our vision for Star Wars Zero Company is grounded in gameplay design pillars that weave in the immersive Star Wars galaxy with engaging turn-based tactics gameplay," Bit Reactor CEO and creative director Greg Foertsch said in a press release. "It's our aim to deliver a game with an original Star Wars story from the Clone Wars era that has meaningful outcomes from player choices, and a deep turn-based tactical combat with an approachable and cinematic presentation."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2.1168848/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-rated-for-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It looks like Assassin's Creed Shadows might be coming to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> in the not-too-distant future. The news comes directly from PEGI (Pan-European Game Information), the European rating regulator, which has <a href="https://pegi.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a version for Nintendo's upcoming console. Of course, it could be a mistake, especially since the listing only appears in the 'most searched' tab and not when you actually search for the game.</p>
<p>However, chances are it's not. We know that Ubisoft has been a big supporter of Nintendo platforms ever since the original Switch. So far, for the Switch 2, they have just announced Star Wars Outlaws, which will be released on September 4 with all the DLC, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-a-pirates-fortune-dlc-arriving-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Pirate's Fortune</a>, which launches next month on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>The main doubt surrounding the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 would be of a technical nature. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is very advanced from a technical standpoint</a>. The latest iteration of the Anvil engine features virtual geometry, ray-traced global illumination, dynamic weather, wind, seasons, and destructible environments. However, it is that announcement of Star Wars Outlaws that should give fans hope. While Massive's game runs on a different engine, their own Snowdrop, it is just as advanced as Assassin's Creed Shadows, if not more so in certain areas. On PC, it's even more taxing than the latest Assassin's Creed game.</p>
<p>If the Nintendo Switch 2 could run both games decently, it would be proof that it can punch above its weight class, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-good-job-ps4-visuals-enhancements-40-fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposed to be</a> PlayStation 4-like with some enhancements here and there. Both of these games only run on the latest consoles by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Regardless, with Assassin's Creed Shadows, the lineup of the upcoming console would get even richer. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-reached-2-million-players-besting-origins-and-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> the second most successful launch after Valhalla, which launched during COVID, and critic reviews also rewarded Ubisoft Quebec's title accordingly. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was rated 8.7/10 by Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>

            <p>
Everything is expensive. Everything! Bills, food, video games, you name it. I mean, £75 for a game where you drive around as an Italian plumber? Not entirely convinced by this one, Mr. Bowser. I could get into the weeds of why all of this is happening (none of it for being particularly good reasons), but I won't because I bring word of something actually getting less expensive. Shock horror, I know, and yet here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rockfish-games">Rockfish Games</a> announcing that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everspace-2">Everspace 2's</a> upcoming Wrath of the Ancients DLC will be a bit cheaper when it launches.
</p>
<p>
Rockfish shared the news in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1128920/view/524214742651240614">Steam post earlier this week</a>, explaining that "with events happening in the world, it seems like everything is getting more expensive and there’s a lot of uncertainty in general." Said events could perhaps be in reference to a certain man in a certain position of power enacting baffling tariffs, though I could be reading a smidge too deep between the lines here. As such, while the initial plan was for Wrath of the Ancients to be priced at $30, it'll now only be $25, quite a nice little reduction.
</p>
<p>
In turn, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space game's</a> previous bit of DLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everspace-2-turns-monster-hunter-with-secret-nebula-dwelling-kaiju-that-are-essentially-living-procgen-dungeons">Titans</a> is also being lowered from $15 to $12. Great! Rockfish also quite quickly cleared up that no, "no content has been cut," and that currently they're in the "middle of our final polish and bug fixing phase ahead of release."
</p>
<p>
I am genuinely not sure I've heard of a developer lowering the cost of DLC prior to it even releasing like this before. I'm sure it must have happened somewhere along the line, but couldn't possibly tell you when. It's genuinely just quite a nice move because $5 really can go a long way. You'll be able to pick it up pretty soon too, as it launches on May 12th next month.

I always find it a bit odd when people make comparisons like "new game is the next game you really love" because you're most likely setting yourself up for some kind of disappointment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> was the most recent game to fall victim to such a framing, with many dubbing it as British <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout</a>, which it didn't end up being, nor was it likely intended to be. Thus, alongside some other issues, it's had a general reception of "yeah, it's not bad", which in a world of sequels upon sequels isn't always the response a developer might want. Still, a sequel is still clearly on developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rebellion-developments">Rebellion's</a> mind.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Rebellion CEO Jason Kingsley recently spoke to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rebellion-ceo-on-atomfalls-success-and-launching-a-new-ip-on-xbox-game-pass">GamesIndustry.biz</a> about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>, and how he's feeling post launch. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall," Kingsley explained, continuing on to say, "Happily, that risk is paying off." Guess that roughly positive, slightly mixed response isn't a huge deal then! That doesn't mean Kingsley believes the scale of the developer's projects is perfect, in fact when asked about it whether or not they've got it just right, he said he doesn't think so.
</p>
<p>
"I think that one of the things Chris [Kingsley, Rebellion co-founder and CTO] and I want to do is repeat success. So we want to do more Sniper Elite, we want to do more Zombie Army, we want to do more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/strange-brigade">Strange Brigade</a>. Now it looks like we want to do more Atomfall - it's been successful, can we find the resources to do it? I don't know."
</p>
<p>
Kingsley goes on to talk about things like those Fallout comparisons, success on Game Pass, releasing Sniper Elite: Resistance just a couple of months beforehand, all well worth reading, but no clear indication as to whether or not he thinks a sequel might come. Rebellion are obviously best known for their Sniper series these days, which continue to do well. Perhaps we'll have to wait a while longer to see if they can carve out a slice of that pie for another Atomfall.
