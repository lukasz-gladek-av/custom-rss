            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-12th-february-for-40-minutes-of-ps5-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced that their PlayStation State of Play showcase will return tomorrow, 12th Feburary, 10pm UK time – that’s 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CET, and on 13th February at 7am JST.</p>
<p>The announcement is very, very light on what we might expect to see, but we do know that the show will be around 40 minutes long, and it will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5. The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world.”</p>


<p>And that’s all that they’re saying. Not even hinting at some of the publishers and studios that are taking part. Though we do already know one that will be there:&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/06/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-august-release-date-leaks/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater release date announcement</a>, which leaked last week.</p>
<p>The MGS Delta release date trailer – <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">viewable here</a> – was accidentally uploaded to the PlayStation Store, and the page listing temporarily hosted the game’s August release date as well. The trailer teased the returning Ape Escape tie-in mode, Snake vs. Monkey, just as was found in the original release of Metal Gear Solid 3!</p>

<p>Sony only mentions the PS5 here, and while that strictly speaking would include PSVR 2 games. The VR headset obviously requires a PS5 or a PC in order to play games, so there could be some VR titles featured or games that build VR compatibility in, but Sony don’t mention it here like they have in the past. So, I think we can safely expect that this will be pretty narrowly focused on PS5 titles. Hopefully there’s some first party bangers in there, like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/17/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-1-ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, Insomniac’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/09/insomniac-are-making-a-game-based-on-marvels-wolverine/">Wolverine</a> – which was first announced way, way back in 2021 – or something completely new and surprising.</p>
<p>Maybe Kendrik Lamar will turn up and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak&amp;pp=ygUTYXBwbGUgaGFsZnRpbWUgc2hvdw%3D%3D">perform around the PlayStation symbols,</a> like he did on the weekend?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-has-a-major-security-flaw-hacker-claims/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A hacker has found a security flaw in Marvel Rivals, one of the most popular multiplayer games currently available.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://shalzuth.com/Blog/IFoundAGameExploit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shalzuth’s blog</a>, spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/528355/article/can-marvel-rivals-hackers-take-over-your-pc-or-playstation-5-remotely-hacker-finds-a-security-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>, discusses the Marvel Rivals security exploit, which lets hackers access the player’s PC and PS5. The report states that developers use “remote code execution for their hotfix patching system.” However, when the codes are executed, the “game doesn’t verify” whether the command comes from the real server. Moreover, it provides “admin privileges for the sake of anti-cheat,” making it easier for the hacker to take over the device.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those wondering about RCE or remote code execution, this is a common way for hackers to run malicious code on a player’s device if they are on an unsecured network without the victim noticing. Shalzuth also posted a video of exploiting this Marvel Rivals security flaw on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSXoH1xYIcE&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gaming laptop</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDxUaIvVxmY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation 5</a> by injecting malicious scripts while on the same Wi-Fi. He has also contacted NetEase through various channels to inform them about the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Security flaws in the gaming industry aren’t uncommon, especially with games like Marvel Rivals, which focus on online gameplay. However, the fact that a hacker can quickly take over a player’s device with the help of the game is a cause for concern, mainly when the title attracts close to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">200-300,000 players every day</a> on Steam alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-cancels-mid-season-rank-reset/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled mid-season rank resets</a> after recent backlash. Also, the game has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-section-disney-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a section on Disney Plus</a>. What are your thoughts on the Marvel Rivals security flaw? Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-the-final-preview.1106001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I was smitten with Compulsion’s South of Midnight well before I got to play a little more than an hour of it recently. From the first enigmatic trailers hinting at this Southern gothic, dark fantasy, magical realist stop-motion game set in the Deep South, to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore"><u>IGN’s own first look</u></a>, to the bigger gameplay overview at the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-release-date-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct"><u>Xbox Developer Direct</u></a> – South of Midnight struck me as a deeply moving, highly stylized game that would almost definitely make me cry. When I told the Art Director, Whitney Clayton, that I had immediately thought of that decade-plus-old movie Beasts of the Southern Wild, she confirmed that was one of their early major inspirations for its “Mythical Bayou-type location, folklore creatures, and this really heartwarming protagonist.” That, along with the “darkness and folktale fantasy” of Pan’s Labyrinth from Guillermo del Toro. Huge yes to all of that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the section that I got hands-on time with, I absolutely got the sense that all of the intrigue and hype-building was no bluff, and yet a couple elements of the gameplay still needed more time in the metaphorical oven before it’s ready to ship out. Even with those minor blemishes – which are slightly concerning because we’re just a couple months away  from its April 8 release date – I left still enamored with the setting and bubbling with curiosity about the bigger story about ghosts and environmental catastrophe driving South of Midnight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played through Chapter 3, far along enough to have some magical combat tricks as a Weaver going up against spooky figures called Haints – which is exactly where I began. (Though the question of “What exactly is a Weaver?” is yet to be explained.) Diving pretty much headfirst into a fight was expectedly disorienting, but I was reassured that all of the mapped techniques – push, pull, and what’s basically a stun move – are introduced at a pace that’s much easier to get acquainted to naturally. Part of the struggle was the autolock feature being a little loosey-goosey at times; because of the volume of Haints and where they appear in the combat area, the camera spun around the main character, Hazel, in a way that made me a tiny bit woozy.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else besides combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I eventually got the hang of the Weaving moves, plus the timing of dodging for its magic recoil against nearby Haints, and found it challenging enough but not necessarily revolutionary. But I hardly think it needs to be: South of Midnight’s charm is, well, basically everything else. As long as it’s fun (it was) and not horribly repetitive (it wasn’t), then it can, in fact, run almost purely on vibes. From each encounter with the Haints, I felt a sense of eerie dread from the lighting and fog, the blaring drums-and-horns score, the general spore-like creepiness of the Haints and their corruption. And when I finally beat their spooky asses, it culminated in a cathartic cleansing of the land, both physically and spiritually, that had been choking on its past. Hazel wasn’t just clearing out the wreckage of environmental disaster from a devastating hurricane where she lost her mother, setting her on this very journey. She was healing the ghosts of history that were haunting the land, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s kind of how the beats of the chapter went: platform around a swampy area with double jumps, glides, and magic skills to find what I’ll call “Haint holes,” clear ‘em out, and pick up little pieces of a bigger story that all point back to a Mythical Creature – this one in particular at the behest of a giant talking magical Catfish who is both narrator and seemingly Hazel’s mode of transportation around different areas. Chapter 3 didn’t end with a boss battle against one of the giants highlighted in earlier videos; instead I climbed up a giant man-shaped tree to clear the Stigma of its Wound. I swear, the game explains why it exists at all through the collected ghost stories, and houses and spaces are littered with ephemera that help fill out more of the character-building picture. But even so, the ultimate answer still felt like a cliffhanger: Who were these people and how were they connected to the bigger tapestry of South of Midnight? I gotta know!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This storybook narrative meshed peachily – pun intentional – with the luxuriously textured elements of its habitat. Clayton told me the basis of these details was rooted in making the animation feel tactile: “What would this look like if it were actually handcrafted in real life?” she said. “What kind of materials would they have been made out of to look like the thing that they're supposed to be made out of?” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of stop-motion: The team knows that not everyone is going to love the style, Clayton said, and that’s fine: “Anytime you do something a bit bold, you're gonna get polarizing feelings.” (For what it’s worth, if it’s <em>that</em> distracting, you’ll be able to turn it off outside of cutscenes in South of Midnight’s settings.) I will say, I did catch a couple of moments with frame rate issues that haven’t been fully ironed out yet, but Compulsion is aiming for 60fps on Series X by launch. And when everything is running smoothly as it ought to, South of Midnight should be a uniquely beautiful game that might even make you cry a little bit, too.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Having now played the game for about 90 minutes, the gameplay doesn't wow me. That said, South of Midnight doesn't feel like a game that needs to deliver a never-before-seen gameplay experience. The focal point of the game is clearly its celebration of the myths, sounds, culture, and language of the American South, and in that respect, South of Midnight feels like it's going to exceed those expectations.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Hazel in South of Midnight, desperate to find her mother after their home washes away in a hurricane. Early into her journey, she learns to be a weaver, a person who can both unravel the corrupting forces influencing a community and knit together constructs to glide or leap across dangerous swampland. As Hazel searches for her mom, her abilities and skills as a weaver continue to develop and she comes across numerous legendary monsters, beings who were once humans or animals and have since been twisted into mythical larger-than-life creatures by the trauma and tragedy that surrounded them in life. As a weaver, Hazel's job is to put these legends to rest.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441625"></a><figcaption>Hazel can use her weaver abilities to glide, grapple, double jump, and wall-run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441625-southofmidnight_devdirect_screenshot_15_traversal_grappling-fb018319ae4c8aa4ee73-1900x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My time with the game saw me step in during an early chapter, which immediately precedes the level and boss battle I saw during my trip to Compulsion Games last year. The chapter starts with Hazel having only recently become a weaver and making the acquaintance of Catfish, who promises to help her find her mother if she first frees him from the grip of a colossal tree that resembles a scared and sad-looking man. The level then establishes the gameplay loop that South of Midnight will presumably follow for the rest of the story: Hazel platforms through largely linear levels, encountering and fighting groups of enemies who guard the memories that detail the truth behind a local legend.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not sold on South of Midnight's platforming or combat. Admittedly, this demo made me <em>very </em>motion-sick (I assume it was the stop-motion-inspired animation style, even though stop-motion has never been a problem for me before), so I was a tad cranky by the time I finished up. Still, South of Midnight isn't an especially rewarding gameplay experience. You <em>can </em>mess up the platforming and miss a jump, but the section I played through had their platforms so close together and Hazel is so acrobatic that I never did, with the exception of one early moment when I purposely jumped into the swamp water to see whether Hazel can swim. Spoiler: she cannot. The mistake cost me a portion of Hazel's health, but since there are no enemies to contend with during the platforming sections, this setback didn't create any tension like what's seen in platformers that do something similar.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608" data-ratio="0.56842105263158" data-width="1900" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441608"></a><figcaption>Catfish acts as a guide and teacher to Hazel after she saves him.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441608-south-midnight-date_01-23-25.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the chapter I played through felt extremely early into Hazel's adventure, very much like a bike-with-training-wheels section. So the platforming could become more challenging and subsequently more fulfilling to clear later on. From what I've seen so far, however, Hazel's double-jumping, gliding, and wall-running through the bayou doesn't add any excitement to the process of moving from point A to B. The most disappointing part of the demo was a chase sequence right at the end, in which all Hazel had to do was jump back and forth between opposing walls she was running along. There was no floor, and the crescendo in the music curated a sense of tension and suspense, but when all I was doing was jumping back and forth between walls to avoid easy-to-spot gaps, it trivialized what felt like should have been this incredibly suspenseful run for Hazel's life.</p><p dir="ltr">Combat also feels somewhat trivial in service to the narrative. As a weaver, I expected Hazel to possess abilities and movements that reflected the act of suturing, knitting, or tearing, an assumption strengthened by Hazel wielding a spindle and weaving hooks as weapons in combat. Instead, Hazel uses her tools more like twin daggers, needing to dodge out of the way of enemy attacks and slash them enough times so that a prompt pops to unweave them, which Hazel does with a cinematic flourish. She possesses some abilities to augment her tools, like a stun and telekinetic shove, that use a cooldown to keep you from spamming them, and a skill tree lets you unlock additional moves for Hazel, like a ground-pound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4441535"></a><figcaption>Sometimes bottling up your feelings takes a literal bottle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4441535-4k-developer-direct-2025-1737656313349.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Altogether it's fine. South of Midnight certainly doesn't quite reach the acrobatic triumphs of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunset-overdrive/" data-ref-id="5000-183908">Sunset Overdrive</a>, nor does Hazel have a block or counter (in what I played, at least--maybe she gets one later), which are necessary mechanics for a more strategic and tactile combat experience on par with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hi-fi-rush/" data-ref-id="5000-580957">Hi-Fi Rush</a>. Since Hazel isn't all that nimble during combat, the enemies can't be all that fast and because Hazel cannot block or counter, the enemies' attack patterns can't be all that complex. What's left is a gameplay experience in which you have Hazel dodge out of the way of an enemy's clearly telegraphed attacks, wail on them with melee attacks and abilities, and repeat. Since Hazel typically takes on at least three or four enemies at a time, there's a challenge in needing to keep track of where combatants' placements are, but no enemy I fought had a particular weakness or counter to one of Hazel's moves, so the strategy of wildly slashing worked on everything. And, of course, once you thin the herd a bit and kill one or two enemies, the remaining enemies don't have the numbers to pose a rewarding challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense that combat isn't supposed to be all that hard, though, or at least not be a roadblock in the player's path. Each enemy encounter I faced had a pick-up within the combat arena that I could go and interact with to replenish Hazel's health, trivializing each fight further by ensuring I was never close to death.</p><p dir="ltr">The one big exception I could see to this is the boss battles. When Hazel faces these local legends, the encounter can play out in a few different ways. When I went to Compulsion Games' office and saw the chapter that immediately follows this demo, it concluded with Hazel taking on the colossal Two-Toed Tom. It looked incredible, with Hazel facing Tom through multiple phases of increasing difficulty, but I didn't get a chance to play it myself. In the chapter I played for this demo, the "final battle" was climbing a tree along a clearly marked path. It was quite cinematic and the slow build-up of the music made the experience feel suitably epic, but it lacked the gravitas of the Two-Toed Tom boss fight I've seen (as well as the brief look at Huggin' Molly's boss fight during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klgw-To1rqc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight trailer</a> that debuted during 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-directs-are-about-more-than-games-theyre-about-the-human-side-of-game-development/1100-6529023/" data-ref-id="1100-6529023">Xbox Developer Direct</a>). The boss battles could be where the combat mechanics come together in a more fulfilling way.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441540"></a><figcaption>Fighting Two-Toed Tom looks so much fun.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441540-southofmidnight-gameplaytrailer-screenshot-08-escapingtwotoedtom-66f0ec4aa40a264f4a92-1717959183639.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All that said: South of Midnight's art direction, soundtrack, character design, voice acting, and writing seem fantastic, so despite my misgivings with the rest of the game, I want to dive into the full story to see and hear and experience more of its world. Similar to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kena-bridge-of-spirits/" data-ref-id="5000-513788">Kena: Bridge of Spirits</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau/" data-ref-id="5000-612207">Tales of Kenzera: Zua</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-origins/" data-ref-id="5000-465527">Assassin's Creed: Origins</a>, South of Midnight feels like it's going to be an experience long remembered for its setting--the real star of the show. There's clearly been a lot of great care here to not only honor the sights and sounds of the American South, but celebrate the culture and stories told by the people who call the place home.</p><p dir="ltr">Lots of love has been devoted to the additional fantasy elements too, with fun nods to sayings or slang in regards to Hazel's abilities--she uses a bottle to collect the feelings surrounding each legend, for example, in a nod to "bottling up emotions." What I love most, however, is that South of Midnight seems to not be filled to the brim with documents to find, audio recordings to uncover, or NPCs to explain every facet of whatever fantastical scenario is happening to Hazel. So far, the game has allowed me to just exist in its fantasy, fumbling for answers alongside Hazel, maintaining the overall mysticism of the locale and the legends told about the people and creatures who live there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4441607"></a><figcaption>I really hope South of Midnight goes full gothic fantasy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4441607-southofmidnight_shakinbones_hazel_1920x1080-6818f66931e82767bb1d.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It adds an almost spooky quality to the adventure, framing Hazel as a young woman who has stumbled into something otherworldly that can never be truly understood or explained. What I've played so far has not quite reached gothic fantasy, but I have my fingers crossed that that's where the story is going. Regardless, however, the storytelling and worldbuilding is superb and the voice acting (especially actor Adriyan Rae, who voices Hazel) is remarkably strong, adding a ton of characterization to already memorable character designs.</p><p dir="ltr">I hope this love and care extends to the platforming and combat in the rest of South of Midnight, but even if it doesn't, the game feels like it will at least be an exceptional tale that's set in a very real region of the world that video games (especially in the AAA space) have largely ignored.</p><p dir="ltr">South of Midnight is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, Game Pass, and PC on April 8.</p>

                <p>Well, that was fast. Just yesterday, NetEase announced Marvel Rivals was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-adding-human-torch-and-the-thing-very-soon-alongside-a-rank-reset/1100-6529366/" data-ref-id="1100-6529366">restructuring its season rankings</a>, but that was quickly reversed.

Players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1imd0h8/marvel_rivals_dev_talk_vol10_seasonal_rank/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">immediately responded</a> with

"A common concern was the pressure associated with having a rank reset every half-season, which has made participating in competitive mode less enjoyable."</p><p>The update went on to explain how the ranks would work now with the first half of the season still concluding on February 21 at 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET. Players at Gold rank will receive the costume reward, as well as Crests of Honors for those in Grandmaster and above, and the Crest of Honor for the top 500 (One Above All).</p><p>Now when the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half. To simplify things even further, to earn more rewards players need to complete 10 matches in Competitive mode and meet the conditions by the end of the season. Rewards will include a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>"We strive to make Marvel Rivals the best game it can be, and the community is the driving force behind this mission," the statement added. "Please stay tuned to our official channels for more updates on the second half of the season. Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and we're excited to continue this journey together!"</p><p>Marvel Rivals will also add Human Torch and the Thing from the Fantastic Four on February 21. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>.

            <p>The Royal Shakespeare Company is working on its first-ever video game, an adaptation of Macbeth - but it doesn't play out as you'd expect.</p>
<p>The game, a collaboration with developer iNK Stories,is called Lili and is set in contemporary Iran. Here, the title character is inspired by Lady Macbeth and played by Cannes Best Actress winner Zar Amir.</p>
<p>As such, iNK Stories is describing the game as a neo-noir "screen-life thriller", combining live-action and interactive storytelling, and is influenced by Amir's experiences as an Iranian woman in exile battling authoritarian gendered oppression.</p>
<p>"We're really calling this genre a 'screen-life thriller', with the idea that all of this is transpiring on your desktop," iNK Stories co-founder Navid Khonsari tells Eurogamer. "The real focus for that is we want to embrace a large audience, people that naturally might not see themselves as wanting to play games."</p>
<p>Khonsari previously worked at GTA developer Rockstar as cinematic director on GTA 3, Vice City and San Andreas, as well as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> games. After leaving the company he co-founded iNK Stories with his wife Vassiliki Khonsari and together they gained notoriety for their previous BAFTA-nominated game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/1979-revolution-review">1979 Revolution: Black Friday</a> set in the Iranian Revolution.</p>
<p>Now they're working with the RSC on Lili, which was a suggestion from the company's director of digital Sarah Ellis, who was familiar with iNK Stories' work. "For us it became pretty clear that it would be abundantly thrilling to turn Macbeth, this timeless tale, into a game," Vassiliki says.</p>
<p>"Obviously all of Shakespeare's stories have transcended both time and culture, being adapted in multiple different ways... but not in this form," adds Navid. "For us, the challenge of it and the adaptation of it and making something interactive, putting the audience at the centre of this incredible story that has so many climactic moments and allow you to be in the middle of that rather than being somebody that's just observing it, was not just a great challenge, but also what a great story!</p>
<p>"It's made for that kind of player who likes to explore and really live in that world," he continues. "As we know, Shakespearean text is so rich: the backstories, the history, the evolution of each character. It was such rich material to be able to draw from."</p>

</figure>
<p>The studio worked with dramaturges to bring Shakespeare's play to life in a new setting, with help in particular from RSC board member and leading Shakespeare academic Emma Smith. It's been a collaborative effort, with Navid describing a "continual conversation and collaboration" with the RSC to be able to push the boundaries of the play.</p>
<p>So how exactly will Lili play? Players will take the role of a hacker, initially tasked with befriending Lili, but to do so means infiltrating her hardware, using the dark web and government surveillance to follow and watch her. This takes place through live-action sequences to maintain the theatricality of the original play. Later, players will use these same tools to take down the regime that's oppressed Lili, though the pair noted the game's moral ambiguity - while it loosely follows the events of Macbeth, players can still impact the narrative.</p>
<p>Macbeth has a legacy of being an "enigmatic character", says Vassiliki, with Lady Macbeth as "both a heroine and a villainess and wildly complicated". She continues: "Through the lens of 400 years, who is this woman with this thirst and ambition? How do we unpack her today?"</p>
<p>As such, Macbeth provided an "interesting entry point to touch on today's culture points" and a "perfect moment" of combining Shakespeare's play with modern day Iran. "There was a lot of electricity when we started thinking about bringing Macbeth to Iran and what are the parallels in the morality police in which we're placing this military hierarchy of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth and adapting that too," says Vassiliki.</p>
<blockquote>"There was a lot of electricity when we started thinking about bringing Macbeth to Iran."</blockquote>
<p>"When we first started looking at the story and initially digging in, there's something extremely strong and attractive about [Lady Macbeth] but we realised because of her gender, she was limited," says Navid. "The question of gender is something that's becoming globally challenging right now, not just within Iran. So we wanted to not just scratch that, but to then recognise this is obviously the huge thing that's impacting women, specifically in Iran."</p>
<p>Macbeth's infamous witches also became an entry point for the game's parallels with the play. While the team had begun development before 2022's protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini - a woman who died due to injuries sustained while in police custody - these circumstances added to the game's pertinence. "All of a sudden the country was going into this technological lockdown and the flow of information was being governed by the regime and at the same time there were hackers and people at the forefront of trying to allow information to leave Iran, but also allow people to organise within," explains Vassiliki. "That, for us, became this really beautiful parallel of the witches and Macbeth. They control the flow of information and within our world they're the forecasters of chaos. They're agents of destabilisation. They're both supernatural and sort of digital in their omnipresence."</p>

</figure>
<p>Through making the game, the pair say they have considered the intersection between theatre and games. "Theatre, as it unfolds in a live setting, there is an interplay between the audience and the performance," says Vassiliki. "Particularly during Shakespearean times... that open forum of back and forth took place. And that's actually like games in that it's all happening and unfolding in a live way whereby the player has agency, the audience has agency within that world - unlike film. What was really fascinating was working with the dramaturges, working with the Shakespearean experts, and really mining for the places where there is immersion and there is room for interpretation."</p>
<p>Ultimately, all this means Lili will be quite different to what is generally expected from Macbeth, but Navid noted the core of the story remains underneath. "We make games for global audiences and sometimes if we become too literal to the text, we feel like we'd actually be pushing our audience away," he says. "We wanted to draw them in by staying true to the material, by the themes of the material, but also make it digestible in a way and global in a way that language doesn't become a barrier for people wanting to play the game."</p>
<p>Adds Vassiliki: "It's very important to us to preserve the thematic strength of these stories. They've endured for so long for a reason. How do we make sure we're honouring that? That's been part of the relationship with the RSC in not just going hogwild with off-the-wall interpretations, but actually allowing these interpretations to further enrich the original text."</p>
<blockquote>"Forget the old chestnut that Shakespeare would be writing for Hollywood if he were alive now: what Lili makes absolutely clear is - he'd be writing for gaming."</blockquote>
<p>Really, Lili is proving the timelessness and universality of Shakespeare's plays. As Emma Smith said, as quoted in a press release for the game: "Forget the old chestnut that Shakespeare would be writing for Hollywood if he were alive now: what Lili makes absolutely clear is - he'd be writing for gaming."</p>
<p>Vassiliki extends this idea. "The linearity of traditional films don't capture the richness of the worlds [Shakespeare] created and the characters," she said. "I think games absolutely can do that, the fact they're non-linear and you can provide this canvas that allows for exploration and interaction and agency, it's so much more complicated and complex."</p>
<p>She adds: "Games are the contemporary zeitgeist of today's culture... you can see that we gravitate towards this medium because it affords us agency, it affords us a place where we can fully invest in a world and make choices as ourselves and see the consequences of how that unfolds."</p>
<p>Lili is still in development and is due for release later this year. It follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-luminous-documentary-about-staging-shakespeare-inside-gta-online-that-brings-fresh-nuance-to-the-game-and-bard-alike">release of Grand Theft Hamlet</a>, a documentary film about staging Shakespeare inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, this could be the start of a Shakespearean renaissance in video games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-soul-neo-a-remaster-of-the-classic-mmorpg-is-coming-soon-to-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul NEO</a>&nbsp;<span>will be released on February 25, and we were recently given the opportunity to interview NC America's Andrew Long, Senior Producer, and Andrew Gant, Community Manager, about the upcoming release and what players can expect from the MMORPG&nbsp;Blade &amp; Soul Live will </span>continue to exist at the same time, with updates being released for that title alongside this new and improved version of the game.</p>
<p>Before the interview, I was given an exclusive look at the game in a presentation. This presentation showed off the expansive customization available, where you can tweak characters in any way you can imagine to make them fully yours.</p>
<p>When the game launches, it will be launching with seven of the 14 classes that are currently available in Blade &amp; Soul Live. As you explore the game, there will be many different outfits that you can collect to keep your character fashionable while facing off against bosses or other players in PvP. Additionally, those who purchase the exclusive <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order bundles</a> will also get some special outfits and cosmetics. The graphics are revamped, giving the game a fresh coat of paint. As the developers stated, the story will be the beloved Blade &amp; Soul story that you know and love, with some extra improvements made along the way.</p>
<p>In the interview, I made sure to ask some of the burning questions that the dedicated community had, as well as get some answers to questions of my own.</p>
<p><strong>What went into the decision to remake Blade &amp; Soul now rather than earlier or later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> A lot of us have this nostalgia where we feel like when the game launched in our time frame, it was the best it's ever been, and so, we really wanted to relive that experience and address it with new audiences, there's a whole new generation of people who weren't even born yet, or old enough to play video games at the time Blade &amp; Soul launched. We want to have that interaction between the old and the new, playing all together in that experience.</p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is adding a lot of features to make the game friendlier for new audiences, including the addition of infinite Windwalking. Prior to this, you had an allotted amount of Windwalking that you could do before you ran out of stamina. Now, you can Windwalk as much as you like, which will allow you to scale new buildings, take pictures in new locations that you would have never been able to reach in the previous version of the game, and much more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_character_creation.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be ranked systems for PvP or PvE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> When our 6v6 battlegrounds come out, we'll have the awards attached to those. At the time of launch, there's not going to be any of those systems in the game. But, the battleground 6v6 arena does come very quickly after the launch. We want to monitor how people are going to take the launch, and we're going to enjoy that content, and when we see people getting towards the end of it, we have that content ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to add new classes that didn't exist in the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> As far as classes go, in Live we're up to 14 classes. We want to introduce those into NEO as well. We don't have a timeline exactly... As far as new classes, it's something we're going to look into; I don't have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any stories or expansions added to NEO that won't be added to Live and vice versa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I don't want to spoil anything, but that is definitely something we want to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_boss_battle.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What is your favorite part of NEO compared to Live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> It comes down to what kind of MMO gamer you are, I love adventure and exploration. I'll probably be gobbling up the infinite Windwalking and exploring every single section of the map, looking for hidden places, and probably trying to get my friends to climb a building that you've never been able to get to the top of just to take pictures. I love the new aspects and exploration journal that we've added, these little hidden unlockables that you can find from exploring the world.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I'm really excited, we've changed how the gear drops in Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In Live, you get all of your weapons and accessories at a base level, and the base level is all the same. You go through a zero to 20 upgrade system, and it's very harsh. I'm not a big fan of that system, personally. What we've done in NEO is more of a traditional style. We've really upped the drop rates of thing,s and the secondary stats are going to be randomized. You're going to be able to get a lot more gear... I'm really excited that I'm not going to have to run a dungeon a thousand times before I even see a piece of gear that is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any plans for controller compatibility down the line?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> Currently, we don't have controller compatibility at the moment. We are going to be looking at other platforms, whether it's going to be console or Steam. We're definitely looking at that right now. At the time of launch, we will not have controller support available.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> I know we have DLSS available, but I'm not sure about the other. There are an incredible amount of customizations you can do so that your machine can run NEO just fine. The recommended specifications are very similar, if not the same, as the ones for Blade &amp; Soul Live.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
<p>The team behind Blade &amp; Soul NEO has a lot planned to ensure that the game is friendly and accessible to new audiences. This includes completely optional PvP, gathering systems, and plenty of gear to unlock. The story will be authentically Blade &amp; Soul, with the improved visuals bringing a fresh lick of paint to a game that is beloved by its community. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will be available for <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free on PC</a> on February 25 in North America and Europe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has released its financial statement for the 2024 fiscal year, and the company has reported "record-breaking" sales and profits.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Krafton's sales grew by 41.8% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, while its profits grew by a staggering 54%. Both of these figures were, Krafton says, "driven by the continued expansion and sustainability of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP".</p>

<p>The figures mean that Krafton's average annual sales growth rate for the past five years stands at 20%, which isn't too shabby at all. I'm sure the studio will be happy with these numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=EiCaq-fE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=HTOeUEbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP has driven a year of record-breaking highs for Krafton in financial terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton also reported its numbers for the year's fourth quarter along with the full twelve-month span, and that quarter also brought growth for the company, with sales rising 15.5% and profit rising 31.1% year-on-year.</p>

<p>According to Krafton,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s transition to a free-to-play model, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-player-count-doubles-on-steam-after-free-to-play-launch" rel="nofollow">took place in late 2021</a>, "has continued to drive growth", along with the IP's various successful collaborations. As a reminder, those collaborations have historically included the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">Payday</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-crossover-adds-dead-by-daylight-for-spooky-frights" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>With regards to its future, Krafton says it wants to make "significant investments in securing a 'Big Franchise IP'", although it's not clear whether that means the company wants to acquire a new property or transform its&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP into a "Big Franchise".</p>

<p>The company's slate of games for this year includes the likes of survival sequel&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">Subnautica 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>inZoi</em></a>, as well as the global launch of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker Mobile&nbsp;</em>and multiplayer life sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum Together</em>.</p>

Not only does the company have a packed slate of upcoming games, but it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks</a> and the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP after Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">turned its back on the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Krafton is also planning to develop a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of global smash hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, although we don't have a release window for that yet.

While <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the follow-up to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2</em> are both due for release later in the year, questions remain about the state of multiplayer shooter <em>Fairgame$</em> and other Sony projects like Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>. </p><p>It’s also possible that this week’s State of Play could include the announcement of a <em>God of War</em> anthology that brings the older PS2 and PS3 games to the PS5. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Feeling-Examination6</a></span>, who previously leaked the existence of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, has added to the mounting pile of rumors that the <em>God of War </em>Greek saga is getting a modern re-release. Currently, of the games that preceded 2018's relaunch of the franchise, only <em>God of War III</em> has a version playable on PS5. </p><p>What’s less clear is which other games this rumored collection would feature. In addition to the numbered entries, there’s also <em>Chains of Olympus</em> and <em>Ghost of Sparta </em>for the PSP, as well as <em>God of War: Ascension</em>, the final game before the series went dark until 2018 brought the franchise into Norse mythology. What seems more certain is that if these games really are getting modern ports, they’ll likely  end up on PC as well at some point. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-release-date">Split Fiction Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The dynamic duo. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Fallout made its bright and bloody TV debut last year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">critically-acclaimed first season</a> which not only drew in viewers but also led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 actually became the best-selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, despite already being several years old.</p>
<p>It came as no surprise, then, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Amazon series was picked up for a second season</a>, with showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner later stating the team was "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>
<p>And now, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins has provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better.</p>

<p>"We're in the middle of filming it right now, we've been at it since November, and I can tell you that I thought Season one was extraordinary, personally, I was very pleased with it," Goggins said to Deadline when asked about Fallout's second season.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story. It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it.</p>
<p>"We're working really hard to make that happen."</p> <div>

<p>Earlier this year, devastating wildfires raged across multiple districts of Los Angeles, shutting down production across Hollywood and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devastating-los-angeles-fires-shut-down-fallout-season-2">impacting the filming of Fallout's second season</a> along with a swathe of other projects.</p>

			<p>As rumored in the past few days, PlayStation State of Play will return this week to provide new information on games coming to PS5 in the future.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the 40-plus-minute show that will celebrate <em>"a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world"</em> will begin on February 12th at 2pm PT / 5pm ET | 11pm CET / February 13th at 7am JST. As usual, the show will be streamed on YouTube and Twitch in English and Japanese.</p>
<p>With games like Ghost of Yotei and <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> scheduled for release this year on PlayStation 5, there's a very good chance we will learn precisely when the two games will be released during tomorrow's State of Play. The show may also feature some surprises, including the announcement of a collection featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/">remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series</a>. The release date for Rogue Factor's Hell is Us, which was revealed to be September 4th yesterday, is likely going to be confirmed during the show as well. Hopefully, tomorrow's presentation will also hold more surprises, as the previous State of Play did back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">September</a> when the aforementioned Ghost of Yotei was officially revealed.</p>

			<p>CCP Games has announced that EVE Frontier will be getting a 10-day free trial, where players who register as 'Remnants' will get to experience the new Space Survival MMO as the development continues on in the Closed Alpha. On February 14, players will be able to dive into the game and see what they can expect from it over a ten-day period. As long as you have registered an account, you will be able to dive into it completely free. This trial will be available for both <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/40wUM3LFZOlUcZfxEIZrYK?si=fe598053f71a40e0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC and Mac users</a>. A teaser trailer to celebrate the free trial has been posted on the EVE Frontier YouTube channel. You can check it out below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVE Frontier - Free Trial | PC &amp; Mac" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/phOVTd-7QBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This title is a player-driven Space Survival MMO created by CCP Games, where you are cast out into a vicious cosmos, lost to time and light. To be able to survive out there, you will need to explore space, exploit it when needed, and expand your base to be able to fend off against evil forces. The Frontier, in particular, is a shattered region of space that is continuously being warped by nearby supermassive black holes.</p>
<p>Thus far, EVE Frontier has been in Closed Alpha since 10 December 2024. People are able to access the Closed Alpha by acquiring Founder Access, which will give players access to the Closed Alpha, where they will have persistent access throughout every update and development that is released for the game. Along with this, those with Founder Access will be able to provide feedback for the developers and get special rewards such as cosmetics, access to developer streams, and more. If this sounds like something you would want to purchase, you can obtain Founder Access to the game for $39.99. There are <a href="https://wccftech.com/founder-access-for-eve-frontier-announced-closed-alpha-starts-december-10/">multiple tiers</a> available, with all of them offering different rewards.</p>
<p>It's important to note that if you choose to obtain Founder Access, you will be subject to an NDA during this time.</p>
<p>This MMO will be free-to-play once it launches, with an optional subscription that will be available.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more information about EVE Frontier, there is an <a href="https://www.evefrontier.com/en/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansive FAQ</a> available on the official website that dives into cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and open-sourcing for those who want to know more about the ins and outs of EVE Frontier.</p>
<p>Will you be playing EVE Frontier during the free trial period? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that a new PlayStation State of Play show will air tomorrow, featuring updates on "exciting games from studios around the world".</p>

<p>Announcing the showcase on its PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, Sony says the new State of Play will last for 40-plus minutes and that it'll air at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT, so make sure you grab your coffee if you're planning to stay up for it).</p>

<p>The show will be broadcast via Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PlayStation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channels, and you'll be able to watch it in either English or Japanese, depending on your whim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=uD0c1482 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=ETbep27N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tomorrow's State of Play could bring that&nbsp;<em>MGS Delta&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what are we likely to see during the show? Well, naturally, Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what will be showcased, so we'll have to resort to (educated!) guesswork.</p>

<p>The most likely announcement for tomorrow's State of Play is a release date for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">leaked last week</a> via a PlayStation Store listing and new trailer before being hastily removed, so it's almost certainly earmarked for the show.</p>

<p>Upcoming PlayStation-exclusive games (for now, at least!) include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a>, both of which could get new extended gameplay demos or release dates tomorrow.</p>

<p>There's also a non-zero chance that some sort of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake could finally be revealed tomorrow, if Sony's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">twin DMCA takedowns</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">fan projects</a> revolving around the game are anything to go by.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=mBxsRziX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=cvxkO2At 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could that long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster finally be coming?</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever PlayStation has to show for itself, it's following hot on the heels of January's Xbox Developer Direct, during which we got new looks at&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, as well as the reveal of a new&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Whether or not Sony shows anything comparable off remains to be seen, but you can tune in tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (5pm Eastern, 10pm GMT).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unity-reportedly-lays-off-yet-more-staff-including-entire-behavior-division.1105905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New reports have emerged claiming that Unity has laid off a number of employees, with one report suggesting that the company's entire Behavior division has been laid off.</p>

<p>According to Unity Behavior head Shanee Nishry, the whole Behavior team has been "included in [Unity's] latest round of layoffs". Nishry says she's reached out to Unity leadership to ask if "they can open source the project", but that this isn't guaranteed.</p>

<p>Additionally, designer&nbsp;André de Miranda Cardoso <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andre-mc_unfortunately-i-was-affected-by-the-latest-activity-7295024528282288128-4mqz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted on LinkedIn earlier</a> confirming that he's been "affected by the latest Unity layoff[s]". Neither former employee confirmed how many staff members had been laid off across the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=e85RPOHM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=OCWy1rza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More layoffs have apparently hit Unity.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Unity employees to confirm the layoffs include senior software developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coline Turquin</a> and tech lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294815856256049152/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Florence Rolland-Soulier</a>&nbsp;(both courtesy of <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>), the latter of whom refers to the latest round as a "wave of mass layoffs".</p>

<p>Another employee impacted by the layoffs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294910467607535616/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Peter Roe</a>, "call[s] out" the way Unity chose to communicate the layoffs to staff, claiming that the company sent "a 5am email" from a "noreply" email address to inform him that his role would be "eliminated".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Unity itself has yet to publicly announce or confirm these layoffs. However, given how many Unity employees (or former employees) are coming forward to share their stories, it seems unlikely that the reports are false.</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>, Unity revealed that it would slash 25% of its workforce in order to "refocus on its core business". It's unclear whether these layoffs are part of that wave or whether they represent a further commitment to cutting staff.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/609973/civilization-7-steam-deck-performance-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are few things more daunting than attempting to win a game of <em>Civilization</em> by way of cultural victory… except maybe trying to play a complex strategy game on the Steam Deck. And while I’m still struggling on the culture victory aspect, I can say, playing <em>Civilization VII</em> on my Steam Deck was far less difficult than I imagined. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/604489/civilization-7-review">my review of <em>Civilization VII</em></a>, my biggest complaint was not really understanding some of the game’s more complex systems. The controls are a function of that misunderstanding. In playing a game as information-dense as <em>Civilization</em>, every function is mapped to a button, and there are <em>a lot</em> of functions. I tried my best to memorize it all but was grateful for the Deck’s touch-screen functionality, which let me forgo buttons in certain instances.</p><p>However, there were times when I occasionally encountered a bug where I’d click on a selection and nothing happened. It was never anything mission-critical. Sometimes the game didn’t want to register when I wanted to put a unit to sleep or ignored my attempts to establish a trade route I knew I met the criteria for. These complaints blend with my initial problems with the game’s legibility. Maybe those weren’t bugs but, rather, the game refusing an invalid action. If it was the latter, there was nothing in the game’s UI that I noticed communicating that.</p><p>I also had an issue that essentially boiled down to “out of sight, out of mind,” whereby the small size of the Steam Deck’s screen meant I sometimes lost track of my units. It’s nice that when <em>Civilization VII</em> prompts you to issue orders to units each turn, it’ll snap to every unit in question. But sometimes you might issue a unit to go to sleep — you want to keep it around but don’t need to issue orders every turn. With the smaller screen, I can’t see my units on a map all at once and so, embarrassingly, can forget they exist. And that can kinda suck if you need to recall your armies home to defend the motherland against literal Machiavellian assaults. (This is a silly problem, I admit, but it nevertheless happened more than once.)</p><p>I didn’t notice any significant performance issues playing on the Deck except for loading times at the start of a game or jumping back into one feeling a bit lengthy. I remember fondly how <em>Civilization V</em> used to chug even on adequate machines whenever the game swung back around to the top of the turn order, but that seems to have been corrected between then and now. Graphics also weren’t an issue, but I did have some instances of pop-in. I actually recall being impressed by the detail of the new fog of war system. Instead of a literal fog, unexplored portions of the map are obscured by an ornately designed map tile that features black marble inlaid with golden Roman numerals that looked particularly stunning.</p><p>With the advent of all these <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">newfangled</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">portable games systems</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578144/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-xbox-controller">previously PC-locked games branching out onto consoles</a>, I have been taken over by what I’m going to call desktop sloth. If I don’t have to play a game at my desk, I’m not going to, and I’m willing to accept a little bit of a degraded experience to do it. Thankfully, playing <em>Civilization VII</em> on my Steam Deck, with certain exceptions, didn’t feel too different from a <em>Civ</em> game at my desktop. Though I’m still getting the hang of game mechanics, I can still set policies, deploy armies and spies, and build up my cities just as easily from my couch as I once could my desk.</p><p>It wasn’t a frictionless experience. But the ability to take my cold war with Machiavelli on the go glossed over those minor hiccups just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 is out now in full public access on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Epic Games Store</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-founders-edition/9NNRSLQGVJ1M">Microsoft Store</a> and once again, I ask myself: does Sid Meier keep a hit list of journalists who just call it plain old Civilization? What about journalists who come up with cute puns like Sidilization or CiviliSidtion or SimSiddy: The Meier The Merrier and whoops, I've just been assassinated by sniper drone. Fortunately the drone is equipped with one of those generative AI chatbots and can write the rest of this news post for me.

<p>
The latest helping of Firaxis 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> launched in early access to Founder Edition buyers last week. You may have noticed that we don't have a review yet. This is because our Civilization 7 review is the best Civilization 7 review, and much as with Worldly Wonders, the best things take time. It is marinating underground like, I don't know, some kind of exotic resource you can build an absolutely banging library with. It hangs unseen in the air around us, a cloud of purest Schrödingas refusing to condense into anything so trivial and <em>gauche</em> as a concrete verdict. 
</p>
<p>
That verdict's absence may even be for the best, as far as Firaxis and publisher 2K Games concerned. RPS strategy game columnist Sin Vega has already reviewed Sid 7 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer</a> and she wasn't especially wowed. "Its design broadly works, and a certain kind of city-optimising fan may even love it," she wrote. "But its lack of character is endemic, the extent of its annoying habits and oversights shocking for a series of such pedigree." I gather that a lot of the game feels both pointless and characterless, and that "the interface is ashamed that it's a strategy game". I'm disappointed to read that the fancy new Age structure, which breaks your campaign up into more digestible, narrative-driven chunks, is simply a source of irritation.
</p>
<p>
Sin's review is one among many, and there are plenty of positive write-ups - perhaps the RPS review will be among them - but the player mood on Steam is currently Mixed. Firaxis have put together <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583?l=english">a patch</a> for launch that suspends cross-play while they implement fixes for various issues with the camera, AI and features or systems such as naval combat and how Age progression works. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">a substantial menu of planned seasonal updates</a>, including new civilizations and leaders, which has naturally attracted some accusations that certain features should be part of the game at launch.
</p>
<p>
But you, reader dear - what do you make of Cid 7 so far? I know that a few of you are Founder's Editioners who already have dozens of hours under your belts. If you have complaints, are they the kind that can be addressed with patches, or are they more fundamental issues? Me, I look forward to playing the game six months down the road once the dust has settled. This is Meierbot85, signing off.

Doing so will unlock the second set of rewards, including a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>Live-service games are a delicate dance between developers trying to maintain the overall health and longevity of the game while players want to Have Fun, and not feel Screwed Over. Even beloved hits like<em> Helldivers 2</em> have occasionally missed the mark when it comes to this balancing act. Kudos to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> for course correcting so quickly. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has officially announced its next PlayStation State of Play event. Confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a>, the show will take place on Wednesday, February 12 at 5pm ET/11pm CET.</p>



<p>In its announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the company says that the show will be over 40 minutes long, and will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5.” </p>



<p>“The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world,” Sony said with no other details being given regarding what games will appear.</p>



<p>But aside from the small tease from Sony, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qKJBGGFu6X4hNmi6GQP8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a> that a brand new game from a brand new studio will be shown during the event as well.</p>

<p>As far as what else to expect, it’s unclear. With plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to come to the PlayStation 5, the show could see another announcement of the next Xbox game to come to PlayStation. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come. Two games that could also be shown are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Death Stranding 2 as both are scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Like always, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the show as it airs, including every announcement you need to know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher%E2%80%99s-doug-cockle-on-becoming-netflix%E2%80%99s-latest-geralt.1105887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-doug-cockle-on-becoming-netflixs-latest-geralt<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While Henry Cavill may be the most famous actor to have played Geralt of Rivia, he’s not the first name many will think of when discussing The Witcher. Certainly amongst the gaming community, Doug Cockle — the voice of Geralt in CD Projekt Red’s series of critically acclaimed RPGs — is considered the original and ultimate white wolf. But the paths of Cavill and Cockle’s Geralts have now merged, with Cockle bringing his unmistakable voice to Netflix’s interpretation of the character in the new animated movie, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he’s not playing the same version of Geralt who appears in the games, Cockle was not asked to alter his performance to sound more like or include the mannerisms of Henry Cavill or Liam Hemsworth, who replaces Cavill as Geralt in the next season of the live-action show. This creative decision meant Cockle was able to draw upon the same method and approach that created the unmistakably gravelly tones of his Geralt of Rivia. And so you’ll still hear the same voice you’ve known and loved for nearly 20 years.     </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle formulated that voice back in 2005 when recording dialogue for the first Witcher video game. “The thing I found most challenging about recording Witcher 1 was actually the voice itself,” Cockle recalls. “When I first started recording the game, (Geralt’s) voice was very, very far down in my register. It was something I had to push towards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time there was little guidance as to how long voice actors should spend recording in a single session, and so Cockle was spending eight or nine hours per day delivering that gravelly voice. “I was going back to my hotel just going, ‘Wow, my throat is ripped’,” he recalls. The struggle continued into the recording of The Witcher 2 a few years later, but Cockle’s vocal chords eventually strengthened and began attuned to what was required of them — a process he sheepishly likens to an athlete's muscles getting into shape. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As soon as The Last Wish came out in English, I tore through it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle’s vocal chords adapting to better support Geralt’s voice wasn’t the only major change that happened during the development of the second game, though. “The books started to come out in English while I was recording Witcher 2,” he explains. “Before that, it was the developers from CD Projekt Red who taught me everything I needed to know about Geralt. So as soon as The Last Wish came out in English, I was down at the bookstore buying it, and I tore through it. And I understood things about Geralt just from reading just that one book that I didn't understand at all before. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The developers kept saying, ‘He's emotionless’,” Cockle says. “And I was like, ‘Okay, I get it, I get it, but I'm an actor. I want to play with emotions.’ But I better understood [when reading] the book why they were pushing for as flat as possible of an emotional life for him.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-jaskier-geralt-1738945176731.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle's Geralt appears alongside Joey Batey's Jaskier and other members of the Netflix cast. | Image credit: Netflix</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle immediately fell in love with the books, noting that author Andrzej Sapkowski “is such a wonderful writer.” Having grown up on Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, Cockle quickly forged a connection with this new fantasy universe. Of all Sapkowski’s novels, he most fondly remembers Season of Storms. It’s a story he’d love to be a part of, should Netflix ever need a voice for Geralt again.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's one of those stories that when I read it, I was like, ‘Oh, this is horrible. This is awful.’ [But] it's thrilling at the same time,” he says. “There's some really graphic fight scenes that Sapkowski gives to us, and I think that would be a really fun story to turn into an anime or a TV episode.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I enjoy the gravitas of Geralt when he's all serious and mopey and whatever, but I do also like those moments when he's trying to be light.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe we’ll see that story in the future, but right now Doug’s Geralt can be seen and heard in Sirens of the Deep, Netflix’s latest animated Witcher adventure. Based on the short story A Little Sacrifice from the Sword of Destiny collection, it’s a dark and twisted interpretation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid. After a mermaid and a human prince fall in love, Geralt finds himself caught up in a conflict between two very different kingdoms. But while there’s plenty of blood-splattering action and serious political drama, it’s the story’s lighter moments that interest Cockle the most. He notes a humorous conversation between Geralt and Jaskier, where both are sitting around a campfire after a long day, as a good example of that lightness. The scene demonstrates Geralt’s softer side, which is often overlooked as an important part of the monster hunter’s personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Part of liking acting is liking all those different aspects of a character's personality and the different choices that could be made and how they might approach those choices,” Cockle explains. “I enjoy the gravitas of Geralt when he's all serious and mopey and whatever, but I do also like those moments when he's trying to be light. When he's trying to crack a joke and it just doesn't go very well for him most of the time because he's just not funny.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep Geeked Week 2024 Teaser Stills</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of Cockle’s work on Sirens of the Deep simply required him to use a voice that’s become second nature, the anime did pose a unique challenge: learning how to speak mermaid. Yes, for the first time in his career, Cockle had to perform in a fictional language. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I found doing this really difficult,” he confesses. “I got phonetic spellings of the words and things so I could get familiar with it and hopefully be okay on the day. And then I got in front of the mic and… it wasn't like performance anxiety or anything like that, it's just that it was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things should be much easier when Cockle returns to the world of video games in The Witcher 4, which was revealed with an exciting trailer at The Game Awards last year. Returning to his original version of Geralt should be like putting on an old pair of favourite slippers. Even easier, actually, because he won’t have to record anywhere near the amount of dialogue that he did for the previous three games. This time around Geralt is set to be a supporting character in a story that puts Ciri, his adoptive daughter, in the protagonist role.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Cockle has little to say about The Witcher 4. He claims to only know as much about it as we do. But he’s eager to see what happens in CDPR’s next chapter of The Witcher story, and thinks it's already headed in the right direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's a really good move,” he says of switching the story’s perspective from Geralt to Ciri. “I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more about what CD Projekt Red is planning, take a look at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg">in-depth interview with the creators of The Witcher 4</a>.

                <p>Sony has confirmed that its first State of Play livestream for 2025 will kick off on <strong>February 12 </strong>at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. As usual, you'll be able to watch it on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels.</p><p>This looks like it'll be a pretty big livestream, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony says</a> the event will run for at least 40 minutes and will show "a creative and unique selection of exciting games" from various studios around the world.</p><p>So what else can you expect from the show? Sony is keeping details on it under wraps, but the company does have some big games in development currently. The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> last year, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima sequel--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost of Yotei</a>--is scheduled to release later this year, and it'll be interesting to see if the live-service heist-'em-up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fairgame/" data-ref-id="5000-589427">FairGame$</a> makes an appearance after a long period of radio silence.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> director Hideo Kojima has also been sharing a few teases for a new trailer on his social media accounts, so we could get a new look at the post-apocalyptic courier game. Beyond that, there has also been quite a bit of speculation regarding From Software's Bloodborne, as the 10th anniversary of the game is fast approaching.</p><p>Additionally, numerous third-party games are coming out this year from notable studios. February 2025 still has big releases like Monster Hunter Wilds and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, while March turns up the heat with Assassin's Creed Shadows, Atomfall, and Killing Floor 3.</p>

<p>So what can we expect to see? Sony doesn't have too many announced first party games on the horizon for 2025, so it'll be exciting to see what is shown.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-final-preview.1105866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/monster-hunter-wilds-final-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s no Seikret that we love Monster Hunter here at TSA. There probably isn’t a Monster Hunter title that we haven’t poured hundreds of hours into between us, and it’s probably best we don’t think about the upper limit of that number… Much better to think about all the exciting and fun times that await in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>And so, when our friends at Capcom offered us a chance to come play the first four hours of the game — completely uninterrupted —&nbsp;along with two special hunts from later in the game, we seized the opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 6th Trailer | Into the Iceshard Cliffs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFoueW07mxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This, naturally, came with the same kind of caveats that any pre-release game build has. The multiplayer aspect was still a little sticky and the lip sync wasn’t quite, well, synced. They’re minor issues that are sure to be rounded off in the final weeks and months of development, and the amount of polish that is on show throughout the game is already impressive.</p>
<p>We picked up the game after the opening sequence we last played in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our first Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a> last September. We escorted Y’sai back to his Kunafa village, taking in the scenery and meeting some colourful new characters along the way. One of our colleagues at the base asked us to keep an eye out for some honey so Y’sai pointed it out for us along the way.</p>

<p>But, as much as I love honey – and hot honey is, of course, very trendy right now – what I was really waiting for was a mission, and it didn’t take long before we were asked to kill a Quematrice — a Brute Wyvern new to Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>

<p>It’s always exciting to come across new beasties, and the Quematrice did not disappoint. This greenish-brown brute with red and blue scales has a large comb atop its head, and a wattle on its throat, giving it the appearance of a cockatrice — unsurprising perhaps given its name. It also has a very large tail that sprays oil on the ground, which it then strikes to ignite.</p>
<p>Aggressive though it was, we dispatched it and moved on, meeting up with Y’sai to continue the dual mission of reuniting Nata with The Keepers and hunting down the White Wraith.</p>
<p>What was doubly exciting is that, unlike the old days of Monster Hunters past, we weren’t sitting around watching load screens. Instead we could just run out the base and leg it to where the monster waited, battle it and then simply move towards our next target in this large open biome.</p>
<p>We soon wind up in a forest, meet some new characters and stumble across what was easily my favourite monster of the day, a Lala Barina. This temnoceran (a monster type that covers arachnid-likes) is also new to Wilds, and is also pretty cool. Well, so long as you like spiders that are red, white and fluffy all over, and have spikey legs. When enraged, its abdomen opens up into what looks like a large rose, and this is where it gets really cool. It shoots out ‘florets’ — neuroleptics that float in the air ready to ensnare and paralyse you.</p>

<p>Naturally, we killed that and moved on, setting up a pop-up base in the Forest along the way. This is a great new mechanic in that, unlike in Worlds, the base can be destroyed by local monsters. In this case it was ransacked by some Wudwuds. These are basically Monster Hunter’s version of the Ewoks, if they were taught English by a surfer from the 60s. It’s a little jarring at first, but unlike your Felyne’s English voice (I quickly changed the setting to Felyne language), it quickly becomes endearing.</p>
<p>A bout with the farting gorilla monster of a Congalala brought back some misty memories of the first time I battled one back in 2006, but the next treat in this area was another brand-new monster, the Uth Duna.</p>
<p>In testament to its strength, we didn’t have to kill this one, just repel it. This leviathan was impressive, coating itself with a veil of water that repels attacks and moving with incredible speed and agility in terrain that you struggle to just walk in. While it was a nightmare to fight, it was gorgeous to look at.</p>

<p>And that’s where our story preview ended. The opening hours had us facing off against three new monsters — a fire, paralysis and water type — and have a crack at an old favourite that hasn’t been seen in a main-series game since 2014. We got to see a few new biomes, meet some new characters, and see the quality of life updates that will be very exciting for long-term fans, and even just those wanting a true sequel to World.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t where our time with the game ended, with two more new monsters and two more biomes from later in the game to see. First was the Rompopolo in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>This monster has a fascinating design. Rather than the typical Brute Wyvern build, it has an insectile head with a mosquito-like nose, scythe-like hands, a forked tongue and a stinger. It uses these appendages not only to jab and slash, but to either shoot jets of poison or inject it into the ground, causing explosion of oil and tar.</p>
<p>All this made for a pretty exciting fight — despite its aggressive nature, we still took it down inside of 10 minutes, like everything else today.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final monster — the temnoceran Nerscylla in the Iceshard Cliffs.</p>
<p>It was really exciting to get a chance to try another new temnoceran that attacks in a very different way. Instead of paralysis, this one uses poison to attack. It also flings itself across the room like Spider-Man, occasionally dangling from the ceiling as it watches its tiny spider spawn try to rush you. Fortunately, it can be shot down from its cocky little perch with a well-placed shot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about this monster is that if offers a unique insight into the ecology of Monster Hunter. Look carefully and you’ll see that it is wearing a Gypceros hide. That’s some Silence of the Lambs-level nonsense right there.</p>
<p>Our key takeaways from this final preview hands on are that the game is shaping up incredibly well. Combat is smooth and slick, and feels even better than it did in our first preview. The addition of wound damage in Wilds is excellent, adding another dimension to gameplay.</p>
<p>The new monsters we fought are all unique in their own ways, and the biomes we visited are both vast and exciting, underpinning that sense of adventure that comes with each new game. While the weapons and mechanics are familiar, as are some of the monsters that you fight, Wilds feels like a brand new adventure, and that is incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes out in just a few short weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-out-in-february-2025/">on 28th February</a>, but I am itching to get my hands on it once again. And if you’re a fan of either the franchise or the genre, you should be too.</p>
