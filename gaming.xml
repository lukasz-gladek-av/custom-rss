            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-direct-duration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming Switch 2 Direct show will run for around an hour, and that you can expect to see hands-on gameplay footage of some Switch 2 games in the days to follow.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907055353742700718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media platform X, Nintendo confirms the Nintendo Direct, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">scheduled to air tomorrow</a> at 6am Pacific (9am Eastern), "will be approximately 60 minutes long". That's longer than Directs usually run; they're normally about 30-45 minutes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907056611610243535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>&nbsp;subsequently confirms that two Nintendo Treehouse presentations will be held on April 3rd and 4th, each of which will feature "hands-on gameplay of Nintendo Switch 2 games", although we don't know which games those will be just yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-duration-mario-kart.jpg?itok=34WiHVZ_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-direct-duration-mario-kart.jpg?itok=EFJbckjP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 Direct presentation will run for about an hour.</figcaption></figure><p>It's very likely that tomorrow will bring a reveal for the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game that was teased when the Switch 2 was first revealed, assuming that it's not an enhanced port of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>

<p>Other than that, however, the Switch 2's launch lineup is shrouded in mystery, so it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo has up its sleeve for which a console that the company is reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">gearing up to ship 20 million units</a> during its first year.</p>

<p>We're also expecting that the Switch 2's release date will be revealed tomorrow; according <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon" rel="nofollow">to accessory maker Nacon</a>, said date is likely to land somewhere in the April-September region. If I had to guess, I'd put my money on June or July.</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be, we'll find out exactly what Nintendo has up its sleeve for the Switch 2 during the Direct presentation tomorrow.</p>

<p>You can watch said presentation on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a>, and we will, of course, have all the news from the show for you as it happens as well.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9Cplan%E2%80%9D-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed-in-internal-memo.1150935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-plan-for-the-ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-detailed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Insider Gaming has obtained another internal memo from Ubisoft, this time from Christophe Derennes (Zone 1 Managing Director) on the plan for Ubisoft’s new subsidiary with Tencent.</p>



<p>The announcement on the new subsidiary was made on March 27 and thus far, not much detail has been given as to what can be expected moving forward. Officially, we know that certain Ubisoft teams and IP’s will be moving over to the new subsidiary, but the lack of information of what it means for the overall company, its future projects, and employees is currently unknown.</p>



<p>On the investor front, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-falls-double-digits-days-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft stock has fallen a staggering 19%</a> as of the time of writing since the subsidiary news hit the internet. Speaking to one investor, who wished to remain anonymous, he said that the stock price drop is a result of the unknown and how the new structure will work out with Tencent and its cash injection. Another investor casted doubt on the move too, saying that the move means little in the medium to long term if there’s not more changes to the company. </p>



<p>Speaking with employee’s on the move, over half a dozen tell me that internal communication has been fairly lackluster apart from a few company-wide emails. Some tell me that they feel like the deal was probably rushed due to the positive negotiating power Ubisoft had following the initial success of Assassin’s Creed Shadows – but as to when the deal was finalised is unclear. </p>



<p>The apprehension on the future becomes more clear after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-tencent-internal-memo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reading the company’s emails following the subsidiary announcement</a>, and the latest email obtained by Insider Gaming sent from Christophe Derennes paints a clearer picture of why investors and employees are nervous. </p>



<p>But in short, it’s because Ubisoft doesn’t seem to have much of a plan, yet.</p>



<p>You can read the full memo below:</p>



<div><p>“Hello all –</p><p>By now you have seen the message from Yves about the decision to create a new subsidiary that encompasses the three biggest Ubisoft brands: Rainbow 6, Assassin’s Creed, and Far Cry. This new entity will remain part of the Ubisoft family and will continue to be operated by us, with Tencent being a minority shareholder. This important decision is a key turning point for us after the last few difficult years and is an opportunity for Ubisoft to rebuild stronger than ever.</p><p>What will this mean for us in Zone 1? Certainly, we can expect some major changes in terms of structure and organization, since these three brands compose a significant part of Zone 1’s population. For now, what we can say is that once the agreement is finalized and confirmed by legal authorities, our Quebec, Saguenay and Sherbrooke studios will move entirely to the new entity, while our Montreal project teams will be spread between the new entity and the current Ubisoft organization. Our studios in Toronto, Winnipeg, as well as Red Storm and Blue Mammoth, will continue evolving in the current organization. </p><p>It is still very early in the process and I know you must have many questions, but the short answer to the “what’s next” question is: we need to take the time to figure this out and the next months will be dedicated to determining the transition plan.</p><p>Step one was this announcement, where we shared the decision and kicked off the planning phase.</p><p>Step two will be from now until this summer, where we will work out how to support the new entity with the existing organization and determine what the new model looks like on both sides. There will be a variety of guided consultations and discussions over the next few months, and your leaders will be involved as we take this opportunity to set up Ubisoft and the new entity for success.</p><p>Step three will be the implementation of the new model, with a longer period to complete the transition. Of course, there are many things that have not been determined yet such as who and how we will manage the new entity, what will happen to the structure we have created around the Zone, what will be the impact on the studios, and more. While there are many things that will only be defined during the planning process over the next few months, I can assure you that Ubisoft will continue to be a world class creator of video games, and your great ideas and energy will always be a critical part of our success.</p><p>I’m sure you have many questions for which we have no answers yet. Your MDs have also been just recently briefed on this announcement, and like me, don’t have any more information than I do. However, as always, we will try to keep you updated on our progress as we go along and share the latest decisions as soon as we can. In the meantime, we are looking forward to this opportunity of rebuilding a new and stronger Ubisoft, and of maximizing the contributions of all our people.</p><p>Thank you for your patience and resilience: living through change is never simple, and this is a big (and important) one for us and for the future of Ubisoft. My ask to you is to keep focusing on what you do best and where you have the biggest impact: making great games that enrich the lives of our players. I’m thankful to be able to count on your cooperation as we move forward together.</p><p>Christophe<br>Managing Director, Zone 1″</p></div>

<p>Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered PC port release is closer than an alerted Clicker. It adds a lot of new content and quality of life features, and PC users finally get the refined and remastered edition of the game. </p>



<p>We get it, Naughty Dog can probably slow down with The Last of Us remasters, remakes, and rereleases. There’s a reason they keep doing it, though, and that’s because they sell. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a> did well on PS5, and in keeping with PlayStation and PC’s partnership in recent years, a port is on the way.</p>



<p>We have information on the PC port’s release date in different time zones, and extra info on Early Access, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-pc-release-date">The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered PC Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We do this again. Credit to Naughty Dog</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered PC port has a concrete release date of April 3.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a bit later than the original Jan. 19, 2024, release on console, but better late than never! PC users can finally experience the highs and lows of a fully remastered The Last of Us Part 2—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-2-remastered-announces-free-no-return-content-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new content</a>.</p>



<p>This is set to be the best version of TLOU Part 2 yet, and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-features-and-new-no-return-content-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony</a> has promised many PC-specific details:</p>

<h2 id="h-does-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-pc-have-early-access">Does The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered PC Have Early Access?</h2>



<p><strong>There’s no Early Access start time for The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered release on PC.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re desperate to play, you have to wait for launch like everyone else. Naughty Dog isn’t offering any Early Access incentive, making it a normal time-zone-based release for all.</p>

                <p>It is going to be a big, big week for Nintendo and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, as Nintendo has confirmed it will follow up the April 2 Nintendo Switch 2 Direct with two more days of livestreams focused on games for the console.</p><p>Nintendo's Treehouse Live broadcast series returns April 3 and 4 for what's being called a "Nintendo Switch 2 presentation featuring hands-on gameplay of Nintendo Switch 2 games." These Treehouse broadcasts will begin at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET on April 3 and 4.</p><p>If the Treehouse Live events for Switch 2 games are similar to previous ones, fans can expect Nintendo to go deep. Previous Treehouse Live events featured Nintendo developers and designers discussing games at length while showing off gameplay. In short, you won't want to miss them. It's not clear how long these Treehouse Live events will run for, however.</p><p>Given that Nintendo is dedicating two days to follow-up broadcasts for the Switch 2 event with these Treehouse livestreams, it's reasonable to assume Nintendo has <em>a lot </em>in store for the 60-minute April 2 event.</p><p>That makes sense, of course, given the console is coming out this year and we still don't know much about it or its games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">In terms of titles</a>, many are expecting to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart 9</a> and a new 3D Mario game, among others.</p><p>As for when the Switch 2 could release, the latest scuttlebutt suggests <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launching-in-june-with-three-phase-rollout-for-games-report/1100-6530366/" data-ref-id="1100-6530366">the system may release in June, priced at $400 or more.</a> Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

                <p>Director Jared Hess' A Minecraft Movie is what the world needs right now, according to stars Jack Black and Jason Momoa. Speaking at the movie's premiere, Black quoted Burt Bacharach's 1965 song "What The World Needs Now," and added, "We've got to work together, my god."</p><p>"There's so much violence and war and hatred. And that's what I love about this movie--there's a lot of love in it and there's a lot of creativity. There is some anger and violence too, but in the end it's about friendship and working together to make [the world] a better place," Black told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jason-momoa-jack-black-minecraft-movie-jennifer-coolidge-1236175713/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter.</a></p><p>Momoa, meanwhile, said "everyone needs to escape a little bit right now," and A Minecraft Movie could be a solution for them.</p><p>"It's nice to sit back and have a really fun adventure and giggle and laugh," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Momoa said he's hopeful A Minecraft Movie is well-received and performs well at the box office so he can make a sequel.</p><p>"We won't let you down. We worked our ass off for you, and I think we brought the world to life. I think everybody's gonna love it," he said. "There's so much more to tell; I just hope the fans will be delighted and let us make more."</p><p>A Minecraft Movie comes to theaters this Friday, April 4, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-minecraft-movie-could-compare-to-other-video-game-films-at-the-box-office/1100-6530115/" data-ref-id="1100-6530115">it's expected to perform about as well as Sonic the Hedgehog 3 did in the US.</a> April also sees the release of HBO's The Last of Us Season 2 (April 13) and then Sony's Until Dawn movie (April 25), so it's a stacked month for video game adaptations.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-social-media-reviews-to-a-minecraft-movie-are-in-heres-what-people-are-saying/1100-6530503/" data-ref-id="1100-6530503">first social media reviews for A Minecraft Movie have begun to appear online</a>, with people calling it "appalling" and "awkward," as well as "hilarious" and "sharp." That seems to be in keeping with tradition for movies from Hess, whose previous releases, including Napoleon Dynamite and Nacho Libre, divided audiences.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/01/den-of-wolves-throws-an-inception-sized-wrench-into-the-multiplayer-heist-genre/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>10 Chambers know how to make a multiplayer shooter. The team, built from the ground up by Ulf Anderson, Simon Viklund and Anders Bodbacka, spawned from the Payday 1 and Payday 2 team, with their opening studio salvo being the bloody and tough GTFO. If that was the game they ‘had’ to make, Den of Wolves is the game they ‘need’ to make. From our early hands-on session, this is the culmination of everything they’ve previously built, but they’re exploring the genre in some unexpected and intriguing ways.</p>
<p><iframe title="Den of Wolves - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RlKiBVO1GLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Den of Wolves is a techno-thriller, a multiplayer heist, and an Inception-like journey into the human mind. Fundamentally, this is Payday and GTFO by way of Deus Ex, set in 2097 in a future where corporations have built their own superstate in the middle of the Atlantic Sea.</p>


<p>Den of Wolves is set in Midway City. The island of Midway began life as one of Pan-Am Airways’ refuelling spots on its way to cracking travel between the US and Asia, before it became a crucial base for America during World War 2, but in this future, a giant cityscape has overwhelmed the island, spilling into the sea and thrusting into the clouds.</p>
<p>This evocative setting, one that ties the East and the West, plays host to the Corporations. The team describe it as a high-tech Venice, with a stock exchange that sits at the centre of global trade. All Corporations have a presence there, and the island is split into five distinct districts, each controlled by a different company.</p>

<p>Within this setting, cybercrime and industrial espionage are rife. You work for the Corporations, taking jobs from the highest bidder, and in Midway City, loyalty is bought rather than earned. You’re not, as you may have guessed, the hero of this piece; you’re a criminal mastermind, putting together a crew that’s capable of shooting, looting and hacking their way to success.</p>

<p>Each heist is built upon a series of smaller jobs, culminating in the central mission. The prep jobs might see you building up your tech or collecting information, but each acquisition affects how the final act plays out. For our playthrough, we got to play a single prep mission, and the team describe these as being ‘bitesized’ experiences, which will fit into a lunchbreak and let you move forward with the game even when you’re short of time.</p>
<p>Our team of four blasted through this vault theft in just under ten minutes – the fact that we were grouped up with Vlad and Calle of 10 Chambers might have helped us out a bit – but you can opt to extend these prep missions by heading back into the area to try and grab more loot.</p>
<p>There’s serious risk to balance against the reward though, and Vlad and Calle told us that the difficulty seriously ramps up the longer you stick it out, making the chances of success much slimmer. It’s a tantalising challenge, and the ghost of GTFO’s hardcore difficulty level satisfyingly rears its head here. The main run through both the prep and the final mission felt tough but fair, and we had to communicate and work as a team, balancing gunplay while breaking into vaults, reviving fallen comrades or throwing up defensive shields and turrets.</p>

<p>So far, you might be thinking that this is Payday in the future, and while it’s undeniably built on the same foundations, Den of Wolves has a digital ace up its cybernetic sleeve: The Dive. You are one of the few people capable of The Dive, which is an ability to hack neural networks in a way that AI can’t. In gameplay terms, they’ve crossed Inception with Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>The Dive can, fundamentally, be whatever 10 Chambers want it to be. These sections of a heist are separate in terms of their structure, and the way they play is notably distinct from the bombastic gunplay of the central heist. In our playthrough, The Dive saw our team leaping through the mind of a prisoner, jumping between floating platforms as gravity tilted and turned the landscape in disconcerting ways. It was set against a timer as well, where failing to make a jump and the inevitable drop into the abyss was a devastating blow to our team. Thankfully, only one player needs to make it to the end to succeed.</p>
<p>What’s exciting, for both players and the team at 10 Chambers, is that the possibilities here are nearly infinite. Simon spoke animatedly about the idea, saying, “The only thing where it limits us it it needs to be a first-person experience. It’s not going to be a Match-3 or an RTS or a side scroller, but you could be running through a maze hunted by a monster. Right now we’re working on a forest setting where there’s a creature tracking you. We can lean into military simulation or it can be a Japanese temple where you’re fighting ninjas, and what’s interesting is that it’s not just providing variation for the players, but for us developers as well”.</p>

<p>This idea is Den of Wolves’ golden bullet. The freedom and creativity that it allows is unprecedented, and the fact that in the midst of a heist you could suddenly be free-running across city rooftops like Mirrors Edge or battling demons in the ruins of a castle. I wasn’t the first to suggest that we might see a GTFO-like Dive, and the team seemed open to that possibility. Hell, they’re open to all possibilities.</p>
<p>Beyond the heists, the guns and the masks, it’s clear that 10 Chambers want Den of Wolves to be a truly global force. The team have already started on this path, releasing deep dive videos into different aspects of the game’s development, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNroOU2W1C4">motion capture</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpcCbA7jrE0">music</a>, and releasing a music video for Viklund’s stellar <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oli2M8Z1EU">Inject</a>.</p>
<p>The iconography, the visual design and the ethos all speak to a team that are creating a brand as much as they’re designing a game. In the modern development sphere, it’s a canny approach, and much like League of Legends, Den of Wolves’s rich, tangible sci-fi world has the potential to capture fans beyond the game’s frantic robberies.</p>
<p>The music is an integral part of that, and Simon, who was the composer for Payday 1, Payday 2 and GTFO, relished the opportunity to craft something fitting for the game’s futuristic settings. He told us, “In part, it’s the arbitrary choice of wanting to do something different, to challenge myself, while at the same time staying in the wider genre of EDM. I chose to go for something slower and heavier, like an unstoppable force type of energy.” He continued, “Hip-hop and rap music has a little bit of that, with the super deep 808 bass sounds and the slower tempo, and I felt that was a good fit – at least for the parts of the mission where everything is going to plan!”</p>

<p>When things go wrong, the audio tempo ticks up, reflecting the sudden overwhelming enemies that are homing in on your position. As your heart rate ramps up, and your teammates start shouting for support, Simon’s tracks take on a completely different tone.</p>
<p>Eye’s glinting, Simon says, “The music here still has the gritty texture and the electronics, but it’s more high-octane. It’s adrenaline-pumping music. I’ve sectioned off a certain part of EDM where I feel I can move around, and we can cover the emotions that we want the players to feel.” From first-hand experience, it definitely works.</p>
<p>Den of Wolves is another statement piece from 10 Chambers, and perhaps more clearly than ever, this is a game that’s about grasping the anonymity of the teams’ signature masks. Where the Payday games gave you the chance to be the villain, Den of Wolves explores some of the darkness that lurks at the edges of everyone’s psyche.</p>
<p>Simon describes this as ‘moral escapism’, the idea that beyond the mechanical freedom of firing a gun in a military shooter, here players can do something wholly illegal, become someone wholly different. It’s less Ocean’s 11, more neo-noir techno thriller , a dark undercurrent running through its narrative threads. Wherever your conscience sits on this moral scale, Den of Wolves brings a new sense of catharsis and freedom to the multiplayer space.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's April Fools' Day once again, and you know what that means: time to take literally everything you read on the internet today with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't necessarily include this article; we're gathering up everything we see that looks like an April Fools' joke to us, but there's every chance we're wrong and some of these announcements are legit. In any case, here's our roundup of this year's April Fools' shenanigans!</p>

<hr><h2>Level-5 invites you to cross "New Horizons"</h2>




<p>Level-5's April Fools' joke this year involves a trailer that will look very familiar to you if you were glued to a certain Nintendo game during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's intended to promote the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of RPG sequel&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>

<h2><em>PUBG</em>&nbsp;gets romantic</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=qXtIPUXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=JtFweEi4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to date your&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>weapons? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton is celebrating April Fools' Day in&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>in the form of <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Winner Winner Romantic Dinner"</a>, a dating sim that lets you romance, uh, your weapons. This one's been created with the help of gen AI, which is a bit yucky if you ask me.</p>

<h2><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>adds infantry into the mix</h2>




<p>This is one of those announcements where I'm not sure whether it's an April Fools' joke or not, but in any case, Gaijin has announced that <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9447/current" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ground troops</a> are on their way to vehicular combat game&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em>. Judging by the comments, this one might do well if it wasn't a gag.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords&nbsp;</em>wants to have some words with you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=S1Sx2Z8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=X8RKD4KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game is extremely real. Honest.</figcaption></figure><p>You've heard of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, but <a href="https://www.sonicracingcrosswords.com/special/crosswords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">what about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords</em></a>? A "demo" for the game is available now, and it challenges you to, uh, solve a word puzzle as fast as you can. I see what you did there, Sega.</p>

<h2><em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em>is calling your bluff</h2>




<p>A brand new board game mode has been added to party game&nbsp;<em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260320/view/498317142563751751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the form of "Bluffalo Club"</a>, in which you must take turns saying ridiculous things and hoping your friends fall for them. There's more in the update besides the new game, too.</p>

<h2><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>wants you to sign a binding marriage contract</h2>

<p>Are you intending on marrying one of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s handsome and beautiful NPCs? If so, then you'll want to sign this extensive and extremely legally binding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1084600/view/514079741259548841" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">marriage contract</a>, which asks that you jump through all kinds of hoops in order to prove your love is enduring.</p>

<h2><em>Palworld</em>'s dating sim surely can't be real, right?</h2>




<p>I'm including this one mainly for posterity, but it's also worth mentioning the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dating sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">once again announced yesterday</a>. There's...just no way&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>can be real...is there?</p>

<h2><em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is making a triumphant return</h2>

<h2><em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>is bringing realistic visuals to Mintrocket's pixel art extravaganza</h2>




<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is probably one of the most diverse and minigame-stuffed games of all time, but wouldn't it be better if it looked a little more...realistic? Well, Mintrocket clearly thinks so if this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>trailer is anything to go by. You'll only have to wait until 2049 to play it as well!</p>

<h2>THQ Nordic reveals&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em></h2>

<p>In the world of THQ Nordic's&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em>, "typography and magic are one", and you must destroy the corrupt sans serif fonts, who have allowed their power to go to their heads. This game is absolutely real and is absolutely launching in 2026. Cough, cough.</p>

<h2><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is getting a feature film</h2>




<p>Jiggly mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting itself a feature film, complete with epic mecha battles and plenty of waifu-style characters. Whether or not this is all a huge, elaborate April Fools' Day prank remains to be seen (hint: it is).</p>

<h2><em>The Talos Principle Reawakened&nbsp;</em>has tons of features so you don't need to think anymore</h2>




<p>Are modern puzzle games too difficult for your brain? Do you wish they made you...well...think a little less? Croteam and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date" rel="nofollow">The Talos Principle Reawakened</a>&nbsp;</em>have you covered with a suite of hilarious features designed to stop your brain from needing to activate even once.</p>

<h2><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is, erm, throwing shade at&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>?</h2>

<p>I'll readily admit I don't get this one; I don't think there's any shame in that. Riot Games' FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is apparently either teaming up with, throwing shade at, or affectionately ribbing&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>&nbsp;in <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1907062942022910313" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this strange video message</a> posted on the game's official X account.</p>

Every year, the fruit flies and mosquitoes return to my kitchen, drawn to the illicit aroma of unlidded pasta sauce and the rank embroidery of carbonised toast around my cooker. Every year, I attempt to remove them non-violently by building intricate traps out of vinegar bottles, or performing slow-motion kung fu punches with a jug.</p>
<p>My inability to keep the winged hoodlums at bay has alienated me from my so-called friends, but on the plus side, it has also equipped me to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-mosquito-gang">The Mosquito Gang</a>, an asymmetrical multiplayer affair in which one, regular-sized human player attempts to carry out various domestic tasks while four, tiny mosquito players attempt to suck their blood.

The Mosquito Gang is my favourite usage of the term "extraction" game in a while. As one of the mosq, you must obviously try to land on the human player without attracting their attention. Any mammalian essence extracted in that time can be spent at a blood bank to unlock random new abilities and modifiers. The blood bank mechanic is not a faithful representation of mosquito feeding habits, but does create a useful interval between extracting blood and profiting from it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the abilities are, exactly, but one of the screenshots shows a mosquito driving a toy car. The mosquitoes also appear to get side objectives, like unplugging fumigators and turning on a music player. Again, I must sternly object that this is not typical mosquito behaviour. A mosquito does not have the muscle power to operate a steering wheel. You'd need to be a horse fly or larger.
</p>
<p>
The human player, meanwhile, has to carry out chores that range from the ordinary - taking out the trash, preparing a meal - to the Madly Scientific - operating a DNA scanner, mixing a cocktail for a robot. You earn cash for completing jobs, which can be spent on useful implements such as bug swatters. There doesn't appear to be a pacifist mode, but I would love the option to trap the mosq in a jar and stand next to it for 20 minutes doing the floss. As for mosq objectives, perhaps they could add one where you maintain a just-audible presence near the ceiling, then suddenly whine right by the human's ear as they're falling asleep. Always a hit round these parts.
</p>
<p>
I'm a fan of Big vs Little in multiplayer games, and while this doesn't seem quite as high octane as, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a> or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, I can imagine it being a holler. Perhaps it'll teach me the real trick to staving off the annual kitchen invasion. People have suggested doing the washing-up more often but that feels pretty extreme, very much a last resort. The Mosquito Gang is slated to launch sometime this year. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2811100/The_Mosquito_Gang/">Read more on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-invictus-an-arcade-multiplayer-game-rumored-to-launch-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to insider Tom Henderson, Assassin's Creed Invictus could launch in 2025. The leaker <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1906783248232923469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">answered</a> a question on X about the upcoming spin-off game, saying that Ubisoft should release it this year.</p>
<p>The publisher only acknowledged its existence with a brief sentence <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/RQdGp9fytJeMffReMQpN3/fc14fdc4ed35de3550e1c94e250893a9/Ubisoft_FY23_H1_Earnings_PR_English_Final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in October 2022's financial report</a> that followed the 15th anniversary of the franchise and its updated roadmap:</p>
<p><em>Additionally, a team, including For Honor veterans, is currently working on bringing back multiplayer to Assassin’s Creed with a standalone experience through Infinity under the project codename Invictus.</em></p>
<p>The only information we have on Assassin's Creed Invictus comes from leaks via <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xJ0nathan</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>. Both confirmed that it's a multiplayer game with an arcade feel inspired by Fall Guys and Smash Bros. Players would compete in multiple rounds across various multiplayer modes, such as team deathmatch, free-for-all, and some sort of speedrunning competition. There are also reportedly powers that characters can use to get a boost. The camera is said to be further away from the player character, while maps and characters from previous games like Ezio and Cesare Borgia will make an appearance in Assassin's Creed Invictus.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it'll be an unusual experience, and it remains to be seen whether it'll be successful. Still, 2025 kicked off on the right note for Ubisoft with the strong launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-3-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> more than three million units in the first week, the second-best debut in the whole franchise after Valhalla (though that game launched during the pandemic and therefore had its sales boosted by the contingency).</p>
<p>There could be even more Assassin's Creed coming relatively soon, with the remake of the beloved fourth chapter (Black Flag) <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-is-reportedly-closer-than-we-thought/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting a 2026 release. It was actually originally scheduled for November 2025, but that was before the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows. There was also a rumor about the latter game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">getting a co-op multiplayer mode post-launch</a>, by the way. There won't be any shortage of adventures in the franchise, that's for sure, especially following the creation of a new subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-forms-new-subsidiary-based-on-the-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-and-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solely dedicated to the expansion of Ubisoft's biggest franchises</a> (Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six).</p>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has addressed those criticising Bella Ramsey for not looking older as Ellie in the show's upcoming second season.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-season-2-craig-mazin-interview-1236169252/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Mazin said he understands "the difficulty that some people have where they say, 'She looked like she was 14 in season one. She still looks roughly the same to us, even though now she's 19'."</p>
<p>Mazin added he appreciates Ellie in The Last of Us Part 2 does look "much older" than she did in the first game. However, when it comes to the show, he isn't "interested in the physical aspect" of Ellie's appearance.</p>

</figure>
<p>"Some people do change quite dramatically and some people don't," Mazin said. "I've been looking at Bella's face for years while editing, and I can see that she's certainly grown. I'm interested in the emotional maturity, and the change in personality."</p>
<p>The Last of Us showrunner added he has "watched Bella grow and become independent and start to find her own two feet separate and apart from her parents", stating it's also about "how do I figure out how to be my own person now and test that full independence?"</p>
<p>This is something he "[feels in] Ellie completely" when it comes to Ramsey's portrayal of the character.</p>
<p>"So, I understand where people are coming from, but when they watch this year, I think they're going to see the difference," Mazin closed.</p>

            <p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons company Wizards Of The Coast have apologised for "mistakenly" sending a legal takedown to the creator of a free <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> mod that adds a village inspired by and featuring characters from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. The mod has attracted praise from Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who was naturally a bit piqued when it was taken offline.</p>
<p>Published on Nexus Mods on 16th March, the Baldur's Village mod in question was taken offline days later and placed "under moderation review". <a href="https://forums.nexusmods.com/topic/13511816-dmca-request-issued-by-wizards-of-the-coast-llc/">According</a> to a Nexus Mods staff member, legal firm Reynolds Law PLLC sent a claim of copyright infringement on behalf of Wizards on 27th March.</p>
<p>The mod has now <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/30888">been restored</a>, following a player backlash, so go ahead and marry pixelart Astarion as you please. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wizards-of-the-coast-scores-pr-masterstroke-bullies-bg3-stardew-mod-that-had-swen-vinckes-personal-approval-off-the-internet-with-a-dmca/">PCGamer</a> also have a statement from Wizards, who claim the strike was one big whoopsie.</p>
<p>"The Baldur's Village DMCA takedown was issued mistakenly - we are sorry about that," it reads. "We are in the process of fixing that now so fans and the Stardew community can continue to enjoy this great mod!"</p>
<p>It's possible this has something to do with Vincke's intervention yesterday. In a predictably popular post on the Muskvine, he <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219">wrote</a>: "free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth. Imho they shouldn't be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.</p>
<p>"Protecting your [intellectual property] can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled," Vincke continued. "There are good ways of dealing with this."</p>
<p>For context, Larian have <a href="https://larian.com/fan-content-policy">said</a> in their fan content policy that they're fine with people making mods based on their games, as long as they give them away for free, don't pass them off as Larian's own work, and don't do anything "inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging". Larian are not, however, the legal custodians of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons world in which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> takes place.</p>
<p>The Baldur's Village mod is informally set after the Larian RPG's ending, so beware spoilers if you're planning to install. Again, it's free, though the modders do run a Patreon. Given enough interest and crowdfunding, they hope to flesh out their chunk of the Forgotten Realms with further BG3 callbacks.</p>
<p>"Our next focus will be creating Halsin's romance storyline," the Nexusmod page FAQ explains. "Once completed, we will shift our attention to expanding the mod's world-building, background stories, and gameplay by introducing new features and items."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To celebrate the 25th anniversary of Final Fantasy 9, Square Enix has launched a special website dedicated to the title. But all this has done is spark gossip and speculation that a Final Fantasy 9 remake is on the way and close to being announced.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-single-player-record-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> project has been a hit. It’s won awards, both games have sold millions of copies, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-developers-have-already-written-part-3s-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third and final chapter of the trilogy</a> is sure to round things off in style. But while the FF7 remake talk has been constant, the chatter about a Final Fantasy 9 remake has been just as loud and fervent.</p>



<p>The ninth mainline game is considered as important as any to many in the FF community. So when Square Enix suddenly drops a new FF9 website, eyebrows are raised, and questions are sure to be asked.</p>

<p>A new official <a href="https://jp.finalfantasy.com/ffix25th" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Final Fantasy 9 website</a> celebrating the JRPG’s 25th anniversary launched in March 2025. It pays homage to the game and gives fans worldwide the chance to buy exclusive merchandise, learn about the title, and see what Square Enix has planned.</p>



<p>Nothing else has been confirmed for now. However, it’s been reported that <strong>a Final Fantasy 9 Remake has been in the works</strong>—although it may not involve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-director-denies-ff9-remake-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 14 director Naoki Yoshida</a>. The development of the title has reportedly happened alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-release-on-a-wide-range-of-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FF7 Remake Part 3</a>.</p>



<p>A new website and all this commotion and celebration for Final Fantasy 9 likely doesn’t stop here. With the annual Summer of blockbuster gaming announcements upcoming, all signs are pointing toward the inevitable Final Fantasy 9 Remake confirmation.</p>

			<p>A Sonic Adventure 2 Unreal Engine 5 remake is in the works, and a new playable demo is now available for download to allow users to experience for themselves the stunning recreation of some classic stages.</p>
<p>The demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/SA2R/939490">here</a>, features the modern recreation of Radical Highway, White Jungle, and Green Forest, among other levels and boss fight updates. The demo, much like the yet-to-be-released full remake, is powered by the Azure Framework, a branch of Velocity+ that overhauls the physics, camera, controls, and UI to offer a brand-new experience that still sports some classic mechanics, such as a high-speed platforming experience and the return of the scoring system which rewards players to chain moves together to keep a perfect score and score more points. Visuals have also been significantly improved over the original, featuring real-time path-traced lighting and reflections.</p>

<p>Following the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-gamescom-hands-on-preview-shadow-frontiers/">Sonic x Shadow Generations</a>, Sonic the Hedgehog PC fans have definitely been eating well. Besides the recent release of the Sonic Adventure 2 Redux Unreal Engine 5 remake demo, some dedicated developers have released an unofficial port of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sonic-unleashed-unofficial-pc-port-download/">Sonic Unleashed</a>, finally giving PC players the chance to try out the console-exclusive game like never before. Hopefully, the follow-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-frontiers-review-wheres-the-fun-in-being-careful/">Sonic Frontiers</a>, which has yet to be officially announced, will receive the same amount of love from Sonic Team as these fan projects have from their developers.</p>

The images are supposedly taken from the Star Wars strategy game developed by Bit Reactor.

They're dated back to 2023, so it's possible that they aren't up to date. However, it does provide us a glimpse of what the project might look like. According to MP1st, the game's codename is "Bruno" and the screenshots suggest that it's an isometric tactics game.</p><p>Some of the screenshots show gameplay where Mandalorians and a droid take cover while others depict the user interface. One shows what looks like the hub area, called Kafrene Mining Colony.</p><p>As these images are over a year old, it's also possible that the final release could look drastically different. The official <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-panel-schedule" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars website</a> states that there will be a first look at Respawn and Bit Reactor's project during Star Wars Celebration in Japan on April 19.</p><p>This Star Wars project is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/1100-6499936/" data-ref-id="1100-6499936">not the only one in the works right now</a>.

            <p>The anonymous creator of Balatro, LocalThunk, impressed passersby at last month's Game Developer Conference with his card skills, but nobody recognised him.</p>
<p>Balatro won several awards at GDC's Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, Best Design, Best Debut, and Innovation Award. As a result of the nominations, the game had a booth on the show floor.</p>
<p>LocalThunk himself played the game there, but managed to retain his anonymous status despite impressing onlookers at the booth.</p>

<p>"One of my fav moments from GDC - they had a booth set up to play Balatro since it was an award nominee. I watched for a bit then I gave it a go myself. Crushed a white stake run," the developer wrote on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"Someone approached me as I was about to leave. 'Wow you must have played this before!'</p>
<p>"'I guess you could say that'."</p>
<p>He added: "Also this was actually the first and only time I have seen strangers play my game in real life. Have yet to see Balatro in the wild. So as far as I'm concerned y'all are just Truman Show-ing me."</p>

<p>As with previous awards shows, Playstack Communications Director Wout Van Halderen collected Balatro's wins on LocalThunk's behalf.</p>

            <p>75 people have been let go by Eidos-Montreal, the studio announced yesterday. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> and Tomb Raider developers laid off the workers because they didn't have the "capacity to entirely reallocate them", according to a statement. It's a further blow to the workforce at the Embracer-owned company, following hefty cuts last year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Today, we informed our studio staff that we are going to let go up to 75 valuable members, as one of our mandates is coming to an end," said management in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/eidosmontreal_nous-avons-inform%C3%A9-aujourdhui-les-membres-activity-7312494582850543616-TzUD/?originalSubdomain=fr">the post on LinkedIn</a>. "It is not a reflection of their dedication or skills, but unfortunately, we don’t have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services.</p>
<p>"These very talented, highly experienced experts are going to enter the employment market, and we are working to support them through this transition."</p>
<p>The company doesn't specify what that "mandate" is. But it most likely means that work on a current project is finishing, for whatever reason. Note the classic use of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">not-our-fault spinlingo</a>. The statement says the axed workers are "going to enter the employment market" rather than, say, being frogmarched there.</p>
<p>"Eidos-Montréal stays committed to deliver its other projects currently in development," they added.</p>
<p>The only project that the studio has publicly acknowledged they've been working on lately is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, on which they're helping out alongside core developer Playground Games. The company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-deus-ex-game-in-the-works-for-two-years-reportedly-cancelled-almost-100-staff-laid-off-at-eidos-montreal">cancelled a Deus Ex game last year</a>, and laid off 100 workers in the wake of that cancellation. We don't know what else they're doing right now. </p>
<p>Eidos-Montreal was bought by Embracer Group in 2022, following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> the year before. Soon afterwards Embracer began a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-have-laid-off-8-of-their-global-workforce-since-their-restructuring-began">ruthless cost-cutting purge of workers</a> across all its studios. In March last year, Embracer's CEO claimed this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">process of "restructuring" was over</a>. But since then the multinational conglomerate has overseen the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">closure of the Gothic developers</a>, the axing of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-iv-support-studio-hit-by-layoffs-putting-139-people-out-of-work-proving-that-embracers-restructuring-is-not-over">139 people from a Diablo IV support studio</a>, and just last week other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tomb-raider-and-perfect-dark-devs-crystal-dynamics-cut-staff-promising-that-current-projects-are-unaffected">layoffs at Crystal Dynamics</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We already know that 2026 brings us a new reboot of Resident Evil. However, thanks to words from director Zach Cregger, it could be one of the most faithful adaptations of the legendary survival-horror series to date.</p>



<p>The history of Resident Evil movies isn’t the best. There’s been plenty to love, and we’ve seen countless nods to the game from characters to Resident Evil Apocalypse’s full inclusion of Nemesis. Milla Jovovich killed it as Alice in the original six movies, but the franchise has moved in a different direction since.</p>



<p>2021’s Resident Evil Welcome to Raccoon City has already been forgotten, but now we look ahead to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new 2026 Resident Evil film</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-movie-is-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films">Resident Evil Movie is “Unlike Any of The Previous Films”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>This news has us howling. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Through <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-resident-evil-movie-will-be-unlike-any-of-the-previous-films-director-promises?utm_source=facebook,threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, we’ve learned from Zach Cregger—director of the Resident Evil movie reboot—that his interpretation “Will be built in the spirit of those games and follows one central protagonist from point A to point B, as they descend deeper into hell.”</p>



<p>He wants to capture a truer feel of the survival games, and has boldly claimed the reboot is “<strong>Unlike any of the previous films</strong>.”</p>



<p>Zach Cregger is an actor-turned-director and producer. He’s had several roles across TV and movies, but he’s recently best-known for writing and directing 2022’s Barbarian. The Resident Evil reboot is a huge project, and if the movie can be a success, it could start a new trend of Resident Evil movies to go along with the game series.</p>



<p>We know a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Resident Evil game</a> is well into development, and it’s also rumored that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil 0 and Code Veronica remakes</a> are on the way. Join the conversation in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to see if anyone else is excited at the prospect of more Resident Evil screentime.</p>

I'm not saying it'll change your life, but it might improve your afternoon.</p></div><p id="insignia-55"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Insignia - 55" f30="" series="" led="">Insignia - 55" Class F30 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217968"><div id="217968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Insignia - 55" Class F30 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the TV I’d buy if I wanted something that works without having to pretend I care about specs. It turns on, the picture’s 4K, it has Alexa so I don’t have to get off the couch, and it costs less than my last grocery run. Honestly, that’s more than enough.</p></div><p id="outright-games-game-on-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Outright Games Game On! Bundle">Outright Games Game On!

Pay $20 or more, get a pile of games, and support charity. Seems like a win for everyone except your free time.</p></div><p id="insignia-65"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Insignia - 65" f50="" series="" led="">Insignia - 65" Class F50 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217969"><div id="217969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Insignia - 65" Class F50 Series LED 4K UHD Smart Fire TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I like this one because it feels unnecessarily large in the best way. You get Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and it still costs less than a concert ticket and a hoodie. If you want to make movie night feel intentional without spending your life savings, this does the job.</p></div><p id="death-stranding-2-dhv-magellan-m"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - M">Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - Model Kit</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217973"><div id="217973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Death Stranding 2 - DHV Magellan - Model Kit</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I want this on my shelf mostly so people ask what it is and I can pretend I understand <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2</a>. It’s a 1/350 scale model of a massive mobile base from a game that hasn’t even released yet, and I respect the level of commitment required to care this much. It’s $69.99, which is fair for something this weirdly specific and detailed — and yes, the railgun is included.</p></div><p id="lg-65-class-ut70-series-led-4k-uh"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UH">LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV (2024)</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217970"><div id="217970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LG - 65” Class UT70 Series LED 4K UHD Smart webOS TV (2024)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the kind of TV I’d get if I wanted it to last longer than my attention span. It’s a 2024 model, has LG’s updated processor, and handles all the streaming stuff without having to download three extra apps just to log in. Feels like someone at LG actually thought it through.</p></div><p id="samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-titaniu"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titaniu">Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium Smartwatch 47mm LTE</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217971"><div id="217971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Samsung - Galaxy Watch Ultra Titanium Smartwatch 47mm LTE</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I think this is what happens when Samsung realizes not everyone wants to spend $650 to track their steps. The titanium build is overkill in a good way, and the battery life means I don’t have to charge it every time I blink. It finally dropped to a price where it makes sense to buy one without feeling like I’m auditioning for a tech influencer role.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetjourne"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journe">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217878"><div id="217878" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">i’ve been watching the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">Journey Together</a> Elite Trainer Box like a hawk, and somehow it’s actually in stock at Amazon for $70.31. That’s 30% off apparantly, but it's not at all. It includes nine booster packs, a full-art N’s Zorua promo, sleeves, and the usual accessories, Most people just want the packs and the promo. If it’s gone when you check, keep trying. I’ve seen stock randomly reappear in the mornings and lunch time, just like <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3RDlq?object_uuid=c37b4d1b-d6b0-4f69-a7db-8c4f4a75a646&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target's Journey Together stock</a>.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-violetpaldea"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldea">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217879"><div id="217879" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Paldean Fates Booster Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Paldean Fates Booster Bundle at $69.77. Six packs inside, and the draw here is the return of shiny Pokémon. I like that it cuts straight to the good stuff — no sleeves, no dice, no cardboard fluff, just a clean bundle of packs ready to be cracked open. If you’re chasing shinies, this is where the hunt begins.</p></div><p id="best-of-boomer-shooters-4-badda-bin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bin">Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bing Badda Boom</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217880"><div id="217880" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Best of Boomer Shooters 4: Badda Bing Badda Boom</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Pay extra to give more to publishers, Humble, and charities The Global FoodBanking Network (GFN) + Cool Effect</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Humble Bundle’s “Best of Boomer Shooters 4” is live right now, and I love how chaotic it is. For $16, you get $174 worth of retro-inspired FPS games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forgive-me-father-2">Forgive Me Father 2</a>. I think of it as therapy, just with more blood and less talking about my feelings. You also support some good causes, so now your nostalgia trip is technically altruism. You're welcome.</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-scarlet-and-violet-shro"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shro">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217881"><div id="217881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet and Violet Shrouded Fable Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-shrouded-fable-preview">Shrouded Fable</a> ETB is holding steady at $54.96, and I think it’s slept on. It has nine packs, a Pecharunt foil, some sharp sleeves, and a player’s guide that you’ll absolutely ignore until you pull something weird and have to look it up. This set's all about the Legendary trio—Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti—and if you’re into building themed decks or hoarding off-meta cards, this one hits.</p></div><p id="street-fighter-alpha-warriors-dreams"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Street Fighter Alpha Warriors Dreams">Street Fighter TCG Alpha Warriors Dreams Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217882"><div id="217882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Street Fighter Alpha Warriors Dreams - Series One</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Collectors box, Inner Case and Master Case available for pre order</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, if your card obsession extends beyond Pikachu, the Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors’ Dreams trading cards are now up for pre-order on the IGN Store, starting at $20. I already pre-ordered a box because the idea of serial-numbered Chun-Li cards is somehow more exciting to me than it should be. Rare pulls, killer art, and a chance to relive the 90s one Hadouken at a time — I’m in.</p></div><p id="pokmontcg-paradox-clash-tin-iron"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PokémonTCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron ">Pokémon TCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron Leaves ex or Walking Wake ex</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217883"><div id="217883" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PokémonTCG: Paradox Clash tin: Iron Leaves ex or Walking Wake ex</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I picked up one of the Paradox Clash tins just for fun and honestly, no regrets. For $39.96, you get five booster packs and either a Walking Wake EX or Iron Leaves EX promo, chosen completely at random. It’s a bit of a gamble, but opening tins is half the fun anyway. The promos are clean, the packaging is slick, and I think it makes a solid gift for anyone getting into the game</p></div><p id="pokmon-tcg-3-booster-packs-1-ran"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Ran">Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Random Foil</h2></p><div catalogid="8779f54b-0e08-4abc-82e6-49c5712ec775" id="217884"><div id="217884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon TCG: 3 Booster Packs &amp; 1 Random Foil</h3></p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>For a cheaper fix, I’d go for the $12.25 blister pack with three random boosters and a foil promo. It’s 39% off, which is honestly kind of wild, and it’s one of those no-risk purchases you can talk yourself into without too much guilt. The listing shows Silver Tempest Boosters, so there's a good chance of pulling some Sword and Shield chase cards here.</p><p>This one’s for the people who want it all: QLED, anti-reflection, studio-calibrated modes, and picture quality so good I paused a show just to stare at a lamp. I think my eyes are spoiled now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.
