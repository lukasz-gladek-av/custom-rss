			<p>CD Projekt was not long ago the biggest European developer in terms of market capitalization, despite only having made essentially one franchise (the trilogy of The Witcher) with an IP that was not even its own. The Polish studio had garnered an impeccable reputation with those three games, largely due to the overwhelming success of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, and it seemed like it could do no wrong in the eyes of many gamers.</p>
<p>All that came crashing down following the hype and subsequent disappointment of Cyberpunk 2077's release, which launched with many bugs and performance issues, especially on old-generation consoles. As you might remember, Sony even undertook the nearly unprecedented action of <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delisted-from-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removing the game made by CD Projekt from the PlayStation Store</a> until it was fixed.</p>
<p>It wasn't until June 2021, over six months after the game's release, that Sony allowed Cyberpunk 2077 back on the PlayStation store. By then, the studio had already considerably improved the worst issues, although the real game-changer was the combo Update 2.0 and Phantom Liberty expansion, both of which launched around a year ago to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent critical and fan reception</a>, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sales</a>.</p>
<p>In a retrospective article <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published by Eurogamer</a> and focused on what transpired with Cyberpunk 2077, CD Projekt joint CEO Michał Nowakowski admitted that despite the successful turnaround of the gaming community's sentiment, the studio may never recover the sterling reputation it once had.</p>
<p><em>At the level of the board, it was: a) the realisation of what happened, b) we self-acknowledged that what happened was a big, big challenge and a big hit for the company.</em></p>
<p><em>None of us were actually even thinking about it in any financial terms, but it's a problem for the future that we were hoping to build for this company, for its perception amongst fans. And that's something that, to be honest, we've probably lost forever. And yes, you can repair some things, but it's a certain perception of the company that's never going to come back. Is that good or bad? I don't know, but it's a fact.</em></p>
<p>Paweł Sasko, CD Projekt Associate Director on the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel (codenamed Project Orion and in development at the new Boston office), commented:</p>
<p><em>I accept and understand that it might be a situation that never happens for some of them. But that's unfortunately the price we have to pay for what happened. But I hope that, throughout the work that we are doing, throughout the things we are showing, we can actually win some of those people around - and when they hear someone talking to them about the incredible experiences they can have in, let's say Phantom Liberty, or the next Witcher, next Cyberpunk, or Hadar [CD Projekt's new IP], at the moment when they see there's that incredible value in that game, they will actually reach out for it, play it and enjoy it.</em></p>
<p>In a way, though, it might work out in CD Projekt's favor. They won't have to deal with unrealistic expectations like with Cyberpunk 2077; after all, there's no perfect developer, and consumers should always carefully evaluate a game before purchasing it.</p>

            <p>
Hexworks and CI Games are working on a sequel to 2023 action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Lords Of The Fallen, itself a sequel to 2014 action-RPG Lords Of The Fallen. It's slated to launch in 2026. Will the new Lords Of The Fallen also be called Lords Of The Fallen? Will it build on the exciting innovations of Lords Of The Fallen, or will it seek to recapture the nostalgic charms of Lords Of The Fallen? Perhaps in ten years time we'll do a list feature, "Lords Of The Fallen Games Ranked", with just one entry. I'm pretty sure that in 10 years time, generative AI plagiarism will have rendered everything interchangeable anyway.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new Lords Of The Fallen – again, not to be confused with Lords Of The Fallen, to say nothing of Lords Of The Fallen – is currently called Project 3. It appears on a new <a href="https://cigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CI-Games-Strategy-Update-and-Product-Roadmap-2025-2028.pdf">CI Games strategy report</a>, spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-new-details/">Insider Gaming</a>. It’ll run on Unreal Engine 5 and feature such “gameplay improvements” as “increased game mode optionality, more commercial art style and narrative, elevated production values”, which I would roughly translate as “larger selection of modes, an art style and narrative that will appeal to more players, and an overall posher look and feel with, I don’t know, catchier menu fonts and suchlike”. It’ll have a single player campaign with full “shared-progression” co-op, and we can expect a proper announcement in 2025. Oh, and Epic have ponied up to make it exclusive to Epic Games Store on PC. Sad trombone!
</p>
<p>
Resident RPS Soulsliker Edders wasn’t especially sold on Lords Of The Fallen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-review">declaring</a> that “realm-hopping magic can't keep this Soulslike from getting on your nerves”, but he did rate it higher than Lords Of The Fallen, which Rich Stanton <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-pc-review">summarised</a> as “the game so average it doesn't want you to play”. CI Games reckon the series has plenty of juice, however – in the report, they describe it as one of “two major evergreen franchises”, adding that the 2023 sequel accounted for 72 percent of company revenue in the first half of 2024.
</p>
<p>
CI’s other “major evergreen franchise” is camo-faced shooter Sniper Ghost Warrior, which is due another “major iteration” in 2027, again running on Unreal Engine 5. CI are partnering with an unnamed external studio on this one. It’ll be a mix of survival game and shooter, and development has been “expedited” by reusing a bunch of stuff from two other projects, “Project Survive” – described elsewhere in the report as a “new survival genre IP” - and “SGW Next”.
</p>
<p>
We have not written much about the Sniper Ghost Warrior series of late, though Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-announced">did a banger pun</a> about Sniper Ghost Warrior Contracts having a smaller focus back in 2018. I think the last one I played was a preview build of Sniper Ghost Warrior 3 in… 2016? I wasn’t massively enthused, but on the upside, I can at least write about several Sniper Ghost Warrior games at once without feeling like I'm the butt of the joke in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIGRgmxRfiE">Who's On First</a>.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, CI Games have a “major new action-RPG” forthcoming from Underdog Studio, which will use “systems and architecture” from the most recent Lords Of The Fallen and whatever the next Lords Of The Fallen game is called. It’s currently in pre-production with a small team, and will hopefully go into production in late 2025, at which point Hexworks should be in position to help out by way of “cross-studio talent allocation”. All going to plan, it'll release in 2028.

Then a dedicated staff member at Games Workshop works closely with its partners to provide feedback to make sure everything is perfect.</p><p>“Let me give you an example,” Willits told <em>IGN</em>, “the ankle armor we had, the ankle armor was the wrong size and they told us that the ankle armor was wrong.”<br></p><p>Keep in mind that that large, hulking Space Marine design seen today in games, books, and comics, was created over 40 years ago for a tabletop strategy game. So what might work on a tiny plastic model doesn’t always translate easily to a fully animated 3D video game character.<br></p><p> “45 years ago when the guy that made the little Space Marine that sat on the table, he probably was not imagining them animating in a video game 45 years later,” said Willits, “And let me tell you, that was hard to make it. I mean, when you walk and run and fight as Titus, it feels so good. But you’ve seen people cosplay as a Space Marine, right? They can’t even walk down a hallway without falling.” </p><h2 id="h20253"><a id=""></a>Working with Games Workshop isn’t always easy</h2><p>However, while the CCO of Saber did admit that sometimes these notes and approvals can cause headaches, generally Games Workshop is more about “steering” devs and creators and not demanding changes. </p><p> “When we’re coming up with Tyranid attacks, they’re like, ‘Oh, that Tyranid doesn’t really attack like that,’ or ‘That Chaos Marine, you can’t really have him do that.’ So we had to adjust things. And we pushed them a little bit. We did push them a little bit.” </p><p>But Willits understands why Games Workshop is so protective of the franchise, saying that “you have to be” when you own and operate something as massive as the <em>W4Ok </em>universe. </p><p>“When you have a universe as big as Games Workshop has with <em>Warhammer</em>, you have to protect it like it’s your baby, because it is,” said Willits, “And there’s millions of people that love this franchise, and if we screw up an emblem or we make the chapter wrong, it’s just embarrassing.”</p><p>After four years of working on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a></span><em> </em>and making sure everything is lore accurate, Saber’s CCO says he’s “very proud” of what the team pulled off with the game as they “truly” respected and honored the franchise. </p><p>“And when you have the respect of your core fans, everything else is easier.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s also the one that can only be obtained in NG+ mode, meaning you won’t even have access to it until you’ve already beaten the game. Lame.</p><p>Life-Saving Strand will automatically resurrect you one time after being killed, but its extraordinarily long cooldown, coupled with the fact that it doesn’t provide any other boons, makes it a very situational spell that is outclassed by every other incantation on offer in <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>.</p><h2 id="h168805"><a id=""></a><strong>6 - Ring of Fire</strong></h2><p>Ring of Fire lets you apply—wait for it—a ring of fire on the ground. You can stand in to receive enhanced protection from enemy attacks, and while inside the ring, the effects of consumables are also improved.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ring of Fire’s strict focus on defense makes it suck in a game with attacking combat as frenetic as <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Enemies come at you quickly, and require you to stay on the move far too much to make this spell truly feel worth keeping around.</p><h2 id="h168806"><a id=""></a><strong>5 - Rock Solid</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-recommend-id="image://7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Game Science / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-recommend-id="image://7c6faaca515b58b0f954f3f871a7914b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A madsplosion of colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rock Solid is <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s parrying spell, letting you deflect an enemy’s attack and then unleash a counterattack. It can be great when you perfect your skill with it, and it has a short cooldown that allows you to make use of it frequently. However, it requires a lot of practice to nail the timing, and even slightly missing the right moment to cast the spell can result in unnecessary damage.</p><p>Sorry to sound like a broken record, but <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has very fast-paced combat that makes dodging and quickly countering enemies the most efficient way to overcome challenges. As such, it’s hard to recommend Rock Solid unless you’re willing to invest a whole lot of time learning how to use it just right.</p><h2 id="h168807"><a id=""></a><strong>4 - Spell Binder</strong></h2><p>Spell Binder is a pretty straightforward spell that increases your attack power.

<p>Sharkmob London is laying off an unknown number of employees. The move comes after the studio cancelled a game that it was working on.</p>



<p>In a statement released to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sharkmob-london-faces-layoffs-after-game-cancelled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, the studio says it is working through trying to determine how many layoffs need to be made.</p>







<p>“As you know, our industry is facing challenges, meaning we must adapt to focus on the right opportunities as a business,” the company said. “Our team in London has been working on an unannounced game for some time and it is with regret that we now have to announce that this project has been cancelled.</p>



<p>“The decision to cancel the game, unfortunately means there will be a reduction in the number of people we can support in the London studio. This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those potentially impacted.”</p>



<p>As far as when the layoffs will actually take place, that remains to be seen. Sharkmob London was founded in 2020, and is one of two Sharkmob Studios. The other studio, Sharkmob Malmö, is currently working on the tactical extraction shooter Exoborne.</p>



<p>Sharkmob was purchased by Tencent in 2019. It’s first game, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodhunt was released in 2022.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-schreier-on-unearthing-the-secrets-of-blizzards-long-history-in-his-eye-opening-new-book<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If various news events in recent years have ever caused you to wonder, “What the heck has been going on at Blizzard Entertainment?” Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier’s new book has an answer for you.</p><p>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment is Schreier’s third book on the games industry, following Blood, Sweat, and Pixels (2017) and Press Reset: Ruin and Recovery in the Video Game Industry (2021). While both of Schreier’s previous books canvas multiple studios along a particular theme, Play Nice turns a focused lens on one of the most interesting and tumultuous studios in video games.</p><p>Play Nice covers three decades of Blizzard history, bookended by the foundation of the company by Allen Adham and Mike Morhaime in 1991 and Adham’s most recent departure from the company at the start of this year. To tell the story, Schreier has interviewed over 300 current and former employees about their memories and experiences with Blizzard. The story canvases the company’s rash of hits: Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, Overwatch, World of Warcraft, and Hearthstone, as well as a number of canceled or otherwise less successful projects. It examines the ups and downs of the company itself as it passed between corporate owners, the internal culture that resulted in both deep company loyalty, and one of the most prominent work culture lawsuits in video game history. </p><p>Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment is out on October 8, 2024. Ahead of its release, I was able to read through the entirety of an advanced copy of the book before speaking to Schreier at length about its contents, his work on it, and some of the insights readers can expect to glean from such a close look at Blizzard’s history. Our conversation is published in full below, lightly edited for clarity.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>So why Blizzard? What was most interesting about this specific company that warranted a book like this?</strong></p><p><strong>Jason Schreier:</strong> I think the idea first started formulating around 2018, when co-founder and CEO Mike Morhaime left the company, and when I first started hearing inklings that Activision was slowly taking over. And not just that they were taking over, but that there was this huge cultural clash between the way Activision did business and the way that Blizzard did business. And as I started hearing more and more about that, I didn't really actively start thinking like, "Oh, I need to write a book about this." But it started seeming to me like a really interesting story. And then as I was finishing up Press Reset, my last book, I think about a few months beforehand, I was thinking about, "Okay, what am I going to do next?" Because there's this huge buffer period between when you actually finish the book and when you publish it. So you're just sitting there, twiddling your thumbs, and waiting for it to come out.</p><p>So a few months before Press Reset, I was thinking, "What am I going to do next?" And I sent this pitch to my editor and my agent, I was like, "I have this idea that keeps popping into my head, that is the story of Blizzard. Its entire history, getting taken over by Activision, and what happens next." And then on top of that, I grew up playing Blizzard's games, Warcraft II especially, and StarCraft I, and Diablo II, which I spent many, many hours playing. So it seemed like a good... It was certainly a subject I knew a lot about and it seemed like a good fit for me. And then of course, in the summer of 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california"><u>California sued Blizzard's parent company, Activision, Blizzard, for sexual discrimination and misconduct</u></a>. And that was kind of like, "Oh, okay. This book just took a twist and a turn."</p><p>And then the number of developments that have happened since then have just made it seem even more vital to tell this story and to get this out there. But yeah, that was the sequence of events. I had started early preliminary work on the book before the California lawsuit, and I remember sending an email to my editor and my agent on that day when it hit being like, "Well, holy crap. This is a new twist in the saga." And then I spent the next three years after that reporting, talking to many, many people and writing the book.</p><p><strong>I think there’s an expectation from some readers that this book is going to be all about all these horrible, salacious things that people imagine must have happened at Blizzard because of that lawsuit. And you talk about it in there, certainly you don't ignore it, but that's not really the meat of Play Nice at all. Was that different from what you expected?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> No, I mean, this is a story that I wanted to tell. And it's also like, if you talk to women who were at Blizzard for a long time, which I have talked to many of those women, a lot of them are like, "Look, I mean, Blizzard is a lot more complicated than just this place that has been kind of portrayed by the lawsuit and kind of gotten this reputation for being this awful place. I don't know, this den of sex pests and misconduct and harassment." And there were certainly problems that I talk a lot about in the book, but I think one of the conclusions I came to from talking to a lot of different women who worked there was that women saw it as this kind of contradictory place a lot of the time. Where it's like, there were a lot of awful things, but there were also so many good things.</p><p>I think that's an important kind of aspect of that to capture here, and to make it clear that there's nuance beyond the splashy headlines and the California lawsuit. And as you see in the book, there's a lot of stuff that the California lawsuit misconstrued or got wrong as well. The other part of this is that this is a company with 33 years of history, and a lot of that history just says a lot more and is a lot more kind of multifaceted than just cultural stuff. There's a lot of business aspects of this story that I think really are interesting in and of themselves, and also say a lot about the video game industry as a whole.</p><p>And I thought that was really important to capture. And obviously the development of so many killer franchises is also an interesting story. I don't think you can do a Blizzard story without diving into why Warcraft... How Warcraft was created and what made it such a hit. And how StarCraft was created, how Diablo was created. The thing that I really enjoyed about doing this book is that I uncovered so many wild anecdotes that I don't even know where to start when I'm talking to people about it. Because every single kind of aspect of Blizzard history has its own just bonkers twists and turns. And yeah, the cultural issues are very real and an important thing to talk about, but not the only part of Blizzard's story.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Since we're on the subject, in the book you establish how this sort of bro culture that's been reported at Blizzard over the years, was built over time, both through people's choices and also just through circumstances that people were in. What do you think that people should be taking away from that aspect of your book? Especially as we start talking more as an industry about cultures specifically like that and how to avoid them in the future.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, it's really tough. I think that when you have these companies that were formed in the 90’s when the video game industry was almost entirely men, it's very hard to get out of that. And especially with companies like Blizzard. And now we're seeing Bungie, we're talking about Bungie a lot these days. And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"><u>you've reported on this quite a lot</u></a>. We're seeing companies where people have been working there for 30 years, and some of that experience might be really good and really helpful and valuable in today's video industry. But some of it is also, there are some bad habits that people pick up on. There's some bad cultural quirks or tendencies, or even really bad behavior that people carry with them, and that gets infused into the culture. I think if you are one of these companies, really if you're any video game company, you really have to do a lot of work to make sure that that isn't part of your company culture.</p><p>And video game companies especially, I talk a little bit in the book about how Blizzard was a place where people would go and wear flip-flops and t-shirts to the office. And they loved that about it. They called themselves a frat house back in the nineties. They described it in the 10-year anniversary video, which I discuss in the book, they describe it as more like a frat house than a business, than an office, in a really positive way. And I don't think that when they say that... You can interpret that in a lot of different ways, but I don't think when they say that they're imagining it in a negative, nasty, boys club sort of way. I think they're imagining it in a context of, "Look at all these other companies where they have to wear button-down shirts and khakis to work, and work these strict hours and don't play games with each other, barely talk to each other. Here we are at Blizzard, we're all wearing flip-flops and t-shirts, and playing games together and hanging out after work. And this place is awesome. It's like being in a frat house."</p><p>And with that, you have to look at the positive and the negative, and there is a lot of negative with that. And you have to, as a company, kind of figure out how to deal with that. And maybe you do set boundaries or maybe you find ways to make sure that everyone is feeling inclusive, even if you are a casual place where people can wear gaming t-shirts to work and hang out with each other on the weekends and stuff like that. So yeah, I mean, I don't think there are easy answers to a lot of these questions, but you certainly need to be discussing them. And I think one of the things that Blizzard wasn't good at, especially during the 2000s, as more women started joining the company…was having that conversation, and looking around and people being like, "Wait a minute, why are so many people here dating each other and married to each other? Even high level people with people below them at the company.” Like, "Is this a little funky? Should we talk about this?" And I think that's the sort of thing that nowadays, will be discussed a lot more, and I think that's a very good step.</p><p><strong>When I asked about why you were doing this book, you'd mentioned the tension of Activision taking over. And certainly I'm a big WoW player, so the thing in the WoW community is, "Oh, World of Warcraft (WoW) used to be so good before Activision showed up and ruined everything.” And I think your book paints a much more nuanced picture of that relationship and the struggles that Blizzard had with Activision, but also the struggles that were sort of self-inflicted. I'm curious where you came down on it. Do you ultimately feel that Activision was good for Blizzard?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, it's interesting. I think that, not to sound too centrist-y here, but I think this is a case where Blizzard was so far on one end of the spectrum of, "We are going to be creative and take our time, and do what we want and have false starts, and let people just really take their time." And I talk quite a few times in the book about Blizzard's kind of glacial way of doing things, all the way up to them taking months to do tasks that, at other companies, might take a few days or a few weeks. That's one end of the spectrum. And then on the other end of the spectrum, entirely, completely polar opposite, you have Activision with their commercial-driven, "Release date comes first. We are putting out a Call of Duty every single year, no matter what it takes. And we will pull any sort of money and people resource to make that happen."</p><p>And those two, instead of finding a way to meet in the middle, for various reasons, they just could not. And there was no room for compromise. And you had a lot of strong personalities, especially on the Activision end, coming in and trying to yank Blizzard all the way to their point of view. And it just did not work out. But I will say, I mean…WoW was a good example. I mean, that game's kind of woes and flaws over the years, a lot of people point at Cataclysm as the first big turning point for WoW. And that wasn't Activision's doing, that was entirely Blizzard. Bobby Kotick is not coming in and being like, "You need to destroy the world. Or you need to add Dungeon Finder or whatever." All the stuff that actually changed on a creative level with WoW, including a bunch of stuff that fans didn't like, that was entirely Blizzard's doing.</p><p>That said, there were pressures for sure coming up from above… And one of the things I've seen over the years is this belief that Activision was coming in and being like, "You need to do things cheaper." And I actually think it was kind of the opposite approach where Activision was coming in and saying, "You need to hire 400 more developers so you can make these games more quickly." Which is a very different sort of problem set to solve for a company like Blizzard. But very different than the Reddit sentiment I've seen where people just think Bobby is going around cutting costs and slashing people's budgets, and stuff like that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>This might just be what we just talked about, but your book very much canvases a lot of ups and downs over time for Blizzard. It changed leaders, personnel, owners, projects, all this stuff. Do you think that there's any one specific turning point or inflection point for them?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> If you go back in history, I think a lot of people think that... A lot of people seem to believe that Activision bought Blizzard or Activision merged with Blizzard, and before then, they were independent and doing all great, and having autonomy and stuff. But really, I mean, Blizzard's path to what it is today started in 1994, when Mike Morhaime and Alan Adham decided to sell the company to Davidson and Associates, which of course was the education software company behind Math Blaster of all things. And from there, it just shuffled around in this kind of ridiculous whirlwind of going from a mail order catalog company to this debacle of a merger that was this company called Sendin. That, of course, was almost immediately investigated by SEC for fraud, a story you can read about in the book. And then moving to Vivendi, a French utilities company. And then eventually moving to Activision.</p><p>And that shuffling was really entirely out of the hands of the Blizzard folks. And there was one point during the early Vivendi drama days, in the early 2000s, where the people who ran Blizzard were looking into and came close to potentially spinning out and trying to go independent, trying to buy back the company for themselves. And that didn't happen. But they had kind of lost their agency as a company. They did not make the business decisions for their company because they always had a parent company since then. So that really is the turning point. And then of course the merger with Activision really just kind of completely changed things for Blizzard. Seemed like a good move at the time. Escaping Vivendi was pretty essential for them at that point. But obviously, did not go well in the long run. And I think if the people who ran Blizzard at the time could go back in history and prevent that from happening, I think they probably would.</p><p><strong>I want to hit on a couple specific things that were in the book that stood out to me. Pretty early on, you almost nonchalantly mentioned, I don't know that I'd ever read about this anywhere else, a Blizzard Star Wars game that got discussed for five minutes and then didn't even make it to a prototype. Are there any more details on that that you're able to share at all?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Fantastic catch. Yes. So I too, when I heard about that from early Blizzard people, I was like, "Whoa, is this a scoop from 1995 that nobody has ever revealed?" Because no, nobody's ever talked about it before publicly, and that's because it was never really real. So what happened was, Blizzard was working on this game called Shattered Nations, and it was canceled for various reasons, even after being announced. It was announced publicly and then it was quietly canceled.</p><p>And then Allen Adham, who was the president of Blizzard at the time, and he was one of the two co-founders of the company, he came to everybody and was like, "Look, we're not going to do Shattered Nations, but we have this other potential thing that we're going to do, which is we're going to work with [George] Lucas and we're going to make this Star Wars RTS game. And it's going to be awesome." And so people started getting really excited and making concept art, yada, yada, yada. But I actually spoke to Jack Sorensen, who was president of Lucas Arts at the time. And he said he didn't remember anything like that. So it couldn't have gotten that far. And so, I'm not sure how real it really was. A lot of the kind of lower level Blizzard employees were pretty stoked about it, but I'm not sure how long it lasted. It couldn't have been more than a couple of months. And despite them drawing some really exciting AT-ATs going at it and stuff like that, it never actually came to fruition. But yeah, that's a fun bit of history.</p><p>And then of course it would eventually turn into StarCraft because they were like, "Hey, we like the idea of doing a sci-fi, real-time strategy game, so let's make StarCraft out of this." But yeah, the Star Wars project never actually came to fruition, but it's a fun little kind of what if moment in Blizzard history for sure.</p><p><strong>Another thing that jumped out, I didn't realize the circumstances around the closure of Blizzard North, and I'm still I guess trying to wrap my head around it. Did the company leaders get fired because of the culture? Was it over the email they sent? Can you clarify what was happening there?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> The context here is that this is 2003, and Vivendi, Blizzard's parent company, is just constantly in the news for all sorts of drama, all sorts of struggles. It's billions of dollars in debt. And everybody's like, "Why does Vivendi own an entertainment conglomerate?" It had parts of Universal. It was a mess. And so there were these rumors hitting the press about Vivendi potentially selling off its games division to Microsoft or Take-Two. And all these other suitors. And the Blizzard North bosses, David Brevik, [Erich and Max] Schaefer, and Bill Roper, all get together and they're like, "This is messed up. We need to be able to communicate to our employees what's going on, and we don't know what's going on. We're seeing these rumors in the press without hearing it from Vivendi." So they got together and they sent this email to Vivendi being like, "We plan to resign if we do not get this, this, and this and this."</p><p>Essentially, it was a threat. And Vivendi responded by accepting their resignation. And Mike Morhaime and his group of executives flew up to Blizzard North and they said, "Goodbye." And put in a new person and laid off some people, and refocused the studio. The other piece of context here that's important is that after Diablo II, which came out in 2000, and the next expansion came out the following year, Blizzard North was really floundering. And they were going off in all sorts of different directions, working on all these different projects that just were not coming together. In some cases, like playing video games all day instead of actually working. And so I think that maybe there would've been more pushback, either on a Blizzard South level or an executive level, somewhere, there would've been more pushback to the idea of accepting their resignations if there was more productivity out of Blizzard North.</p><p>And in fact, David Brevik, who was the director of the first two Diablo games and really seen as kind of the lead visionary and also president of the studio, Mike Morhaime came to him as this was all going down and being like, "Hey, if you want to stay, we'd love to keep you around, but not the rest of the bosses." And he was like, "No, I'm not going to do that to my co-founders." But I think in other words, it was partially them making this big grand gesture and resigning, and then partially the studio not being in good shape at the time, that led to... But they were never fired. Technically they resigned and their resignations were accepted. Yeah.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p><strong>I noticed also that you didn't say too much about Odyssey in the book, the survival game. I know you've reported on it before. Was there anything new you learned about it that you can share?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that game certainly seemed promising. I've seen some footage of it, it looked pretty. I think that I mentioned towards the end of the book a little bit about how it went through these technical challenges. But they had this concept at Blizzard to do this shared, company-wide game engine, which of course is the tech and tool set behind games. And Odyssey was going to use that… then the shared engine actually turned into the Odyssey engine, and they abandoned the idea of doing a shared engine. And they really struggled to get that thing working and to be able to get it to a point where they could actually make the game in it. So it came to the point where they had a ton of people on that team, they were trying to figure out how to enter production, and they realized they couldn't. And it was canceled as part of the big Microsoft layoffs earlier this year.</p><p>That game was in development for a very long time. It was pitched around 2016, 2017, something like that, as Blizzard's take on Rust. And there were some people really excited about the first couple of prototypes, which were done in Unreal Engine. And there was this notion among some people being like, "Hey, we should just put this out there because it's cooler than all the other early access survival games, and we could really seize on this." But there were other people at Blizzard who were like, "No, we're Blizzard. We make these big, epic games that sell millions and millions of copies. We don't want to just be another Valheim that maybe sells a few million and then is just in early access forever. And then it's just another survival game. We want to be the big Blizzard thing." And again, I mean to my point earlier about Blizzard moving slowly, this is a prime example of that, where maybe if they had released it after a couple of years instead of taking this six, seven year period to make it, and switching engines, then things might have looked differently for that project.</p><p><strong>You talk in the book about Chris Metzen returning to Blizzard, and in the last year he has taken on a more prominent role on Warcraft specifically. Did this surprise you? Do you have any thoughts about how his sort of grand return or whatever, might impact the direction of Warcraft as a whole or the company as a whole?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think it's really interesting. It certainly has fans jazzed because fans have always loved Metzen and his work, and his storytelling and his big, bombastic performances and showings, and him screaming, "Horde! Alliance!" at the BlizzCons. He's always been a fan favorite. And yeah, I think he brings... It's interesting, I was looking at the credits for Warcraft I, and I think after the most recent round of layoffs, which led to a few of the 30-year Blizzard veterans leaving as well, people like Sam Didier. Well, he actually left a couple months before the layoffs, but still. And people like Bob Fitch, I believe he left during that layoff, and he was one of the first Blizzard employees. What I'm getting at is that if you look at the Warcraft I credits, Metzen is now the only remaining person at the studio I believe, who worked on Warcraft I.</p><p>I think that him being there, him coming back brings a little bit of that old school Blizzard culture, for better or for worse, to the equation. Although, obviously Metzen, like most people, has changed a lot since his twenties. I have no indication in my reporting or anyone's reporting that Metzen was problematic in the way that some of the other people who have been named were problematic. And I think that there's something... I think if you're Blizzard, it's probably pretty important to have some of that kind of old school mentality around, even in a small dose. And having someone like Metzen around probably helps a lot of people boost the morale and makes people feel like, "Okay, this is still Blizzard. No matter what we've been through over the last few years, this is still Blizzard."</p><p><strong>It's interesting to see the community's obsession with him. People view him as this sort of savior, especially given his associations with the character, Thrall, in the lore.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that people tend to ascribe a little too much importance to single people for games, and there does tend to be a lot more collaboration. And anyone who's done anything creatively with a group of people knows that you can never really assign that much credit. A lot of it just comes... Ideas just kind of turn into a big stew and nobody could really take credit. I mean, even in Blizzard's case, in the case of this book, I went around actually, because I was very curious, and I asked a bunch of people who worked on vanilla World of Warcraft back before it actually came out. I said, "Hey, where did the name World of Warcraft come from?" And people were just like... Nobody really knows. It just kind of popped up. Everyone just started using it. And in the same way, a bunch of people all thought they had the idea to make a Warcraft version of EverQuest, that eventually turned into World of Warcraft.</p><p>Sometimes at a game studio, or on a game team within a studio, something just gets in the air, or ideas just kind of pop up and nobody really knows where they came from. In the case of Metzen, I mean he did play a pretty integral role in writing the story for a lot of Blizzard's games, for really most of Blizzard's games. So I think there is reason to look at him and be like, "Okay, if he had ideas for where this story of the Warcraft universe was going to go, maybe that's kind of coming now." But Blizzard has a lot of writers and a lot of people working on the story, and I think that you can't really give too much credit to a single person.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Your book ends on a real downer note for RTS fans. It sounds kind of like any dreams of Warcraft IV or StarCraft III got squashed when Tim Morten left. Do you think there's any hope?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier: </strong>No.</p><p><strong>That’s really sad!</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think there's hope for the IPs, like StarCraft definitely isn't dead. But the idea of a Warcraft IV or a StarCraft III does not seem very likely at Blizzard. And even one of the problems that Tim Morten, who was a production director on StarCraft II and tried to really get a new RTS game off the ground in the later years of Blizzard's history, even the problem he ran into was that he couldn't find a person who would be a really good director for that game, someone who had the experience making RTS games, and also most importantly, the interest in making a new RTS game.</p><p>And so, I think that was a bit of a struggle there. Because someone like Dustin Browder, for example, who was the director of StarCraft II, went off and worked on this new project, Aries, that was a shooter game. So a lot of times, it comes down to the people. And if the people aren't interested in actually making a game like that, then it's not going to happen. That said, I mean, there are a lot of spiritual successors to those games. Morten's game, Stormgate, just entered early access. And Battle Aces from David Kim, who was another StarCraft designer, and his team, that is imminent as well. So there are some games like that. But yeah, I would not hold your breath for one from Blizzard anytime soon.</p><p><strong>I don't know if I'm off base for thinking this, but there does seem to be sort of a phenomenon with Blizzard, maybe more so than most other companies, where so many other companies kind of spiral out of it. You're referring to a bunch of people who worked at Blizzard for a long time, became very known for their contributions, left, and then started their own studios, with sort of leaning on that Blizzard pedigree or that Blizzard culture. I feel like Blizzard has way more than most other studios. Do you get that sense as well? Why do you think that is?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, Riot is up there too these days… I think there are a couple reasons for that. One is that, as the book illustrates, there was a period, starting around 2018, really starting when Mike Morhaime left, when Blizzard was just losing so many veterans every single week that the company stopped sending emails about it because there were so many to announce. And it was demoralizing people.</p><p>And all of those people... Not all of those people, but a good number of those people went off and wanted to do new things, and wanted to start smaller teams. And especially a lot of the Blizzard veterans, and I'm actually writing an article about this for Bloomberg, there's this trend of veteran people who have worked in the video game industry for 10, 15, 20 years, looking around and being like, "We don't want to be on these teams of hundreds of people anymore. We want to go and do these smaller, focused studios where we can get back to the days where we could all fit in a single room and discuss ideas, and know each other's names and stuff like that, instead of being part of these big, massive, AAA machines."</p><p>So that's a big part of it. The other big part of it is that having that Blizzard cache makes it easier to tell a story about your studio. Which means it's easier to get investors, it's easier to get marketing and headlines, and gaming websites that are like, "Look at what these ex-Blizzard developers are doing." So it gives you more of a story to tell. That's another big reason. And then, yeah, I mean, I think the third reason is being able to do games that you wouldn't be able to do at Blizzard, whether it's RTS or whether it's other types of games that Blizzard shut down. There's a company called Notorious that was started by a guy named Chris Kaleiki, who essentially was like, "Look, I'm not able... Blizzard is not interested in this pitch that I'm doing, so I want to go and make a version of it somewhere else."</p><p>Or, because Blizzard expects their games to sell tens of millions of copies, and they're like, "We want to make a smaller, focused game that could potentially sell one million copies and do just fine for us because we're a team of 50 people instead of a team of 500 people." So yeah, there are a lot of potential reasons for that. And then also Blizzard, with so many people that inevitably there are going to be a lot of ex-Blizzard people who go and make stuff. </p><p><strong>Do you have any impressions from your work on this book, or thoughts on what Microsoft's acquisition of this company is going to change for it long term? Especially from the perspective of company and creative direction. Blizzard's now embedded basically three or four companies deep. So I'm curious if you think it still gets to be Blizzard.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> I think that what nobody foresaw when it happened was that the Blizzard deal would close. It closed about a year ago, as of when the book will be out. So October 13th of last year. Nobody foresaw that Microsoft would be going through these massive... Or Xbox would be going through the massive changes that it is this year. And if you told someone two years ago, "Oh yeah, Xbox is going to have this year where they lay off thousands of people. And also they start releasing their games on PlayStation and all this other stuff. And shut down the makers of Hi-Fi Rush and all this other stuff," people would've been like, "What are you talking about? What are you smoking?" So it's hard to make predictions about what all this means because nobody even knows what Xbox is going to look like as a brand in two years.</p><p>But I do think that there's optimism on the Blizzard level about not reporting to the former Activision C-suite anymore. I think that's been big as far as morale and as far as what people want to do, are able to do. But yeah, I mean, as far as overall product strategy and roadmap for the next five, ten years, all bets are off. I will say, I mean, I've heard a lot of good things about Johanna Faries, who's the new president of Blizzard as of February. I think there's optimism around her and what she can bring to the table. So yeah, I guess we'll see.</p><p><strong>I mean certainly reporting up to Microsoft as opposed to the Activision C-suite, one of the main things we've already seen it lead to is this </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-agrees-neutral-approach-future-activision-blizzard-unions"><u><strong>wave of unionization</strong></u></a><strong>, right? In World of Warcraft, </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-entire-development-team-has-officially-unionized"><u><strong>the wall-to-wall Union over there</strong></u></a><strong>, I mean, that's huge. That's one of the biggest games out there, getting a five-hundred-person-something-strong union. Is this something that you thought was possible when you were putting this book together? Do you think there's any factors that made Blizzard right for this, apart from the fact that Microsoft just has this open policy about unions?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier</strong>: I think that this would not have happened if not for the California lawsuit, because I think that was the first domino really. After the California lawsuit, a lot of Blizzard employees, they started a big Discord for ABK people, ABK being Activision Blizzard King, the whole company. And a Discord so that they could have unofficial chats. And there was a lot more communication outside of official work channels and outside of work hours, as people started organizing... It was walk-ins or <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-walkout"><u>walk-outs</u></a>, whatever you want to call it, picket lines, assemblies you might say, to protest Activision's reactions to the California lawsuit. And there were people standing in front of Blizzard's gates with signs and masks on, and just protesting Bobby Kotick and his responses to the lawsuit.</p><p>And I think that was really the first wave of organization. There had been some the year before, when people started talking about salaries within Blizzard and starting a spreadsheet, and pushing back against the administration about how much money they were making, and feeling like it was unfair and feeling like this big compensation review that they did was unfair. But really, the California lawsuit kind of spurred a lot of that stuff. And then what always happens, I mean, things move slowly and there are fits and starts along the way. What always, always happens in a lot of these companies is that the people who are most likely to be union organizers are also really unhappy or angry, and that's what's helping incentivize that. And then they wind up leaving and then there's nobody to fill their spot. So that happens a lot. And it's also really hard to organize because it's essentially doing another full-time job. So it took a lot for that to start happening.</p><p>And then of course, under the Activision regime, there was a lot of pushing back against unions...There were emails from Brian Bulatao, who was a C-suite member at the time, saying, "Hey, here are some reasons why organizing isn't a good idea for this company." And so, as part of Microsoft buying Activision, as part of its concessions to the FDC, as part of the whole antitrust regulation process, Microsoft agreed to take a stance of neutrality, which I think helped a lot when it came to actually getting this off the ground. So yeah, it was a lot of factors working together. To answer your question, I wouldn't say that I didn't envision it. In fact, the buzz I was hearing all along was that it was going to happen and people were having these active conversations. I couldn't have guessed that it would be the WoW team that was first to do it or anything like that. But yeah, it does not surprise me that this happened.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Activision Blizzard Lawsuit Timeline: The Story So Far</h3></div></output><p><strong>I know everybody is likely quite curious about what Blizzard's internal culture is like now, since the lawsuit has come out, it has been settled, all these things have happened. Do you get the sense that things are improving?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah. Things were improving even when the lawsuit hit. I think that the lawsuit... The lawsuit definitely was referring to specific people and specific problems that had been identified by Blizzard's management and then changed. That's not to say everything was perfect. I mean, after the lawsuit hit, there were dozens of people who were either reprimanded or let go in the wake of that. So certainly more change needed to happen. But this was an ongoing cultural change. I mean, some of the people that I name in the book is some of the most accused people, people like Alex Afraciabi, who was the creative director on WoW for a while, and Ben Kilgore, who was the chief technology officer, those people had been exited, specifically let go by Blizzard in previous years, before the lawsuit. But yeah, the lawsuit definitely catalyzed things. And I think what we're seeing now at a lot of game companies is more willingness to speak out. People who are just not really going to tolerate this sort of stuff anymore.</p><p>So yeah, I mean, I certainly have gotten the sense. But it's really hard to talk about Blizzard culture as a whole because so much of it is so team- and department- specific. So I think people's experiences on, I don't know, the Overwatch team, are very different than their experiences on the Diablo team, as an example. And then these days, so many people are remote that they're having drastically different experiences. It's very hard to... If you're a woman working at a games company, and you're working remotely, I think the chances of you facing some of the same sort of bullshit you might if you went into an office are much lower. So that's played a big role as well. And then obviously during COVID, everyone was remote. So yeah, there are a lot of factors at play here. But overall, I would say the video game industry is slowly inching toward progress, one small footstep at a time.</p><p><strong>Are there any lingering questions you had about Blizzard and its history, or anything going into this book, that you weren't able to answer?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier</strong>: Nothing I can think of. I think the book is hopefully pretty definitive when it comes to telling the Blizzard story. I think the biggest complaint about this book will be that even though it's a hundred thousand words, like 380 pages or whatever it is, I think people will say, "Man, I wish he had spent more time on this thing or this thing." Because when you're talking about the 33-year history of a company with as many games and teams and sagas that Blizzard went through, I think people are always going to be like, "Oh, why wasn't this thing mentioned? Why wasn't that mentioned?" But at the end of the day, I needed this book to be a manageable size so it can fit on shelves, and people will actually want to read the whole thing, that aren't just hardcore Blizzard fans. So I did have to leave some stuff out. But no, I don't have any lingering questions, at least that I can think of right now.</p><p><strong>Are there any wild stories or just silly facts that you didn't include, but you're just dying to share?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Oh, man. Let me think. Yeah, here's a fun story. So let me make sure I'm telling this the correct way. So back in the mid-nineties, when Blizzard was just a few dozen people, they played a lot of games in the office and they would even make up their own games. And there was this programmer who created this game that was sort of like a mix of Risk and Magic, The Gathering, where everyone had different territory and you would battle each other through magic games, and you would capture territory.</p><p>And there was a lot of politics involved. So people would just kind of betray each other, form alliances and stuff like that. And basically, long story short, this guy named James Phinney, who was a designer there, programmer turned designer, he concocted this scheme to get someone else to betray Alan Adham, the president and founder of the company, and come to James's side, so James could then defeat Alan Adham. And Alan looks at him after this betrayal and he is like, "Oh, James, you son of a gun. You have my respect now." And James Phinney believes …this epic orchestration of strategy is at least one of the reasons that Alan Adham then gave James the responsibility of lead designer of StarCraft I. So turns out, if you play games in the office really well, you might get ahead at the studio.</p><p><strong>Was there anything in this book that you discovered that surprised you?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Everything. Yeah, a ton of stuff surprised me.</p><p><strong>Well, you've been on the beat for so long, at a certain point, I assume that not too much surprises you at all.</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> Yeah, but you know what? I think when you're going into history, there might be stuff that's publicly documented but you don't necessarily know about. I mean, even just to pick a random example, and there's a ton of stuff in here that really surprised me, but to pick a random example, diving into the history of Activision and how Bobby Kotick wound up taking it over and leading it out of bankruptcy into the behemoth it is today, is just so wild.</p><p>And a lot of that stuff has been... Some of the stuff I'm revealing for the first time, or at least packaging for the first time in the way that this is told, but still, most people don't know it. Most people don't know how Bobby Kotick kind of happened to sit next to this guy Steve Wynn at a fundraiser in Texas and befriended him. And Steve Wynn, of course the casino mogul, who would then go on to become Bobby Kotick's godfather and mentor and biggest business advocate, helped Bobby put together this deal and kind of hostile takeover, to take over Activision and then turn it around as a business. And that whole saga is just mind-boggling.</p><p><strong>Is there anything that I'm not asking you about that you are just dying to talk about?</strong></p><p><strong>Schreier:</strong> So many things. The thing about this book is that there's so many directions that I could go in. There's so much stuff we haven't gotten into. Everything from the Overwatch story to the Hearthstone story, to the Diablo redemption story, to Armin Zerza, who became the kind of CFO of Blizzard. And he's quite a personality. God, there's just so much stuff that we could get into. Yeah, I don't know. I hope this book resonates with folks. I think it will. I think people will enjoy reading it. I think what really is exciting to me about this book is that hopefully it's appealing even to people who don't care about Blizzard or don't play their games, or just have a cursory interest in Blizzard. Because I think the story of Blizzard just says so much overall about the entire gaming industry, both from a business perspective and from a cultural perspective, and from a creative perspective too. I just think it's a very illuminating story for a lot of different reasons.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

                <p>While the 2024 iteration of Fortnitemares hasn't yet been announced, this week's Fortnite update included a loading screen that appears to be the key art for this year's version of Fortnite's annual spooky event--and it spills the beans on six new skins you'll be able to buy this October. The headliners are two new horror movie collab skins: Leatherface from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Billy the Puppet from Saw.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376784" data-ratio="0.56246401842257" data-width="1737" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376784"></a><figcaption>Fortnite's newest Fortnitemares event looks packed with horror collabs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4376784-fortnitemares2024leatherfacebillysaw.jpg"></figure><p>On top of that, there are five other previously unrevealed new skins here. There's a new purple version of Guff, a new remix of Red Knight that glows purple, a pumpkin remix of Ultima Knight, a witchy new iteration of Lexa, and a spooky new version of Marshmello. Considering how Epic has handled the Ariana Grande and J Balvin Icon skins lately, it's very possible that this new Marshmello is an entirely new skin that will have to be purchased separately, rather than a new style for the existing Marshmello skin.</p><p>We don't really know much else about what's in store for Fortnitemares this year since nothing has been announced yet, but it usually involves at least one existing map location being converted into a new creepy place, and a mythic gameplay item of some sort--<a href="https://x.com/Guille_GAG/status/1841034240189681936" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leakers indicate</a> it may be an exploding Saw puppet on a tricycle.</p><p>The gameplay details of Fortnitemares is hardly the only part of it that remains under wraps--we don't actually even know when it starts. But we have a big potential clue: There will be <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1841115998948053458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">some sort of battle royale live event</a> taking place this Saturday, December 5 at 2pm ET, according to a new countdown on the map. With four weeks left in the season, it's a bit early for a season finale event, so it could be that Doctor Doom is going to unleash the Fortnitemares himself.</p><p>Aside from the skins in the image, there are two other reported upcoming collabs that we just learned about. Shaquille O'Neal will be getting a <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1840859765548707889" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set of Icon skins this week</a>, and it also appears as though Sally and the Pumpkin King from The Nightmare Before Christmas <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1841036058206577075" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">are being added</a>. If you're a Fortnite cosmetics collector, this October is looking pretty expensive--but, hey, it's nice to have options.</p>

The patch notes reveal buffs for several Modern Warfare 2 weapons. Other small changes include spawn adjustments for Shipment map variants in multiplayer and improvements for challenges in Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">For Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer, the update adjusts the spawns for Shipment maps to make them more consistent across the different variants. The developer says this change was based on player feedback and analytics, which revealed the spawn quality was better on the Shipmas version of the map, so now all Shipment maps should have spawns more in line with the Christmas variant.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The crossbow from Modern Warfare 2 received a significant buff to make it more viable to use. The changes include an 81% increase to the bolt velocity, a 70% decrease to bolt-gravity influence, and a small increase to the neck-damage multiplier. The update also removes the aim-down-sight spread for the Brightblaze, Blastcap, and Caustic 20" bolt types.</p><p dir="ltr">Several shotguns from Modern Warfare 2 are buffed. This includes damage-range buffs for the KV Broadside, Lockwood 300, Expedite 12, Bryson 800, and the Bryson 890. Buffs are also included for MW2 handguns, which aim to improve the damage and damage range of the pistols. This list includes the P890, .50 GS, X12, and Basilisk handguns.</p><p dir="ltr">While last year's guns are getting improvements, Season 6's DTIR 30-06 battle rifle is nerfed for multiplayer. The gun received a slight decrease to the lower-torso damage multiplier, with a drop from 1.3x to 1.0x.</p><p dir="ltr">The update is much smaller on the Warzone side. The only weapon balancing is the crossbow change. MW2's crossbow receives a similar buff as mentioned above for multiplayer. The neck-damage multiplier didn't get adjusted, but it does have the 81% increase to the bolt velocity and a 70% decrease to bolt-gravity influence. It also removes the aim-down-sight spread for the Brightblaze, Blastcap, and Caustic 20" bolt types.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes include an adjustment to the Terriball challenge for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzones-new-purgatory-ltm-cant-be-won-and-thats-why-its-great/1100-6526671/">Warzone's Purgatory LTM mode</a>.

The team wants to take a "new approach" to licensed games after working on titles like John Wick Hex and Hellboy: Web of Wyrd.</p><p dir="ltr">No new games were unveiled with the introduction of Big Fan Games. The publisher notes that it wants to work with indie developers on games that aren't just "marketing tie-ins" to help launch a movie or comic book. Instead, Big Fan Games wants its titles to do their own thing.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="4091152" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grounded-no-longer-requires-microsoft-accounts-on-steam-for-multiplayer.997596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grounded-steam-microsoft-account<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update for downsized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>has been released, and if you're not a fan of having to sign into your Microsoft account when you play on Steam, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Per the update's (admittedly small) <a href="https://grounded.obsidian.net/news/grounded/grounded-patch-145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, you'll no longer need to sign into your Microsoft account if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s multiplayer modes with your friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not logged into your Microsoft account, you can now host and join standard multiplayer sessions with other players who are already on your Steam friends list, so if you've been hoping to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>without your Microsoft account getting in the way, today's your lucky day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=o2frAHft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=Povo7SAg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>no longer requires you to sign into a Microsoft account to play multiplayer on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>There is one major caveat, though. If you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>cross-platform, or you want to play on shared worlds or in Playgrounds, you're still going to need to sign into your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>As well as this change, Obsidian and Microsoft have also implemented a new switch that lets you toggle between a Crossplay State and a Steam Native State, and you'll need to be in the same state as your friends to see them online.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can also unlink your Microsoft account from your Steam account completely via&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s Options menu; just navigate to Game, then Unlink Microsoft Account. Again, though, this will prevent you from accessing some of the game's features on Steam.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass, you'll still need to use your Microsoft account to access it, so there haven't been any changes on that front.</p>

<p>This change comes in the wake of the controversy surrounding Sony requiring a sign-in to a PlayStation account in order to play its games on PC, with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>coming in for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">particularly vicious criticism</a> over this decision.</p>
<p>Eventually, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked the change back</a>, and the fact that both&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>don't require external accounts will probably set tongues wagging the next time a Sony game hits the PC.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is available right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grounded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grounded/9pjthrnvh62h" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/grounded-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259402/devolver-digital-big-fan-licensed-indie-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced the creation of a new publishing label designed specifically for licensed games. The label, named <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/">Big Fan Games</a>, is helmed by industry veterans who have worked with brands like Disney, Dark Horse, and more. In a press release, Devolver said that the new company’s goals are “helping independent game developers breathe new life into their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes through the power of video games.” Big Fan already has a number of games on its roster, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17764070/reigns-game-of-thrones-hbo-devolver"><em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23791503/a-hellboy-game-that-looks-like-the-hellboy-comics"><em>Hellboy Web of Wyrd</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682291/john-wick-hex-hands-on-mike-bithell-interview-e3-2019"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>.</p><p>Licensed games were a big portion of the video game industry in the late ’80s and early ’90s. A lot of games that have been enshrined in older gamers’ imagination as being harder than the games of today were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375434/disney-video-games-aladdin-the-lion-king-the-jungle-book-gog">licensed platformers like Disney’s <em>Lion King</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265996/making-ducktales-remastered"><em>DuckTales</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22969751/tmnt-classic-games-bundle-konami-ps4-ps5-ninja-turtles-retro"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> on the NES. However, their quality started to decline, and soon, licensed games became thought of as little more than interactive commercials. </p><p>Though sentiments regarding licensed games have changed, the team at Big Fan is aware of the stigma, sharing in the press release that the “goal at Big Fan is to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.”</p><p>The launch of a label centered on licensed properties seems right on time as those kinds of games are experiencing a new renaissance and attention from the industry’s biggest studios. Respawn Entertainment has seen enormous success with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn">duology of</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars</em> games</a>. <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> launched in 2022 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interviewhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">to critical acclaim</a>. MachineGames is due to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040391/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gameplay-trailer-xbox-bethesda">a new <em>Indiana Jones</em> video game later this year</a>, while IO Interactive, maker of the <em>Hitman</em> franchise, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman">is working on a James Bond game</a>.</p><p>Big Fan seeks to keep the trend going, saying that “independent games created in these universes can explore them in new and unexpected ways, and it’s our goal to raise the bar of what fans can expect.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For reasons that seemingly amount to japery, Google have unveiled a double-sided, endlessly looping keyboard design – but only in Japan, and they’re not actually making it. However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on <a href="https://github.com/google/mozc-devices/tree/master/mozc-doublesided">GitHub</a>, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/keyboards/google-showcases-bizarre-double-sided-japanese-keyboard-which-it-wont-sell-the-keyboard-uses-a-mobius-strip-as-its-foundation">Tom’s Hardware</a>) as a controller.</p>

<p>While the keyboard itself is quite literally a joke – see its tee-hee ho-ho 'trailer' above – I am dead serious that it could be the centrepiece for an enjoyably competitive, 2-4 player button mash-off that would make the average <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-jackbox-party-pack">Jackbox</a> session look like a model UN meeting. The circular, omnidirectional shape makes it perfect for gathering round in a group, and its fully mechanical keys – besides giving the Gboard some cred as a gaming peripheral – should be hardy enough to survive the furious bashing that 'friendly' party games inevitably devolve into.</p>
<p>As for the actual game design... I’ll leave that to the pros, though inspiration is out there. Chiefly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/play-unique-alt-controller-delights-at-egx-2023-in-london-this-week">Karting Khaos</a>, a simple top-down racer that we hosted at the Future of Play booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/egx-london-2023">EGX 2023</a>. Each player gets assigned a kart, but their steering and acceleration controls are randomly assigned across 24 comedy quiz show buttons – producing thrillingly disorganised contests, as racers hunt for their gas pedals and contend with mid-race input scrambles. It’s tremendous fun, and in the course of writing this paragraph, I have become tremendously sad that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">Gamer Network sale</a> means I won’t be able to hang around the booth playing it again this year.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Still, bigger picture: a keyboard like this twisting monstrosity could easily allow us to recreate Karting Khaos’ madcap vibe, but in the comfort of our own homes, and without the need for a table-sized controller. Just one about as big as a generous birthday cake, and that can fascinate mathematicians for centuries.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>XR Games, the VR studio behind games like Starship Troopers: Continuum and Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, has told a number of employees that they are at risk of being laid off.</p>



<p>According to a number of employees on LinkedIn — first reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-vr-studio-xr-games-placing-72-employees-at-risk-of-redundancy-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> — management has said that at least 72 employees are at risk of redundancy. For those that may not know, being at risk of redundancy means that a position is being considered by a company for termination. While it’s not necessarily a set in stone decision, it can be viewed as a writing on the wall type of move.</p>



<p>The moves come as part of a “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joe-hopson-664381162_opentowork-activity-7246871973954301954-B1a3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive restructuring</a>” at XR Games.</p>



<p>“Multiple redundancies (72 to be exact) are taking place at the company,” QA project lead Tamara Whymark said. “I know the games industry is hard at the moment but I also want to give support for all my colleagues, they’re some of the most talented people I’ve ever met so please keep your eye out for them!”</p>



<p>XR Games recently released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded to numerous criticisms due to the quality of the game. It prompted the studio to <a href="https://x.com/xrgamesvr/status/1833192314891571244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a statement</a> saying that the game’s release didn’t meet their “high expectations”. They also said that they were committed to updating and improving the game to meet those expectations of both players and the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to XR Games for comment on the reported layoff plans.</p>



<p>So far this year, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies. It’s expected that more layoffs will happen as the year comes to a close.</p>

While Max has gone on to have his own successful career in the video game industry, working on titles like <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em> and <em>Battlefield 1</em>, it’s impossible to completely escape his father’s shadow.  However, as he told <em>MinnMax</em>, it was actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237">Steven Spielberg and his love of video games</a></span> that got Max interested in the medium and the industry. </p><p> “He loves gaming. He’s the one that got me into it. He plays games.

He plays the campaign,” said Max. </p><p>Interestingly, Max explained that his father, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284">who loves story-focused games</a></span>, never learned how to play games using a controller and is more comfortable using a keyboard and mouse. However, he apparently plays a lot of mobile games like <em>Golf Clash</em>. </p><p>“He’s big into story games and I’m always trying to get him to play <em>Uncharted</em>, I’m like it’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a></span>, you’d appreciate this. And he’s like ‘I can’t do controllers. I can only do keyboard and mouse.’”</p><p> As mentioned in the MinnMax interview, Max’s father doesn’t come up much at work as people are usually professional and not looking dig for info or stories. But Max Spielberg has shown his upcoming game, <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark,</em> to his dad for feedback. His father said that the co-op hack-and-slash game that also features town-building and roguelike elements looks great. And while Max’s father doesn’t usually come up during development, Lynked’s art director Eric Kozlowsky pointed out, “You can’t help but feel like [your] doing something right” when Steven Spielberg likes your artwork or designs. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playlynked.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playlynked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark </em>arrives on Steam via early access on October 22</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a total of five characters and eight unique class options (not counting each character’s default classes), you’ll have a total of <em>40</em> possible classes to use in your active party. That’s a lot of choices, especially since you can only use three of them at once!</p><p>Truthfully, it’s hard to say what the “best class” or the “best team” is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each character can fulfill different party roles depending on their class, ranging from pure damage dealers to dedicated supporters. In the end, how you synergize your active team’s abilities and exploit your enemies’ weaknesses will matter more than the specific classes you choose. But if you’d like a little nudge to figure out how you should build your team into the awesome monster slayers you know they can be, consider using the classes we’ve picked here.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Evaluations are based on how each class performs throughout the game, not just their endgame potential. For this reason, skills each class learns in the first two tiers of their Elemental Plot will be typically weighed much higher than tier three and tier four skills.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36024"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h36025"><a id=""></a>Val: Rune Knight Details</h3><p><strong>Rune Knight is your best damage dealer in the early game of <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. It’s the first character class you can unlock, and comes right out of the box with two elemental imbuement skills and a great 20 percent attack boost when Val uses said imbuements. Exploiting elemental weaknesses can skyrocket your outgoing damage, so this class will help you tear down even the bulkiest of foes. Val can learn more imbuement skills as he unlocks new classes too, which lets Rune Knight scale well into the mid and late game.</p><p>Once Morley can use his first Chalice to unlock the second tier of his Elemental Plot, Val may fall behind as a main damage dealer for reasons that will become apparent later. Still, <strong>Rune Knight Val</strong> performs incredibly well as a support DPS, and you’ll be happy to have him on your team.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-recommend-id="image://9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-recommend-id="image://9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36026"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h36027"><a id=""></a>Val: Edelfrei Details</h3><p>f you’re playing on Hard mode, or you’re fighting monsters that are way higher level than you are, designating a party member to draw the enemy’s attention can seriously take the heat off your team. <strong>No other character is better equipped to fulfill the Tank role than Val, and Edelfrei lets Val fill multiple party roles at once</strong>. This class gives Val knockback resistance, a damage boost for hitting elemental weaknesses (which we’ve established Val is good at), and a built-in healing option thanks to Dryad’s Elemental Vessel. Equip Val with Ability Seeds that boost his defenses and you’ll have a reliable wall to send to your front lines.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-recommend-id="image://66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-recommend-id="image://66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36028"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Luck</p><h3 id="h36029"><a id=""></a>Careena: Divine Fist Details</h3><p>Class Strikes are comically powerful in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. These attacks can defeat entire groups of enemies in a single hit, and <strong>Careena’s Divine Fist class is all about making your Class Strikes even better</strong>. Not only can Careena ignore a chunk of her foes’ defense stats thanks to the Fighting Spirit ability, she can also fill the Class Strike gauge faster and even give herself an attack buff after each Class Strike. You can also equip her with all those buff and debuff moves from her other class options, letting her fulfill a supporting role as well!</p><p>Careena as a Divine Fist will help you tear through common enemies and obliterate boss health bars alike. What’s more, since Class Strikes stop the clock in Elemental Aerie battles, she’ll help you clear battle arenas above your current level too. Careena might not look like a fighter, but her fists are not to be trifled with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-recommend-id="image://7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-recommend-id="image://7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36030"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Luck</p><h3 id="h36031"><a id=""></a>Morley: Nightblade Details</h3><p>Morley may look like a cat, but make no mistake, this boy is the G.O.A.T. Nightblade is one of Morley’s strongest classes from the minute you recruit him, but it’s not terribly impressive at first. However, once you access the second tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, everything changes. A 20 percent critical hit damage increase <em>and</em> an absurd 70 percent critical hit rate buff increases his damage potential to ludicrous heights. Augment his critical hit rate and damage further via Ability Seeds, and all of the sudden you have a lightning-fast attacker who can stack dozens of guaranteed critical hits in a handful of seconds.</p><p><strong>I strongly recommend using Morley as your main damage dealer</strong>. The only downside is that, unless you’re playing on hard mode, a well-optimized Morley might make the game too easy. Even Luna’s Elemental Vessel ability works well with this class, since it can stop enemies in their tracks while Morley unleashes a flurry of powerful attacks. Between great damage and the ability to stunlock several enemies in the game, what more could you ask for?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36032"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Intellect<br></p><h3 id="h36033"><a id=""></a>Palamena: Grand Diviner Details</h3><p><strong>Nobody uses magic like Palamena, and the Grand Diviner class lets her do what she does best</strong>. While Grand Diviner gives Palamena a healthy Intellect stat to work with, she can restore half her MP bar after every battle for free with the Fluid Flourish skill. This means you can set Palamena to “All-Out Attack” and “Go Wild” in her battle AI and she’ll almost never run out of magic throughout a dungeon. Make sure to learn spells from the other classes on her Elemental Plot to help her exploit enemy weaknesses whenever she can!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-recommend-id="image://71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-recommend-id="image://71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36034"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Intellect<br></p><h3 id="h36035"><a id=""></a>Palamena: Magus Details</h3><p>While Val had two best class options that fulfill different roles, Palamena’s Magus class is a different flavor of her magic casting niche. Magus has an even <em>higher</em> magic stat than Grand Diviner, and it sports valuable knockback immunity while Palamena is casting. Palamena does lose that handy MP regeneration after every battle, but by the time you unlock this class, you should have the cash to afford all the magic recovery items Palamena needs to sustain herself.</p><p>You may prefer Grand Diviner if you mostly use Palamena against random enemy mobs, but bosses and other big bads will melt faster if you use Magus instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-recommend-id="image://ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-recommend-id="image://ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36036"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Spirit, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h36037"><a id=""></a>Julei: High Cleric Details</h3><p>As the last character to join your party, Julei fills a niche that your gang has likely struggled to fill until now: Healing. And of all the classes Julei can pick, High Cleric is the healer-est of them all. With a sky-high Spirit stat and a buff that doubles the healing potential of Julei’s moves, the little sproutling will become easily capable of topping off a party member’s HP with a single spell. But really, because High Cleric gives Julei his most foundational healing and status recovery spells, you’ll want to invest in this class no matter how you build Julei.</p><p>Once Julei does unlock his third tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, the Healing Light + spell massively elevates his usefulness. The ability to functionally heal the entire party’s HP in a single cast is borderline essential for the game’s hardest challenges, and the Strong Roots skill will help him survive one fatal blow per battle. I highly recommend giving Julei resistance to status ailments and strong defenses so he can always bring your party back from the brink.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h36038"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Spirit, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h36039"><a id=""></a>Julei: Necromancer Details</h3><p>Julei’s Necromancer is incredible on paper, but the game provides precious few opportunities for it to really excel. Its first two tiers of moves aren’t especially exciting (though a passive defense debuff to all enemies can be nice), but its signature Dark Curse spell in the third tier is the real selling point here. A spell that debuffs <em>all</em> of an enemy’s stats, alongside buffs that extends the spell’s duration and lets it target all enemies? Sign me up!</p><p>Unfortunately, there’s just one tiny problem here: Dark Curse is a Dark attack. Against enemies that resist darkness, which includes the final boss and the game’s strongest post-game bosses, Dark Curse doesn’t put in much work. Still, this class can be helpful depending on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-benevodon-boss-fights-guide-1851655719&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/visions-of-mana-benevodon-boss-fights-guide-1851655719">how early you unlock Julei’s third tier of his Elemental Plot</a></span>, and the full suite of debuffs can help in Elemental Aeries too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-studios-holding-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hi-Rez Studios, the developers of Smite and Smite 2, is the next studio holding layoffs during a year full of them. </p>



<p>The announcement came via a Twitter post by Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam. In his <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy message</a>, he said that the decision to layoff “some team members” comes with a “focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future.”</p>



<p>“Today, we’re making some difficult but necessary changes to ensure Hi-Rez’s long-term success, with a specific focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future,” Chisam said.</p>



<p>While there was no mention of just how many people would be let go due to the “internal reorganization and reprioritization”, Chisam says that it will “disproportionately” involve people in marketing and publishing positions. He added that it will impact people from Evil  Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions of the company.</p>



<p>He also said that the layoffs show a “failure” in his leadership at the company.</p>



<p>“This news has a real human impact at a tough time for workers in this industry,” he said. “Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-the-hi-rez-layoffs-now">Why The Hi-Rez Layoffs Now?</h2>



<p>Chisam says that the layoffs come after a “comprehensive review” of the company’s strategy. The decision was made to put full efforts into Smite 2 moving forward with small teams remaining to support the original Smite and Paladins. He then says that the development team on Smite 2 remains larger than the first game.</p>



<p>“Notably, the core dev team currently working on Smite 2 after these changes is still a significant size: Larger than the Smite 1 team was throughout most of its lifecycle (outside of a period during and shortly after the pandemic),” he said. “The team working on gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the SMITE 1 team ever was for such features.”</p>



<p>Chisam closed his statement saying that that he believed the changes were necessary albeit difficult, and that the company will “emerge stronger from them”.</p>



<p>Through the first nine months of 2024, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies.</p>

fully constructed, you can check out some cool Easter eggs hidden in this plastic bust. For example, there's a Chaos Emerald inside of Shadow, his base contains several gold rings, and he comes with a nameplate to attach to his display. This version of Shadow is based on his very first appearance in Sonic Adventure 2, a 2001 game for the Sega Dreamcast.</p><p>Shadow has starred in several other video games over the decades--including that one 2005 game where he had a cool motorcycle and lots of guns--and he'll be appearing on the big screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Making a switch from hitman to hedgehog, Keanu Reeves will voice Shadow in the threequel, and video game fans can also look forward to seeing Shadow pop up in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Generations</a> on October 25.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone/1100-6525218/">Lego Fortnite sets</a> also released today, October 1, and if you're a fan of the battle royale series, you can pick up some fun kits like the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fbattle-bus-77073&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Battle Bus</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fdurrr-burger-77070&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Durr Burger</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsupply-llama-77071&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supply Llama</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fpeely-bone-77072&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peely Bone</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater celebrated its 25-year anniversary on September 29, 2024. Below, we look back at how it began, and its influence as an unconventional platformer.<br></em></p><p dir="ltr">The 1990s were a wild time for skateboarding. Professionals like Tony Hawk were pushing the limits of what seemed possible by nailing unbelievable stunts for the first time in history--the loop of death, a 16ft ollie between water towers, and the first 900. Little did we know that these stunts and the people behind them would become part of the foundation of one of the greatest platformers of all time: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1999 classic has officially turned 25 this year. Its legacy of incredible arcade gameplay--the one that spawned eight sequels, millions in sales, and countless kickflips and heelflips--is still as prevalent today as it was when the X Games were at the height of their popularity. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brought skateboarding to a new level of cultural significance as people of all ages, kids especially, found their way to real-world skateboarding after shredding through the digital remains of an old abandoned mall.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk and other skaters weren't just turning skateboarding into a phenomenon, they were turning it into an extreme sport. Skateboarders were practically superheroes while ollieing through traffic and grinding across power lines in the real world. The Birdman wanted to replicate that feeling in a game when he set out to partner with a studio. The demo from Neversoft made anyone–not just skateboarders–feel like they were superman with a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">"Activision called me and I knew right away that was exactly what I wanted to work on," he said in a 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2017/01/13/the-oral-history-of-the-tony-hawks-pro-skater/" rel="nofollow ">Jenkem</a>.

The simple movement, especially for a release that came just years after Super Mario 64, was as sharp as any other platformer out there.</p><p dir="ltr">"We never wanted you to accidentally do something you didn't want to do. Even if that was cool. We wanted it to do exactly what you were telling it to do," said Tony Hawk's Pro Skater producer Scott Pease in a 2019 <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2019/8/30/20838769/oral-history-tony-hawk-pro-skater-soundtrack-les-claypool-neversoft-activision" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with The Ringer. "When you actually physically push that button and then you get snapped into that rail, it feels like you're doing something, versus the game kind of playing itself."</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a sports game, and a skateboarding game if you'd categorize that as a whole genre, but its core mechanics set Tony Hawk besides the likes of Mario, Astro Bot, and the Fall Guys. Like any great platformer, the core of the game is about navigating tricky jumps with precision timing, and chaining your movements together into one impeccably smooth line. Like those heroes and their catalog of wild adventures, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater had its fair share of arcade zaniness.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding across the top of a movie theater's showtime display in Minneapolis and doing an ollie over a cable car in San Francisco were just a couple of things that you'd never see in the real world unless Red Bull set up a stunt for it. Those were simply challenges and fun things to do while riding around in an open space.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of those early parks was a seamless combination of exploration, platforming, and eventually style-themed challenges where each two minute long run provided a different kind of fun. First you'd just explore to get the lay of the land, then you'd try and find all the secrets, and finally you'd find the fastest and most efficient way to collect everything and earn the most points in a level. It was a recipe for replayability.</p><p dir="ltr">Each following game did a little to make their parks feel more alive. Pro Skater 3 brought pedestrians, Pro Skater 4 brought animals, and Underground actually let you get off your board to explore things up close.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, built on the framework of Neversoft's earlier project <em>Apocalypse</em>--which featured Bruce Willis blowing things up--had straightforward movement mechanics. There was a limited set of tricks and the primary way to combine tricks was to grind and wall ride. Later games would improve on this, bringing in the manual, natural ways to combine tricks, and better game development technology that made riding a skateboard in a digital space tighter.</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of fantastic movement and open playgrounds was widely appealing. It made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater a game that almost anyone could jump into. The tricks were important, but the ability to go your own way was the real attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of people did say, 'You can't really do that. You can't just make a game that's pure tricks. It's not going to work, no one's done that. It's not real, man, you'd run out of speed.' So we had this big internal debate," Pease said in a separate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5926545/neversoft-tony-hawk-guitar-hero-close" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with Polygon. "We just started to lean into the natural act of skating in a real environment, going anywhere, exploring, finding your own lines and being creative.”</p><p dir="ltr">The history behind the studios that have made the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series--including the games that would eventually drop the Pro Skater title and the eventual 2020 remaster--have disbanded. Neversoft, the studio behind the 1999 hit, disbanded in 2014. Vicarious Visions, the team behind the 2020 remaster, was folded into other Activision Blizzard teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though the team that is behind it is no longer working on the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a gigantic success. It sold more than a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-1-2-i-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-two-weeks" rel="nofollow ">million copies</a> in the span of two weeks. Players have continued to dig into the games create-a-park mode, despite little support for the remasters online modes.</p><p dir="ltr">The love that players--not just skateboarding fans--have for the simple joy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater gameplay is incredible. They were devastated when reports that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/#:~:text=Tony%20Hawk's%20Pro%20Skater%203,Call%20Of%20Duty%20Content%20-%20GameSpot">remake</a> of the second and third game in the series was rejected in favor of Call of Duty development.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709"></a><figcaption>Hawk grabbing some serious air</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision has said that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is an "<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/tony-hawks-pro-skate-25th-anniversary-interview-save-state/" rel="nofollow ">important core</a>" franchise for it today, sparking some hope that more remakes and new games could be in the future. Under new ownership at Microsoft, perhaps it's a franchise that will be revisited. It would be fantastic to see a new game continue to evolve the incredible premise of a skateboarding platformer, but the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater will forever live alongside Mario.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thanks to Activision, Neversoft (RIP) and all of you that played THPS in those formative years," Tony Hawk said in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAgXDa1PI8a/" rel="nofollow ">post</a> to commemorate the games 25th anniversary. "I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p><p dir="ltr">There is as much demand for fantastic platformers today as there was in 1999 as Astro Bot, Super Mario Odyssey, and even Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 have shown us. Players, both new and old, would immediately feel right at home on the digital concrete of a new Tony Hawk game, especially if The Birdman is still making sure the game experience lives up to the hype of real-world skateboarding.</p>
