            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear-hunger">Fear &amp; Hunger</a> games are pitch-black horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>s quite unlike anything else I’ve ever played, taking aspects of JRPG, survival <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure games</a> and distilling them into something I’d be tempted to call bleakly nihilistic if they didn’t display so much evident love for their craft. They also both start with a content warning listing “extreme violence, gore, sexual violence, and drug usage”. You’ll want to take this seriously, and just to be clear: the third item on this list does manifest in some tasteless, albeit brief, ways in the first game. It’s a frustrating blemish on what is otherwise an incredibly evocative and creative series, though you can download <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fearandhunger/mods/13">a mod</a> to censor the more egregious bits. You will miss the full effect of critically severing an ogre’s massive schlong, however.</p>

<p>Either way, both titles are currently sitting at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=Miro%20Haverinen">30% off on Steam</a>, or just over a tenner in brit-nuggets. You should consider them if you like any of the following: Berserk, Robert Chambers’ The King In Yellow, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, Hellraiser, or that thing lots of FMV games and cinematic platformers used to do where you can get killed in lots of different, instant ways by making the wrong choices. They also remind me quite a bit of tabletop game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-obsession-with-a-singular-board-game-makes-me-fear-the-unchill-passage-of-time">Kingdom Death: Monster</a>. Sometimes, you don’t get killed, you just get your legs chopped off and have to quite literally crawl around for the rest of the game. Sometimes you lose both eyes. You can keep playing, if you want, you just won’t be able see anything.</p>
<p>The genesis for the first game, apparently, was as a sort of impromptu storytelling game that creator Miro Haverinen used to play with his uni classmates, where he’d pose them horrific moral choices in a dungeon setting, which became the first game's trap-and-trauma laden environments. As the name implies, you’ll need to keep your party of characters well fed and sane during your travels. It's likely the only game in which you can give both a dog and a child opium to calm them down. The Twitter account 'Can you offer a pipe stuffed with opiates to the dog?' is much more popular in the timeline we deserve, imo.</p>
<p>You’ll fail repeatedly as you play, losing run after run until you slowly start to acclimate yourself to obscure terrors, becoming fluent in the series’ uniquely sadistic grammar, and picking up tricks to eke out just a little more progress. It sound utterly miserable, but I find this kind of exploration incredibly compelling. It’s got very little to do with the <em>points</em> of it all, just the experience, as you slowly form a mental map of these previously inscrutable places, right down to which barrels have the best drugs in them. If you’re looking for something somewhat similar but less intense, though, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/felvidek">Felvidek</a> is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/felvidek-review">singularly stark indie RPG</a> that probably won’t make you want to go for a wash afterward.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-lags-behind-dlss/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-3-1-still-lags-behind-nvidia-dlss-3-7-intel-xess-1-3-in-terms-of-image-quality-despite-improvements.916806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-3-1-lags-behind-dlss/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite some improvements, AMD FSR 3.1 still lags behind other upscalers in terms of image quality, such as NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and Intel XeSS 1.3.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the DF Direct Weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry took a quick look at the new version of AMD's upscaler, highlighting how the update made to upscaling does bring some light improvements in terms of image clarity, but it still looks noticeable worse than NVIDIA DLSS and Intel XeSS latest version, mostly due to these upscalers attempting to do anti-aliasing on moving pixels, which is quite noticeable in the Horizon Forbidden West still upon which their quick comparison is based. At the end of the day, the differences with version 2.2 are minimal, and the upscaler still shows its limitations with moving objects.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #169: Dragon's Dogma 2 Fixed? FSR 3.1 First Look, Dead Rising Remake" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TQIBknDAj4g?start=120&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>These issues that have yet to be improved with AMD FSR 3.1 are also highlighted quite clearly in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmark PC</a>. As such, the most notable change introduced by the new version of the upscaler is the update to the frame generation component, which can now be used with any upscaler or anti-aliasing solution. This is especially good for those with NVIDIA RTX 2000 and 3000 series cards who do not get access to NVIDIA's Frame Generation solution included in DLSS 3.0 onward.</p>

            <p>
After putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo is continuing its fight against the lucrative modded console business with a pair of fresh lawsuits. 
</p>
<p>
James "Archbox" Williams, the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates, a subreddit with nearly 200,000 members, faces paying potentially millions of dollars in fines after being named by Nintendo in a new case filed last week, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701">TorrentFreak</a> reports.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's interest in Williams primarily seems to be as an operator of "several pirate shops" through which he offers "massive libraries of pirated Nintendo Switch games", Nintendo's legal filing alleges. 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Newscast: With the death of Keystone, will Xbox give up its streaming console plans forever?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQg2NCp1bQU?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
But Nintendo also claims Williams has used his position on the SwitchPirates reddit to encourage piracy and offer technical advice, violating DMCA terms and infringing on Nintendo's copyright.
</p>
<p>
"Defendant is well aware that his conduct is unlawful and infringes Nintendo's intellectual property rights," the company states. "Indeed, Defendant has bragged publicly that he is a 'pirate' who '[isn't] going to give Nintendo $50 for a game'."
</p>
<p>
A second, separate lawsuit takes aim at Modded Hardware - a group whose name rather speaks for itself. Run by Ryan "Hombrew Homie" Daly, Nintendo has had the group in its sights for several months. 
</p>
<p>
TorrentFreak reports that Nintendo asked Modded Hardware to stop selling modded hardware, to which Daly agreed earlier this year, but then didn't. Nintendo finally filed suit against Daly last week.
</p>
<p>
The filing notes that Modded Hardware sells mod chips, a memory card which unlocks the ability to play pirated games, mail-in modding services and fully modded consoles. Again, Nintendo could potentially win millions of dollars in fines.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jail-term-for-nintendo-pirate-gary-bowser-was-unique-opportunity-to-set-example-court-documents-reveal">Nintendo lawyers argued Gary Bowser should serve the maximum jail term of five years</a> for his role in Team Xecutor, a piracy group that Nintendo claimed had cost it "greater than $65m" of financial damage. Despite not being one of Team Xecutor's two founders - who are yet to be brought to trial - Bowser was ultimately given a 40-month prison sentence and fined $14.5m.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this year, Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, agreed to pay $2.4m in damages to Nintendo and cease all operations in response to a lawsuit which alleged the group had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-switch-emulator-creator-for-facilitating-piracy-at-a-colossal-scale">enabled piracy "at a colossal scale"</a>.

</header>
  <div>



            <p>A UK employment tribunal has ordered Cloud Imperium Games to pay a former employee £27,748 in compensation following a discrimination claim about its return-to-office policy.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/cloud-imperium-games-discriminated-against-disabled-employee-with-return-to-office-policy">Game Developer</a>, senior programmer Paul Ah-Thion was dismissed in 2022 after his requests to permanently work from home to accommodate his disability were denied.</p>
<p>Ah-Thion previously worked in-office at its former Wilmslow location before Cloud Imperium mandated employees to work from home during the pandemic. In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/cloud-imperium-to-open-manchester-studio">CIG opened its Manchester studio</a> – which is now its UK headquarters – and mandated staff to return to the office.</p>
<p>As found by the tribunal, Ah-Thion reportedly asked to continue working remotely rather than relocate to the Manchester studio, which was denied. He was then let go due to "performance issues related to his remote working setup."</p>
<p>The tribunal found that Cloud Imperium's "concern about the claimant's performance seemed rather retrospective in the sense that whilst the claimant was employed [Cloud Imperium] never formally investigated those concerns" and that it "failed to give any evidence to suggest why they could not monitor it successfully remotely whilst he was working from home."</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that working from home would have failed to achieve the respondent's legitimate aim of ensuring the acceptable performance of a senior gameplay programmer," the judgement further read.</p>
<p>"We find that [Cloud Imperium] has treated the claimant unfavourably because of something arising in consequence of his disability. [It has] been unable to show that dismissal was a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aim."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Cloud Imperium for comment.</p>

            <p>Capcom has announced the next (and long-rumoured) entry in the Resident Evil series is now in development.</p>
<p>The news was shared during Capcom's NEXT broadcast last night, in an oh so casual way. "We're making a new Resident Evil," said Resident Evil 7: Biohazard director Koshi Nakanishi, essentially confirming he will be helming development on the next game.</p>
<p>"It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p>

<p>Nakanishi was unable to share any further details on the next Resident Evil game during the broadcast, but said "I hope you're excited for the day I can".</p>
<p>Along with his work on Resident Evil 7, Nakanishi has previously served as lead designer on Resident Evil 5, as well as being director on both Mercenaries 3D and the first Resident Evil Revelations game.</p>
<p>There has long been speculation and hearsay regarding a Resident Evil 9 reveal of some description, but other than last night's brief tease from Nakanishi, Capcom has been playing its cards close to its chest. Nakanishi didn't even specify he was talking about Resident Evil 9, although it is fair to assume he was.</p>
<p>Other Resident Evil projects said to be in the pipeline include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Elsewhere during last night's broadcast, Capcom gave us our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-spruced-up-zombie-mall-slaughter-arrives-in-september">first proper look at its Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>. This particular game is currently slated to launch digitally across Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release set to follow.</p>

            <p>When Edwin disappeared into the hot mists of Summer Games Fest we couldn't know he would return with a crazed look in his eye, raving about "phantasmagorical mulch" and insisting: "As of this week, I am seriously excited by tower defence." That's because he played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</a>, the upcoming action strategy game about defending a maiden from colourful monsters and recruiting villagers to cleanse demonic defilement. Developer Capcom released a demo for the game yesterday, ahead of its July 19th release date. So now the rest of us can join Edwin in becoming entranced by the swirling colours of this sword-swinger.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBbz12bhyE8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/">available on Steam</a>, and the developers say that if enough people play it (and gather enough of a certain type of collectible) they'll include some themed gear for your characters in the full release, namely costumes based on calligraphic wolf simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/okami">Okami</a>. They announced all this in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p7hiMS0Hct4?si=KT1RJMJQW9_4Al4c&amp;t=930">Capcom Next</a>, the studio's marketing broadcast that also covered some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-a-steam-release-date-also-confirmed-graphics">news about the Dead Rising remaster</a> and a confirmation that they are working on the next Resident Evil. They said nothing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</a>, and their silence on this issue continues to provoke <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">the howling laments of everyone ever</a>. </p>
<p>As for Kunitsu-Gami, it's being priced at £40/$50. "It will take no less than 20 hours just to clear the story," said the game's producer producer Yoshiaki Hirabayashi when <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-prices-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-affordably-but-it-has-the-volume-of-a-full-price-game-devs-say/">Automaton asked</a> how the price reflected the scope of the game. "Then, of course, there will also be missions and challenges to clear after completing the story, so I think the volume of the game is comparable to that of a full priced title.”</p>
<p>20 hours sounds grand. I'm downloading the demo as I type. Edwin described it as "unabashedly ornate" and concluded it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-was-the-best-game-i-played-at-summer-game-fest">the best game he played at Summer Game Fest</a>. That, plus all the sword swishing in the trailers, has me convinced enough to give it a bash. I love the way the katana seems to wound the air itself, creating a gorgeous kaleidoscopic ribbon as it flows through space. The enemy design of the Seethe (the creepy-beautiful demons you'll be fighting) is also quite something. So many hands! </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-reveal-why-some-games-run-better-on-ps5-despite-xbox-series-x-being-more-powerful<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It is widely accepted that Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X</a> console is the most powerful ever made, so why do some games run better on Sony’s PlayStation 5? That’s a question finally answered by the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>.</p><p>Both Microsoft and Sony launched the next-generation of consoles at the same time, November 2020, and while the less powerful Xbox Series S obviously struggles on the performance front, the Xbox Series X is a tech monster; it's capable of 12 teraflops of GPU performance, whereas the PS5 is capable of 10.28 teraflops.</p><p>Xbox executives have said they wanted to avoid repeating the narrative established in the last generation, where the Xbox One was significantly underpowered compared to the PlayStation 4 resulting in a mismatch when it came to multiplatform game performance. And so, Microsoft went hard with the Xbox Series X, ensuring it could safely call it he "world's most powerful console” in marketing. </p><p>But now, as we approach each console’s fourth birthday, has that power difference born fruit in the video games we play? It turns out that some games run better on PS5 than Xbox Series X. But how can that be?</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-if-xbox-series-x-is-more-powerful-how-does-ps5-compete-so-closely" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry’s conversations with developers</a>, “the combination of a more efficient GPU compiler, lower-level APIs, and higher clock speeds allows PS5 to match or even exceed the outputs of Xbox Series X in some scenarios.”</p><p>One example of this at play is FromSoftware’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>, which runs faster on PS5 than on Xbox Series X. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-long-standing-tech-issues-have-been-ignored" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry’s analysis of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC</a> shows a surprising frame-rate difference in favor of PS5, which is apparently the less capable machine.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But, as Digital Foundry notes, there remains value in the approach Microsoft took for Xbox Series X, which has a commonality with PC development that helps game makers. “Additionally, there are situations where the Xbox ecosystem and feature set yields dividends,” Digital Foundry explains. “For example, while Elden Ring may run faster on PS5, Sony's limited implementation of variable refresh rate support means that we'd much rather play the game on Xbox Series X — it's just a smoother and more consistent experience.”</p><p>So, what happens next? Sony is heavily rumored to be ready to release a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">PS5 Pro</a> later this year, with Microsoft heavily rumored to be ready to release an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">Xbox handheld</a>. Digital Foundry expects the PS5 Pro to “lean into the same strengths that made PS5 competitive and go beyond — PSSR machine learning-based upscaling should act as an effective 'multiplier' of sorts on its increased GPU performance.”</p><p>And then? No doubt we’ll have to do this all over again when Microsoft releases its next-gen Xbox and Sony releases the inevitable PS6.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Last week, those teases at Capcom dangled a remastered version of 2006 zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> gem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising</a> before the darting, entranced eyes of me specifically. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a>, presumably named so to differentiate it from the 2016 HD Remaster, now looks to be shambling ever closer to full remake territory if the new footage Capcom shared as part of yesterday’s NEXT showcase is anything to go by. Also, it’s coming to Steam! I’ve checked with the rest of the treehouse, and this means it’s also confirmed for PC. Get in!</p>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBJjy3gf2k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" height="113" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" title="CAPCOM NEXT - Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and Resident Evil 7 - Part 1" width="200"></iframe><span data-type="targeting">

<p>For the video haters among you (moving pictures truly are the devil’s work), here’s a quick comparison between what looks like the 2016 HD version, and the upcoming (19th September 2024) Deluxe version:</p>
<figure data-count="2" role="group">

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/dead-rising-comparison-original.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

 </a>
</figure>

</figure>
<p>Please, please, save your applause. Oh, sure. Some might say my coverage is “giving Digital Foundry a run for their money”. But I do this for you, not for petty accolades.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the showcase, Director Ryosuke Murai sheds a bit more light on what exactly the “Deluxe Remaster” entails. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration, he says, to call it a remake, considering the amount of work that went into it. It’s a 4K/60 FPS job, with control tweaks like letting protag Frank move while aiming. I’m a bit less jazzed about the autosave feature, since the tension of having limited saves was one of the original’s main draws for me, but I’ll hold out to see how it’s implemented. That said, I absolutely welcome promised improvements to hopefully stop the idiot escortable NPCs being idiots quite so often. Do check out the above showcase for more details on the new tech.</p>
<p>If you missed Dead Rising the first time around, our Matt Jarvis does a great job of explaining <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-dead-rising-is-getting-a-deluxe-remaster-ahead-of-its-20th-anniversary">why it was so great</a>. I like it a lot, too. So much, in fact, that I once spent an entire day grinding out one of the most infamously ridiculous Xbox achievements of all time. ‘Zombie Genocider’ had you kill 53,594 - the population of the town the game is set in - zombies in a single playthrough. In reality, this meant I was sat on a sofa with a tenners of shit hash and a homemade Lucozade bottle bong, mowing a car back and forth through zombo-infested underground tunnels, for roughly eight solid hours of my life. </p>
<p>I regret nothing, although I will not be repeating the experience when the new version <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/">releases on Steam</a>. Unless you all make it very clear in the comments that you'd very much read this sort of Gonzo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-monkey-game-on-itch">self-flagellation</a> games writing, in which case Graham might let me do it. Wait. What am I saying? No. Never again.</p>

			<p>The third game to be featured in CAPCOM's NEXT showcase beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 9</a> was Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess.</p>
<p>The action/strategy game based on a new IP is very close to its July 19 debut. The reception from fans has been lukewarm so far, and that's probably why CAPCOM has decided to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842890/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess__Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release a free demo</a> to allow players to try the game before purchasing. The demo of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess lets players check out some of the stages of the main game as many times as they like without a time limit.</p>
<p>CAPCOM has also added some extra spice to the demo with the Okami collaboration. Demo players across the globe are called to complete two missions. Should they succeed, all players would receive costumes based on Amaterasu and Waka from Okami, as well as unlocking a collab soundtrack for the full game.</p>
<p>Using a day/night cycle and creatively mixing several genres from action-adventure to real-time strategy to tower defense, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess aims to test players' strategic and real-time decision-making skills. During the day, they will explore the village, purifying the tainted villagers, assigning them different roles, and choosing where to place them to best protect the maiden Yoshiro. During the night, the sinister Seethe foes emerge to attack the mountain. Upgrade villager roles to gain more support and issue commands to villagers as you fight alongside them to defeat the Seethe and cleanse each village.</p>
<p>Players are free to reset upgrades and reassign them to other roles and can even upgrade protagonist Soh with new attacks and abilities to customize their strategies to achieve their goal of safeguarding Maiden Yoshiro and restoring peace to the villages of Mt. Kafuku.</p>
<p>If you're planning to play on PC, here's the minimum and recommended system requirements:</p>

		<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will launch across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC on 19th September 2024, Capcom has confirmed with a new trailer that dives into all the improvements and changes being made.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIAiUWhxmrs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is closer to a remake than a quick upscaling effort, as the game has been rebuilt within Capcom’s excellent RE Engine. On the latest generation consoles, the game will run with an “up to” 4K resolution and at 60FPS, while also featuring updated character models for Franke West, all the psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie and Madonna, and all those zombies you’ll be bashing about. You can really see the difference in the trailer above, with some dramatically overhauled lighting effects, West having a face that looks like it’s already been in a fight or seventeen, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Capcom also detailed further quality of life improvements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Frank West now has the ability to move while aiming!</li>
<li>Aspiring photojournalists can customize action shots with filters to get the best glam shot of their favorite zombies!</li>
<li>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster now has auto-save functionality! Need a bathroom break? Don’t worry…manual saves are still available when you need a breather.</li>
<li>All NPC and survivor interactions are now fully voiced!</li>
<li>New and improved NPC behaviors!</li>
<li>Real-time lighting and shadow effects!</li>
<li>More intuitive and user-friendly controls!</li>
<li>New fine-tuned user interface!</li>
<li>Fully voice overs for nine languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), and subtitles for fourteen (the aforementioned plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic).</li>
</ul>
<p>Dead Rising was a classic from the early Xbox 360 days, using the then powerful new system to stuff a shopping mall with undead and have you clatter your way through them using all manner of ridiculous items as weapons. It introduced photojournalist Frank West as the protagonist, and gave you just 72 hours in-game to figure out the truth behind the outbreak – this time limit was perhaps the most contentious part of the game, which Capcom dropped for the third and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/02/dead-rising-4-franks-big-package-review/">fourth</a> games in the series. It sounds like it’s back here in full force, though with auto-saves and other tweaks it should be easier to live with.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-is-official-director-it-was-difficult-to-figure-out-what-to-do-after-7-but-i-found-it-and-it-is-substantial/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM NEXT Showcase, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reveal of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster's pricing and key features</a>, the studio also dropped a little bomb about Resident Evil 9. Yes, the next mainline installment in the revered survival horror franchise is officially in development.</p>
<p>The announcement was tied to the showcase of Resident Evil 7, which is out now on Apple's iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and every iPad and Mac with the M1 chip or later. The main game is bundled with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-7-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Not A Hero story DLC</a>, starring franchise veteran Chris Redfield, while the optional Gold Edition upgrade allows fans to get all of the content from the other DLCs, including additional story content and game modes. The package also supports universal purchase and cross-progression, so Apple gamers can play across iPhone, iPad, and Mac and continue their save games at home or on the go. Resident Evil 7 Biohazard runs natively on Apple devices. This version also features newly optimized controls for iPhone and iPad, including an auto-fire option and fully touch-compatible menus.</p>
<p>The reason the announcement of Resident Evil 9 was tied to this Resident Evil 7 showcase is fairly straightforward: the new chapter in CAPCOM's IP is being led by Koshi Nakanishi, who directed the first game in the series to switch from third-person view to first-person view. Nakanishi said:</p>
<p><em>We're making a new Resident Evil. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day that I can.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, speculation will now run rampant as to when exactly CAPCOM will finally show Resident Evil 9. A good option could be the upcoming Tokyo Game Show, scheduled to take place at the usual venue of Makuhari Messe between September 26 and 29. Of course, it's also possible the game will be reserved for later shows, such as The Game Awards.</p>
<p>However, that would clash with rumors from CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem that the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be targeting early 2025</a> for the launch of Resident Evil 9. If that's the case, then TGS seems the only real option. Dusk Golem also previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-monster-hunter-wilds-rumored-to-be-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the game would go open world, just like Monster Hunter Wilds, and he turned out to be right about CAPCOM's other tentpole franchise.</p>
<p>Are you excited about getting a new Resident Evil? Who do you want to see as protagonists?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways.916737/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-is-out-on-september-19-powered-by-re-engine-and-enhanced-in-many-ways/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the CAPCOM Next Showcase, the Japanese studio revealed that Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slated to launch on September 19 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, with pre-orders now open on all platforms.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaser trailer</a>, we immediately noticed the noticeable visual upgrade. Indeed, CAPCOM has now confirmed the game is powered by RE Engine, whereas the original ran on the old MT Framework.</p>
<p>The game is now targeting 4K resolution and 60 FPS frame rate, and much higher quality character models have been made for Frank West, the unhinged Psychopaths, NPCs like Brad, Jessie, Isabela, Madonna, the survivors of the outbreak, and the seemingly endless waves of zombies. In the original game, CAPCOM focused on quantity over quality to pack a large number of zombies in the mall, but with the power of new hardware, they have been able to greatly improve the look of individual zombies, too. Real-time lighting and shadow effects have been introduced as well, which means the locations take a different look depending on the time of day.</p>
<p>The improvements of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster go well beyond the visuals. The user interface (UI) has been refined, the controls have been made more accessible and use-friendly, the NPC behaviors have been expanded, and all NPC and survivor interactions have been fully voiced. Moreover, there's now auto-saving functionality (a popular demand from fans) on top of manual saving.</p>
<p>Combat-wise, the biggest change is that protagonist Frank West can now move while aiming, bringing the feel more in line with modern games. The language support is much bigger, too, as there are full voiceovers in nine different languages (English, Latin American Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Japanese, French, Italian, German, Castilian Spanish, and Russian), plus subtitles for 14 languages (the aforementioned nine plus Korean, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Polish, and Arabic. Lastly, action shots with Frank's camera can now be customized with various filters to get the best possible shots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ed-kfsJnhdU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is priced at $49.99, though there's a Digital Deluxe Edition priced at $59.99 that adds 17 costumes for Frank and 17 BGM tracks playable in the mall. All pre-orders will include the following three costumes and BGMs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costume: Frank West 2006 (Dead Rising); BGM: "Dreams of Yore (Mall Music 2 arranged)"</li>
<li>Costume: Chuck Greene (Dead Rising 2); BGM: "Super Shopper" (Dead Rising 2)</li>
<li>Costume: Willamette Parkview Mall Bee (Dead Rising); BGM: "Happy Flight! (Mall Music 6 arranged)"</li>
</ul>

<p id="7e50o5">This event-exclusive costume doesn’t have much use, but Pikachu’s hat at least is somewhat cute! Notably, this event Pikachu cannot evolve.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Pikachu in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Pikachu is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck keeps <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

<p>Recently, Capcom announced the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a full refresh of the 2006 title that redefined the concept of a zombie apocalypse. Now, the team has confirmed that the game will be released worldwide on September 18 – as well as outlining several key details about the development of the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-next-generation-zombie-slaying">Next Generation Zombie Slaying</h2>



<p>Capcom has suggested that this remaster is more like a full remake, given that it has been built to run in 4K at 60 FPS and has been constructed using the RE Engine. This is the engine that has been used to bring to life games like Resident Evil Village, Monster Hunter Wilds, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and Street Fighter 6.</p>



<p>In creating the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Capcom has amended the original interface and introduced an autosave feature, which means you won’t need to track down a specific location to save your game anymore. Not only that but there is some post-launch content scheduled that’ll bring users and fans of the franchise fresh costumes and music to enjoy as they explore the Willamette Mall, fighting to survive a zombie outbreak.</p>



<p>It wasn’t expected that Capcom would reveal the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster – fans of the franchise have been holding out hope for a new original game for years. It has been almost a decade since Dead Rising 4 was released, and the series is hurting for an update.</p>

<p>During the recent Capcom Next program, it was revealed by Koshi Nakanishi, a director at the firm, that a new Resident Evil game is in development – and it’s ‘substantial’. This news comes following months of discussion, debate, and discourse about the existence of a new Resident Evil title. It’s worth highlighting that this isn’t a remake but an original concept that’s being headed up by the man who directed Resident Evil 7.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kept-you-waiting-huh">Kept You Waiting, Huh?</h2>



<p>Speaking at the end of the Capcom Next: Summer 2024 program, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1807905937216491570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nakanishi addressed the project</a> he’s working on at Capcom:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re making a new&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>. It was really difficult to figure out what to do after Resident Evil 7, but I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can’t share any details just yet, but I hope you’re excited for the day I can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nakanishi is a veteran at Capcom, having worked on the Resident Evil franchise since 2009’s Resident Evil 5 hit the market. Resident Evil 7 is often considered one of the best games in the series, and it marks the point when the franchise pivoted considerably, picking up a first-person perspective and adopting more horror-based themes than ever before. For some, it left behind the core principles of Resident Evil, but as a <strong>game</strong>, it was stellar.</p>



<p>The last original Resident Evil game was Resident Evil Village, released in Q2 of 2021. As a much freer and more open RE title, Village presented players with a larger map to explore – Nakanishi’s comments on the next game being more substantial might point to an even broader environment being introduced in whatever game comes next.</p>

            <p>
Parkitect is an absolute treat, a theme park management sim in the classic Rollercoaster Tycoon mould, but with more than a few fresh ideas of its own. It was a joy on PC, and it's finally console-bound, heading to Xbox and PlayStation this Wednesday, 3rd July.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect is the work of developer Texel Raptor, and originally launched into Steam early access back in 2016. Two years later, it got a wonderfully finessed 1.0 release, and nearly six years on from that, it's been refreshed for consoles, incorporating the likes of an updated UI and a new control scheme built specifically for controllers.
</p>
<p>
And, honestly, Parkitect's an easy recommend if you're a tycoon game fan, expanding on the classic theme park management sim formula (in which you strive to build a park so ceaselessly delightful, your guests can't help but throw cash at you) with some smart modernisation, all while still maintaining that heady whiff of nostalgia.

<p>
Sure, it might not have the gloss of Frontier Development's Planet Coaster (although I'm personally a big fan of Parkitect's adorably low-poly isometric look), but what it lacks in presentational pizzazz, it makes up for in other areas. It's got a rich management core, surprisingly powerful construction tools, a rock-solid campaign mode, and some smart strategic wrinkles - including the need to build and maintain an efficient intra-park delivery infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect's imminent console release, officially titled Parkitect: Deluxe Edition, includes the acclaimed base game - which I slapped with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parkitect-review-the-finest-theme-park-sim-for-years">Recommended badge</a> back in 2018 - alongside its two DLC expansions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theme-park-sim-parkitects-second-paid-expansion-booms-and-blooms-is-out-this-week">Booms &amp; Blooms</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/superb-theme-park-sim-parkitects-taste-of-adventure-dlc-out-next-week">A Taste of Adventure</a>. Those added the likes of fireworks display sequencing, new themed scenery sets, new rides, and more.
</p>
<p>
Parkitect: Deluxe Edition arrives for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 4 this Wednesday, 3rd July. Texel Raptor also recently announced its second game - frog-themed town building and management game Croakwood - which is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2261380/Croakwood/">coming to PC</a> eventually.

            <p>
Following last week's briskest of teases, Capcom has properly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - which is bringing its spruced up zombies-in-a-mall action to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release to follow.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint.
</p>
<p>
It retains the same maximalist approach to zombie hordes and the same anything-goes approach to weaponry, but features upgraded visuals, quality of life improvements, and more. On the graphics front, Capcom's Deluxe Remaster adds enhanced character models and "evolved" mall designs featuring real-time lighting and shadow effects - giving locations a different appearance depending on the time of days. It also supports 4K resolutions at 60fps.

<p>
As far as other improvements go, there are adjustments to make controlling Frank more intuitive - players can now move while aiming, for instance - plus enhanced NPC behaviour, an auto-save feature, and a 'fine tuned' interface. Capcom says its goal with the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is to keep the core "unchanged" but improve on the user experience.
</p>
<p>
And if that's got you salivating at the prospect of chaotic zombie carnage, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available in two digital editions when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 19th September. There's the £39.99 Standard Edition, plus a £49.99 Digital Deluxe edition (yes, Capcom is releasing a Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Deluxe Edition), which includes 17 costumes for Frank and 17 additional mall music tracks.
</p>
<p>
Capcom has also announced a pre-order bonus, with those willing to cough up for the game ahead of release getting the Dead Rising Original Pack, adding three costumes for Frank - Frank West 2006, Dead Rising 2's Chuck Green, and the Willamette Parkview Mall Bee - plus three mall tunes. A Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster physical edition arrives in November.

In early February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-asks-players-if-they-want-sequels-to-okami-dead-rising-mega-man-and-more">Capcom posted a "Super Elections" survey</a> on its website, asking players if they would like a sequel or spin-off to its dormant franchises, such as Dead Rising, Okami, and Dino Crisis. </p><p>Dead Rising was originally released in 2006 and quickly became among the more desirable games available exclusively on the Xbox 360. The franchise ushered in a new franchise for Capcom during the late 2000s and 2010s, including three sequels. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Gameplay Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The most recent entry in the franchise before the announcement of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-4">Dead Rising 4</a>, released in 2016 for Xbox One and PC before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/01/dead-rising-4-announced-for-ps4">a PS4 port</a> titled Frank's Big Package was released a year later.

                <p>Capcom has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered will launch on September 19 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>A faithful remaster of the first game, Dead Rising Deluxe Remastered will cost $50 and boasts a major graphical overhaul made possible using Capcom's proprietary RE Engine. Though its original gameplay mechanics remain intact, the company has confirmed that certain modern features--such as autosaves, revamped controls, and improved UI--have been added to improve the game's quality of life. It's also fully voiced, but it doesn't seem like the original voice actor, TJ Rotolo, will be reprising his role as protagonist Frank West.</p><p>Those who preorder the game will receive various costumes for Frank and some background music. They include Frank's original outfit and the Willamette Parkview Mall bee costume from the 2006 game, as well as the Chuck Greene outfit from Dead Rising 2. There will also be a physical release of the game coming in November.</p><p>The original Dead Rising game was released in 2006 for Xbox 360. It was then remastered for its tenth anniversary in 2016 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The series has been quite successful and spawned three additonal titles: Dead Rising 2 in 2010, Dead Rising 3 in 2013, and Dead Rising 4 in 2016.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-review/1900-6155398/" data-ref-id="1900-6155398">Dead Rising review</a>, we said, "Dead Rising's gory, ridiculous, and entertaining action, coupled with its real-time structure and campy stylistic touches, make it one of the most unique games currently available for the Xbox 360."</p>
