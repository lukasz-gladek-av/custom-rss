<p>First announced in 2010, Stalker 2 was originally scheduled to release in 2012. Unfortunately, due to studio closure, an eventual reformation, a restart of development, and numerous delays, fans have had to wait 15 years for the follow up to Stalker: Call of Pripyat.</p>



<p>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl finally launches on November 20 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Xbox Game Pass. That exclusivity to the Xbox Series consoles is expected to be for at least three months.</p>

There are new characters, new story content, a new minigame, free recruitment opportunities, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not familiar with Goddess of Victory: Nikke, it’s a third-person idle shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for free on iOS, Android, and PC. You lead a squad of android soldiers called Nikke, the last hope for reclaiming the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures who have forced humanity underground.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been going strong, with more than 45 million downloads worldwide in the two years since release. To celebrate that success and give back to fans, Shift Up launched an extensive anniversary event that is ongoing now. The festivities started on October 26 with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vO9vY4nE3A" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a> that included lots of rewards, both in game and out.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-1-1729706806095.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a new story event called Old Tales, which will let players see earlier events through the eyes of Cinderella. She previously was an enemy who players defeated during the first anniversary event Red Ash, but now you’ll get to see things from her perspective and learn more about her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cinderella, Grave, and Rapunzel: Pure Grace will be three new characters added as part of the anniversary celebration. All three are SSR Nikke, the highest rarity of Nikke in the game. There will be lots of free recruitment opportunities that accompany them as well, making this an ideal time for newcomers to dive in.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-2-1729706806096.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you log in during the anniversary event, you can claim up to 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers and a SSR Nikke choice box, which will let you choose between two characters to recruit for free — either Snow White: Innocent Days or the new character Rapunzel: Pure Grace. The Cinderella Pick Up Recruitment event will give you one free recruit every day until November 21, while the Grave Pick Up Recruitment event will also give you a free recruit every day from November 7 to November 28.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-3-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you complete the Old Tales event, you’ll get several rewards: 15 Advanced Recruit Vouchers, 15 Ordinary Recruit Vouchers, and 2 SSR Nikke choice boxes. The rewards for all of these events stack, so if you take part in all of the anniversary events on offer, you can get multiple guaranteed free characters and dozens of free recruitment opportunities. So new players can get a nice jumpstart to begin their journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all. Since its inception, Goddess of Victory: Nikke has routinely added new minigames that spice up gameplay. It added a tower defense minigame during the 1.5 anniversary and a Dave the Diver collab minigame during this year’s summer event. That tradition continues with the second anniversary, which introduces In the Mirror, an action-platforming minigame focused on platform jumping.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-4-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Goddess of Victory: Nikke is also taking the celebration out into the real world. It has partnered with Bushiroad to create a Nikke trading card game that will now be published worldwide for the first time. And in the United States and Canada, it’s collaborating with milk tea brands Xing Fu Tang and The Alley to launch Nikke-branded bubble tea and hold in-store pop-up events.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/23/body-image-5-1729706806096.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">That will include a special drink centered on Cinderella, and select stores will have exclusive rewards and cosplayer events. In Canada, Nikke’s partnership with The Alley will run from October 28 to November 10. Their pop-up event will be in Toronto on November 9 at Scarborough Town Centre.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the U.S., Nikke’s partnership with Xing Fu Tang will run from November 13 to December 15. The pop-up events will be held in New York on November 16 at Korean Town Store, in Houston on November 17 at Bellaire Blvd., and in Los Angeles on November 23 at Alhambra.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/24/bubble-tea-collab-1729792728728.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can download Goddess of Victory: Nikke for free now on , on the App Store, or Google Play.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-breaks-series-steam-player-count-record.1025178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta period has begun, and despite the fact that this isn't even a full game release, it's already broken Steam player records for the franchise as a whole.</p>

<p>A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3065170/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB's stats</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta">open beta</a> shows that the test hit a staggering total of 463,798 players at its peak, and that it's currently sitting pretty at 441,009 players (at time of writing).</p>

<p>By way of comparison,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>, which remains the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">biggest-selling</a>&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to date, managed 334,684 players at its busiest on Steam, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>hit 231,360. Both are very respectable totals, but they don't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' beta test.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=eguERMHa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records-beasts.jpg?itok=uc3NSK0D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>open beta is taking the world by storm right now.</figcaption></figure><p>While it could be contended that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rise&nbsp;</em>are both paid premium products,&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' open beta is also leaving the free demos the series has offered in the past in its dust.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>'s demo, for instance, attracted just 23,991 players at its peak, while the demo for expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak&nbsp;</em>topped out at 27,540. Again, those aren't numbers to be sniffed at, but they do show just how popular&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' open beta is.</p>

<p>The open beta is free, of course, and so many players may be checking it out even if they don't intend to buy the full game. Still, it looks like Capcom will have another bona fide success on its hands when&nbsp;<em>Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">launches in February</a>.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of action RPGs.</p>

<p>Set in the Forbidden Lands, the game will once again see players venturing out into large semi-open world areas to do battle with a series of monsters, including the game's new flagship beast Arkveld, also known as the White Wraith.</p>

<p>The open beta offers a look at the character creator, as well as an open hunt and a portion of the story. Of course, the internet has already <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/monster-hunter-wilds-character-creator-is-being-used-to-make-scarily-accurate-recreations-of-superheroes-actors-and-characters-from-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created some pretty impressive stuff</a> with said character creator.</p>

<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th.

            <p>Some days, I wonder if every word written before a trailer is actually superfluous. It’s a visual medium, after all. What can a description achieve save to clumsily gesture at the true shape of something; a dog-eared tour brochure for a thrilling weekend spelunking in Plato’s cave? I can usually shake this feeling, but gory zombie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/showa-american-story">Showa American Story</a> is my breaking point. There is nothing I can impart about this thing that will not be conveyed better by allowing its new trailer to wash over you like a tide of sheer videogame. Here’s it:</p>

</span>
</figure>
<p>It’s so wonderful, somewhere between RGG and Grasshopper Manufacture, with a little bit of one of my all time favourite films, Tokyo Gore Police, thrown in for good measure. It’s “a brand new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> and an enthusiastic love letter to the 80s' pop culture that features a strong taste of B-Movies,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687540/Showa_American_Story/">Steam</a>. “Follow Choko's journey of truth and revenge across North America as she grows stronger.” It’s from Nekcom, who previously put out the confoundingly named <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/699700/DYING_Reborn/">DYING: Reborn</a> - a gory escape room. Here’s the setup:</p>
<blockquote><p>Showa 66, Japan has bought out most of the United States with its strong economic power. A surge of immigration has firmly planted Japanese culture within the American continent. Two cultures are rapidly amalgamated, although conflicts are inevitable, citizens gradually adapt to a life never imagined as time goes by.</p>
<p>However, a mysterious catastrophic incident changes the world drastically. The social order is long gone. An unknown amount of time passes, a teenage girl mysteriously revives from the dead, only to find a brand new wild post-apocalyptic world with zombies, monsters, and human survivors of different backgrounds and beliefs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as combat, you’ll be travelling around the US in a “big” RV. It’s big! You’ll be able to customise it, as well as “enhance Choko's status and unlock abilities through various enjoyable "Living Activities". Finally, the enjoyable living activities I crave. No release date on this one yet, but you can bet I’ll be shouting loudly about it as soon as we get one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the few early critic previews of the film floating around, we know that anyone even remotely interested in <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, or the theater production in general, will find themselves in for a treat. They’re calling it a “masterpiece” and a “marvel.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Wicked </em>tells the story of Elphaba, known as the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the Good Witch, in their earliest days as college students at Shiz University in the Land of Oz. With her unusual green skin and lack of understanding regarding her unique powers, Elphaba becomes the target of hostilities. However, an unlikely friendship between Elphaba and Glinda forms before the two encounter a crossroads that will alter their destinies and change the landscape of Oz forever.<br></p><p>Over on IMDB, <em>Wicked </em>is slowly dropping in popularity, though it’s still in the top 50 upcoming releases, making it a top choice for the fall season. On Rotten Tomatoes, it’s too early to tell. No official critic or fan reviews are available, leaving the film’s rating unavailable.<br></p><p>From director Jon M Chu (<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and <em>In The Heights</em>) and starring Cynthia Erivo (<em>Bad Times at the El Royale</em>), Ariana Grande (<em>Don’t Look Up</em>), and Jeff Goldblum (<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>), <em>Wicked </em>officially hits theaters on Friday, November 22. It’s a musical fantasy adventure with a runtime of two hours and 40 minutes, making it somewhat challenging for those with young children who can’t sit still in the theater.<br></p><p>Whether you’ll have a kid with you or not, some early previews of <em>Wicked</em> indicate childlike wonder awaits at the theater:<br></p><p>Variety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katcy Stephan</a></span>:<br></p><p>“I was ‘pessimistical’ going in, but...WICKED is a masterpiece. Ariana Grande makes Glinda sparkle: she milks every moment with gusto, humor and hair flips. Jon M. Chu added so much new life to the story that I can see why it needed to be 2 parts! Well worth the 20-year wait.”<br></p><p>Vanity Fair, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/christress/status/1851668671518867629&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/christress/status/1851668671518867629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Murphy</a></span>:<br></p><p>“I have seen the Wicked movie not once not twice but three separate times now and believe me when i say it is a complete and utter slay you will be gagged beyond belief.

Jon M. Chu perfectly captures the magic of the Broadway show while adding in some of his own unique flourishes to the source material. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo completely knock it out of the park as Elphaba and Galinda. Jonathan Bailey is also quite phenomenal in the film. Wicked lives up to the hype and often succeeds it. Oh, and there is one scene that fans of the Broadway show are going to absolutely lose their minds over. Wicked is hands down one of the year’s best films.”<br></p><p>WBAL-TV, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Veneziani</a></span>:<br></p><p>“One of the most perfect musical adaptions to ever exist. 💚💗 #WickedMovie exceeded my expectations.

But it also falls into some of the traps of the Disney live-action remakes that diminishes its power — overlong, noisy, over-designed. Overall I liked it a lot and can’t wait for part 2🧹.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-zombies-split-screen-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Zombies</a> brings the traditional round-based format back, and players have been digging their teeth into Liberty Falls and Terminus, reaching high rounds and discovering the Main Quest for both maps.</p>



<p>Treyarch love to hide little secrets and Easter eggs in Zombies, which have become an integral part of the experience in the mode. Speaking of which, you may have found Loot Keys in both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-liberty-falls-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liberty Falls</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-terminus-music-easter-egg-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terminus</a> and wondered what they are and how to use them.</p>



<p>So, here’s what to do with Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to use Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can use Loot Keys to <strong>open safe deposit boxes in the Liberty Falls Vault and lockers in Terminus Armory</strong>. You can get different rarities of Loot Key. The higher the rarity, the better the loot will be in the respective caches.</p>



<p>If you’re lucky enough, you can earn yourself a free Perk, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapon</a>, or even a Legendary weapon. You can also get Equipment, Scorestreaks, Salvage, and more. You can only open one safe deposit box or locker per Loot Key.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-loot-keys-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Loot Keys in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>You can get Loot Keys in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a> Zombies via r<strong>andom drops from mini-boss enemies</strong> such as Manglers, Abominations, and Amalgams. Once you pick a Loot Key up, you’ll find it in your Personal Items inventory.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-get-liberty-falls-vault-combination-in-black-ops-6-zombies">How to get Liberty Falls Vault combination in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>The Vault is in the Liberty Falls Bank and you’ll need to enter the combination to enter it. You can find the combination by following these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>On the front desk of the Bank, you’ll find a yellow post-it note with a number and three blank spaces. This is the first number for the Vault combination. </li>



<li>You’ll find the second number in Fuller’s Liberty Lanes on the front desk just under the desk lamp to the right of the lanes.</li>



<li>The final number is in Olly’s Comics on the inside of the shelf in the middle counter area where the employee’s dead body can be found.</li>
</ol>



<p>Combine the numbers in the correct order and enter the combination at the Vault to open it and earn some great loot. </p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-use-loot-keys-in-terminus">Where to use Loot Keys in Terminus</h2>



<p><strong>You can use Loot Keys on Terminus in the Armory</strong>, which is located in the same room as Stamin-Up (lower floor of the Control Center). Here, you’ll see a door with some computers near it and a set of windows looking into the Armory. Simply walk to the door, enter the Armory, and use a Loot Key on one of the lockers to earn some loot.</p>



<p>You don’t need to do anything to unlock the Armory door, all you need to do is walk up to it and enter. Don’t worry about Zombies pilling up outside the Armory either, as once you leave a massive blast will eliminate Zombies in the area so you can get out scot-free.</p>

                <p>Hideo Kojima has revealed Death Stranding 2: On The Beach's title screen with a tantalizing teaser, but no one should get too attached to it just yet. Kojima clarified that the title screen is "still very much temporary."</p><p>Right now, the screen features the game's name and a background image of Norman Reedus' character, Sam Porter, and a baby. The title screen has options for "Continue," "New Game," "Load Game," "Options," and "Recap of Death Stranding." That last one might be handy for anyone who needs a refresher on the events of the 2019 game, which had a narrative full of twists, turns, and <a href="https://deathstranding.fandom.com/wiki/Conan_O%27Brien" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Conan O'Brien. </a></p><p>In another update, Kojima shared an image of his work desk featuring a very comfy-looking chair. A second image appears to show multiple Death Stranding 2 save files.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 follows Sam and his companions as they embark on "a new journey to save humanity from extinction." Players will travel through a world full of "otherworldly enemies" and obstacles, while players will also face existential questions throughout the story, according to the game's description.</p><p>As mentioned, Reedus returns in the lead role, while Lea Seydoux comes back to play Fragile. Troy Baker, meanwhile, returns as Higgs. Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna join the sequel in new roles.</p><p>As for when we might see or learn more about Death Stranding 2, that remains to be seen. Kojima revealed Death Stranding 2 at his good friend Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards in December 2022. Some are expecting more information about the sequel to come at the 2024 edition of the show this December.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is set for release on PS5 at some point in 2025. Kojima is also developing an Xbox-exclusive game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, along with an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint.</a></p>

            <p>
After a year on sale, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> is finally close to recouping the money Remedy spent on developing and marketing the game.
</p>
<p>
Remedy's latest <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">financial results</a>, published today, note the critically-acclaimed Alan Wake 2 is still to "generate royalties", but had now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses". 
</p>
<p>
The long-awaited sequel has struggled to sell in big numbers since its launch this time last year. The past month has seen Remedy move on from its development, following the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-dlc-review">second and final expansion The Lake House</a>, and the release of the game's physical deluxe edition.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Eurogamer Let's Play: Alan Wake 2!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGs1FX3V_vE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
More generally, Remedy said its development costs for the past quarter had increased due to higher development fees for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1&amp;2. Royalties decreased, meanwhile, as sales largely consisted of the aging Control and original Alan Wake.
</p>
<p>
In the long-term, Remedy said it was still committed to growing both Control and Alan Wake brands as "a key part of our future", with Control in particular set to be expanded by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">recently-unveiled spin-off FBC: Firebreak</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Remedy's first full multiplayer project is set to launch as a "mid-priced game" in 2025, though will also be offered as part of both Xbox and PC Game Pass, as well as PlayStation Plus. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear what's next for Alan Wake, meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the launch of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion provided what looks to be an intriguing tease for where Control 2's story is headed</a>.

		<p>Some of you may not remember it, but back in 2010, Hydrophobia was a pretty big deal. Not because it was a well lauded and much loved game, but because it wasn’t. In fact, the original release of Hydrophobia was met with so much negativity that the developers Dark Energy Digital reworked it, changed a voice actor, overhauled levels, and added a final boss. This new package was released in 2011 as Hyrdophobia Prophecy. It was supposed to be the start of a trilogy, but the difficulties the game faced saw Dark Energy Digital go out of business, leaving us with just the first part of this story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hydrophobia Prophecy Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RzSF0EV-84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The other reason that Hydrophobia Prophecy was a big story at the time was its water tech, which was the basis of the game’s HydroEngine. This engine allowed water to flow and move just like it does in reality, which really helped the game stand out for at the time. Water is almost ever present throughout Hydrophobia Prophecy, set on the giant city ship The Queen of the World as it comes under attack by the terrorist group the Neo-Malthusians. The world is in an overpopulation crisis, so this group wants to kill off the majority of the human population so the survivors – themselves, of course – can flourish.</p>


<p>Kate Wilson is merely an engineer aboard the ship, but she has to fight back against the Neo-Malthusians in order to save it, the people, and the research being carried out on it. She is joined by Scoot, her manager who is no more than a guiding voice. In the original Hyrdophobia, Scoot had a Scottish accent, but this voice was one of the complaints players of the original release had, so in Prophecy his voice was replaced by a more neutral North American accent. His role is to help guide Kate through the ship, though plenty of waypoints make that easy, as well as to make the occasional quip when Kate kills a Neo-Malthusian.</p>


<p>For a game that’s two generations old, there are still elements of Hydrophobia: Prophecy that feel fresh. The most obvious is how water moves through levels and areas, and the other is the underwater combat. These moments add a proper three dimensional combat situation where you are not just trying to shoot at the enemies on the platforms in front of you and behind you, but also those that are swimming around, below, and above you. These are proper cat and mouse moments, as you may spot an enemy swimming below and manage to get your shots off first, or you may suddenly be under fire from an unexpected angle, requiring you to get Kate’s bearings right to respond in kind.</p>
<p>Kate’s gun has different ammo types, with the basic round being a shock round which is unlimited. This joined by rapid fire, gel, and energy rounds later to give different advantages. However, shock alone is pretty handy throughout the game. Charge a shock round up, and you could take an enemy out in one hit. They can also destroy hazards including loose wires that are sending electricity into the water, making areas impassable. The game is littered with these basic puzzles, though it can also use elements in more novel ways. One such example is collecting floating tanks and putting them into heavy containers to make them float up to unblock passages.</p>

<p>The tragedy of Hydrophobia: Prophecy is that it ends just as it is getting going. The third and final act, just before you face off with the boss, gives Kate the ability to control water. You can tell the development team would have expanded on these further in future releases, as this lets Kate summon a water tower and throw objects through that final boss fight against a giant security bot. Once that fight is over, the story ends, and while a challenge mode lets you use the water powers in some scenarios, it’s simply not enough.</p>
<p>In some ways, Hyrdophobia: Prophecy was ahead of its time. It was one of the earliest tales of a developer reacting to audience feedback to build a better experience, and this resulted in a more competent, if somewhat by the numbers third person shooter. Yet it pushed tech in other ways with the water physics and rendering a still impressive element. It is unfortunate that the trilogy never materialised to continue Kate’s story. Just imagine what things could have been like if the HydroEngine had been refined further and the tech used in more games in the early 2010s.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/reality-redemption-overhaul-mod-is-now-available-for-rdr-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Red Dead Redemption launched on PC on October 29, the author of the Reality Redemption overhaul mod, BadassBaboon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stunning-red-dead-redemption-reality-redemption-visual-overhaul-mod-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> they would soon port it for this version. The mod was originally made for the Xbox 360 version (<a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-xenia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which could run on PC via Xenia</a>) and the Nintendo Switch version of the game. However, the modder encountered an issue running the game on his configuration. In the meantime, other modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-gets-first-texture-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started</a> providing texture mods for specific areas, like grass, particles, and the protagonist himself.</p>
<p>Now, though, BadassBaboon has resolved their issue with launching the game (they had to roll back to an earlier version of Windows 11, for some reason), and Reality Redemption for PC can be downloaded here. It's by far the most comprehensive improvement mod for Rockstar's open world masterpiece. Here's a list of its current features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase memory pools and improve general performance</li>
<li>Improve reflection quality</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for vegetation</li>
<li>Improve draw distance for the map</li>
<li>Improve particles and particle count</li>
<li>Improve debris variation and count</li>
<li>Improve physics for liquids like water</li>
<li>Improve AI behavior</li>
<li>Improve the game camera to behave more like RDR2</li>
<li>Improve the Euphoria physics</li>
<li>Improve random events spawn and spawn rate</li>
<li>Improve materials and their interactivity</li>
<li>Improve culling</li>
<li>Modify the movement animations for smoother transitions</li>
<li>Improve John Marston textures</li>
<li>Improve game world textures such as trails, roads, grounds, and grass</li>
<li>Fix the nighttime broken fog and other time cycle shortcomings</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see in the video below, the improvement is significant, and that's even with only 2K textures. I spoke to BadassBaboon about trying to push textures to 4K and they said they'll try.</p>
<p><iframe title="PC Red Dead Remaster with Reality Redemption - Overhaul Project" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6y410L5K5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond a potential texture upscale to 4K, there are also several Reality Redemption features that have to be finished or implemented, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve secondary character textures and building textures</li>
<li>Improve tree textures and smaller physics-based props</li>
<li>Improve cloud skyhats</li>
<li>Improve vehicle draw distance</li>
<li>Improve the shadow maps and shadow distance</li>
<li>Improve sky lighting and time cycles</li>
<li>Improve weather and cloud variations and improve the overall weather system</li>
<li>Improve cloud shadows</li>
<li>Add an option to disable rainy weather at Thieves Landing</li>
<li>Fix the moonlight ground overbright issue</li>
<li>Improve rain effects</li>
<li>Figure out why R* didn't implement a proper PostFX system in this game</li>
<li>Increase some memory allocations</li>
<li>Update the game's lore with new dialogue and subtitles</li>
<li>Improved weapon and environment sounds</li>
<li>Add new and improved particle and effect textures</li>
</ul>

The studio has released two expansions for Alan Wake 2 this year that have likely helped - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-announced-releasing-tomorrow-sgf-2024">Night Springs</a> and, more recently, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-ii-lake-house-expansion-reveal-trailer-state-of-play-2024">The Lake House</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alan Wake 2 shifting to generating royalties seems inevitable, and will likely be a big deal for Remedy.

Currently, the company's only major sources of ongoing revenue are sales of Control and older Alan Wake games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, it's getting infusions of cash from partner companies for the purpose of developing more games. For instance, Annapurna Pictures <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">recently entered into a partnership</a> with the studio that will fund 50% of the development of Control 2, while Annapurna creates film and TV spin-offs of Control and Alan Wake. Remedy reports that Control 2 development is on track to start full production in 2025, with a number of critical features already implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Remedy's other games in progress, Codename Condor, Remedy's multiplayer Control spin-off, was announced recently as FBC: Firebreak. Remedy reports that Firebreak is still in full production, and focused on iterating on the core loop and implementing UI for player clarity based on playtesting feedback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-drops-steam-deck-support-in-bid-to-tackle-impactful-exploits-and-cheats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Electronic Arts has blocked Steam Deck players from its cooperative shooter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.</p>
<p>Stating that "the openness of the Linux operating systems makes it an attractive one for cheaters and cheat developers", EA has determined that making its game available on the Linux system - such as Apex Legends - is "a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats."</p>
<p>Developer Respawn said it was left with no choice given there is "no reliable way" to differentiate between legitimate Steam Deck players and "a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck".</p>

<p>"We're sharing today that Linux (and Steam Deck using Linux) will no longer be able to access Apex Legends," <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">said</a> community manager, Mako.</p>
<p>"Our dev team wanted to provide a bit more context into this and share some of the decision-making process that happened along the way. As mentioned in our prior <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/anti-cheat-update-082124">anti-cheat dev blog</a>, competitive integrity is a top priority for our team and there are many ways in which we're battling cheaters - this is one to add to the list.</p><p>"In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex. While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Steam storefront for Repawn's free-to-play battle royale, which used to be deemed "playable", now states in no uncertain terms that Steam Deck compatibility is "unsupported". Respawn insists this decision will not impact Apex players on Steam PC.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if any further competitive game makers follow suit.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors earlier this week during the company's quarterly earnings call. Asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends, Wilson said the battle royale is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community", suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-2-not-on-the-cards-right-now-ea-ceo-says">it may be a while yet until we see Apex Legends 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Early on in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, BioWare offers a knowing nod to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, its other beloved role-playing game series, via a cheeky line of dialogue.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to start playing, there's nothing particularly spoilery below - but fair warning if you'd rather encounter the Easter egg for yourself. 
</p>
<p>
You always need someone good at tinkering with tech on your team, it seems - and in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, that's elven engineer Bellara. So, when it comes to sorting out a misfiring Eluvian mirror, she's your girl.

</figure>
<p>
I spotted that chatting to Belara while she's attempting to repair the Eluvian continued to provide several lines of extra dialogue, and ultimately resulted in her offering up a catchphrase made famous by Mass Effect's immortal sidekick Garrus Vakarian. 
</p>
<p>
"Sorry Rook," Belara can be heard to say, "I'm just in the middle of some calibrations."
</p>
<p>
Garrus' insistence he be left alone to focus on his gun calibrations in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-2">Mass Effect 2</a> became something of a meme, as players continually checked in with the character in the hopes of hearing new banter, only to have the same dialogue about needing to do more calibrations pop up over and over. 
</p>
<p>
Other Dragon Age: The Veilguard players have spotted the Easter egg too - here's a quick recording:

</span></p><p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">new Mass Effect game</a> is still very much on the agenda from BioWare, though is likely still several years away. Early work has been ongoing for some time, and this week we heard from project director Michael Gamble on some of the difference between the two franchises - including how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">Mass Effect 5 will deal with the series' established visuals and tone</a>.</p>

			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, packing a lot of fixes and improvements that should improve emulation considerably.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the emulator's <a href="https://shadps4.net/index.php/2024/10/31/shadps4-v0-4-0-just-dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a>, version 0.4.0 features plenty of fixes and improvements that enable proper emulation of select titles, such as Gravity Rush Remastered, which previously only worked with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-exclusive-pc/">workarounds</a>. Among the fixes and improvements are shader recompiler fixes, emulated support for CPUs that don't have SSE4.2a, an auto-update feature, swap chain recreation and window resizing, improved keyboard navigation in the game list, working touchpad support, multiple install folders, improved Vulkan support and more.</p>
<p>While there are a few PlayStation 4 exclusives that the ShadPS4 emulator has made playable on PC, such as the aforementioned Gravity Rush Remastered, most players have been keeping an eye on the best PlayStation 4 emulator currently available to see how well it can run Bloodborne. Thanks to the emulator development team and many modders, the game developed by FromSoftware can be played on PC with a variety of improvements and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-loading-speeds-shad-ps4/">blazing fast load speeds</a>, and players will soon be able to enjoy better visuals thanks to an <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-visuals/">unofficial remaster</a> that is currently in the works which will offer something more beyond the higher resolution and 60FPS gameplay made possible by the emulator.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lucas-pope-surprise-releases-lcd-throwback-game-moida-mansion.1025061/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lucas-pope-moida-mansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary indie<em>&nbsp;</em>developer Lucas Pope has released&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em>, a brand new game inspired by Tiger Electronics handhelds and <em>Game &amp; Watch&nbsp;</em>that you can play right now on PC.</p>

<p>Pope is perhaps best known for the likes of maritime detective game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>&nbsp;</em>and oppressive document-checking simulator&nbsp;<em>Papers, Please</em>, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion</em> has an altogether different tone, as you've probably guessed from the humorously phonetic spelling of "murder" in the title.</p>

<p>On <em>Moida Mansion</em>'s <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Itch.io page</a>, it's presented as a charmingly old-school handheld throwback, with the screen surrounded by character artwork and some properly chunky-looking retro buttons (which you'll need to click to interact with the game).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lucas-pope-moida-mansion-view.jpg?itok=seiY7fJd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lucas-pope-moida-mansion-view.jpg?itok=u65_26lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>is a deliberate homage to the Tiger Electronics devices of yesteryear.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Moida Mansion</em>'s display pays homage to the devices Pope was seemingly inspired by; it's got a monochrome color scheme and the refresh rate is low, leading to an effect that's almost a slideshow-style series of still images rather than a fluid, moving image.</p>

<p>The game is also accompanied by a delightful 80s-style instruction manual; in fact, Pope himself <a href="https://x.com/dukope/status/1852057229438128510" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>was "a good excuse to make a very 80s instruction manual", apologizing to any players "struggling through [his] youth here".</p>

<p>You play as a member of the Adventure Club, an intrepid group of kids who have wandered into the titular mansion in order to find a wayward turtle mascot. Unfortunately, you're not alone in the mansion, and so you must look for your missing friends while also avoiding a "terrible monsta".</p>

<p>You'll need to search through objects to find your friends, and rooms in the mansion often contain secrets or hidden passages as well. Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>"is constantly changing", as Pope says, so each run won't be the same.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lucas-pope-return-of-the-obra-dinn.jpg?itok=WzZY2KZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lucas-pope-return-of-the-obra-dinn.jpg?itok=hBZ0Ixlr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lucas Pope is best known for games like&nbsp;<em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>operates along similar lines to&nbsp;<a href="https://play.date/games/mars-after-midnight/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mars After Midnight</em></a>, a work simulator Pope designed for the retro Playdate console line, as well as the similarly LCD-heavy&nbsp;<em>LCD, Please</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Game &amp; Watch</em>-style take on&nbsp;<em>Papers, Please</em>.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Moida Mansion&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via Itch.io, and you can also find some of Lucas Pope's <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">other work there</a> if you're interested in checking that out.</p>

            <p>Real gamblers play russian roulette with shotguns. That is the core concept of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>-looking game of blinksweat and bulletworry. It's been out for a while now but the developers have just added a fun extra - a 4-person multiplayer mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>They teased this multiplayer mode <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unnerving-2-gem-buckshot-roulette-is-working-on-a-multiplayer-mode-so-you-can-play-shotgun-roulette-with-pals">earlier in the year</a> but just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/4477234095318892693">posted the update on Steam</a> yesterday. The game remains one of uncertain trigger pulling. A handful of shells - some duds, some live - are loaded into a shotgun in a random and unseen order. Players then take turns pointing the gun at one another (or themselves) and committing their lives to lady luck. Click! Phew, this one was a dud. </p>
<p>But look, what's Nipplemancer69 doing? He's slugging a beer, ejecting a shell, clicking on a mysterious gadget, and smoking a cigarette... Wait, wait, don't point that at me, Nipplemancer69! Have you even kept count of the shells correctly!? Stop. STOP.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Oh thank heavens. Between each reloading of the shotgun you get a bunch of items to make use of against your friends, you see. A cell phone with a mysterious voice on the other end, for example, who tells you what the fifth or sixth shell will be. Or a gizmo that lets you steal a device straight out of your opponent's pile. All this on top of the main game's health-regenerating cigarettes and beer cans that let you eject a shell. </p><p>There are other devices I'm far less keen on. These cause players to miss a turn, for instance, or reverse the turn order of the entire table. It's possible as a result to play a whole round without ever even laying hands on the gun. Turn-skipping mechanics in board games annoy me for the same reason. It's frustrating to sit there and helplessly watch an entire game happen around you. And in a chatless internet game setting, it really invites people to quit. I much prefer the more interesting gadgets, like the do-hicky that reverse the "polarity" of the shell in the chamber. </p>
<p>It's best done with pre-existing pals - there's no servers. If you do want to shoot strangers though, you can join the Discord of the game's publisher, Critical Reflex, where lots of people are dumping lobby codes into a "looking for game" channel. It's not perfect as multiplayer goes, but on the plus side it's a supremely cheap game at around £2. So the buy-in is not particularly high. And the core concept - trying to keep track of live rounds and dud rounds while people muddy the waters with gadgetry - remains compelling enough to get a few tense and funny moments, as players miscount and accidentally blow their own heads off. (Yes, I did do this. Leave me alone.)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> has debuted to a peak of 70,414 concurrent players on Steam, setting a new record for a single-player game published by EA.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's long-awaited new Dragon Age installment unlocked last night, and now sits atop the Steam top sellers chart - ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (though notably this is also available via Game Pass).
</p>
<p>
EA's previous record for a Steam launch was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a>, which debuted to a slightly-smaller peak of 67,855 concurrent players back in April 2023.

</figure>
<p>
Comparing The Veilguard's Steam performance with past Dragon Age games is more difficult, however. Inquisition, originally released via EA's own PC storefront in 2014, only arrived on Steam much later. As it stands, though, The Veilguard is the franchise's biggest launch on Steam thus far.
</p>
<p>
The biggest story on Steam right now is likely the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">launch of Monster Hunter Wild's open beta</a>, which has hit a peak of 463,798 concurrent players.
</p>
<p>
Steam user reviews for The Veilguard are currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Mostly Positive</a>, meanwhile.

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is setting out to be an extremely demanding game on PC, as even recent mid-range GPUs struggle to run the game at the most common resolution.</p>
<p>As highlighted by a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, the game's open beta, which is finally live on all platforms, struggles to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on an RTX 4070 GPU at the highest settings, often dipping in the 50s and 40s range on the field. With NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation, things obviously fare much better, as the open beta runs at higher than 60 FPS at both 1440p and 1080p resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds | RTX 4070 4K, 1440p, 1080p DLSS 3.7 Frame Generation | PC Performance" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFgPHa8C6-4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While there's still some time left until release, and things could change in the final release, it's somewhat worrying to see the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta struggle to run at 60 FPS at native 1080p resolution on a mid-range GPU, although that was somewhat expected, given the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-specs-out-now-ssd-required-directstorage-supported-frame-generation-listed-as-recommended/">system requirements</a> and Frame Generation being recommended to hit 60 FPS. Hopefully, the Japanese developer will use the next few months to improve things and make the run better on a wider range of system configurations.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Despite a PlayStation blog earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">suggested Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater would drop in 2024</a>, Konami still hasn't put a definite release date against the highly-anticipated remake.</p>
<p>According to Konami's half-yearly financial results, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is still listed as "TBD", alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, Silent Hill Townfall, and a couple of games only releasing in Japan.</p>

<p>It's not that publisher Konami is simply refraining from detailing the release dates of games coming in 2025, either - other titles on the list such as Yu-Gi-Oh! Early Days Collection have generic "2025" or "Feb 2025" dates appended. It's just Snake Eater and the Silent Hill games that have no hint of a street date at all.</p><p>If you were hoping for a little more information about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>'s financial performance, that too is sadly missing from the <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/meeting/2024/en1031_4xpuc2.pdf">presentation</a>. For now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">all we know is that it sold over a million copies in just three days</a>.</p>
<p>Konami says the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>: Snake Eater maintains what players loved from the original, such as its story, characters, voice acting, gameplay, and music, but now it is "presented in an even more immersive experience".</p>
<p>It's been a year since we had got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-remake-in-engine-footage-receives-mixed-reaction">look at some in-engine footage of Konami's remake</a>. While Snake actor David Hayter gave the trailer his stamp of approval, others said they missed the older style of the original game.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote after some time with the game earlier this year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>This last week has whizzed by, and perhaps some of that was down to the joy I found in the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-showcase-confirms-open-beta-for-next-week/">Monster Hunter Wilds beta</a>. It’s a true sequel to Monster Hunter Worlds, and while I’m very sad to see the Palamutes and Wirebugs of Monster Hunter Rise head off into the sunset, I’m more than happy with what Capcom are serving up! Other than that, there’s been more Metaphor ReFantazio, a heap of Empire of the Ants and a sniff of F1 24.</p>
<p>Checking in with the team, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Diablo IV’s latest expansion, Phasmophobia, Baldur’s Gate 3, and D&amp;D. Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> is very late to the party but he picked up Helldivers 2 the other day and sayd, “OH MY GOOD GRIEF WHAT A GAME! The most fun I’ve had with an online multiplayer in years. Helldivers 2 has shot it’s way straight into GOTY position for me!” So, I think he liked it.</p>

<p>It’s been a bad week for <strong>Aran</strong> as he’s been suffering with illness this week – hope you get better soon mate! <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has continued with his standard dose of Destiny 2 and a little Beat Saber.</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/the-smurfs-dreams-review/">The Smurfs – Dreams</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review/">Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</a> for review, both of which “were enjoyable in very different ways”. He continues, “I have got another highly anticipated horror game on the go for review next week so that’ll be my main focus. Other than that I have been polishing off the last few remaining Steam Next Fest demos and have put together a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/8-games-that-show-the-future-of-horror-is-terribly-exciting/">recommendation list</a>.”</p>


<p>Then we’re onto <strong>Jim</strong>, who’s week has almost exclusively been dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>. He absolutely loved it, saying, “It’s my favourite COD since Black Ops 2 and manages to deliver on all fronts though the acrobatic omnidirectional movement takes some getting used to.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> snuck in a few matches of Black Ops 6 as well, but hasn’t started the campaign yet. Instead, this week he quickly checked out the spooky <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/lego-islands-mystery-of-the-monolith-wraps-up-with-lego-dark-space/">Lego Dark Space level in Fortnite</a>, got to share some thoughts about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/hands-on-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-preview/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and put together a compare ’em up piece for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/30/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

At 24, he relearned how to walk and write after a stroke impacted his brain. When open-heart surgery wasn’t enough to address a rare autoimmune disease, he adopted a paleo diet — and became <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Paleo-Takeout-Restaurant-Favorites-Without/dp/162860087X?tag=theverge02-20">a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling cookbook author</a> and food blogger following his seemingly miraculous recovery. Last year, he retired from a 22-year career as a US Navy translator to become a full-time YouTuber instead.</p><p>Now, he’s wondering if Nintendo will force him to change yet again.</p><p>Crandall runs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, a YouTube channel with half a million subscribers that shows hundreds of ways to play classic games using modern hardware and emulation.<strong> </strong>If there’s a handheld gaming device released in the past four years, odds are Crandall has made a 20-minute video about it. He started the channel as a hobby in 2020 during the covid-19 pandemic but soon realized it could become his day job. </p><p>So, last year, he <a href="https://thedomesticman.com/2023/04/06/i-think-were-done-here/">shut down his food blog</a> — “I was kind of done telling people what to eat,” he says — and left the military with the rank of master chief petty officer.</p><div><figcaption><em>Yes, Retro Game Corps was a master chief, just like in </em>Halo<em>. (I saw his DD-214.)</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Selfie by Russ Crandall</cite></p></div><p>But four years into his YouTube career, on September 28th, Crandall saw how easily his new life as a content creator could disintegrate. Walking back from his studio after pulling an all-nighter, he checked his phone to see if a just-edited video was uploading properly. It was — but another one of his videos vanished before his eyes. Days earlier, he’d published a 14-minute video about how well Nintendo Wii U games can run on Android handhelds, and now it had been wiped from YouTube.</p><p>“This can’t be happening,” he recalls saying out loud. A few minutes later, a YouTube email confirmed it wasn’t a glitch: Nintendo had issued a DMCA takedown notice, YouTube had removed his video, and his entire 500,000-subscriber channel was now at risk of permanent deletion.&nbsp;</p><div><p>“We’ll have to terminate your channel” after one more strike, YouTube warned</p></div><p>It was his second YouTube copyright strike from Nintendo, and Crandall says that’s when it truly sank in. YouTube maintains a strict “three strikes, you’re out” rule, and he realized his family’s livelihood depended on preventing strike number three. “It all sort of came crashing down in that moment,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>In a panic, he rushed back to the studio, canceled his upload, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1frjcaa/hey_everyone_this_is_russ_from_retro_game_corps_i/">publicly declared</a> that Nintendo was targeting him. He would begin self-censoring all his videos to hopefully escape the Japanese company’s wrath. “I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen,” he told his fans and related communities on Reddit, YouTube, and social networks.</p><p>Nintendo was well within its rights to ask for a takedown, of course: Crandall had shown the company’s copyrighted content onscreen. And yet that doesn’t explain the copyright strike at all since countless Twitch streamers, YouTubers, TikTokers, and Instagrammers show Nintendo content every single day. Clearly, Nintendo was using copyright as a pretext to get these videos taken down.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Crandall says he received this YouTube notice on September 28th.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Most institutions have historically taken Nintendo’s legal threats seriously. Countless fan projects, including unofficial remakes and sequels, have been voluntarily terminated by their creators after receiving cease and desist orders from Nintendo. While the technology behind video game emulators is generally considered legal, even the lead developers of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">Nintendo Switch emulators Yuzu</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx folded</a> when Nintendo came knocking on their doors. </p><p>But unlike many of those developers, Crandall isn’t some pseudonymous person who could slink back into the internet’s shadows. Nor is he someone Nintendo can readily accuse of “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">facilitating piracy at a colossal scale</a>,” like Yuzu, for distributing software tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Even among content creators, Crandall doesn’t seem like the kind of person Nintendo usually threatens — he’s known for <em>advocating</em> that people should buy Nintendo products before they use emulators and often shows off physical cartridges in his videos to drive that message home.&nbsp;</p><p>“If I’m playing a Switch game on my Steam Deck, the cartridge will be there or the box will be there to indicate that I have purchased the game,” he says. While he admits he hasn’t done that 100 percent of the time, he’s been careful with Nintendo Switch games in particular. In one of the videos that YouTube removed, he flips through a wallet full of 80 genuine cartridges. He also produces guides on how to create personal backups of your own genuine classic games.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Here’s his wallet of 80 genuine Switch cartridges, from one of the videos that Nintendo asked YouTube to remove.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>That’s why the community was so surprised when Nintendo targeted him, of all YouTubers — and it’s why Crandall might possibly take the unusual step of<em> </em>challenging Nintendo’s takedowns.&nbsp;</p><p>Crandall says he’s been a Nintendo fan for nearly 40 years, ever since his family bought an NES for Christmas in 1985. The copyright strikes hit hard. “This is the first actual interaction I’ve had with Nintendo, and it’s crazy. I feature most of their games not because I’m trying to, like, stick it to them, but just sharing the love of those games,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>But he does have a guess as to why Nintendo targeted him. The first copyright strike landed on his video about <a href="https://migflash.com/">the MIG Dumper and the MIG Flash</a>, a pair of devices that let you turn genuine Nintendo Switch cartridges into digital files and then carry around an entire library of those ROMs in a special microSD-equipped flash cartridge for your console. I’ve watched the video, and while Crandall does explicitly take an anti-piracy stance, it’s easy to imagine these gadgets being used by bad actors, too.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think the first strike was simply due to the fact that they wanted to minimize attention around the MIG Flash cartridge and dumper, and they had an opportunity,” Crandall says. That opportunity was a relatively tiny mistake: unlike, say, fellow YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4A5LR_ipQ4">Taki Udon’s video on the MIG products</a>, Retro Game Corps showed off four seconds of the title screen of <em>Mario</em> to prove the MIG hardware could legitimately dump and run games, potentially infringing Nintendo’s exclusive right to distribute and / or perform its audiovisual intellectual property.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>In one of the videos YouTube removed, Crandall never shows more than the title screen of this Nintendo game.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Isn’t that fair use? Crandall thinks so. It seems like his uses could be brief, limited, and educational enough to satisfy <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107#:~:text=the%20factors%20to%20be%20considered%20shall%20include">the four-factor fair use test</a>, and arguing that could genuinely get him out of YouTube purgatory. I could easily find dozens of similar examples in our journalism here at <em>The Verge</em>. But in order to submit what’s called a “<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2807684?hl=en">copyright counter notification</a>” with YouTube, which argues that he’s been inaccurately targeted and isn’t infringing on someone’s copyright,<strong> </strong>Crandall would have to open himself up to a potential Nintendo lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a dangerous game,” says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HoegLaw">Richard Hoeg</a>, a business attorney who hosts the <em>Virtual Legality</em> podcast. “You really don’t want to get into federal court over something that even if you win, will be an expensive and time-consuming burden.”</p><p>But Crandall knows this — he seems quite read up on both the DMCA and YouTube processes — and yet he’s considered at least trying his luck. Crandall says he’s conflicted; he doesn’t want to “poke the bear.” He has his family to think about. But it’s possible Nintendo could continue to come after him, he admits, even if he lies low.</p><p>While he’s already eliminated Nintendo games from his testing suite for all future videos, he says he simply doesn’t have time to go back through the hundreds of videos he’s created that already contain <em>Mario</em> footage and blur or delete every last scrap. And yet, the way things stand, Nintendo could pick any of those videos to immediately designate his channel for deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies can freely pick and choose who they target with copyright infringement complaints and lawsuits, several legal experts tell me. Unlike with trademarks, they don’t need to actively&nbsp;or consistently defend their works in order to maintain their rights.</p><p>Crandall says that even YouTube initially thought that perhaps Nintendo made a mistake when targeting him. He’s part of the YouTube Partner Program, and his designated partner manager told him to sit tight while YouTube asked Nintendo if it might retract its own takedown requests. But Nintendo wouldn’t, and YouTube has now told him he’s on his own.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>On November 23rd, one of the copyright strikes should simply expire — unless Nintendo makes a move before then.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image via Russ Crandall</cite></p></div><p>As of late October, he’s waffling. He could simply wait two more months until YouTube’s 90-day copyright strikes expire because, as soon as they do, his channel will no longer be in danger of immediate termination. Nintendo’s takedown requests already succeeded in removing those videos, and he can<strong> </strong>hope Nintendo feels it’s made enough of an example out of him to do anything more.&nbsp;</p><p>Or he can submit a document that shows he’s not willing to be that example, not willing to be pushed around by Nintendo — and hope it doesn’t land him in a world of legal hurt.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s painful for Crandall, who has been a lifelong fan of Nintendo’s work. Even after a long day of making videos about games, he likes to relax by playing through a couple of classic <em>Mario</em> or <em>Donkey Kong</em> levels, purely to admire the artistry and design. “Since the second strike I haven’t been doing that much at all, because even just seeing the box art leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth,” he says.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p><p>"Coupled with some of those smart tweaks to streamline the experience and put as much focus as possible on the action, rather than fiddly menus, and there's a good chance this one'll successfully lure in a new audience of hunters."</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in full in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">February next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>This week saw the global launch of Pokemon TCG Pocket for Android and iOS devices, having been available in New Zealand for the last month. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/16duP6ga_Q8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Today, following the global launch on October 30th, sees the first event that players can take part in outside of the standard missions. This event is Wonder Pick Event Part 1, with Chansey and Meowth being the focus. From today, and for the next two weeks, special promo card versions of Chansey and Meowth will appear in Wonder Picks. There is no other way to obtain either of these promo cards, so a lot of this will be on your luck at selecting the correct option when using a Wonder Pick. For those unfamiliar with Wonder Picks, this is an option where you can pick one of five overturned cards to add to your collection. You are limited to how many times you can do this in a day. For this Chansey and Meowth event, there are special Wonder Pick options where instead of five Pokemon cards, you have one of the promo cards with the other four options being accessories such as shop tickets.</p>
<p>Alongside the chance to get either the promo Chansey or Meowth, there are also new additions to the the Pokemon TCG Pocket shop, which are only available for the duration of the Wonder Pick Event Part 1. The three items available are a Meowth backdrop, a Meowth binder cover, and a pink desk frame to use for display boards. There are no new card sleeves, Pokemon flip coins, or playmats. The event items all cost 3 event shop tickets each.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is something of a talisman for gaming on Linux, its popularity and penguin-powered SteamOS having almost singlehandedly dragged it past MacOS as the second-most-used operating system among Steam users. Sadly, this also means the Valve handheld is the primary casualty when developers decide to stop bothering with Linux support, as Respawn Entertainment have decided to do for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a>.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">post</a> on EA’s tech support hub, Respawn’s immediate culling of ApeLeg’s Linux support – which, to be clear, effectively renders it unplayable on SteamOS – is a well-meaning sacrifice to the anti-cheat pantheon. The post explains that Linux is particularly vulnerable to exploitation by hacker types, due to it not allowing anti-cheat measures access to the deep, dark levels of OS kernel space that they typically need to block non-kosher modifications.</p>
<p>"We had to weigh the decision on the number of players who were legitimately playing on Linux/the Steam Deck versus the greater health of the population of players for Apex," it reads. "While the population of Linux users is small, their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games. This ultimately brought us to our decision today."</p>
<p>Yeah. I dunno. While it is technically true that Linux is more protective of its kernel space than Windows (ironically, this is in part to ensure all its drivers remain open source), I’ve been playing Apex Legends since it released nearly six years ago, and I’ve been rolled over by a passing aimbotter... twice? Maybe thrice? I’ve never felt the impression that its legit playerbase is being held at the mercy of a horde of rampaging Linux abusers. As such, it’s hard to agree that effectively banning an entire operating system, taking out the world’s most widely played handheld PC in the process, is a proportionate response.</p><p>For bonus bafflement, Respawn have previously been unusually supportive of the Deck, working with Valve back in 2021 to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">improve SteamOS compatibility with Easy Anti-Cheat</a> and earn Apex a coveted Steam Deck Verified badge. Today, that cheerful green tick is replaced by the grumpy grey of Unsupported status. And that’s saying nothing of the small (but, if they’re still playing a shooter from 2019, loyal) contingent of desktop Linux/SteamOS players who’ve now been locked out as well.</p>
<p>Windows-based handhelds, like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/asus-rog-ally">Asus ROG Ally</a> series and the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zotac-zone-review">Zotac Zone</a>, are unaffected.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
