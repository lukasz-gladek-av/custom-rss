Dareth shiral!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving to monitor game-breaking bugs sounds like players shouldn’t expect any new content. And as Eurogamer points out, "dareth shiral" means "farewell" in Dragon Age's Elvish language.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard was the first new game in the fantasy RPG series in 10 years, but it came and went not with a bang but a whimper. Amid the launch <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5">BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard wouldn’t get any post-launch DLC</a>, shocking fans who had hoped for expansions as previous Dragon Age games had received.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, publisher and owner EA admitted <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-15-million-players-in-first-two-months-ea-expected-3-million">Dragon Age: The Veilguard had failed to meet sales expectations by a whopping 50%</a>; it had expected three million players, but the game managed only 1.5 million.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's been some smoke around Dragon Age: The Veilguard's struggles, such as it receiving a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-cyber-monday-deal-2024">significant discount just a month after launch</a> for Cyber Monday, and the departure of its director, Corinne Busche, from BioWare just last week. We've <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">chronicled some of the game's development challenges already</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-eliminates-50-jobs-to-match-studios-changing-needs">layoffs</a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-4-creative-director-left-bioware">departure</a> of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-to-leave-studio-all-current-projects-planned-to-continue">several project leads</a> at different stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a> now appears to be BioWare’s focus, although it seems far, far away still. And what next for Dragon Age? Given how Dragon Age: The Veilguard went for EA, it seems the publisher will take some convincing to greenlight yet another sequel any time soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-director-yoshi-p-threatens-legal-action-against-stalking-mod<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In early 2025, a Final Fantasy 14 mod sparked "stalking" fears amid <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-14-communities-panic-as-it-turns-out-change-to-blacklisting-meant-to-help-reduce-stalking-also-lets-players-use-mods-to-track-their-alts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports</u></a> it was able to scrape hidden player data, including details like character information, retainer information, any alternate characters linked to a Square Enix account, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The mod, named “Playerscope,” allows users to track specific player data of anyone in the vicinity of the person using it. This information is then sent to a centralized database managed by the mod author (no matter if you are looking at a specific player, or just happen to be around other players), and tracks information that players would usually not be permitted to see via in-game tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, the mod offers information on “Content ID” and “Account ID,” which can be used to track players across characters. This was done by manipulating the Content ID system introduced in the Dawntrail expansion, which in turn let players blacklist others across their service account and multiple characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only way to prevent your account data being scraped by the tool is to join the private Discord channel for Playerscope and opt out. Theoretically, every single Final Fantasy 14 player who is not in the Discord channel is having their data scraped. Obviously this is a significant privacy risk, and the community has been vocal in its response: “the purpose is obvious, to stalk people” one commenter noted <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Shuggler123/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>on Reddit</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Several weeks ago the mod author posted on Discord that the plugin was found on Github, which led to an explosion in popularity. Due to terms of service violations, Playerscope has now <a href="https://github.com/sicakbirtebessum/PlayerScope/tree/master/PlayerScope" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>been removed from Github</u></a>, but it was allegedly mirrored on similar websites Gittea and Gitflic. IGN has verified that a Playerscope repository no longer exists on either alternative platform. Theoretically, the mod could also still be circulating in private communities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/gettyimages-1232398922-1737727396150.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida. Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 14 producer and director Naoki 'Yoshi-P' Yoshida has now issued a statement on <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515102" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Final Fantasy 14’s official forum</u></a> regarding third-party mods, clearly referencing the emergence of Playerscope. The statement reads:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have confirmed that there exist third-party tools that are being used to check Final Fantasy 14 character information that is not displayed during normal game play. The tool is being used to display a segment of an Final Fantasy 14 character's internal account ID, which is then used in an attempt to further correlate information on other characters on the same Final Fantasy 14 service account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Development and Operations teams are aware of the situation and the concerns being raised by the community and are discussing the following options:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Requesting that the tool in question be removed and deleted.</li><li>Pursuing legal action.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Aside from character information that can be checked in-game and on the Lodestone, we have received concerns that personal information registered on a user’s Square Enix account, such as address and payment information, could also be exposed with this tool. Please rest assured that it is not possible to access this information using these third-party tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools. We also ask that players do not share information about third-party tools such as details about their installation methods, or take any other actions to assist in their dissemination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The use of third-party tools is prohibited by the Final Fantasy 14 User Agreement and their usage could threaten the safety of players. We will continue to take a firm stance against their usage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the use of third-party tools is prohibited in Final Fantasy 14, the likes of Advanced Combat Tracker is regularly used by the game's raiding community and cross-referenced using websites like <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>FFlogs</u></a>. Yoshida's legal threat, however, is a significant step up in rhetoric. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The FF14 community responds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Final Fantasy 14 community has responded to Yoshida’s statement in damning fashion. One user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/comment/m8vv5ch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>said</u></a>: “fixing the game to break the mod isn’t on the list of options they’re considering I see.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/comment/m8w9nnq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>: “or you could just see how not to expose the information on [the player’s] client side. Ofc this means extra work which they did not plan for, but is Final Fantasy 14 really on such a tight schedule and budget they can't deal with these things properly?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Kind of a disappointing statement that really fails to acknowledge the root cause of the problem,"  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1i8rn8v/yoship_forum_post_regarding_external_tools_that/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another person said</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The author of Playerscope has yet to respond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Olly Curtis/Future Publishing via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-mortal-kombat-1-community-is-working-together-to-try-to-figure-out-how-to-fight-floyd-but-the-exact-process-remains-a-mystery-for-now<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mortal Kombat 1’s big Conan the Barbarian update launched this week and with it came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-secret-floyd-fight-isnt-just-a-cool-easter-egg-it-unlocks-a-brand-new-stage">the arrival of a secret fight with Floyd</a>, the pink ninja developer Ed Boon had been teasing for years. Not only that, but if you defeat Floyd you unlock cool exclusive rewards, including a coveted new stage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how exactly do you trigger the secret Floyd fight? Players are working together to try to crowdsource the answer. This community effort, led by Mortal Kombat modder and dataminer <a href="https://x.com/thethiny" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thethiny</a>, has done much to unravel the mystery, but the exact process remains unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what fans have worked out: a number of Floyd challenges must be completed before the fight with Floyd triggers. How many, no-one knows. Which challenges must be completed, and in which order? No-one knows that either. Worse, it appears different for each player. That’s not much help, is it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is helping is thethiny’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/htmlview#" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Doc</a> that lists the various challenges players have discovered and the requirements for each. When you’ve completed a challenge the Floyd icon will pop up on the left of the screen and you’ll hear a guitar riff. Requirements include taunting four times in a match, winning without jumping, and winning using sweeps only. Some of these challenges can be completed using any character, some with certain characters only. 37 Floyd clues have been discovered so far. Maybe there are more!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It appears to be the case that you do not have to complete all 37 Floyd challenges to fight Floyd. It also appears to be the case that players have different “active” challenges, so there isn’t a single process fans can rely upon. It's all a bit confusing, but the best advice right now is to do as many of these challenges as you can, and eventually, hopefully, you'll fight Floyd.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Occasionally, Floyd himself will appear at the start of the match to give you a clue (klue?) to one of your active challenges. Thethiny's data suggests it can take hundreds of ladder matches to get one of these clues from Floyd to pop up. Players are working through all this right now, and some are spending a lot of time doing so. Some are trying to increase their chances by restarting matches, but that comes with the risk of missing the Floyd clue because they only appear at the end of the match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is clear is that the Floyd fight has breathed new life into Mortal Kombat 1. The new stage, the field seen in Mortal Kombat 1’s announcement trailer, is gorgeous, so the reward for all this effort is a good one. And Floyd himself is sparking a deeper dive as modders try to work out the details of his moveset and which characters from the Mortal Kombat games have inspired it. It’s just a whole lot of fun to be a part of and watch unfold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc">we’ve got the T-1000 guest character to look forward to</a>, and potentially more DLC to come, although NetherRealm has yet to confirm that. Hopefully whatever happens, the developer will throw in more secret fights over time, perhaps with Mortal Kombat’s iconic Pit stage as a reward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Fans apparently took this to mean the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director was officially chiming in on a longstanding discussion about the game's love triangle between Cloud, Aerith, and Tifa. But now Hamaguchi is saying that isn't the case at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Again, I would like to convey to the fans that the characters’ relationships are portrayed through content," Hamaguchi told Automaton. In other words, it's up to players to decide who to ship with Cloud. Though keep in mind the story hasn't been completed yet, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-takes-another-big-step-forward/1100-6528974/">the final part of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy taking a big step forward</a> recently.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth just launched on PC after previously only being available on PS5 since February 2024. The RPG is also part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6128">a list of rumored Nintendo Switch 2 games on the way</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Over four years after its undeniably rocky launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s recent Steam reviews have reached the coveted "overwhelmingly positive" rating.</p><p dir="ltr">Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow ">Steam's user-review data</a>, 95% of the 12,818 reviews written by users over the past 30 days were positive. (Cyberpunk 2077's overall score--the average of all 716,126 of its reviews--is still sitting at "very positive.")</p><p dir="ltr">When Cyberpunk 2077 launched back in 2020, it was in pretty rough shape. So rough, in fact, that it led to developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077s-rough-launch-led-to-a-massive-structural-overhaul-at-cd-projekt-red/1100-6519510/">CD Projekt Red's near-total restructuring</a>. But the studio was quick to learn from its mistakes, and spent years working to fix the game's broken bits, and improve on its strengths.</p><p dir="ltr">The end result of this effort was the 2.0 update and Phantom Liberty DLC, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-2-0-update-rebuilds-its-gameplay-to-make-a-fantastic-rpg/1100-6517704/">completely restructured gameplay</a> and added a compelling new storyline featuring voice work from Idris Elba. Phantom Liberty was well-received by critics and players alike (GameSpot gave it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/">a rare 10/10</a>), and after years spent working to create--and then fix--the game, CD Projekt Red seemed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-deems-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-a-commercial-success" rel="nofollow ">pleased with the result</a> as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Phantom Liberty released just over a year ago, in September 2023. Given the positive player reception, it's not too surprising that the game's user reviews on Steam have become increasingly positive as well.</p><p dir="ltr">So what's next for the Cyberpunk 2077 franchise? Well, the game's core development team has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-core-team-moving-to-boston-to-start-work-on-sequel/1100-6508035/">moved to Boston to begin work</a> on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-be-more-authentically-america-dev-says/1100-6524584/">"more authentically American" sequel</a>. (Here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/">everything we know about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a>.) Both a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-the-latest-on-cyberpunk-2077-live-action-and-anime-projects/1100-6528068/">live-action Cyberpunk project and a new anime</a> are in the works, though details are currently sparse.</p><p>As for the game itself, CD Projekt Red has indicated that aside from the odd bug-fix, Cyberpunk 2077 won't receive any more updates--so players were caught off-guard when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-what-cyberpunk-2077s-unexpected-2-2-update-is-bringing/2900-6052/">a surprise update launched</a> last month, adding several new features to the game …including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-adds-balatro-crossover-quest/1100-6528375/">Balatro-based quest</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-need-a-ray-tracing-card-at-minimum.1091064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-pc-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After yesterday's Developer Direct deep dive, Bethesda and id Software have announced the&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>PC specs, and it turns out you're going to need quite a beefy machine even to run it at a minimum level.</p>

<p>During yesterday's presentation, we got to see more of&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>' gameplay, and we also got a release date for it: May 15th. Now, on the game's official <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, Bethesda has unveiled the game's PC specs, and even the minimum preset might prompt you to upgrade.</p>

<p>Often, when it comes to PC gaming, you can get away with older graphics cards if you're just looking to run games with fairly modest visuals. Not so with&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, though; it needs you to have a ray tracing-compatible card even for its lowest tier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=H8Yrp4co 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs-gameplay.jpg?itok=XsAivQ6z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>won't let you get away with a potato PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a rundown of the specs you'll need at each tier for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. All of these tiers require Windows 10 or 11, as well as a 512GB or higher NVMe SSD with 100GB available.</p>

<h3>Minimum (1080p, 60fps, Low)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X,&nbsp;Intel Core i7-10700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 Super, AMD Radeon RX 6600, or better</li>
	<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p, 60fps, High)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080, AMD Radeon RX 6800, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K (4K, 60fps, Ultra)</h3>

<ul><li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5700X, Intel Core i7-12700K, or better</li>
	<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080, AMD Radeon RX 7900XT, or better</li>
	<li>32GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>id Software calls&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>its "most ambitious" game to date, and it looks like the recommended PC specs will match that ambition. Better make sure you upgrade your machine in time for the game's launch if it needs it!</p>




<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>launches on May 15th for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>A new report suggests NHL players are increasingly turning to video games and weed edibles during their downtime, as opposed to boozing like players of past generations took part in regularly.</p><p>Twenty-two-year-old Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6078563/2025/01/24/nhl-weed-gummies-video-gaming-alcohol/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that because technology has advanced so much, it's very easy to "live a virtual life instead of a real one." Buffalo Sabres forward Peyton Krebs, 23, said, "We'll all go out for dinner, but then guys will generally go back to their rooms to play video games."</p><p>One anonymous defenseman told the site that playing video games with teammates can help with camaraderie. "You just have to be more open," this person said. "I'll try to drag guys out of their comfort zone, and then I'll play video games with them."</p><p>Beyond video games, NHL players appear to be increasingly turning to weed edibles over booze during downtime. The Athletic spoke with more than three-dozen current NHL players and asked if they took an edible during the season, and 38% "indicated" they did. Hockey players are known to be big boozers, but this trend may be on the decline. Floridan Panthers defenseman Nate Schmidt told the site he was told when he entered the NHL a decade ago, "If you can't play hungover in this league, you don't belong in it."</p><p>That attitude may be changing, especially with younger players. Schmidt said it's unacceptable for players to show up to practice at anything less than 100%. Alcohol-fueled partying during the season is on the decline, it seems, as players look to mellow out instead and take better care of their bodies.</p><p>A veteran NHL forward who asked to remain anonymous said he's sad about the lack of boozing as a means of team-bonding. "When I came into the league, we were going out for beers the night before games," he said. "I think (the NHL) used to be more fun back in the day."</p><p>Cannabis is not banned for NHL players, and it is legal in many cities across North America where NHL teams play.</p><p>As for EA's NHL video game series, the newest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nhl-25/" data-ref-id="5000-640627">NHL 25</a>, was just recently updated with a new 4 Nations Face-Off update themed around the real-world tournament.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-pass-the-2m-mark.1091037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone, further adding to what has been a pretty good year for the Blue Blur and his dark and edgy rival so far.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.sega.co.jp/en/release/250124_2.html?year=2025&amp;category=1&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Sega reveals that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales, which means it's sold another million copies since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million" rel="nofollow">hit the million mark</a> back in October (on the day of its launch, no less).</p>

<p>Once again, Sega puts the sales figure down to&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow</em>'s range of language options, allowing many players from different regions to experience the game, as well as the "large-scale global promotions" the company engaged in to promote its platformer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=y4lV-qkE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m-sonics.jpg?itok=26_PeGLX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well for Sega, surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>The past twelve months, it seems, has been the year not only of Sonic, but of Shadow as well.</p>

<p>Played by Keanu Reeves, Shadow made an appearance in the third&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, which was released late last year and which helped the movie franchise as a whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">cross the $1 billion mark</a> at the box office. A fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">earmarked for March 2027</a>.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>itself, it's the latest 3D platformer in the&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>series...well, sort of. It marries a remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>with a brand new campaign revolving around Shadow, complete with several new levels and boss fights.</p>

<p>It might be better to think of this one as the definitive version of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>rather than as an entirely new game; it's not on the same scale as something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sonic-frontiers" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></a>, but it does have some new stuff to check out, even if you rinsed the original&nbsp;<em>Generations</em>.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9mvlzdh2fh05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

Player choice can influence their interactions, prompting things like a date with different characters depending on how the player, as Cloud, treats  them. The "canon" relationship has long been debated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were therefore shocked when Hamaguchi appeared to have essentially dismissed Aerith as a romantic partner in his comments, though he has now told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/cloud-and-aerith-are-not-like-brother-and-sister-final-fantasy-vii-rebirths-director-speaks-out-about-misinterpretation-of-his-statement/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> this was a misinterpretation and that he, nor anyone at Square Enix, would convey the nature of their characters' relationships beyond the game itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As creators, we will continue to convey [the relationships between our characters] through our content," Hamagucho said. "For example, no one will make any official statements about who Cloud likes, who Aerith likes, and so on."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added that the misunderstanding may have come from subtle differences in language and culture between his native Japanese and the article's publication in English.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as the modern retelling of Final Fantasy 7 hasn't concluded yet. More answers, or more questions, could emerge in the third and final part of the Remake Trilogy, though fans will be waiting a while for them as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027">Square Enix doesn't hope to release it until 2027 at the earliest</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-a-completed-story-at-square-enix">The story has now been wrapped up internally</a> though, and Final Fantasy series producer Yoshinori Kitase previously said he's "sure fans will be satisfied with the final chapter."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">In our 9/10 review of the last game</a>, IGN said: "Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action role playing game full of exciting challenges and an awe inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

    <p><span>The Mikawa Flower Festival returns to Inazuma with new character Yumemizuki Mizuki.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [121 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Moonlight Amidst Dreams,” will launch on February 12, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-940256"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This time, players will knock on the doors of the centuries-old Mikawa Flower Festival once again, sharing this grand occasion with youkai as they explore a variety of gameplay experiences. What’s more, the versatile and capable Yumemizuki Mizuki joins the roster as a playable character. This update also includes a host of optimizations for increased convenience.</p><p>The Mikawa Flower Festival, a symbol of the bond between humans and youkai, returns with more reunions, challenges, and rewards for all to cherish and savor the moment. Raiden Shogun will also attend the gathering, and she seems to be investigating a mysterious nightmare. The fun and exciting games from the “48-hour game development competition” are sure to keep players entertained. For instance, try “A Little Fox’s Daydream,” where players must guide a little fox through its dreamscapes, collecting Fried Tofu and reaching its destination. For those up for a brain-teasing challenge, dive into “Bunshin Phantasm.” In this unique experience, Muji-Muji Daruma will mimic the player’s actions from the previous round. Players need to use the Daruma’s imitated actions to unlock the bridge to the goal within three rounds. The beloved “Akitsu Yuugei” is also back with a twist as the new “Akitsu Harpastum.” In this game, players must dodge a barrage of bullets while returning their harpastum to keep their vitality above zero. Join the games to earn Festival Stamps and exchange them for rewards, including a new 4-star polearm, “Tamayuratei no Ohanashi.”</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_940257"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>The dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse, Yumemizuki Mizuki, will soon join the roster as a 5-star Anemo Catalyst user and showcase her special treatments in her latest Story Quest. Her Dreamdrifter state, activated by her Elemental Skill, is one of her key combat features. While in this state, she deals AoE Anemo DMG and further enhances her team’s Swirl DMG when nearby party members hit opponents with Pyro, Hydro, Cryo, or Electro attacks. Her Elemental Burst summons a Mini Baku that creates Yumemi Style Special Snacks. When party members with less than 70% HP pick up these Snacks, they recover HP. If their HP is above 70%, the Snacks explode instead, dealing AoE Anemo DMG. Additionally, if Mizuki is in the party, using healing food items has a chance to restore an extra 30% HP to all characters.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Yumemizuki Mizuki will debut in the first half of Version 5.4’s Event Wishes with Sigewinne’s rerun, followed by reruns for Furina and Wriothesley in the second half. Mizuki will join the Standard Wish banner after the Version 5.5 update.</p><p>More exciting events are soon to follow in the update’s wake. “Travelers’ Tales: Anthology Chapter” offers players a glimpse into the captivating slice-of-life stories of their favorite characters. Additionally, mini-games, including the film editing challenge “Reel Ad-Venture,” the fishing game with cooperative and competitive modes “Invasive Fish Wrangler,” and the combat event “Realm of Tempered Valor,” will be available in this update.</p><p>To make adventuring and combat easier, this update also introduces several system optimizations. Players can now set Level-Up Plans for their characters in the Training Guide. Once these goals are set, the required materials and their sources will be clearly displayed. The filter systems for both Characters and Weapons have also been streamlined, reducing the steps needed to navigate the interfaces. Lastly, an Auto Add button has been added to the Weapon Refinement interface to speed up the process.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,708 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,620 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

                <p>A regular library typically doesn't have a section devoted to out-of-print video game magazines and promotional materials, but that's a gap that the Video Game History Foundation is looking to fill next week when it opens the doors to its virtual library. The non-profit organization has been steadily collecting video game materials for several years, and its public library will be accessible starting January 30.</p><p>"After years of collecting, cataloging, and digitizing video game history materials, the VGHF is finally opening the virtual doors to its library--wherever you are," the group said in a statement (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-video-game-history-foundation-makes-its-digital-library-available-to-the-public-next-week" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). Some of the materials teased by the organization include high-resolution scans of Final Fantasy 7 artwork and more than 1,500 video game magazines.</p><p>The VGHF added that its library will be home to "never-before-seen game development materials," and with powerful search options teased, it could become an invaluable resource for video game historians to make use of.</p><p>If you're interested in seeing more of the VGHF's work--and supporting its efforts to preserve the past--<a href="https://gamehistory.org/" rel="nofollow ">you can check out its main website for more details</a>. The group has faced a few obstacles in its video game preservation mission, as last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-preservation-efforts-just-got-some-bad-news-from-us-copyright-office/1100-6527411/">its petition to the US Copyright Office</a> to allow libraries to share out-of-print video games in their possession with researchers remotely was denied.</p><p>The VGHF is one of several preservation efforts that have sprung up over the years, with one of the other notable examples being GOG's program to keep classic video games compatible with current and next-gen systems. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-put-together-a-new-team-focused-on-game-preservation/1100-6522463/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-has-set-up-a-new-game-preservation-department/1100-6502798/">PlayStation</a> have also reportedly set up their own preservation programs for their game libraries.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-version-5-4-release-date-revealed-for-february.1091004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-54-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 release date, and the latest update for the gacha RPG is landing next month, bringing the Flower Festival back to Inazuma.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4 lands on February 12th, just in time for Valentine's Day. Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">this month's Version 5.3</a>, this update's main attraction is the return of the Mikawa Flower Festival, which gives you the chance to engage with a variety of exciting minigames and exchange the rewards you get from them for some cool stuff.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to the addition of a brand new five-star character in the form of Yumemizuki Mizuki, a "dedicated clinical psychologist and major shareholder of the Aisa Bathhouse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.4-release-date-yumemizuki-mizuki.jpg?itok=aaVKXSCH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.4-release-date-yumemizuki-mizuki.jpg?itok=EimxpOvU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll get the chance to recruit the five-star character Yumemizuki Mizuki in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4.</figcaption></figure><p>Yumemizuki Mizuki is a five-star Anemo-using catalyst wielder who can enter a Dreamdrifter state, in which she'll deal area-of-effect damage and buff allies using different elements.</p>

<p>She can also create snacks that can either heal party members or explode to deal further damage, depending on how much health your party has left. It sounds like she'll be a pretty valuable addition to your team.</p>

<p>You can expect Yumemizuki Mizuki to debut in the first half of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.4, alongside a rerun of Sigewinne. The second half will bring reruns of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-wriothesley-gameplay-demo" rel="nofollow">Wriothesley</a>, just in case you haven't added them to your roster yet.</p>

<p>As well as the new character and the Flower Festival, Version 5.4 will also bring new slice-of-life vignettes that will revolve around some of your "favorite characters", and of course, you can expect system improvements and gameplay optimizations too.</p>




<p>As always, HoYoverse has released some new codes that will net you some nifty free stuff for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as well, and here they are.</p>

<ul><li>GISpecialProgram54 - 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>

                <p>Circana has shared new video game data that shows how challenging 2024 was for video game hardware. Total spending on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch devices in the US declined a gargantuan 25%, dropping to $4.9 billion (down from $6.45 billion in 2023).</p><p>For December 2024 specifically, spending on new video game hardware fell 29%, declining to $1.1 billion. PS5 hardware sales in December 2024 dropped by 18%, with Xbox Series X|S and Switch sales each declining a more precipitous 38%.</p><p>A major drop in spending on video game hardware is expected, of course, given PS5 and Xbox Series X|S being past their prime selling peaks and the Switch's maturity in the market, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggacbcepk2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Circana's Mat Piscatella said</a>. That said, Piscatella commented that the decline was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgh33abqkc2x" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bigger than he expected.</a></p><p>PS5 was December 2024's best-selling console platform in terms of units sales and dollars, with Switch coming in second place. For 2024 overall, PS5 led the way in unit and dollar sales, followed by Xbox Series X|S for dollar sales and Switch coming in at No. 2 for unit sales.</p><p>Also of note is that 49% of all PS5 consoles and 43% of Xbox Series X|S devices sold in December 2024 did not have a disc drive. For 2024 overall, all-digital consoles made up 45% of PS5 units sold and 44% of all Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lggkcxfw3c2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Something else to know</a> is that, while the PS5 is pacing 7% ahead of the PS4 in terms of unit sales after its first 50 months on the market, Xbox Series X|S sales are down 18% compared to Xbox One.</p><p>Another key statistic was that PS5 is now the No. 3 best-selling console in US history of all time based on dollar sales, only behind Nintendo Switch and Xbox 360. PS5 is now the No. 11 best-selling console in US video game history based on unit sales.</p><p>Nintendo is launching the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025, and that should help improve hardware spending this year.

            <p>
BioWare appears to have bid farewell to any further updates for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, following the launch this week of the game's Patch 5.
</p>
<p>
Patch <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-5-release-notes">notes</a> for the update thank fans for playing Dragon Age: The Veilguard over the past few months while some small additional quality of life features have been implemented. 
</p>
<p>
BioWare goes on to state that it is now happy the game is in a "stable place" and will move to monitoring for any reports of game-breaking bugs, should these occur.
</p>
<p>
The patch notes finish with "Dareth shiral!" - meaning '<em>farewell</em>', or '<em>safe journey</em>' in the game's Elvish language. It really sounds like this is it.

<p>
Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-ea-sports-fc-25-and-dragon-age-the-veilguard-underperformed-as-it-lowers-financial-forecast">EA said Dragon Age: The Veilguard had missed the publisher's own internal targets</a>, after it "engaged" 1.5 million players between October 2024 and the end of the year, "down nearly 50 percent from the company's expectations".
</p>
<p>Last week, Eurogamer published the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware">first statement from Dragon Age: The Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</a>, discussing her exit from the studio.</p>
<p>
While large updates to Dragon Age: The Veilguard were not expected and BioWare had already ruled out the prospect of DLC, fans have still reacted in surprise at the sudden end to any further small additions.
</p>
<p>
There had been some hope of a New Game Plus mode being added, for example, as well as further cosmetic options for character clothing designs.
</p>
<p>
Instead, Patch 5 contains a number of small bug fixes, and one final quality of life change: "Recommended levels have been added to side quests that players may receive at significantly lower levels."
</p>
<p>
Dareth shiral, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. On the upside, here's hoping this helps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-isnt-ready-to-suddenly-have-a-team-of-250-300-people-working-on-it-now-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-done">BioWare get work spun up more quickly on Mass Effect 5</a>.

			<p>Sometimes a game just meshes so well with you that you feel as though the developers reached into your head just to get the idea for it. The first Heroes of Hammerwatch was one of those for me, and not just me either, but a group of my friends. The lovely graphical style, the music, the exceptional gameplay loop, the meta-progression, and perhaps most importantly the ability to play with as many players as you wanted, are still sublime. Well, Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is now out, and it’s basically all of that again, but with a new take on some classes, some new skills and systems here and there, and more awesome bosses to get beaten by.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enzo Margaglio - Heroes of Hammerwatch II Trailer Music Full Version" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qIt-Rch26Ds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 is a roguelite action RPG, think original Diablo with more dying, that has you trying to fight off an evil cult. To do this, you have to venture out of the town you save and fight a bunch of stuff. You’re going to die a lot, but that’s very much the point. The overarching progression in Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 comes in a lot of forms.</p>


<p>Building up your town is a surefire way to unlock new upgrades for characters, new buffs to choose at the beginning of your run, and even ways to alter the dungeons you’ll be delving into. You can then keep levelling your character up to get new skills, upgrade their stats, and find equipment as well. Equipment is permanent, but in each run, you’ll also find trinkets to serve as passive boosts during just that run. So, you’ll always be more powerful by the end of a run, but whether that’s powerful enough to beat the game depends on how you started things.</p>


<p>Along with all of that, you unlock in-game achievements as you play the game that grant stat boosts, or extra points to spend on skills, and so on. Each class also grants a special buff that gets better the higher the level is, which means you’re encouraged to play every class, and each time you make a new character, they feel a lot stronger. It just all ties together really well, and makes for an incredibly engaging gameplay loop.</p>
<p>The seven character classes all feel varied too, with each one having its own skills and strengths, along with the skills that different weapons can give them, and then each of those has three subclasses too. You can respec basically all of this whenever you want too, which means that if you get a piece of gear you think could carry an entire build, you can switch it up and try it out.</p>

<p>When you add the ability to play with friends or strangers, and the ability to create lobbies as large as you want, you’ve got a game that just wants to be played, and will always reward you for doing so. Sometimes, you’ll pick your buffs to make sure you can gather resources to buff your town, sometimes to buff your character, and sometimes, you’ll choose violence.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Even when you do eventually beat the game, you're then thrown into a new game plus cycle that means you can just keep playing and making your character stronger and stronger. It's such a blast to play. In fact, it's so good that I've been meaning to write this review for about a week now, but every time I think about Heroes of Hammerwatch 2 I seem to end up playing it instead. Speaking of which...	</p></div>

            <p>If you turn 33 years old in the next couple of months then, sorry, you are dead. I don't make the rules, that's just how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> explains the lack of elders in its very French yet very <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> world. The fantasy game will see you journey across a dangerous landscape to stop the mad "paintress" who's magically culling humanity at younger and younger ages every year. We've been keeping a weary middle-aged eye on its development, and yesterday it got a release date. It's too late for most of us in the RPS treehouse. But watch the trailer for yourself, maybe you'll make it. </p>

<p>It's coming out on April 24th. Anybody squeak through in time? Good. You'll be able to enjoy the Persona-style turn-based combat, and probably have sprightly enough reflexes to hit the quicktime prompts at various points mid-battle (although the QTEs "aren't forced on you", we've been told - so maybe you can simply turn them off). This newest trailer, shared during last night's Xbox Developer Direct, also shows off some of the ways you can traverse the world, at one point using a big beetle-like friend to swim and fly over long distances. We've already seen the combat in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55rUagD9sVQ">a previous trailer</a>.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur definitely has an interesting hook. The idea is that every year a big mortal countdown gets shorter, and a bunch of people over a certain age instantly dissolve into the air. Human lifespans are being mystically contracted, the various stages of life compressed into a smaller and smaller box while the remnants of humanity struggle on in the ruins of late-nineteenth century France. All the while the world seems full of weird critters painted into existence by a distant madwoman. Previously, developers Sandfall Interactive have revealed that Andy Serkis of Gollum fame is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/4529024222446556926">among the English voice cast</a>. Although my bet is that his is a small part.</p><p>As for the title. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is certainly a bunch of words in some order with a number attached. The eyes pass over it like a faded road sign. It might say something important under all the grime and vowels. But it might also just be a picture of a windsock. Let us be generous and say the baroque title is just another example of the game following in the footsteps of JRPGs, right down to the often impenetrable naming conventions. Laxadolia: Menacing Shards X. Sephical Lights: Code Wonder. QsY XIV: Last Awakenons. Yes, sir, these are unique Google terms. </p>
<p>Edwin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/noughties-style-jrpg-clair-obscur-wants-to-recapture-the-glories-of-lost-odyssey-with-a-touch-of-devil-may-cry">peered at a preview demo</a> of the game with a curious raised eyebrow, drawing parallels not only to Persona games but the old Xbox 360 games of the mid-2000s, such as Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, not to mention similarly alt-history JRPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valkyria-chronicles">Valkyria Chronicles</a>. Edwin is dead now, though, lost some Expeditions ago. I too was lost in Expedition 36, making my thumbs too dusty and incapable of saving this particular fantasy world. But maybe, come April, some of you will make it through. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Later in episode, we find out that Innie Mark’s forcible demand for the return of his team in the Season 2 premiere prompted The Board to give him exactly what he wants. This is the same Board that doesn’t respect a single employee enough to show their faces or speak directly to them, yet now they’re willing to let a disgruntled employee force them to change one of their decisions. </p><p>Once we discover Mark’s seeming irreplaceability, certain details of the show go from overlooked fodder to clues. Cobel living across the street from Outie Mark and forcing herself into his life was likely done to make sure he stayed on task. Outie Mark being the only one on the Severed Floor to have someone close to him—his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman)—work for Lumon appears to be some form of emotional manipulation, especially since he specified her death and his inability to shake her memory as reasons for him getting severed. He’s the only one of the four Innies that broke the rules in the Season 1 finale to not only not be fired, but get offered a 20 percent pay increase to return.</p><figure id="" data-id="63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-recommend-id="image://63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-recommend-id="image://63b0233803cc19b5dedfed8fcab1d53e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gemma on the Cold Harbor file" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This also gives us a clue into what these people are actually doing for work. At the end of last week’s premiere episode, we see Mark is 68 percent finished with a project called “Cold Harbor” that has Gemma’s face plastered on it. If Lumon has no problem firing and replacing his team at a moment’s notice, it’s safe to assume that whatever they’re working on can be done by anyone. For some inexplicable reason, only Mark can finish his project, which implies there is some sort of connection the workers have to the numbers they’re sorting on the screen. We already know the workers sort the numbers based on an ineffable emotional reaction they have to what the screens show them. Mark being the only one who can finish a project that appears connected to his supposedly dead wife means the project has some inextricable connection to Mark as a person.</p><p>What that connection is, and how Mark became such an important figure to a company that’s been around for over 150 years, is still unknown. Now, figuring out why Mark S is so important is the central mystery we all must uncover, because it likely will unravel the entire tapestry of confusion that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-podcast-news-1851734616"><em>Severance</em></a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in 2023, the Video Game History Foundation announced it was curating a digital library, which would allow users to access its vast collection of magazines, art books and more from the comfort of their homes. And while it didn't pop a date on when it would be available to the public at that time, it now has.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gamehistoryorg.bsky.social/post/3lggnduk3p227">Writing on social media</a>, the Video Game History Foundation revealed its digital library will be launching next week, on 30th January.</p>
<p>"Good things come to those who wait," the team wrote, promising it would share further details on what to expect closer to the time.</p>

<p>When the digital library was first announced a year and a bit ago, library director Phil Salvador said one of the questions the team at the Video Game History Foundation was asked was how people "can access our collections of rare video game history research materials", but without having to make a trip in person.</p>
<p>This digital library - which in 2023 had already been in the works for two years - was the solution. You can check out a little video about the library above.</p>
<p>The Video Game History Foundation was initially set up back in 2017, by game preservationist and historian Frank Cifaldi. Writing on BlueSky, Cifaldi shared a more recent teaser for the team's "work-in-progress" digital library, adding it will be "such a great resource" for users.</p>
<p>"I just asked it to show me every video game magazine in our collection in chronological order that says Metroidvania," Cifaldi posted.</p>

In the Rockstar Games open-world title, the biggest change is in vegetation quality, as the new model significantly decreases the shimmering in vegetation over the previous version of the upscaler using the CNN model. Hair rendering is also improved with better stability and less aliasing. In GSC World's game, on the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS 4 using the Transformer model improves image stability considerably and reduces vegetation shimmering like in Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>

<p>The new Transformer model isn't the only new thing NVIDIA DLSS 4 brings to the table. Multi Frame Generation, which will be exclusive to RTX 50 series cards, will deliver an up to 8x performance boost versus DLSS 3, making it possible to enjoy games with full path tracing at high framerates and resolutions. Cyberpunk 2077, for example, can run with Overdrive Mode path tracing at above 120 FPS at 4K resolution on an <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">RTX 5080</a>, which is extremely impressive, considering how taxing path tracing is in pretty much every game that supports it.</p>
<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 will make its official debut next week, on January 30th, when it will become possible to use a new Override feature to update to the latest version of the upscaler with any game that already supports previous versions.</p>

How many times can video games riff on that one Dr Who episode with the weeping statues? At least once more. Surgeon Simulator devs Bossa have just announced Don't Get Got, in which you and up to seven of your so-called friends are trapped in a large school with randomised objectives and safe rooms. Also in the school: a bunch of horrifying little boys in shorts and braces.
</p>
<p>
It's out in early access today. Yes, they've sprung this one on us like a ghastly Jack-in-the-box. Steady your nerves and watch the trailer.

Going by the video, the little boys only move when you're not looking at them, or can't see them. You probably don't need a PhD in Who to know what kind of play strategy this adds up to: keep that torch topped up with batteries, travel as a pack while looking in different directions, and try not to turn your back on any empty space. 
</p><p>
The trouble is that some of the objectives seemingly require you to take your eyes off the environment - operating a music box while staying perfectly still, for example, or using a scanner. The other trouble is that you have a sanity bar - not sure what the effects of running low are, but I doubt they are helpful. The other other trouble is that some of your friends are bastards. I mean, the game encourages them to be bastards. I'm not calling your friends bastards, with the exception of, you know, <em>her</em>. "Use the environment and collaborate with other players until they no longer serve your needs," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467390/DONT_GET_GOT/">Steam page</a> summarises.
</p>
<p>
Don't Get Got began life as a gamejam project, and will be in early access for around a year. The current build includes one map, game mode, character and enemy type. The 1.0 release "will definitely have more content in terms of maps, characters, enemy types, items and so on". They're also "intending to use this period to test some radically different ideas, which means there may be experimental features that we try in EA but decide not to ship in the final version."
</p>
<p>
While impressively ghoulish in itself, Don't Get Got does feel a little like yet another claimant to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>'s throne that doesn't have a fraction of that game's cosmic grotesqueness. The title is also a bit How Do You Do, Fellow <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kids">Kids</a>, not that I'm in a position to judge.
</p>
<p>
Still, I'm a fan of Dr Who's Weeping Angels - it's one of two episodes of modern Who I've ever watched, the other being the one with the library where the shadows eat people. I also quite like Bossa, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/surgeon-simulator-and-lost-skies-devs-bossa-studios-lay-off-a-third-of-staff-due-to-perfect-storm-of-events">who've been through rough times recently</a>. So I may yet find time for a trip to the schoolhouse.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dooms-combat-evolves-alongside-modern-metal-music<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom has always had a close relationship with metal music. Hearing one quick burst of any Doom soundtrack, or even just catching a quick glance at the series’ persistent demonic imagery, will tell you this. Its customary pile-up of flames, skulls, and devilish creatures is not far from what you’d see adorning any Iron Maiden stage, past or present. This relationship with the heavier side of music has progressed in step with the series’ gameplay, with both elements having reinvented themselves several times over the 30-plus-year journey of Doom. From its thrash beginnings, Doom has explored multiple metal sub-genres across the decades, progressing all the way to the present day with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> and its crunching metalcore hammer blows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 1993, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-1993">original Doom’s</a> driving soundtrack was influenced by the big metal bands of the late 80s and early 90s. Co-creator John Romero has freely discussed how the likes of Pantera and Alice in Chains were major influences, and this can be heard clearly across the score. “Untitled”, for instance, the track used for the E3M1: Hell Keep level, features a riff that’s nearly identical to that heard in Pantera’s “Mouth of War."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Doom: The Dark Ages - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The wider Doom score borrows aspects of the thrash subgenre, recreating in digital form the likes of Metallica and Anthrax. This thudding sound propelled players through Mars’ narrow corridors, quickly getting them from a-to-b while sprinkling in demonic enemies just like Kirk Hammett would a guitar solo into any song possible. Thrash was fast, to the point, and hit between the ears with its urgency, much like Romero’s creation did with its shotgun and BFG when it burst onto the scene. Composer Bobby Prince’s soundtrack remains as timeless as the shooter it soundtracks, perfectly matching the rhythm of its unforgettable gunplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For over a decade, Doom and its music continued in a similar vein, harmonising the rate of its bullets with the speed of its shredding score. That was until 2004, when the experimental <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-3">Doom 3</a> emerged from the darkness. This survival horror-inspired reinvention took risks, and not all of them were successful. A controversial flashlight mechanic that prevented you from shooting a gun while holding it was considered antithetical to Doom, and eventually removed by modders and a 2012 re-release, but no one could deny that Doom 3 <em>was </em>trying new things. A slower, more deliberate pace required a new sound, and so id Software sought out new inspiration.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom 3’s main theme could practically be a bonus track on Tool's 2001 masterpiece, Lateralus.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Trent Reznor’s talents were reportedly sought out to orchestrate the entire sound design of Doom 3, but that plan never quite came to fruition, as explained to IGN by former Nine Inch Nails bandmate Chris Vrenna: “Well, way, way, way back when I was with 'Nails, you know, we worked on Quake. I know that Trent was involved with the project early on and then wasn't involved with it anymore”. In fact, it was to be Vrenna himself who would instead take over the reins with Clint Walsh to compose the threequel’s theme. Their approach mirrors “the thinking man’s” metal outfit, Tool. Doom 3’s main theme could practically be a bonus track on their 2001 masterpiece, Lateralus, its own snaking time signatures and off-kilter soundscape providing the perfect accompaniment to the horror shooter’s sci-fi facility. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Doom 3 was a huge success for id Software and the best-selling game the studio had made so far, its survival horror-ish design is today considered something of an anomaly among its series peers. But that’s unsurprising; the early 2000s was a time when FPS games were going through an evolution, with Call of Duty and Halo arriving on the scene to usher in the era of the console shooter. It was only natural for Doom to morph and change alongside those titans. It was a similarly awkward time for metal music; for every stellar Slipknot and Deftones outing, the remains of the nu-metal blowup were haphazardly working things out. Artists like Limp Bizkit or Mudvayne would certainly have been <em>interesting</em> influences for Tweaker (Vrenna and Walsh’s band) to pick up on, to say the least, but their final Tool-ish direction was undoubtedly the right move. Doom 3 won’t go down as the classic artifact that Tool’s Lateralus has, but it certainly served as a worthy experiment with an unsettling soundtrack that fits its tone perfectly.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following Doom 3, years passed with no sign of a new entry. Behind the scenes, the series went through an awkward period of development hell. After scrapping the Call of Duty-influenced Doom 4 project and starting afresh, id Software realised that its hallowed shooter needed a complete facelift, and that’s exactly what it got when it returned to stunning form in 2016. Directors Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin helmed the Slayer’s return to Mars, which fully embraced the momentum kickstarted back in ‘93. Shotguns clicked to the rhythm of the score’s chainsaw guitars, and bullets rattled from chainguns as quickly as the double bass pedal slammed down. Composer Mick Gordon layered sub-bass frequencies with white noise to create a quite literally heart-shaking soundtrack that even Meshuggah may have called a little bass-heavy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Presenting itself as a playable djent (a progressive and rhythmically chugging metal subgenre) album that bounds along at irrepressible speed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom">Doom 2016</a> incorporated the desire for new extremes in both the shooter and metal worlds. It’s become one of the most celebrated video game scores, perhaps even eclipsing the original itself, so much so that it’s impossible to imagine playing Doom 2016 without it. The question is, once you’ve written something that sounds as good as BFG Division, where do you go from there?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Doom 2016 incorporated the desire for new extremes in both the shooter and metal worlds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, that’s where things got a little complicated. Gordon returned to compose the music for 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-eternal">Doom Eternal</a>, but a series of messy back-and-forths with id Software resulted in a soundtrack that’s not all his. It’s unclear exactly what happened, with contradicting stories disagreeing on just how many of his mixes made the final cut. His fingerprints are clearly all over it, though, as the tracks feel like evolved versions of those that came four years previously with an even more modern edge. Eternal’s soundtrack leans further into metalcore, <em>the </em>prevailing metal genre of the late 2010s and early 2020s. It’s likely no coincidence that, around the time of Doom Eternal’s release, Gordon was also producing songs and albums for the genre’s big British names, Bring Me the Horizon and Architects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gordon’s production can certainly be heard in those bands’ mixes, especially in BMTH’s Post Human: Survival Horror (an album incidentally laden with video game references). But the sound of these bands has also found its way into Eternal’s score, especially its propensity for even more crushing breakdowns and added electronic splashes. It’s still undoubtedly heavy, but feels a little lighter when compared to its predecessor, something that is reflected in Eternal’s gameplay with its platforming and puzzle sections that sprinkle more experimental game design in between the punishing gunfights.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Doom 2016 is still my favourite Doom game. I appreciate the hell out of Eternal, but much like the metalcore bands that influenced its soundtrack, I prefer the rawer, less refined work they produced a few years previously. Architects’ album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us, also from 2016, happens to be my favourite metal album of all time. It’s a crushing piece of work both sonically and lyrically, hitting a sweet spot much like Doom did in the same year with its landmark reinvention. Eternal, much like Architects’ more recent outings, is extremely good, and can never be faulted for taking risks, but just doesn’t hit me in quite the same way. Sometimes less is more, but I know many who hold Eternal in higher regard who would happily disagree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Doom: The Dark Ages finds itself in an intriguing spot. In the recent Xbox Developer Direct, we got a good look at how its refreshed combat changes things up in a fairly big way for the series. So, if history is anything to go by, it will need an appropriate soundtrack to sit alongside that brutality. We may have only heard snippets up until this point, but it appears that new composers Finishing Move (Borderlands 3 and The Callisto Protocol) are taking inspiration from metal both past and present, much like how The Dark Ages’ gameplay references the original Doom with new twists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Ages plays at a slower pace than Eternal’s whiplash vertical platforming and arena slingshotting, instead arming you with a Captain America-like shield that encourages you to square up and barrel into enemies of all sizes. This face-first nature reflects the original Doom’s design which shuttled you through corridors and into gangs of enemies, but The Dark Ages take this philosophy and expands it a hundred-fold, arming you with 30-story high mechs and fire-breathing dragons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Such combat requires a malleable soundtrack; something that can feel as heavy, if not heavier, than anything that has come before, but also light on its feet when you’re swooping around on a winged beast. The former can be found in the tracks of one of the most prominent heavy bands in the world right now, Knocked Loose. The seismic-sounding breakdowns and plunges into half-time heard in the background of the gameplay shown so far are only a guttural scream and a pig squeal away from the Kentucky natives’ output. But this is then combined with more traditional, almost thrash-like moments that echo the original 1993 Doom, and even earlier metal that borrows a lot lyrically from fantastical, satanic, and medieval inspirations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re yet to fully understand the breadth of The Dark Ages’ gameplay suite, but I’m more than hopeful that id Software is building on everything that came prior, not just in the Doom series, but also from beyond its own walls. Mounting mythological creatures and piloting giant mechs are exciting additions that one wouldn’t necessarily expect from Doom - a traditionally “boots on the ground” shooter - but are welcome surprises nonetheless. Titanfall 2 appears to continue to influence campaign shooter design beyond its signature mobility and wall-running. In many ways, this shift parallels the evolution modern metal music has experienced in recent years, with experimentation within the genre proving fertile ground, whether that’s in a greater exploration of electronic, hip-hop, or hyperpop trappings that the likes of Bring Me the Horizon freely implement, or the grin-inducing reggaeton-like beat that powers Knocked Loose’s “Suffocate”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an exciting time for heavy music, and in turn an exciting time for Doom fans. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-the-first-preview">The Dark Ages is shaping up to thrill in every area where the series has excelled over the years,</a> but naturally, gunplay will always be king when it comes to an id Software shooter. In fact, if Doom was a packed-out arena metal concert, its combat would be centre stage, and its soundtrack would (somewhat confusingly) be the demonic set dressing. We’ve only had a small peek at what lies in store for us in both regards when it comes to Doom: The Dark Ages, but it’s safe to say I’m very excited to potentially have a new favourite metal album to play through in May.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editorial Producer who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

			<p>After an incredible year for indie horror in 2024, Dead of Darkness looks to continue the genre’s resurgence in the new year. At first sight, Dead of Darkness looks like it might be paying tribute to Konami’s classic series Silent Hill, with main character Miles sporting the obligatory grieving Dad uniform of beige jacket, jeans, and floppy hair parting, but the game itself is far more inspired by Capcom’s earlier Resident Evil.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead of Darkness - Story Trailer (2D Pixel Art Survival Horror Action Adventure)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jiS9Q9KZQZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You begin the game as burned out PI Miles Windham. After receiving a mysterious message recorded on a cassette (the game takes place in 1985) he sets out for Velvet Island in the Celtic Sea off the coast of Ireland. His unknown messenger claims to have information about the tragic fire that claimed the lives of Miles’ family. Mysterious and tragic backstory – check; unexpected journey to an isolated mansion – check; immediate meeting with a blonde woman who will probably be more than she first appears – hell yeah. This opening sounds clichéd but I think it’s more correct to consider it deliberate homage to the genre traditions. Dead of Darkness is clearly deeply immersed in the world of survival horror for better or for worse.</p>


<p>Dead of Darkness has a distinctive top down pixel aesthetic that feels straight out of the Super Nintendo days. The resultant lack of clear detail in the backgrounds is alleviated by the use of shiny circles to show where collectable items can be found – ironically the same tactic used in the highly detailed pre-rendered PS1 games.</p>


<p>While initially enemies are entirely made up of identical zombies, as the game progresses there are some wonderfully disgusting creatures waiting to eat your face off. The characters are nicely designed and the static figures used in dialogue sections look good too.</p>
<p>Audio is solid with suitably creepy moans and screams and a surprising amount of voice acting. I was taken aback, though, by how foul-mouthed the script is, with some characters throwing out the C-word like they’re auditioning for an Irish sequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a>. I have no problem with strong language, but wasn’t expecting it here.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long for Mile’s trip to take a turn for the worse and you quickly obtain a pistol that will be your main weapon for much of the game. Later on you’ll also obtain a shotgun, but I would have liked a little more variety in your arsenal beyond this. There are upgrades for both weapons which you’ll need to take out the more dangerous foes towards the end of the game. The positive to this limited arsenal is that it does help reduce the inventory management that is such a core aspect of the genre. Aside from some quests that require you to carry multiple items you can generally get by having both pistol, shotgun, and healing items at all times.</p>

<p>What initially seems to be a standard retread of familiar spooky mansion shenanigans becomes something far more interesting as the storyline develops. Yes, you have the inevitable sinister Umbrella-analogue corporation, but there is also a backstory that feels closer to folk and cosmic horror.</p>
<p>Alongside a lot of combat (with many narrow corridors not making evasion a workable strategy) there is the usual gamut of puzzles and key fetch quests. One neat addition here though is the use of Clues. Reading some files and notes can unlock Clues which you can use like objects to interact with the environment or your inventory. This is a great way to incentivise actually reading the notes and really brings the world of the game to life.</p>
<p>Less welcome are a bunch of instadeath timing puzzles that don’t quite gel with the top down perspective. Moving up the screen across retracting spikes when your character obscures the view is less than ideal, with one very late-game area being a particularly egregious example. I would also put the instadeath enemies in the bin as well, especially when the shotgun sometimes seems to fire through them and necessitate a game reload.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		All in all, Dead of Darkness is a great 2D Resident Evil tribute that brings plenty of its own ideas to the table. There could have been less reliance on instakills late in the game and the attempts to feed in some Eternal Darkness style sanity effects are underdone, but the core gameplay, the puzzles, and the twisting narrative are all well worth the price of entry.	</p></div>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad is leaving the company. The news <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was broken by Variety</a> and confirmed by the publisher, which shared the following statement from WB Global Streaming CEO JB Perrette:</p>
<p><em>David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter which will help minimize disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title.</em></p>
<p>Haddad himself also provided a statement on his departure from the company after nearly ten years in the role and over twenty in total at WB Games:</p>
<p><em>I am so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together at Warner Bros. Games during my time with the company. It has been an absolute pleasure working on and building our iconic gaming franchises, and I will continue to be an enthusiastic supporter of this talented team’s future endeavors. I look forward to working on the next chapter of my career and will always be grateful for my time with Warner Bros. Games.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is that the recent failures of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus might have played a role. The former game by Rocksteady was a massive disappointment that <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">caused</a> a major financial drop in revenue for the publisher after a big investment. The latter certainly cost a lot less to make, but it still ultimately underperformed despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-surpassed-20-million-players-in-less-than-a-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">initial success seen in the Open Beta a couple of years ago</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's also worth remembering that Warner Bros. Games smashed sales records just a couple of years ago with Avalanche Software's Hogwarts Legacy, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was the best-selling game of 2023</a> in a year filled with triple-A releases. A sequel is already in production and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might have live service elements</a>; in the meantime, rumors suggest a sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitive edition of Hogwarts Legacy</a> is being made with the help of Rocksteady.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-developers-are-allegedly-hiding-fake-heroes-in-game-files-to-catch-leakers.1090938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-fake-leaks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>New claims have hit the internet that the Marvel Rivals developers are adding fake heroes within its game files to confuse and catch leakers, or are they?</p>



<p>The discussion first appeared on the Marvel Rivals Leak discord channel, where data miner and leaker Keone posted that NetEase is likely adding fake heroes to the game in order to confuse data miners.</p>



<p>“Hello everyone, it has come to our attention that the devs have set up characters to catch leakers, not only the ones in the code – but potentially insider sources, too. Kang will probably explain this more as we go on, but here is the current list as far as we can figure out,” Keone explained. He then posted a picture of the characters which he believes will not be coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-fake-heroes-being-planted-in-marvel-rivals">Are There Fake Heroes Being Planted in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p>But the story doesn’t quite end there, as X0X Leaking Team member&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1882561140049269227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zvis_ceral</a>, who is also a dataminer stepped in to elaborate. </p>



<p>“This is not a 100% confirmation that they are all coming or when they will come. This is just to show off that these actually exist,” he said. He continued with a thread of heroes and code:</p>



<div><article><p><span>This is not a 100% confirmations that they are all coming or when they will come. 
This is just to show off that these actually exist. 🧵

All Hero tags can be found in: Marvel/Content/Marvel/Data/DataTable/MarvelHeroTable

Ability Tables are to long to fit the screenshot, will… </span></p></article></div>



<p>While it would be uncommon but plausible for developers to add fake code to their games to catch leakers intentionally, it doesn’t quite make sense as to why they would. After all, the “real” heroes that are making their way to the game would still have to be in the code and would be leaked before their official announcement anyway.</p>



<p>While I don’t consider myself a tech guru when it comes to datamining, to me, it seems like this is all just code related to game development and not necessarily some huge plan from the developers to screw over leakers. All the game code tells us (and is the case for all game leaks that come via game code) is that certain things were in development and planned at one point or another. Whether they release or not is unclear unless the code specifically says.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-x-men-characters-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – These X-men Characters have been leaked to be coming to Marvel Rivals.</a></strong></p>



<p>So, are Marvel Rivals planting fake heroes? I don’t think so. Personally, I think people have misinterpreted the game code and what it means in some way.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Marvel Rivals leaks? Do you think some have been fake-planted? </p>

Blizzard’s end user licence agreement specifically warns players that account boosting or power-leveling, in exchange for payment, is prohibited.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/24/gettyimages-2194433763-1737715737822.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Elon Musk has reportedly admitted to cheating in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2.

Are the TOS not being enforced even when openly broken?” <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3704300" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one Path of Exile player in a post on the game’s official forum</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Are there any comments from GGG regarding this? Maybe in [Early Access] it's not a high priority, or it's garnering too much free press, but as a longtime supporter, this is a massive blow to the credibility of RMT [real money trading] enforcement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not trying to shitpost or troll with this, I'm just extremely disappointed that GGG isn't getting out the ban hammer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Anyone else feel this is undermining the integrity of the game?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a similar sentiment on Battle.net. “Is boosting against the rules?” <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/is-boosting-against-the-rules/212110" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked one player</a>. “If it is, then shouldn’t Elon Musk’s account get banned since he flat out admitted that he boosts his account? I assume he doesn’t get to break the rules just because…”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When contacted by IGN, Grinding Gear Games declined to comment. Blizzard also declined, saying it does not comment on individual player account behaviors or enforcements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Musk had bragged about his gaming prowess on multiple occasions, most notably in <a href="https://youtu.be/7qZl_5xHoBw?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan</a> in which he said he was in the top 20 players in the world for Diablo 4. More recently, Musk had a hardcore level 97 Path of Exile 2 character, although it has since perished. <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1879520605634220362" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He has said</a> he plays video games “to quiet my mind.” “Some days are real tough, so playing video games is my strange solace,” he added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Musk's self-proclaimed gaming prowess was brought into question as players began to take a closer look at his performance and knowledge of the games he plays. Some had questioned whether Musk was capable of dedicating the huge amount of time that would be needed to reach his high levels in Diablo 4 and Path of Exile 2 given his commitments as boss of Tesla, SpaceX, X/Twitter, and now as Donald Trump's efficiency tsar. Then <a href="https://youtu.be/4gxRyXsPoXI?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an early January livestream that saw Musk tackling endgame tasks in Path of Exile 2</a> drew criticism from fans who said he failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of the game’s mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many had assumed that Musk might have been paying others to boost his Path of Exile 2 character for him, and so it proved. <a href="https://x.com/NikoWrex/status/1880845217525588330" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A video posted on</a> Sunday by the Diablo player NikoWrex showed a direct message conversation with Musk on X in which Musk admits to account boosting, insisting it was the only way to compete with players in Asia.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Have you level boosted (had someone else play your accounts) and/or purchased gear/resources for PoE2 [Path of Exile 2] and Diablo 4?” asked NikoWrex. Musk responded with a 100% emoji. He later added: “It’s impossible to beat the players in Asia if you don’t, as they do!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But when I post a video of a game or am streaming, that's 100% me," he added. Musk was asked whether he intended to take credit for having a high level hardcore Path of Exile 2 character. "No. Never claimed that," he replied. "The top accounts in Diablo or PoE require multiple people playing the account to win a leveling race." Musk then went on to question the need to apologize for his actions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following the revelations, the musician Grimes, who has three children with Musk from a previous relationship, <a href="https://x.com/Grimezsz/status/1880685503009443921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> in his defence, saying: "Just for my personal pride, I would like to state that the father of my children was the first American druid in Diablo to clear abattoir of zir and ended that season as best in the USA. He was also ranking in Polytopia, and beat Felix himself at the game. I did observe these things with my own eyes. There are other witnesses who can verify this. That is all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, further allegations of cheating were levelled when <a href="https://youtu.be/-ftqfehTL2Y?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Musk’s Path of Exile 2 character was seen as active in the game while he was in Washington attending Trump’s inauguration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Julia Demaree Nikhinson - Pool/Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
