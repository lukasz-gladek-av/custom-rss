		<p>Since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> first launched on PC at the end of 2023, we’ve had no shortage of great games set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. From Owlcat’s fantastic <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a> CRPG, to the car combat mayhem of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Speed Freeks</a> and, of course, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>, 40K fans have had a veritable buffet to choose from. It definitely feels like we’re in somewhat of a golden age, especially when you cast your mind back some ten or so years during a prolonged streak of half-baked PC and mobile titles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Hive Scum Class Reveal | Cinematic Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZetaKE7KQo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For Swedish developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/fatshark">Fatshark</a>, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide seemed like an open goal: a grimdark sci-fi adaptation of its previous work creating the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/vermintide">Vermintide</a> franchise, which fused Games Workshop’s beloved fantasy setting with a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> style of co-op gameplay. However, when it first launched at the end of 2023, Darktide wasn’t met with universal acclaim, with players bemoaning performance issues, unbalanced/unfinished content, and a general lack of content variety.</p>


<p>So, like any great live service game developer, Fatshark went about improving the core game before its eventual PlayStation 5 launch at the end of 2024. This is where I initially jumped on the wagon, though, after having just come away from Vermintide 2 – which still receives regular support through regular updates and content drops – Darktide couldn’t quite get its hooks in me the same way. However, upon returning to the game in 2026, after more than a year, it finally found its mark, no doubt aided by my recently renewed interest in all things 40K.</p>

<p>Returning to any live service game can be pretty daunting, even in cases where developers offer handy tooltips and videos to help lapsed players get back up to speed. At some point, you simply have to accept that you need to refamiliarise yourself with core concepts: in this case, it was relearning the various passive perks, ability synergies, and gear stats that fuel Darktide’s progression. Of course, you don’t have to throw yourself in the deep end or pick up the thread where you left it. Darktide offers simple matchmaking settings that allow you to quickly dial down the threat level for those first few homecoming missions. This was helped by last year’s Battle for Tertium update, which added a more linear mission path with debriefs and embedded cinematics to give players a more story-driven experience, rather than dropping into random missions with little context or narrative preamble about what’s happening.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Arbites Class | Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GVaGC0xXUVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Although each of the game’s classes has undergone various balance waves and tweaks, you may want to try your hand at rolling a completely different character. For me, that choice was made easier after gaining access to the game’s pair of post-launch classes: the Arbites and the Hive Scum. Similar to the four core classes, they embody archetypes found within the Warhammer 40,000 universe and its various factions, banding together to repel the corrosive influence of Chaos.</p>
<p>It’s easy to see why the Arbites became a fast favourite among fans. There’s a Judge Dredd vibe about them, doling out a brutal strain of Imperial justice with the Shock Maul and Exterminator Shotgun. What really defines the Arbites, however, is their Cyber-Mastiff companion: an AI-controlled pet that will tear through grunts and pin down pesky elites. This mechanical mutt has its own pool of passive and active abilities, though a minority of Arbites sickos can opt to leave their Cyber-Mastiffs kennelled in favour of better stats and quicker cooldowns on abilities/grenades.</p>

<p>The Hive Scum, as their name suggests, are less concerned with the whole law and order thing. Where the Arbites meet their foes head-on, this newest addition to the Darktide roster prefers trickery and mayhem, constantly moving as they switch between their Shivs and Dual Pistols, lobbing explosives and toxins, striking from behind. The new Stimm Lab system also grants Hive Scum a unique layer of customisation – a bonus skill tree loaded with various permanent buffs such as improved core stats, weapon recoil, and ability cooldowns. With both post-launch classes, Fatshark has introduced clever new playstyles that more than justify their price tag.</p>
<p>Going into 2026, Warhammer 40,000: Darktide is a much stronger, more layered and cohesive package than it was at launch or even a year ago. This is thanks to a steady stream of smart quality of life improvements alongside new content such as the roguelike game mode, Mortis Trials, more weapons, and an expanded endgame. Indeed, the game has reached a point where I find it hard to imagine making a return to Vermintide 2 any time soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Pushes Its Latest ANC Headphones to a Record Low, the WH-1000XM6 Is Now Priced Below the XM5’s Original Cost]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-its-latest-anc-headphones-to-a-record-low-the-wh-1000xm6-is-now-priced-below-the-xm5s-original-cost-2000663639</link>
            <guid>1418404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Techies and audiophiles are both notoriously fickle crowds, and they love a good debate about the best this or the best that. But they’re overwhelmingly on the same page when it comes to over-ear noise-cancelling headphone: Sony’s WH-1000XM6 are hands-down the very best you can find on the consumer market. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">That’s very relevant right now, because these otherworldly cans are back down to their holiday pricing at Amazon, with a limited-time deal dropping them to just $398.</a></p>
<p>When the WH-1000XM6 headphones dropped last May, our compadres at Gizmodo called them “damn near perfect,” and they were far from alone in that opinion. Sony had set an extremely steep bar for itself when they announced a successor model to the wildly popular WH-1000XM5 headphones, but they cleared that bar with plenty of room to spare by taking all of the WH-1000XM5’s best features and upgrading them even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Faults Found</h2>
<p>When Sony went back to the drawing board, their opening move was to give the WH-1000XM6 an improved foldable design to make them even better travel companions. The headband was widened for greater comfort, a 10-band EQ was added to the Sony Sound Connect app for a deeper level of customization, and the battery life was boosted to an almost unheard of 30 hours even while the best-in-class active noise cancellation is engaged.</p>
<p>But the real draw to the Sony WH-1000XM6 wireless headphones is, of course, that noise cancellation. To quote the opening words of every KISS concert: <em>“You wanted the best, you got the best.”</em> Sony’s new QN3 processor is joined by 12 upgraded microphones and AI Noise Optimization to create the absolute best Active Noise Cancellation of any set of wireless headphones anywhere. That title was probably held previously by — you guessed it — Sony’s WH-1000XM5. But those had “only” 8 microphones, and its QN1 processor gets absolutely blown out of the water by the QN3, which is fully 7x faster and therefore far more effective in eliminating external sounds.</p>



<h2>You’re In Control</h2>
<p>Toggling between ANC and Ambient Sound, which allows in enough outside noise for you to be aware of your surroundings, is a simple one-button action in the upgraded interface of the WH-1000XM6. Between the buttons built into the cans and the exceptionally robust set of controls that reside in the Sound Connect app, there are more modes and adjustments available to you than you’ll ever use, but better too many than too few.</p>
<p>The word on the street is that Sony won’t be releasing a WH-1000XM7 wireless headphone in 2026, meaning you can feel free to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">grab the WH-1000XM6 for just $398 during this limited-time Amazon deal</a> with full confidence that you’re getting the absolute best noise-cancelling over-ear wireless headphones on the market.</p>

              <p>A team lead at beleaguered Ubisoft has claimed (thanks <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>) that he’s been placed on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension after he made public remarks criticizing the publisher’s recent return-to-office mandate. David Michaud-Cromp says he was told by bosses that this was because of “an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p> <p>In amongst <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">last week’s shock announcement</a> that Ubisoft was cancelling a number of games (including the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> remake), delaying others, and restructuring itself such that even more studios would be closed, was a demand that all employees return to their local Ubisoft office, five days a week. After this new plan was sprung on 15,000 staff at the same time as it was made known to the public, Michaud-Cromp took to his LinkedIn account on January 23 to vent.</p>

 <p><span><span dir="ltr">“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they ‘believe in collaboration'” wrote the Ubisoft Montreal level design team lead, “but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office… (Spoiler alert: it’s not about efficiency or collaboration)”</span></span></p> <p>Michaud-Cromp is not alone in his criticism of Ubisoft’s declaration that all employees must now return to working full-time in offices. Many Ubisoft staff took to the company’s internal message board to vent their feelings, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">as seen and reported on by&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> last week</a>, not least because Parisian employees in particular had only recently completed negotiations to ensure they could maintain two work-from-home days a week.</p>

 <p>It seems Michaud-Cromp’s initial comments did not go down well with his bosses. He now claims that his remarks have led to being disciplined. “P<span><span dir="ltr">rofessional update,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.” He says this was “presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy,” alongside the astonishing phrase, “and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.” He concluded, “I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</span></span></p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s latest plan to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">reverse its rapid decline</a> is a restructuring that will simplify&nbsp;development by the creation of a collection of “creative houses,” which appears to be further consolidation of its many teams around the world, and thus another raft of inevitable job losses. In its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">announcement</a> (a pdf) it adds, “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days.” Why? “This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams.” Um, what? “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p> <p>Staff appeared to receive this with some hefty cynicism, including Michaud-Cromp’s. Another staff member told <em>Kotaku</em> the move was being made “with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing.”</p>

 <p>Due to covid, when everyone was forced to work from home, it became apparent how flexible work arrangements actually lead to <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/study-shows-working-from-home-has-potential-to-significantly-boost-productivity">improved</a> <a href="https://www.apollotechnical.com/working-from-home-productivity-statistics/">productivity</a>, but bosses at many big companies whose roles are perhaps somewhat threatened by this revelation <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/sep/16/amazon-in-person-office-policy">have been pushing back</a>.</p> <p>Ubisoft staff are deeply unimpressed by this new announcement, and the threat of yet another round of job losses, and <em>Kotaku</em> has seen internal calls from at least five unions representing Ubisoft workers for a three-day strike by all employees in February.</p> <p>We have reached out to both Ubisoft and Michaud-Cromp for further comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The 250 hours I've logged in extraction shooter Arc Raiders tell you I'm hooked, but last week I read a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1q3fgds/the_downsides_of_using_purple_weapon_mods_reveals/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>comment on the game's subreddit</u></a> that perfectly encapsulated one of its few flaws.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If the game is about getting good loot, but the good loot is actually bad, what are we doing?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you're searching a container, a rare augment – the devices at the heart of your loadout — or epic gun reveals itself in a burst of purple, a catchy jingle, and a big boost to the value of your stash, the place where you hoard and organise your items. But actually using<em> </em>these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/Best_Weapons_Tier_List">weapons</a> and augments is far less satisfying. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rarest guns in Arc Raiders <em>should</em> feel like a glorious reward for all that time you spent hunting blueprints, or for that risky fight you picked with a fellow raider. But the epic weapons are barely better than common ones – and in certain situations, they're actually worse.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/13/ss-cb49dfbcd7175c86e297b35ffc54cf779708f0ae-1920x1080-1768299969996.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There's very little to choose, for example, between the ultra-rare Vulcano shotgun and the Il Toro, which you can find all the time across Arc Raiders' maps. Yes, the Vulcano kills quicker when you spam the trigger. But the Il Toro deals more damage per shot, so when you're dancing on the edge of cover, peeking out and firing before slithering back again, it shines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are plenty more examples. The Bobcat, the epic SMG, shreds up close. But so does the Stitcher, which you can get as part of a no-risk free loadout or craft for next-to-nothing in your workshop. The Sticher's "effective DPS", taking into account reload time, is actually <em>higher </em>than the Bobcat's, and against certain shields the Stitcher can kill in one magazine where the Bobcat can't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And don't even get me started on the Bettina, a weapon endlessly memed  the community. Yes, I get that it's for killing Arc, but you need to take <em>eight stacks </em>of ammo for it to be worth equipping. Give me an Anvil or Trailblazer grenade instead.</p><p>If these epic guns were 10% more lethal, 15% less expensive, and wore out 20% slower, they'd feel so much better.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cost-should-not-inherently-fill-a-skill-gap-arc-raiders-dev-admits-were-definitely-a-bit-off-on-some-of-the-cost-to-benefit-ratios-for-guns-like-the-bobcat-and-tempest-but-says-all-weapons-have-to-be-usable/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesRadar+</a>, lead designer Virgil Watkins said that "any given weapon in capable hands should be capable of winning a fight if you're playing smartly". That makes sense. Newer or more casual players shouldn't lose just because they're carrying a worse gun. But this also isn't a team-based shooter that requires perfect balance. When you find something rare, it'd better feel special to use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't help that maintaining these weapons is so expensive. Despite being the most polished guns in this apocalyptic world, their durability burns fastest, and repairing them munches through ultra-rare crafting parts. So rather than leveling the playing field, the current status quo actually does the opposite: the only players that can afford the risk of using and losing these weapons are people who, like me, have spent far too much time topside, have found the blueprints of these guns, and have a mountain stash of rare crafting parts ready to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the same interview, Watkins did say "we're definitely a bit off on some of the cost to benefit ratios." It's promising to see him recognise that, and I actually don't think it needs a massive adjustment to fix. If these epic guns were 10% more lethal, 15% less expensive, and wore out 20% slower, they'd feel so much better.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The rarest augments pose a different problem, though. Before Tuesday's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/arc-raiders/ARC_Raiders_Headwinds_Patch_Notes_and_Update_Roadmap">Headwinds update</a> arrived, only two out of the six epic augments were strong – the Looting Mk 3 survivor can stop you bleeding out so that you have the chance of crawling to an extraction point with your loot, and the Tactical Mk 3 defensive has a built-in shield recharger for PvP runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other four aren't worth the crafting components once you finally find their blueprints. I've equipped them when I've found them, but never felt compelled to actually make one. The so-called "aggressive" combat augment, for example, regenerates a mere two health every five seconds. On top of that, it pauses for 30 seconds when you take damage, rendering it virtually useless for its one purpose, aggressive combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the weapons, augments don't need a rebalance. They need a total rethink. Top-tier augments should have a defining attribute that enables new playstyles, and Embark knows this: the studio added two new epic augments as part of the Headwinds update, including one that lets you stick a gun in your safe pocket. That's a start, but I think the useless ones need to be culled and replaced by more imaginative ideas. I love the fact that the more common tactical augment deploys a smoke when your shield breaks, and that the level-two looting augment makes you immune to face-hugging ticks. More of that, please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, I find Arc Raiders compelling despite this problem with rare loot (and despite its insistence on genAI voice acting). But there's no doubt in my mind that late-game balance is a problem, one Embark needs to get a grip on as new players continue to join and as experienced players, like me, look for reasons to stick around beyond its first few months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Horti is a journalist with bylines at the BBC, IGN, Insider Business, and Edge. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-good-loot-is-actually-bad-loot-and-that-needs-to-change]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1418389</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a> 1.4.5 — dubbed the Bigger and Boulder Update — is finally here, and it's welcoming in thousands of new and returning players alike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/105600/charts/#1w" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>, up until the new update, Terraria averaged around 20-30,000 players at any one time, with the occasional spike in interest when new content dropped over the years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">1.4.5, however, has seen one of the biggest spikes in over a decade, hitting a release day peak of almost 165,000 players on Valve's platform. This is second only to the release of Update 1.4 in May 2020, although that coincided with lockdown, of course, which gave millions of gamers around the world a little more time to play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The true number of players will be even higher, given Terraria is also available on console and mobile, and 1.4.5 was released across platforms at the same time. The console and mobile makers do not make player numbers public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So, 'Bigger &amp; Boulder!', why 'Bigger &amp; Boulder' you ask? Beyond a good bit of additional content, a lot of effort with this update went into rounding out and expanding on existing experiences," developer Re-Logic said in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/105600/view/511853946447332034" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>. "Things like making inventory management and crafting easier than ever. We expanded upon secret world seeds - something that we feel greatly expands the replayability/freshness of the game - while also making them more accessible than ever before. We also had a focus on improving things like atmosphere on top of our continual polish/quality of life/balance efforts - which is getting harder and harder as Terraria gets bigger!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Oh, and you might encounter some new boulders... or existing boulders in new ways. Don't say we didn't warn you!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As always, we never share everything that is in each update - not even in the "full" changelog. Part of the fun is in the discovery! Good luck and happy adventuring, Terrarians!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Terraria is pretty old at this point; IGN reviewed it 15 years ago(!), way back in 2011. Even then, though, we thought it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/05/25/terraria-review"><u>amazing, scoring it 9/10</u></a> and writing: "Though on the surface it looks like just another 'me too' indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying. That's rare indeed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have the full — and very long! — rundown of the patch notes below, courtesy of <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-bigger-boulder-available-now.145773/#post-3386339" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Terraria forum</a>, <strong>but be very cautious, as there may be some unmarked spoilers here!</strong></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Terraria Bigger and Boulder 1.4.5 Patch Notes:</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><u>Seeds</u>​</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added the Skyblock seed, where you start out on nothing but a small floating island.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a> has just received a massive new update called The Toxic Tangle, which is adding a new Garden biome, new enemies, and a rideable ladybug with a gun mounted on it. Obviously!</p>
<p>The Toxic Tangle update is the first major update to the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-is-celebrating-its-release-with-a-chance-to-win-a-10-foot-fluffy-ant-you-can-use-to-frighten-a-child">since its Early Access release back in 2025</a>. The Garden, overgrown with vines and towering structures, is a messy new addition that players are now able to explore. It's also littered with new enemies and resources to collect, so you'll need to keep an eye out as you venture between the pumpkins.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 will also let people ride a new Ladybug Buddy, which should help you navigate through this new landscape. It's packing a mounted water cannon on its back which you can use to fend off all manner of creepy crawlies, and is itself a tough creature to take down.</p>

<p><a href="https://grounded2.obsidian.net/news/update-0-3">The official blog post announcing the update</a> has also teased the return of both the Masked Stranger and the Snake Colossus, which you'll have to track down with an updated mutation system allowing you to further customise your ability to build or fight in Grounded 2.</p>
<p>The team at Obsidian also stated it's working on Playgrounds mode, a fan-favourite from the original game.</p>
<p>If you've not played Grounded 2, you can read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grounded-2-early-access-review">Eurogamer's review of its Early Access release</a>. In it, Robert Purchase wrote: "The ant-sized thrills of Grounded return in a sequel which lays exciting foundations for the future. There's work to do but, already, an exciting adventure to have.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-beats-switch-2-final-fantasy-vii-remake-textures/</link>
            <guid>1418371</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, 2020's <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> was finally launched on <strong>Xbox Series S</strong>, <strong>Xbox Series X</strong>, and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> by developer and publisher Square Enix. </p>



<p>Early user impressions based on the demo <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were very positive about the Nintendo Switch 2 version</a></strong>. However, the folks at Digital Foundry have now <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/final-fantasy-7-remake-series-s-beats-switch-2-texture-quality-with-less-ram" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published their detailed analysis</a>, and it seems like the most impressive version of the bunch is actually the one running on the Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>Over the course of this console generation, Microsoft's cheaper Xbox Series console <strong>was often criticized by developers for its hardware deficiencies</strong>, especially in the RAM department. Indeed, even the Nintendo Switch 2 console has more RAM (<strong>9GB</strong> versus <strong>8 GB</strong>) dedicated to its games, and yet <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake shows better texture quality on Microsoft's console</strong>.</p>



<p>While the Switch 2 version appears to mix up assets from the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions, the Xbox Series S deploys the full asset quality seen on its bigger sister, the Xbox Series X, and on the PS5. Digital Foundry postulates that, despite having less available RAM, the Series S achieves this result <strong>thanks to texture streaming powered by its CPU</strong>, a custom 8-core AMD Zen 2 chip which is nearly identical to the Series X's, except for a slightly lower clock speed. By contrast, the Nintendo Switch 2 has a noticeably less powerful CPU, the <strong>ARM Cortex-A78C</strong>. It has the advantage of <strong>NVIDIA DLSS support on the GPU</strong>, but it can't help it here.</p>



<p>That said, the graphics settings used for the Series S version, such as shadow quality, <strong>are somewhere in the middle between the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 versions</strong>. When it comes to resolution and frame rate, Xbox Series S owners can choose between running the game at <strong>1080P resolution and 60 frames per second</strong> or <strong>1440P resolution and 30 frames per second</strong>. The Xbox Series X, on the other hand, uses the same targets as the PS5 version of Final Fantasy VII Remake: <strong>1512P at 60 frames per second</strong> in Performance Mode, and<strong> 2160P (native 4K) at 30 frames per second</strong> in Quality Mode.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the next chapter in the remake trilogy, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-should-launch-this-year-xbox-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is also rumored to be launching this year on Xbox Series S|X and Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, <strong>it's a much more taxing game than the first installment</strong> due to its vast open areas. Even on PlayStation 5, it was known to be blurry because the developers had to reduce the resolution to keep the frame rate smooth. It'll be interesting to see whether the developers can strike a good balance between visuals and performance on the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>In other Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy news, Square Enix <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed that even the third part will be made with Unreal Engine 4</a></strong>, rather than switching to the newest Unreal Engine 5, as the team is more familiar with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has confirmed that recent server issues in ARC Raiders are due to DDoS attacks. </p>



<p>Since the new Headwinds update, players have been reporting several bugs and glitches, most notably one that causes a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive drop in looting speed</a>. Additionally, several players observed stability issues, including being unable to move in the game. It seems the cause of the server issues has been found. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-hit-with-ddos-attacks-hotfix-arriving-later-today">ARC Raiders Hit with DDoS Attacks, Hotfix Arriving Later Today </h2>



<p>As revealed on the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/arcraiders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/arc-raiders-server-issues-caused-by-mass-embark-ddos-attack-as-devs-warn-players-not-to-login-right-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FRVR</a>), Embark Studios recently acknowledged the server issues in ARC Raiders and stated that they were actively investigating the issue. Now, it seems they have found the cause of this problem, as a new statement on the game’s official Discord says both ARC Raiders and THE FINAL are experiencing extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team is working to solve the problem, but at this moment, they are still facing attacks. </p>



<p>The developers have confirmed that a Hotfix will be released later today to address the bugs and glitches introduced by the Headwinds update, and the strike team is making “good progress” towards fixing the problem. Interested readers can check out the full statement below: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>Hey Raiders, both ARC Raiders and THE FINALS have been under extensive, co-ordinated DDoS attacks. The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress – but at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing. </p>



<p>Additionally, the team is also working on a hotfix which will solve some of the issues and unintended changes introduced in yesterday’s update, we hope to have that available later today. </p>



<p>We’ll update you all on progress as we have more information to share! </p>



<p>Stay vigilant, Raiders – and we’ll see you Topside when we’re through this.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> has a new Headwinds game update that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-asks-whether-extra-xp-is-enough-to-go-solo-in-a-group-lobby">amongst many other things</a>, removes an extravagantly drawn-out puzzle from the game’s Buried City map. Introduced in December, the puzzle in question saw people tracking down and pushing 15 buttons in a certain order to unlock a secret chamber containing an actual, strummable guitar. As of this updating, you’ll now be able to buy that guitar at Shani’s, like a millionaire tourist paying to be flown to the top of Mount Everest. </p>
<p>I regard this as a dilution of the game, on paper, but I am not one of the players who’ve driven themselves crackers trying to get hold of the instrument (or paying real money for the battle pass to unlock it). Arc Raiders is a multiplayer game, of course, so even if you survive being shot at while stampeding between buttons, it’s possible another, distant player might innocently press one and reset your progress.</p><!--more-->
<p>I really like multiplayer puzzles, in general, especially when the game isn’t really designed for this kind of trickery. It’s hard enough lugging loot back to the elevator in Arc without getting a bellyful of bullets. One can only imagine the feats of cunning required to track down a bunch of buttons in parallel. One can only imagine the elation of bringing home the prize.</p>
<p>Still, reactions to the tweak on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pp7gdr/how_to_get_guitar_buried_city_music_puzzle_and/">Reddit</a> are mostly a mixture of contempt and relief. As one user points out, even if you unearth the guitar, there’s no guarantee you’ll have enough time to extract. Perhaps turning the guitar into a purchaseable item was all part of Embark's plan, after milking community desperation for a few weeks? It <em>is</em> a very nice guitar. You can play up to seven tunes with it. The difficulty of obtaining the thing may explain why so many wasteland buskers are getting shot in the head.</p><p>Read more about this and other Raider business in <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-13-0">the full changelog</a>. The devs have “fixed the Seedvault extraction glitch on Stella Montis that allowed players to remain in the extraction point after it had closed”. They’re also in the process of implementing a three strikes progressive ban system for cheaters, with bans progressing “from 30 days, to 60 and finally a permaban for repeat offenders”.</p>
<p>Any successful examples of puzzles in multiplayer shooters to share? I guess the obvious ones to beat are still Destiny’s Raids, hashtag Vault Of Glass. There’s probably some good stuff in certain editions of Fortnite, but I forget.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Need a Mini Gaming PC Instead of the Mac Mini, This KAMRUI Hyper H2 Is 40% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-need-a-mini-gaming-pc-instead-of-the-mac-mini-this-kamrui-hyper-h2-is-40-off-on-amazon-2000663599</link>
            <guid>1418338</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re not a fan of bulky and noisy PCs taking over your entire workstation, switching to a mini PC makes sense. These offer reliable performance for everyday tasks in a much smaller (and quieter) form factor. Today is a great time to pick one up, all thanks to Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">The retailer is offering the Kamrui Hyper H2 mini PC for $460 right now, after knocking a whopping 40% off its usual $769 price</a>. And as if that wasn’t enough, you’ll also enjoy an extra 5% discount at checkout with free delivery, which brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time offer that expires soon. If you’ve been eyeing a portable, yet powerful mini PC, this is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>The PC is compact, so can easily fit into tighter spaces and cluttered desktops. You can even mount it under the desk or behind the monitor for a cleaner setup. Performance, however, is seriously impressive. The thing runs on a 14450HX processor with 10 cores (6P + 4E), and turbo speeds up to 4.8GHz. Expect roughly 60% higher multi-core performance than the i5-12450H and up to 180% higher than the i7-1185G. Translation? Smooth performance for everyday tasks such as browsing, streaming, and light office work, along with headroom for demanding projects that require more resources.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16GB of DDR4 memory to keep things running smoothly as you use the PC for a variety of needs. It’s not massive, but it still lets you multitask through busy days without experiencing slowdowns. Storage, on the other hand, is taken care of by a high-speed 512GB M.2 NVMe PCIe Gen4×4 SSD, which offers enough space to house larger files, media libraries, games, and more. What’s even better is that both the memory and the storage capacity are expandable, with support for up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM and as much as 4TB of NVMe SSD storage, if your needs grow in the future. Basically, you won’t have to rely on external solutions with this at hand.</p>



<p>The system is capable of supporting a triple-display setup with HDMI 2.0, DP 1.4b, and a full-featured USB-C port that also supports DisplayPort Alt Mode, 10Gbps data transfer, and 15W power delivery. With this, you can use your primary screen to get work done, while the others for team meetings and displaying reference material. Other connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.2, Gigabit Ethernet, two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports (10Gbps), and USB 3.2 Gen1 ports (5Gbps). This selection makes it incredibly easy to connect all your essential peripherals like printers, keyboards, mice, and more, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Kamrui has also packed the PC with a dual-fan cooling system, which is paired with full copper heat sinks and dedicated aluminum heatsinks to ensure consistent performance, even under heavy loads. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6916/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this mini PC, especially now that it’s down to just $460.</a> This 40% discount makes the purchase a lot more affordable, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to grab the offer soon, as it could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders players have observed looting speed drops and server stability issues after the latest Headwinds update. </p>



<p>Embark Studios put out the Headwinds update for ARC Raiders yesterday, introducing new features and systems like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo vs squads, Bird City, Open Parties, and more</a>, along with new content. However, some bugs and glitches accompanied the new features and system, with several players experiencing issues. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-headwinds-update-impacts-looting-and-server-stability">ARC Raiders Headwinds Update Impacts Looting and Server Stability </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/embark-confirms-arc-raiders-new-update-broke-looting-speed-and-made-it-a-lot-slower-the-team-is-aware-of-this-as-its-not-intended/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, the recent Headwinds update for ARC Raiders has significantly affected looting speed. Players have reported a 30% decrease in looting efficiency when using a skill designed to speed up the process. </p>



<p>This issue has been brought to the attention of the game’s official Discord, where community managers have responded. Community admin Ossen mentioned that Embark is “actively investigating” the problem, while community manager Boirdie confirmed that the “team is aware of this, as it’s not intended.”</p>



<p>Additionally, the Headwinds update appears to be causing the servers to become unstable, with players reporting multiple glitches and being unable to move once they load in. Embark has stated that this issue is under investigation as well, according to a post by CharlieIntel on <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/2016474456655323351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). </p>







<p>In other news, Embark Studios is preparing to implement <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ban-system-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new anti-cheat ban system</a> in ARC Raiders, but players don’t feel it’s close to being enough.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/when-did-it-become-trendy-to-hate-on-a-new-game-as-highguard-struggles-to-win-over-the-internet-video-game-developers-come-to-its-defense</link>
            <guid>1418332</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">“It's downright horrible."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A number of high-profile video game developers have defended <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/highguard">Highguard</a> amid an online backlash during the game’s launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The free-to-play “PvP raid shooter” was the big new game reveal at the end of last month’s The Game Awards, but developer Wildlight then went dark until the January 26 release date in a bid to channel the successful shadowdrop of Apex Legends back in 2019.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At launch, Highguard hit a peak of 97,249 concurrent users on Steam — a significant number for any new game launch on Valve’s platform — but at the same time Wildlight has had to contend with a “mostly negative” user review rating. Meanwhile, Steam concurrents have fallen, and Highguard has slipped out of the top 100 most-played games list on Valve's platform.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Chief among the criticisms from players is that the size of the map feels too big and empty for a 3v3 competitive shooter. You’re able to summon a mount to get about faster (the mounts are one aspect of Highguard that players seem to universally like), but some believe a 4v4, 5v5, or even 3v3v3 mode would have been a better fit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also complaints about the resource-gathering phase of each map, which involves what some are calling boring mining and loot farming. The gist here is there is too much downtime and a lack of excitement, although players seem to be enjoying the raid phase of each match, where combat is concentrated. There is also criticism of the design of the playable characters, Highguard’s art direction, and a lack of content — as well as performance problems particularly on PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Through it all is a feeling that Highguard perhaps suffered from being the “one more thing” reveal at The Game Awards, where it might have better managed expectations in a slot earlier in the show. Wildlight staff have indicated they originally planned a true Apex Legends-style shadowdrop for Highguard, but The Game Awards chief Geoff Keighley asked the team about featuring it at the end of the show. Keighley has subsequently suffered a backlash of his own, with some feeling Highguard’ position in The Game Awards’ running order overly hyped the game.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Opening X this morning! <a href="https://t.co/NQXGvOvjYL" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NQXGvOvjYL</a></p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2016245348210245655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Now, developers from the likes of Baldur’s Gate 3 studio Larian as well as Fortnite maker Epic have hit out at the discourse surrounding Highguard, and the internet’s capacity to “hate” on video games at launch. Developers like Cliff Bleszinski of Gears of War fame, Epic executive Mark Rein, and Larian boss Swen Vincke spoke up against, in particular, negativity from critics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t like people s****ing on things others have created,” Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016287197490491396" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">went on to suggest</a> a Metacritic-style scoring system for reviewers, based on how others evaluate their criticism. “I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint,” he said. “The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want  to publish something.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016292319658410345" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He continued</a>: “And yes — I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say — I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough. No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.“</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And in <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016317086465749120" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a follow-up post</a>, Vincke added: “What I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are  sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most. When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care. The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's other ways of dealing with player exploitation. Not playing the games is probably the best one. You don't have to verbally hurt the people behind the game to express your disdain. If enough people stop playing the games that don't respect players, those in charge will get the message and change course soon. There's enough other games there.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Highguard Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cliff Bleszinski, whose own live service shooter LawBreakers was a commercial failure, leading to the closure of his studio, <a href="https://x.com/therealcliffyb/status/2016245017073877329" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked</a>: “When did it become trendy to hate on a new game?

Just so sad. This is a hobby for people, they should approach with joy not hatred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that Wildlight faces an uphill challenge turning online sentiment about its live service shooter around, and the studio will be particularly concerned by Highguard’s Steam user review rating, which remains ‘mostly negative.’ Currently, 37% of the 19,439 user reviews are positive; Wildlight plans to continue to update Highguard with various patches, and has announced its 2026 roadmap of content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Keighley <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2015906199527686220" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responded</a> to one person on social media who asked if he had a financial stake in Highguard’s success. “lol absolutely not,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

"This is due to claimed content status check processes to notify the player if there is unclaimed content in the Support Desk, as indicated by an exclamation point (!)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The notes go on to confirm that this issue — which causes frames to drop only in the Base Camp and Grand Hub, depending upon if you have any "unclaimed content" — is "an unintended bug and will be resolved with this update."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> Title Update 4 — which ushered in a long list of gameplay and balance changes, as well as CPU/GPU improvements, load reduction, and the optimization of "PC-specific processes and addition of options and presets to reduce processing load" — arrived last month. Its development roadmap, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-sets-out-roadmap-to-improve-performance-on-pc-starting-with-title-update-4"><u>detailed in December</u></a>, hoped to address the myriad issues impacting the PC version. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We'll follow this up in January with a PC-specific update with even more improvements, and are looking into further optimization for implementation in the February content update," the team explained at the time. "We're committed to making Monster Hunter Wilds a great experience for all players. Thank you for your patience and continued support."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/more-dlc-more-fps-monster-hunter-wilds-players-ask-capcom-for-answers-after-theory-suggests-a-backend-dlc-check-is-tanking-performance"><u>one player believed they had discovered that PC performance was dictated by the number of DLCs a user has</u></a>.

The tech-savvy Reddit user uncovered what they believed was a “bug in the code they need to fix” and shared their findings with the Monster Hunter subreddit. Shortly after sharing their theory, the redditor updated the post to report that Capcom had "replied," and was "already looking into and it will be fixed." Which is where Patch 1.040.03.01 comes in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer now insists that "the number of DLCs you own does not affect" performance, but claimed content status check processes <em>does</em>. Applying the latest patch should, according to Capcom, resolve it, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.0.41 update on February 18," it said.</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games" data-cy="the-10-best-monster-hunter-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3><h3>The 10 Best Monster Hunter Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don’t have a direct comparison of my old settings on old vs new patch yet, but I can now run full ultra settings at 1440p and it drops to 55fps at worst, usually more like 65-80 though," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1qp0ubt/comment/o25rsxk/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> one player. "Comparable to what I was getting with balanced FSR and minor settings optimization before. So basically enough of an improvement that I get a free resolution upgrade.

Framerate went from an avg of 45 to about 52 at 1080p with quality FSR with a mix of high, and medium settings. I played around a little more and moving most settings down didnt really impact things much IMO. I know some people are having a better experience, but the game still just doesn’t look good for the performance it’s asking.

            <p>Y'know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> bug where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/further-testing-seems-to-confirm-monster-hunter-wilds-dlc-performance-improvement-theory-to-an-extent">close proximity to a talking DLC vendor cat would drop your framerate</a>? Gone. Dead. Done like a kipper. Do kippers exist in the Monster Hunter universe? Maybe not, but then neither does this bug, following a new PC patch for the troubled RPG and confirmed by my testing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Curiously, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">Capcom’s patch notes</a> claim that the FPS drop – which could previously be 'fixed' by splurging on MHW’s many, many add-on cosmetics – was more specifically triggered by the game’s content status checks flagging <em>unclaimed</em> DLC or items, with the total number of owned DLCs having no effect.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that aligns entirely with my pre-patch testing experience, as I still got a substantial performance boost on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-review">RTX 5080</a> after adding all 190 cosmetics, and after manually combing through all of the DLC cat’s menus to check they were all installed. But at least whatever the cause, it does appear to have been properly addressed. Before this patch, and without any DLC, that RTX 5080 averaged 66fps around the camp area where the offending feline resides; with all the DLC, that rose to 73fps. After the patch, the same test rig produced 74fps with the DLC and 75fps without. Success!</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>This particular fixin’ does little to help Wilds’ notoriously stuttery performance outside of camps, though the update does also include "optimisation improvements" and a couple of new graphics settings that can be lowered for a smidge of extra frames. Several denizens of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1qoyzdi/guys_the_game_runs_on_pc_now/">the game’s subreddit</a> are reporting noticeably improved smoothness after installing the patch, and while the upgrades I’ve seen myself haven’t been so dramatic – dropping the new foliage density from High to Low, for example, only gave the RTX 5080 another 2fps on average – they do sound like they might benefit lower- and mid-range PCs more acutely.</p>
<p>"To further improve stability and performance across all platforms," the patch notes continue, "additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18.</p>
<p>"For example, we are currently verifying measures to reduce GPU processing load by adding quality levels (LOD) to the polygon mesh for 3D models. This may help to reduce processing load by swapping to low-resolution models for objects farther away from the camera."</p>
<p>Reminds me of when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> devs denied that the citybuilder ran so badly because it was rendering entire urban populations’ worth of individual, high-definition, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-blaming-teeth-for-cities-skylines-2-performance-problems-say-devs">dynamically growing teeth</a>. God, games are weird.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-steam-deck-docking-station-was-already-a-value-pick-now-its-at-its-lowest-price-ever-after-another-discount-2000663623</link>
            <guid>1418311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Valve released the Steam Deck, it reset expectations for what portable PC gaming could look like. I mean, they did just copy Nintendo’s homework with the Switch design, but that misses the bigger point. The Steam Deck didn’t ask players to rebuild their libraries or buy special versions of games. Gamers can take their existing Steam collections on the road. That single decision helped create an entirely new class of hardware: handheld gaming PCs. Sure, we’ve always had gaming laptops, but the appeal of being able to easily pick-up and play on a dedicated piece of gaming hardware is undeniable.</p>
<p>As impressive as the Steam Deck is in handheld form, its screen can feel limiting in certain situations. A 7.4-inch display works great on a commute or during travel, but it doesn’t always suit relaxed couch gaming. Sometimes you want to stretch out and play on a large television, the same way consoles have done for years. Thanks to docking solutions, the Steam Deck can handle that role with ease. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/">One suitable option comes from Anker, and it’s currently discounted by 10%.</a> The dock usually sells for $33, but a $3 price cut brings it down to a clean $30 for a short time. Sure, it’s not the greatest discount ever, but $30 for a Steam Deck docking station is an absolutely fair value.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>See Every Detail</h2>
<p>Once connected, the Steam Deck can output to an external display at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz over its HDMI port, a major step up from its native 1280 × 800 handheld resolution. That extra clarity makes a noticeable difference on large TVs and monitors. The dock also works with other devices, including other handheld PCs like the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and even tablets such as the iPad.</p>
<p>The dock supports up to 100W USB-C Power Delivery, keeping the Steam Deck charged while it’s connected to a display. Then when you’re ready to take it on the road, it’ll be at full charge.</p>



<p>It comes with a few built-in USB-A and USB-C ports which allow for wired controllers, keyboards, or other accessories. An integrated Ethernet port supports speeds up to 1,000Mbps, offering a more stable connection for online games and faster downloads compared to Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>The compact design makes the dock easy to pack, great for traveling. You can play handheld on the way to your destination, then dock it to a hotel or Airbnb TV later. The open-face design also allows tabletop use, letting the screen sit at a comfortable angle while you play with a controller, no TV required.</p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast in 2026, and fans of the strategy genre should have their eyes cast towards the release date of MENACE.</p>



<p>The title from Hooded Horse will be available on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> only on release, and the game has been compared to the likes of XCOM, which is sure to ignite further excitement in the passionate strategy playerbase. </p>



<p>With over 50k followers on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, MENACE looks set to make a big impact on its arrival, and Insider Gaming has all the details on the release date and the exact time you will be able to jump in and play.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-menace-release">When Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Strategy. Image via Hooded Horse</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>MENACE has an official release date of February 5, 2026, though this may change based on the region where you are located.</strong></p>



<p>While the majority of players will be able to jump in on that date, others will have to wait until the early hours of the morning on the following day before the doors open to them.</p>



<p>This is because MENACE has a global release structure, becoming available simultaneously to players across the world, and not a staggered release.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-menace-release">What Time Does MENACE Release?</h2>



<p><strong>MENACE will be released at 6 AM PT on February 5, with the release taking place later in the morning for those elsewhere in the United States.</strong></p>



<p>For those in Europe, MENACE releases in the afternoon, while those in Australia and nearby regions will have to stay up late to jump in immediately. Details of the release time come via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2432860/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for players on console, there’s no news on a MENACE release on other platforms yet, so PC will be the only way to play at launch.</p>



<p>The table below highlights the release time of MENACE in major regions across the world, so you can count down exactly how long remains until the game is accessible.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Release Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">6 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">8 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">2 PM – Feb. 5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">1 AM – Feb. 6</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director has confirmed that Rebirth and Part 3 are coming to Xbox. </p>



<p>Square Enix just released the first instalment of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series on new platforms, Xbox and Switch 2, and now players are waiting to see when the next instalments will release. We have already received reports that Rebirth is coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 </a>and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a> in 2026, and now the director has confirmed that Xbox ports do exist. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-series-director-confirms-xbox-ports-for-parts-2-and-3">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series Director Confirms Xbox Ports for Parts 2 and 3</h2>



<p>In a new post on <a href="https://x.com/nhamaguc/status/2016312724599472214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Final Fantasy 7 Remake series director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed that the next instalments will have Xbox ports. The director stated that he was happy that Xbox players were enjoying FF7 Remake, followed by confirmation that Square Enix will bring “REBIRTH and the last part of the trilogy” to Xbox as well. The director also thanked Sarah Bond and Phil Spencer for supporting the Final Fantasy series.</p>



<p>Back in September 2025, the director had stated that Final Fantasy will expand to “major platforms moving forward”, which includes PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. This week, the director also confirmed in a new interview that Rebirth and the third instalment are in development for the Switch 2, and the Switch 2 version’s gameplay experience is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty much exactly the same as all the other&nbsp;platforms</a>.”</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-release-for-xbox">When Will Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Release For Xbox </h2>



<p>Even though we have received official confirmation on Rebirth and Part 3 coming to Xbox, we still do not have a release window. A recent report claims the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-arrive-for-switch-2-this-summer-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 version could arrive this summer</a>, and a reliable source says Switch 2 and the Xbox version of Rebirth should arrive together. So players could expect the Xbox version of FF7 Rebirth to arrive in the summer of 2026 if this report is accurate.</p>







<p>In other news, the Final Fantasy 6 Remake series&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-6-remake-should-be-led-by-someone-else-says-ff7-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should be led by someone else</a>,&nbsp;according to the FF7 Remake director. Additionally, the game experience for part three is “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more or less complete</a>.” What are your thoughts on Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth featuring the same gameplay experience on Switch 2 as other platforms?

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A lot has transpired during this first month of 2026, but Ubisoft can't escape the news cycle with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">layoffs, studio closures, project cancellations</a> (including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-actor-reacts-to-cancellation">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/raid-shadow-legends-collaboration-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake">countless hints</a> the still-unannounced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake is coming sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>A new week, a new leak or finding on Edward Kenway's return being a real, impending thing. Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">IGN</a>, we've learned an all-new statue of the iconic pirate-turned-assassin was spotted on 27th January. While the figure itself doesn't say anything about it pertaining to the Resynced remake we've been hearing about for months now, it joins other promotional materials and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/es-es/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/28oWzWFPvQgskv6cgLGBMG/the-division-2-x-assassins-creed-collaboration">big collaborations</a> that are highlighting Kenway in recent times.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="fr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The statue itself is pretty cool, with Kenway sitting on a treasure chest full of gold coins and leaning back against a ship's wheel, pistol and iconic cutlass in each hand. The titular Black Flag is also present, with both the traditional pirate skull and the Assassin's Creed sigil that so many longtime fans love mixed together.</p>
<p>The figure's origins are unknown, and its appearance is a bit baffling; it popped up via the clothing resale app Vinted. Leakers like <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan">j0nathan</a> are sure this isn't a previously released statue, and the listing states the 35cm-tall statue won't be officially out until later in 2026. IGN's report states "a detailed close-up of the statue's base shows logos for Ubisoft and PureArts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026."</p><p>This would line up with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">PureArts' teases last summer</a> that "something" was happening with Black Flag in the near future. At this point, and following so many hints across very different brands and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-claims-assassins-creed-blag-flag-music-reuploads-were-due-to-technical-issues-and-nothing-more">even Ubisoft drumming up excitement</a> for the fourth mainline Assassin's Creed, it's mostly safe to theorize a release was maybe planned for early 2026 before the delays and reorganization that were announced last week.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake now out of the picture and Ubisoft going more selective with its output moving forward, more expectations are being placed on this next major Assassin's Creed release, so let's hope it's all smooth sailing once Kenway and his crew go out into the seas again.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-mod-looks-even-better-new-pbr-textures/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months after <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-4-rtx-remix-compatibility-mod-publicly-available-enjoy-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the public release of the <strong>GTA 4 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>, modder <strong>xoxor4d</strong> has now released an add-on mod that injects approximately <strong>18K PBR (physically based rendering) textures</strong>, mostly roughness/normal maps and a few height maps, into the game, further improving its visuals.</p>



<p>The modder explained that the textures were not manually created. Instead, xoxor4d used a custom build of the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod (<a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/dxvk-remix/tree/feat/AutoPBR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available here</a> and called AutoPBR) to <strong>dump textures at runtime</strong> whenever they were used for rendering. The compatibility mod provided additional information about each texture via the RTX Remix API. Then, texture associations were built, and a USDA file with overwrites was generated. Further processing of the dumped textures was carried out to convert DX9 normal maps to Remix-compatible normal maps, and specular maps were converted to roughness maps using Python scripts.</p>



<p>Because of the automatic process behind the PBR conversion, the modder clarified that <strong>some textures 'here and there' might look broken</strong>. Still, in most cases, it's a noticeable improvement over the game's original textures.</p>

<p>Physically Based Rendering was not yet a thing in the games industry when <strong>Rockstar</strong> released <strong>Grand Theft Auto 4</strong> in 2008. The first games to use PBR were launched in 2013: <strong>Dontnod</strong>'s sci-fi action game <strong>Remember Me</strong> (made in Unreal Engine 3), <strong>Crytek</strong>'s <strong>Ryse: Son of Rome</strong> (made in CryEngine), and <strong>Guerrilla</strong>'s <strong>Killzone: Shadow Fall</strong> (made in Decima Engine). The big difference is that, with PBR, <strong>materials respond realistically to lighting.</strong> </p>



<p>This is all the more important for the GTA 4 RTX Remix mod, which <strong>enables path tracing and thus benefits immensely from PBR textures</strong>. Of course, it's not quite the same thing as if a Rockstar artist had handcrafted them.</p>



<p>In other RTX Remix news, NVIDIA <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-logic-out-now-dynamic-fx-classic-pc-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the new Logic system yesterday</a></strong>. Modders can now add dynamic visual effects to their mods that are triggered based on in-game events. We'll see if xoxor4d decides to introduce it to this GTA 4 RTX Remix mod.</p>

Fresh from the trenches of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">the Divinity generative AI debate</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has taken to the Twitterverse with some moderately spicy thoughts on video game critics and reviewers. Broadly, he feels that we need to work harder to be “critical” without being “hurtful”. He also suggests that the industry could do with a Metacritic-style system for evaluating and scoring reviewers, to “encourage a bit more restraint”, so that "sensitive" creatives don't "lose their idealism and love of players.”
</p>
<p>
Picture me over here, huffing and snorting like a bull eyeing the red-trousered bottom of an atypically fleshy matador browsing the inside of a just-opened china shop. By gawd! A chance to pontificate about my own navel, while bagging a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> headline in the bargain. I have some notes on Vincke’s notes, but before I start throwing my toys around, maybe <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974">read the Xitter thread in full</a>, from late last night on the 27th. For those who do not partake of Musky products, here's a transcript:
</p><!--more-->
<blockquote><p>I don’t like people shitting on things others have created. Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand this. Even when they’re being critical, they do their best not to be hurtful.</p>
<p>Sometimes I think it'd be a good idea for critics to be scored, Metacritic-style, based on how others evaluate their criticism. I like to imagine it would encourage a bit more restraint. The harsh words do real damage. You shouldn't have to grow callus on your soul just because you want to publish something.</p>
<p>There's plenty of games I genuinely don't like playing and there are many I know are made for the wrong reasons. However - it's incredibly rare for one to be made without there being someone behind it that truly cared about what they were making, putting a part of themselves in it.</p>
<p>One of the best reviewers I ever knew refused to review games he considered failures. He believed that developers deserved the chance to try again. He knew that every failed attempt could be what enabled the next great one.</p>
<p>I know this because I was one of those developers that failed. And he only told me many years later.</p>
<p>So yeah - be nice to people that create things is what I'm trying to say. You need them.</p>
<p>And yes - I get that if people are charging money, you want to know if it's good or not. But reviewers can just say - I didn't enjoy it or I don't think it's well made or I don't think it's worth the money they are charging. That's enough.  No need to get personal for the sake of some likes.</p>
<p>Or headlines if you're press.</p>
<p>Going to step down from my soapbox now. It's been on my mind for a while and just opening my feed today just pushed it all to the surface.</p>
<p>Think of the time you had to recite something in front of the class and how nervous you were. And how much any negative comment hurt.</p>
<p>Be nice to one another, be nice to the people creating stuff to entertain you. Treat them like you would like to be treated if you made something.  </p>
<p>Consider it a strategic investment in the quality of your future entertainment. You won't regret it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Following responses to his thread, Vincke wrote a postscript spelling out that devs shouldn’t indulge in personal attacks either, nor should they “milk players who love their game”. Rather, “what I'm trying to say is that most creative souls are sensitive souls and those sensitive souls are the ones that care the most.
</p><p>
“When they check out because they can't handle the vitriol, we all lose because what's left are those that don't care," he went on. "The effect the words have on those sensitive souls may not be underestimated. You don't want them to lose their idealism and love of players." Vincke suggests that “not playing the games is probably the best [way]” to reproach developers “that don’t respect players”.
</p>
<p>
I’ll keep my own thoughts brief-ish. I have some sympathy for the idea that critics should avoid personal attacks, inasmuch as there is a tendency with videogames to hang the work of many on the antics of just one, prominent figure, which means that both feats of collaboration and wider, structural problems may go overlooked. You could argue that making it personal also feeds an online culture of dogpiling individuals, and especially marginalised people who make for ‘easier’ scapegoats.</p>
<p>Still, it’s utterly ambiguous here where Vincke is drawing the line between “critical” and “hurtful” or "personal". And in any case, it can be appropriate to direct some outright vitriol at the people making a game, inasmuch as art expresses the values of its creators. You don’t get a pass for making poison just because you poured your heart into it. Sometimes, utter scorn is justifiable. If Vincke is serious about this conversation, I would encourage him to actually cite some reviews, games and game developers and discuss the finer workings.</p>
<p>I also have some sympathy for the idea that people trying to make art deserve a break, inasmuch as “creative” work under capitalism is often disparaged for being economically unproductive and "frivolous". But I think the making of art or other “creative” work is mythologised to the point that it encourages people to see any critique as an assault on their very being - and the conceit of artmaking as inherently brave, valuable and worth nurturing may be wielded to silence those who challenge the mantra that the creation of another product is an automatic good.</p><p>That fucking restaurant reviewer from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratatouille">Ratatouille</a> is wrong, in other words. One of criticism's most valuable functions - just as valuable as "discovering and defending the new" - is simply to say no in the face of structural pressure to rubber-stamp the next round of releases. This does actually have its risks: I've received plenty of death threats for scoring things 8/10 or lower, and in a media sphere that depends on traffic volume, there is continual ambient goading to approve of, or at least acknowledge games that already have some kind of mass following.
</p>
<p>
Some quick closing notes: a lot of the toxicity and personality politics of online criticism reflects the workings of particular communication platforms, like Twitter, which reward dunking and hot takes. The idea that a reviewer should avoid commenting on something they consider a failure is ridiculous, on paper. If you’re that reviewer, I’d like to read a defence of your decision not to write about Vincke's prior project. Oh, and as it happens, there are some halfway 'official' systems for evaluating and scoring critics. Go look up Rock Paper Shotgun’s TrustPilot page, if you can bear it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, it seems that Square Enix is planning to release the Switch 2 port for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in the Summer of 2026. </p>



<p>A reliable insider recently claimed that Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-still-coming-to-xbox-in-2026-insider-reaffirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still scheduled to release for Xbox</a> in 2026, and the director of the series also spoke about both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-gameplay-experience-will-be-similar-to-other-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Part 2 and Part 3 being in development</a> for the Switch 2. Now, the new development indicates that the port could be released sooner than expected. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-release-window-reportedly-revealed-for-2026">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Switch 2 Release Window Reportedly Revealed for 2026</h2>



<p>The Summer release window for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth’s Switch 2 port comes through a report by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-switch-2-summer-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>. According to their sources, that’s the launch window Square Enix is planning for part 2 of the series. However, the schedule may change or be delayed due to additional development time. However, as of now, it seems like they aim to release it this summer. </p>



<p>If that is indeed true, then it is exciting news for Final Fantasy 7 Remake series fans across other platforms, considering Intergrade was released for Xbox Series X/S just over a week ago. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-could-also-release-for-xbox-this-summer">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Could Also Release for Xbox This Summer </h2>



<p>Additionally, it seems Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth might also release for Xbox Series X/S this Summer, along with the Switch 2 port. Reliable source, NateTheHate, stated on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-gamer-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-switch-2-port-could-release-this-summer.1418122/#post-150602587" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> that the Xbox and Switch 2 ports “should release at the same time just as Remake did.” So, fans on other platforms might be getting the second part of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series very soon. </p>







<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake part 3 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-stick-to-unreal-engine-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sticking to Unreal Engine 4 </a>for development. Additionally, Part 3 will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-will-bring-back-the-snowboarding-mini-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring back the snowboarding minigame</a> and enhance Queen’s Blood.

            <guid>1418278</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite a rather <strong>successful launch</strong> last year, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn't been as big a success as <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-world-hd-hunter-simulator/"><strong><em>Monster Hunter World</em> </strong></a>and<em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/"><strong>Monster Hunter Rise</strong></a></em>. The <strong>low challenge level and massive performance issues</strong> across all formats prevented the game from capitalizing on its <strong>launch momentum</strong>, with sales dwindling so much that it became <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-pretty-damning-lapsed-players-may-not-be-coming-back-to-monster-hunter-wilds-after-all-as-monster-hunter-rise-continues-to-outsell-the-game/">CAPCOM's worst-selling game</a></strong> in the past few months, soundly outsold by games that had been on the market much longer.</p>



<p>While the <span><strong>low-challenge issues were fixed last year</strong>&nbsp;with Title Updat</span>ed, introducing new&nbsp;<strong>challenging monsters&nbsp;</strong>and more&nbsp;<strong>powerful variants</strong>&nbsp;of already available ones, the <strong>performance issues weren't</strong>. December's update was <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-performance-improvements-of-monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-4-are-set-to-make-a-significant-difference/">a small step in the right direction</a></strong>, but all eyes were on the<strong> January PC performance update</strong>, which promised to deliver the<strong> performance improvements the game desperately needed.</strong></p>



<p>And, against all odds, the new Monster Hunter Wilds patch <strong>delivered its promises</strong>, significantly<strong> improving performance</strong> on various PC configurations and even on the Steam Deck.</p>



<p>The <strong>1.040.03.01 PC performance patch</strong> went live earlier today, alongside the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?snr=1_5_9_"><strong>official patch notes</strong></a> outlining some of the changes, which include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Improved CPU/GPU processing specific to the Steam version.</em></li>



<li><em>Reduced shader warming processes performed outside the shader compilation screen to lower CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted texture streaming to improve visual quality while reducing VRAM usage.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted the High Resolution Texture Pack to reduce VRAM usage and overall package size.</em></li>



<li><em>Added a CPU tab to the Options menu, allowing players to adjust settings related to CPU load.</em></li>



<li><em>Added new categories to the graphics settings, along with new settings for existing options.</em></li>



<li><em>Adjusted graphic presets and added a confirmation window to automatically update your settings on first launch after updating.</em></li>



<li><em>Expanded the Volumetric Fog setting in the graphics options from two levels to five. The previous "High" setting has been renamed to "Highest," and "Low" to "High," with three new lower options—"Medium," "Low," and "Lowest"—now available.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where a warning dialogue incorrectly indicated that the AMD Radeon driver was outdated when using driver version 26.1.1 or later.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>On paper, these changes sound <strong>promising</strong>, but do they actually improve performance? It seems <strong>they do</strong>, looking at online reports. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Game doesn't stutter with highest textures anymore, very good,"</em> reported <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606088"><strong>moqz on the ResetERA forums</strong></a>. While the user reports that on an RTX 4070 Ti at 4K resolution and NVIDIA DLSS in Performance Mode, the framerate still drops below 60 FPS in certain areas, it seems to be <strong>generally more stable.</strong></p>



<p><em>"Significant uplift. I have a 4070 Ti Super and I'm currently running with everything cranked (including the high res texture pack), DLAA and 2X framegen. 100-120 fps. </em><span><em>Image quality also feels sharper,"</em>&nbsp;said another ResetERA user, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-patch-released-ver-1-040-03-01.1418182/post-150606220"><strong>jrx8080</strong></a>, who's running the game on an RTX 4070 Ti GPU at max set</span>tings, DLAA, and 2X Frame Generation, hitting 100-120 FPS, though the user didn't specify at which resolution.</p>



<p>The first <strong>comparison videos</strong> shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@VideoGamePerformance"><strong>Video Game Performance</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Pandapa"><strong>Pandapa</strong></a>, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.youtube.com/@WreckitRai"><strong>WreckitRai</strong> </a>offer a clearer view of what the patch does. While the average framerate isn't significantly higher than the previous version of the game, <strong>frametimes are far more stable</strong>, which contributes to the game feeling generally smoother than before.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new Monster Hunter Wilds patch also brought significant performance improvements on <strong>Steam Deck</strong>. A new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard"><strong>Deck Wizard</strong></a> shows the game running on Valve's system with the patch, <strong>hitting a relatively stable 30 FPS at low settings</strong>, finally making the game somewhat playable on it. </p>



<p>As more performance improvements are expected to come next month, on February 18th, things are definitely looking up for those who wish to play the game on the go and don't want to wait for the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/potato-mode-incoming-monster-hunter-wilds-could-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-and-the-communitys-reaction-doesnt-disappoint/">inevitable Nintendo Switch 2 port</a></strong>, which is all but <a href="https://wccftech.com/think-monster-hunter-wilds-on-nintendo-switch-2-will-be-an-impossible-port-new-screenshot-and-information-suggest-otherwise/"><strong>confirmed to be in the works.</strong></a></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Besides introducing these performance fixes, the new Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance patch also addresses the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/">DLC checks issue that came to light earlier this month</a></strong> and impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/"><strong>performance in the Base Camp and Grand Hub.</strong></a></p>



<p>With a lot more online reports mentioning performance improvements with this new Monster Hunter Wilds patch, it feels like the game may finally be in the perfect spot to <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>bring players back </strong></a><strong>ahead</strong> of the yet-to-be-revealed Master Rank expansion. Hopefully, it will build on the solid game mechanics of the base game to deliver the definitive Monster Hunter experience it has always had the potential to be, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"><strong>in my opinion.</strong></a></p>

Now, fans have seemingly gotten a first look at merchandise for the game, in the shape of a new statue designed by collectible maker Pure Arts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lavish design features Black Flag hero Edward Kenway sat on a treasure chest that's spilling gold coins, leaning back against his ship's wheel, a cutlass and pistol in each hand. The statue is then topped off by a large billowing flag featuring the game's logo: the Assassin's Creed sigil with a skull in the middle.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr"><p>⚠️ LEAK BLACK FLAG REMAKE ?</p><p>Un gars sur Vinted vend une toute nouvelle figurine de Edward Kenway et prétend qu'elle sortirait cette année. </p><p>En sachant que le remake de Black Flag était censé sortir dans moins de 2 mois, serait-ce la figurine officielle du jeu ? <a href="https://t.co/ctVWiavA6c" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ctVWiavA6c</a></p></div>— j0nathan (@xj0nathan) <a href="https://twitter.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 27, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If Ubisoft has made any change to Kenway's character design for its remake, there's no evidence of it here. That said, any alteration to the now-iconic pirate assassin's look would have been a surprise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What is curious, though, is how this statue has seemingly come to light. Unboxed and with no mention of its origins, the item was reportedly listed via used clothing resale app Vinted. Numerous fans spotted the item pop up, including notorious Assassin's Creed leaker <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/2016167642046849488" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">j0nathon</a>, who quickly realized this was not a statue that had been publicly released already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The item's listing states that it is 35cm tall and features a 20cm width, and due for release in 2026.

Reports detailing the remake have  since suggested that the game has gone through substantial changes to modernize its visuals and gear system in line with more recent franchise instalments. Another report has also claimed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stop-removing-the-modern-day-assassins-creed-fans-react-as-black-flag-remake-reportedly-cuts-everything-outside-the-animus">the game will also no longer feature any content outside the Animus</a>, with extra pirate missions added instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft itself previously said it would release an unannounced game before the end of its current financial year on March 31, though this launch has now been delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>It's no secret <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>' optimisation, especially in its PC version, has been a bit cheeks even if updates have slowly tried to bite through its many technical issues. The game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-review">has been good fun</a> otherwise, but even at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/monster-hunter-wilds-sells-11-million-in-just-under-a-year-but-may-lack-worlds-momentum">11m copies sold</a>, its momentum slowed quite a bit following a huge launch.</p>
<p>January is now almost over and the game's first anniversary is near. True to its word, the Monster Hunter developer has now deployed a Steam-exclusive patch which marks the second chapter in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">performance improvements roadmap</a> set in late 2025 by Capcom.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526492547790405650?l=english">patch notes</a> for Ver.1.040.03.01 were shared on 28th January alongside the big update, which also targets the <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained">unintended FPS drops in the Base Camp and Grand Hub</a> oddly tied to unclaimed content <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/">discovered by a Reddit user</a> a couple of weeks ago. "To further improve stability and performance across all platforms, additional improvements will be implemented in the Ver. 1.041 update on February 18," the post added.</p>
<p>The major additions and changes target the CPU/GPU load, with shader processes outside the initial one now reduced to lower CPU load during normal play, improved streaming of textures to reduce VRAM usage, and a reworked High Resolution Texture Pack (optional download) which uses less VRAM and takes up less space.</p><p>Players will now also find a chunky CPU tab if they go to the crowded Options menu, with extra non-graphical settings tied to CPU load now available; these include frame skips and limited numbers of smaller creatures, among other things. They might not make much of a difference for beefy builds, but those with slower CPUs could claw some performance back.</p>

<p>Graphic settings have also gained a few new categories and extra quality levels. Moreover, the typically heavy Volumetric Fog setting has received three lower options and renamed its "High" setting to "Highest" in case you don't need top-notch fog rendering.</p>
<p>In my own post-patch experience, performance has seen improvements across the board even if RE Engine's limitations when it comes to open levels (something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragons-dogma-2-review">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> also suffered from) are still there. Two particularly taxing locations, the main camp located at the Windward Plains and the more watery Scarlet Forest area, have seen a welcome bump of up to 20 FPS on average. Mind you, my PC rig isn't a low-tier one, but without using the Frame Generation option (on top of DLSS), those zones usually were sub-60 FPS. Now they're well above that mark and much higher with the FG x2 boost enabled. Overall, the game seems more stable and less stuttery to boot.</p><p>On the game's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/">Steam forums</a>, the early sentiment is positive so far, with players reporting FPS gains and a less hiccup-y experience overall. A few users are even <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/729154531022090103/">pushing for more positive reviews</a> following the update (the game currently sits at Mixed), but it'll take a while before the community's thoughts coalesce. On the other hand, some veterans are remaining unimpressed by the tweaks.</p>
<p>As a reminder, this is just the second phase of Capcom's ongoing efforts to improve the game's health ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-think-theyve-discovered-even-more-proof-that-monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">rumoured Switch 2 port</a> and a potential large expansion which adds to the game's free endgame content updates, which appear to be done now. Hunters on consoles needn't download this PC-only patch.</p>
