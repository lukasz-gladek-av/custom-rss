		<p>As is tradition, someone somewhere has published information a little too early about a game that is almost certainly going to be revealed later on tonight at The Game Awards. This year Lara Croft can take home not one, but two shiny “Someone pressed the TGA button to soon” awards as two Tomb Raider games have leaked.</p>
<p>The first is Tomb Raider Catalyst, which leaked artwork, synopsis, and the entire trailer, although Amazon has been very quick to take the latter down. It is set for release in 2027 for the PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and finds Lara on a new expedition across Northern India.</p>


<p><em>“Set in the wake of a mythical cataclysm that has unleashed ancient secrets and awakened mysterious guardian forces, Tomb Raider: Catalyst folows Lara Croft on a new adventure across Northern India.”</em></p>

<p>The second game, Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, is a “reimagining” of the very first Lara Croft adventure.</p>

<p><em>“Experience a stunning reimagining of Lara Croft’s 1996 genre-defining game with jaw-dropping visuals, modern gameplay, and new surprises that honor the spirit of the original.”</em></p>
<p>If you really want to watch the trailer for that then you can find it in super low res with no sound over on 4chan, I suggest you don’t. I had a look on your behalf and it looks very much like the first Tomb Raider but all modern, so exactly what you would expect.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis is also coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC and both games are being made by Crystal Dynamics and published by Amazon.&nbsp; They are also making a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/04/sophie-turner-is-lara-croft-in-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series/">Tomb Raider TV series</a> with &nbsp;Sophie Turner set to take on the leading role.</p>
<p>Turner, whose breakout role came as Sansa Stark in the Game of Thrones series, before she played Jean Grey in X-Men: Apocalypse and Dark Phoenix, will be the third actor to play Lara Croft. She follows in the footsteps of Angelina Jolie, who starred in two films in the early 2000s, and Alicia Vikander, who had one shot at the role in 2018.</p>

		<p>Have you been keen to step into the 3D meat space of Super Meat Boy 3D? Well there’s no need to wait for PC gamers, as a Super Meat Boy 3D demo is now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3288210/Super_Meat_Boy_3D/">live on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Coming as a slight precursor to The Game Awards tonight, this is a newly updated version of the demo that was playable at Gamescom earlier this year.</p>


<p>The Super Meat Boy 3D demo features 10 levels from the full game, giving a look at two worlds –&nbsp;the squirrel-infested Forest and the trash-filled Wastes. Of course, this will be just a taster, an apertif for what’s in store, which is laid out by the following blurb:</p>
<p><em>Super Meat Boy 3D is a brutal platformer that sees you guide a cube of meat on a mission to rescue his bandage-made girlfriend from an evil fetus in a tuxedo jar—IN 3D! You’ll wall-jump past buzz saws, crumbling caves, and flaming forests, dying a million times along the way—IN (you guessed it) 3D. With old-school difficulty, twitchy reflexes, epic bosses, and loads of secrets, it’s Meat Boy like never before—IN (say it with me!) 3D!</em></p>
<p>Yup, there’s boss fights in this one.</p>

<p>If you don’t have a PC, or want to save the experience for later, hopefully you won’t have to wait too long. Super Meat Boy 3D coming in early 2026 to Xbox Series X|S, PS5 and PC, and coming day one to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <guid>1380250</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>represents a real experiment for developer FromSoftware, leaving behind the traditional Soulslike trappings in favor of a more self-contained, run-based gameplay loop.</p><p>Despite its departure from what fans of this genre are used to, <em>Nightreign </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69736224-ca37-469c-8a4b-6afcb8284048" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">done pretty well for itself in the sales department</a>. It should come as no surprise, then, that a DLC expansion, <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, has darkened its imposing, slow-to-open doors.</p><p><em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>adds two whole new Nightlords with which to do battle, as well as a host of returning bosses from previous <em>Souls </em>titles (and <em>Elden Ring </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bfae054-41fd-4b3a-9ec6-070cc0be1a83" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">itself</a>, of course), new enemies, and two new characters to get to grips with as well. It's a solid DLC that packs some meaty challenge, but it's not without its flaws.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Did you like <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>? Well, here's more of it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To put it simply, despite the experimental nature of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>itself, you shouldn't expect anything too crazy and different from <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>.</p><p>This isn't a <em>Prey: Mooncrash </em>situation, in which the DLC completely transforms the nature of the base game; rather, it's an additional chunk of <em>Nightreign </em>for those who loved their time in Limveld.</p><p>Depending on what you wanted from <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, that may either come as a relief or an unpleasant surprise. For me, it was the former; I rather liked <em>Nightreign</em>, so I was glad for an excuse to be put back under its weird, wonderful spell.</p><p>This DLC's signature feature is its new Shifting Earth condition, which essentially transforms Limveld into a crystal-strewn underground paradise filled with treacherous chasms and precarious bridges.</p><p>It feels like an entirely new map, and when you first head into it, you can expect more than your fair share of confusion and untimely death as you learn its layout and its most optimal routes.</p><p>That's nothing new for <em>Nightreign</em>; although this new map can be a touch more punishing than Limveld proper, it's still just a matter of spending time with <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> until you're familiar with the area's contours and pitfalls.</p><p>Just like <em>Nightreign </em>itself, I'd very strongly recommend taking two friends with you into this DLC rather than relying on the kindness of strangers.</p><p><em>Nightreign </em>feels like it's built for groups who can communicate beyond the rather limited ping system; there's no built-in voice chat, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' intricate map and brutal boss fights (more on which in a moment) demand co-ordination.</p><h2>Boy Howdy, <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>Sure Is Hard</h2><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>I will never forget you, Mohglester.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The base <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>experience was no slouch in the difficulty department, and <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>ratchets things up to a degree that might test your limits if you found <em>Nightreign </em>itself a challenge.</p><p>The two new Nightlords are fun, engaging additions to <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss canon; one is a group encounter that requires careful observation and management of multiple enemies, while the other is a classic, straightforward Soulslike battle with a fearsome, unpredictable foe.</p><p>They're tough, and they can test unprepared builds, but things really come to a head in the closing battles of each night prior to facing the Nightlords.</p><p>They contain some of <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s most terrifyingly difficult fights, and if you're unprepared, you might find yourself scuppered. Expect to be thwarted at the end of day two more often than you're beaten by the Nightlords themselves.</p><p>That's fine in <em>Elden Ring </em>itself - or, indeed, any Soulslike with a liberal checkpoint system - but <em>Nightreign</em>'s boss run is essentially two entire in-game day cycles of exploring Limveld, so it can feel frustrating to fall at the final hurdle, knowing you'll have to repeat everything that's come before just for a chance to try again.</p><p>This is another reason you're going to want Nightfarers whom you trust by your side. Limveld isn't playing around, and players who don't know <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>' encounters can quickly be overwhelmed by its punishing difficulty.</p><h2>There Isn't Quite Enough in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>Be prepared to see a lot of these guys.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Of course, punishing difficulty and bosses that reward careful observation and planning are part and parcel of the Soulslike experience, so even though <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>pushes things just a tad too far, it's still got some worthy additions to FromSoftware's boss canon.</p><p>The problem is that there just aren't quite enough of them. I counted eight new end-of-night bosses, all of whom return from either the original <em>Elden Ring</em>, its DLC, or a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-souls-iii" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="668e9b25-a2a4-4068-948b-f4cadb234f16" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dark Souls </em>title</a> (or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-souls-iii-ringed-city-dlc-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9443ea1d-c1c8-4ffe-b9e9-889600c1099e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">associated DLC</a> thereof).</p><p>That might sound like a lot at first, but things quickly get repetitive, and it wasn't long before I was sighing in disappointment at the same encounter being laid before me for the sixth or seventh time in a row.</p><p>I have no knowledge of the technical side of things, but I can't imagine it would have been too much work to throw a few more <em>Elden Ring </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>bosses into this DLC, and it would have gone a long way towards alleviating the repetition.</p><p>There are also no new weapons on offer, which feels like a bizarre and unfortunate oversight. Creating new builds and finding fun synergies was a big part of <em>Nightreign</em>, so the fact that there's no new red meat for the crazy theorycrafters is a shame.</p><p>Two new characters are available to play in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, and for me, one was significantly more interesting than the other.</p><p>The Undertaker is...well, she's fine. Perhaps I haven't grasped the nuances of the play style yet, but she prioritizes aggression and damage, which is okay. She's a perfectly acceptable addition to <em>Nightreign</em>'s roster, but I didn't find her particularly interesting.</p><p>However, the Scholar is a much more intriguing prospect. He's a support strategist, a role that none of <em>Nightreign</em>'s other classes fulfil, and his abilities are powerful for a co-ordinated party that knows what it's doing.</p><p>Neither of these characters is quite enough to stave off <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>feeling samey after a while, and they won't transform the game completely, but they're a fun enough diversion.</p><h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>There is new stuff to see in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>...just not quite enough of it.</figcaption>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows </em>is a worthwhile addition to the base game.&nbsp;</p><p>Its new bosses are fun, its underground crystal area is atmospheric (if daunting), and hey, it's an excuse to head back into the excellent <em>Nightreign </em>itself.&nbsp;</p><p>I just wish there was more of it, because repetition sets in far more quickly than I'd have liked. More weapons, a few more bosses, and perhaps one more Nightlord would have made this a must-play.&nbsp;</p><p>As it is, if you loved <em>Nightreign</em>, check this out, but if you're hoping for a <em>Mooncrash </em>or <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>-style revelation, you're better off sleeping through this particular night.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 14 hours of gameplay.

            <p>Rockstar has released another statement regarding its controversial dismissal of 34 employees across the UK and Canada, who also happened to be union members.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Rockstar was accused of union busting</a> after it fired staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. Soon after, the company claimed the affected staff were let go due to gross misconduct, but this didn't appease UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB). The organisation swiftly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> following the dismissals, again noting that all those affected were members of a union.</p>

<p>Rockstar has now doubled down on its defence, stating that unions and any union related activities were not a factor in its decision to dismiss staff. </p>
<p>Rather, Rockstar claims its former employees "distributed and discussed" confidential studio information regarding game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in a public forum, which breached "company policy and their legal obligations".</p>
<p>You can read Rockstar's full statement, as shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations.</p>
<p>"Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p></blockquote>
<p>A previous report suggested <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">internal company messages were being discussed on a Discord server shared privately between staff and union workers</a>, rather than on a public forum.</p>
<p>In the last month, protests have taken place both in the UK and abroad in support of the fired Rockstar staff.</p>

<p>Rockstar's latest statement on the matter comes just one day after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-developer-rockstars-firing-of-union-staff-deeply-concerning-says-uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer">UK prime minister Keir Starmer called the firing of Rockstar's employees "deeply concerning"</a>. The PM added that ministers would be looking further into these dismissals.</p>
<p>"Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union," Starmer said.</p>
<p>This was the second time in the last month Rockstar has come up in parliament. Back in mid- November, the issue was raised by Christine Jardine, Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Edinburgh West.</p>
<p>"Video game giant Rockstar has sacked more than 30 workers across the UK, including my constituents working at their Edinburgh office," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Jardine said at the time</a>. "I urged Ministers to support workers who have lost their jobs, and stop this from happening again."</p>

              <p><em>Supergirl</em> is out next summer and we finally have our first official trailer. It’s still just a “teaser,” so lots about the upcoming DC movie is still unknown, but it nevertheless sets the stage for what to expect from the next chapter in <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-post-credits-james-gunn-dcu-marvel-supergirl-1851786204">James Gunn’s new comic book universe</a>. It also includes a great quote that deftly sums up the difference between Kara and Clark.</p> <p>“He sees the goodness in everyone, I see the truth,” Supergirl says when asked what distinguishes her <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">from the Man of Steel</a>. It puts the perfect period on a teaser for what feels, on the surface, like DC’s take on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> but is actually playing with some very different ideas. Out in theaters on June 26, 2026, the movie will start with Supergirl off-planet celebrating her 23rd birthday with Krypto. But she eventually takes a break from drinking her trauma away to help a mysterious woman named Ruthye Marye Knoll on her quest for revenge.</p>

  <p>The events of the movie are based on the limited series <i>Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow</i> from a few years back by writer Tom King and artist Bilquis Evely. Largely praised at the time, it dives into Supergirl’s past and details an origin story in which Kara and her family initially survive Krypton’s destruction in Argo City thanks to a special shield, only for remnants of the planetary collapse to eventually lead to the slow death of the remaining inhabitants due to radiation poisoning.</p>

 <p>It contrasts with the backstory of Superman, who lost his original family but never directly experienced the cataclysmic event that took them. It was a single event rather than a slow death. Whatever the precise version of events for Supergirl in the film, the trailer is clearly setting up the reasons why Kara’s a nihilistic drunk unlike her endlessly hopeful and idealistic cousin.</p>

 <h2>Yes that’s a split-second look at Jason Momoa as Lobo</h2> <p>We don’t get much else in the initial teaser, though we do catch a glimpse of Krem of the Yellow Hills, the person Ruthye Marye Knoll is hunting for revenge, and Lobo, though the latter’s face is only visible for a few frames. Jason Momoa certainly looks the part but we’ll see if he can play DC’s chaotic alien biker bad boy with the right balance of loud machismo and unhinged charisma or if he’ll just be Aquaman again.</p> <p>Visually, the movie looks kind of bland. Look, the trailer is only two minutes, but there’s a lot of vaguely sci-fi junkyard ruins and grey-brown space rocks here. The kinds of motifs that helped give <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> a sense of clear identity don’t seem to be here, at least not at first glance. We’ll see if that identity comes through more in future trailers. Hopefully, the story that director Craig Gillespie and script writer Ana Nogueira are telling here can deliver something that feels fresh and compelling either way.</p>

                <p>Rockstar Games has released a new statement regarding the situation surrounding the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862"> fired workers in the UK and internationally</a>, once again claiming the 30+ staffers were let go not because they were trying to form a union, but because they were breaching company policy.</p><p>Specifically, Rockstar Games told GameSpot that the action was taken against the workers because they were discussing "specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles" and other "confidential information" in a public forum. </p><p>Rockstar said this was "in breach of company policy and their legal obligations."</p><p>The fired staffers and a union seeking to represent them said the Rockstar workers were fired for their efforts to establish a union. Rockstar pushed back, telling GameSpot, "Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading."</p><p>This is what Rockstar has been saying since the firings happened in October. At the time the action came to light, Rockstar said the workers were let go <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">"for gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</a> In November, Rockstar the firings were in "no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities."</p><p>A spokesperson for the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said the affected staffers were involved in unionizing efforts and said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-dev-says-it-fired-workers-for-leaking-secrets-not-for-trying-to-unionize/1100-6535987/" data-ref-id="1100-6535987">Rockstar is guilty of</a> "one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union-busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rockstar-accused-of-deflecting-after-claiming-fired-union-workers-leaked-information?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IWGB told Game Developer</a> that Rockstar developers in the UK have a "statutory right to engage in private conversation with union organizers that supersedes any employment contract."</p><p>IWGB president Alex Marshall said Rockstar's management are "showing they don't care about delays to GTA 6, and that they're prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game."</p><p>The situation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-kingdoms-ministers-will-look-into-rockstars-dev-firings-says-prime-minister/1100-6536840/" data-ref-id="1100-6536840">escalated all the way to the UK Prime Minister</a>. Keir Starmer recently said it was a "deeply concerning case," making the point that every worker has the right to join a union. He added, "We're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union."</p><p>A subsequent report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-details-emerge-about-fired-rockstar-devs-and-the-messages-they-shared/1100-6536482/" data-ref-id="1100-6536482">Rockstar fired the devs over messages on Discord</a> about the company's revised internal Slack policies.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-game-awards-2025-polymarket-kalshi-gambling/</link>
            <guid>1380208</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>If you’re prone to scrolling for a frankly unhealthy number of hours per day, you might have recently seen a couple names pop up with borderline-bizarre frequency: <a href="https://polymarket.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Polymarket</u></a> and <a href="https://kalshi.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kalshi</u></a>. These sites bill themselves as “prediction markets,” but the activity they center around is, on no uncertain terms, gambling. Polymarket and Kalshi shroud this in marketspeak, allowing people to buy up yes/no “contracts” on real-world events and adopting a peer-to-peer approach instead of heralding down edicts about house odds, with prices instead set by trades a la financial markets. But the sites still take a cut of transactions, and people are still, in aggregate, betting millions.&nbsp;</p><p>Polymarket and Kalshi let users place cash or crypto wagers on just about anything. For example, as of this writing, Polymarket’s trending tab included Time’s 2025 person of the year, a bunch of different sports matches, Netflix’s proposed acquisition of WB, Elon Musk’s tweets, Trump’s release of the Epstein files, and most grimly of all, whether or not the US will sink another oil ship associated with Venezuela.&nbsp;</p><p>Polymarket – which was <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8478-22?ref=aftermath.site#:~:text=The%2520Commodity%2520Futures%2520Trading%2520Commission%2520(CFTC)%2520has,from%2520violating%2520the%2520CEA%2520and%2520CFTC%2520regulations"><u>banned in the US back in 2022</u></a> after the Commodity Futures Trading Commission found it was offering betting contracts without the agency’s approval, only for the agency to drop its investigation this year and give the site a regulatory thumbs up – even allowed users to bet on whether it would go live in the US this year. Odds prior to its rollout this month were at 99 percent, <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/12/04/polymarket-announces-return-to-the-u-s/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>according to Fortune</u></a>. Kalshi, meanwhile, has managed to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/10/sports-betting-kalshi-cftc/684689/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>circumvent states’ laws</u></a> against sports betting due to its financial market status, though Nevada recently <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2f07aed7-58b0-45d3-87d4-c3c883a616fa?ref=aftermath.site"><u>closed that loophole</u></a>, and Massachusetts <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/massachusetts-seeks-block-kalshi-operating-sports-prediction-market-2025-12-09/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>may soon follow suit</u></a>.</p><p>While obvious offshoots of the sports gambling craze that has swept the nation <a href="https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/23501236/supreme-court-strikes-federal-law-prohibiting-sports-gambling?ref=aftermath.site"><u>in recent years</u></a> – promising impoverished citizens a last-ditch means of getting out of debt while actually just miring them in more – Polymarket and Kalshi have recognized that their fortunes are tied to news. The two have approached this in different ways. Kalshi recently struck deals with both CNN and CNBC to integrate its prediction data across the networks’ programming. In <a href="https://news.kalshi.com/p/kalshi-cnn-prediction-market-partnership?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a press release</u></a>, Kalshi cited the fact that it "recently called the NYC Mayoral election eight minutes after polls closed, hours before the media" as evidence that this is good for news and society, actually, and not yet another rotten seed that will eventually sprout an ill-gotten money tree. Also, the system is easily gamed, as <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2025/12/cnn-kalshi-election-polling-prediction-betting-market-harry-enten.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Slate recently pointed out</u></a>:</p><blockquote>If a Republican political firm wanted to buy $50,000 in contracts on the GOP to win the House, that purchase alone could move the price — and thus the implied odds — significantly. If a Republican political consultant wanted to buy $100,000 worth of contracts on the GOP to hold the House, they could materially move the price and thus the implied odds. With CNN providing free media coverage of the party’s improving chances, wouldn’t that be a compelling alternative to simply buying some commercial time? Are you starting to see the problem with a major news channel using an opaque tool of financial speculation to sum up conventional wisdom about an election?&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Polymarket, on the other hand, has favored a more digital-first approach, striking <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/06/x-names-polymarket-as-its-official-prediction-market-partner/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a deal with Twitter</u></a> to become the platform’s official prediction partner and going all-in on news aggregation with both its <a href="https://x.com/Polymarket?ref=aftermath.site"><u>official account</u></a> (which has over 800,000 followers) and offshoots, including <a href="https://x.com/NewsWire_US?ref=aftermath.site"><u>NewsWire US</u></a>, a separate aggregator it recently purchased. Both Polymarket and Kalshi have also partnered with various influencers, some <a href="https://archive.is/FNk5V?ref=aftermath.site"><u>laughably disreputable</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All this in mind, you will not be surprised to learn that Polymarket and Kalshi both have pages for multiple video game award shows, most prominent among them last weekend’s Streamer Awards and today’s Game Awards. Polymarket’s Streamer Awards <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/the-streamer-awards-streamer-of-the-year?ref=aftermath.site"><u>streamer of the year category</u></a> commanded a total trading volume of $24,169 – an impressive sum until you consider The Game Awards’ <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025?ref=aftermath.site"><u>game of the year category</u></a>, on which users have wagered nearly $40 million. Kalshi users, meanwhile, have wagered <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxstrmrsoty/streamer-of-the-year/kxstrmrsoty-25?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$218,771</u></a> and <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxgameawards/game-awards?ref=aftermath.site"><u>$3 million</u></a>, respectively, on the same award categories. Both sites feature additional pages for other award categories, as well as things hosts might say.</p><p>When The Streamer Awards’ host, popular Twitch streamer QTCinderella, caught wind of her event’s Polymarket pages, she was furious.</p><p>“I would like to make this very clear: I am in no way associated with that website, and I am in no way condoning that website,” she said <a href="https://x.com/Awk20000/status/1995706110121254943?ref=aftermath.site"><u>during a stream</u></a> earlier this month in response to a viewer who accused her of supposed “insider trading.” “I have no association with them. I do not. In fact, my lawyers are talking to their lawyers because I am not happy about that.”</p><p>She added that her IP was being used without her consent and that her lawyers sent the site a cease and desist letter. As of this writing, however, Polymarket’s Streamer Awards pages remain accessible – as do Kalshi’s – even though the event has since concluded.</p><p>Aftermath reached out to QTCinderella and Polymarket for more information but did not receive a reply.</p><p>The Game Awards’ stance on prediction markets is unclear. Aftermath reached out to the organization to ask if Polymarket and/or Kalshi have received Geoff Keighley’s world exclusive seal of approval, but did not receive a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>Kalshi does not even consider The Game Awards to be that big of a deal, in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>“That is a… decent number,” Kalshi rep Jack Such <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-of-the-year-goty-gambling-prediction-markets-kalshi-polymarket/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>told Polygon</u></a> about The Game Awards’ market. “It’s OK. But some markets have hundreds of millions.”</p><p>While Such claimed that individual pages are tended to by a dedicated market team because “every market you see on Kalshi requires a pretty extensive legal contract,” it’s hard to imagine that any specific page registers as more than a temporary blip on Kalshi or Polymarket’s radar. After all, they make their money in aggregate. That’s why it behooves both companies to, as Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kalshi-ceo-says-he-wants-to-monetize-any-difference-in-opinion-2000695320?ref=aftermath.site"><u>recently said</u></a>, “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion.”</p><p>Somehow, what that actually entails is even more sinister than it sounds.</p><p>"It's part of a larger trend in Silicon Valley to insert themselves into the cracks of modern society,” Ryan Broderick of <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Garbage Day</u></a> said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSBNZb2CdBb/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a recent video</u></a>. “Everything that's bad about the world, they don't want to fix it. What they want to do is figure out a way to become a middle man in that system to offer a crappier version of what we already used to do."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/adventure-gamers-online-casino-gambling-website-sale-parasite-seo/"><div><p>Adventure Games, Poker And Casinos Do Not ‘Overlap’, You Weirdos - Aftermath</p><p>No normal person could type ‘Recognizing the growing convergence between gaming and gambling’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

<p>The leak came courtesy of a Reddit post on the Tomb Raider subreddit, where images of both a remake, titled ‘Tomb Raider Legacy of Atlantis,’ and a new mainline game called ‘Tomb Raider Catalyst’ were posted from what appears to be Amazon Games listings. You can see both images below:</p>

<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy has been one of the biggest gaming stories of 2025. New developments have slowly trickled out about the firing of 34 Rockstar employees, but now the company itself has officially addressed the real reason that led to the action.</p>



<p>On November 24, Insider Gaming reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaked-discord-messages-reveal-why-rockstar-fired-34-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked Discord messages revealing why Rockstar fired 34 employees</a>. Now, Rockstar Games has officially given its side of the story, and the reasons are very interesting.</p>







<h2 id="h-rockstar-games-claims-employees-discussed-features-from-unannounced-games">Rockstar Games Claims Employees Discussed Features From Unannounced Games</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Does this change things? Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>







<p>Rockstar Games has given <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> a statement, voicing its own take on the employee firings scandal, which led to protests:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The only official title in development (that everyone knows about) at Rockstar Games right now is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-reveal-trailer-is-already-two-years-old/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. This will inevitably raise speculation about other games being worked on behind the scenes. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-4-remaster-former-rockstar-dev-niko-bellic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 4 remaster</a> has been discussed for the longest time, and you’d have to think <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Dead Redemption 3</a> is inevitable.</p>



<p>This statement comes less than 24 hours after UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer declared that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-will-be-investigated-uk-prime-minister-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar will be investigated</a> due to a breach of union rights.</p>



<p>The Rockstar Games firing controversy looks to be far from over. Rockstar was hit with a legal claim shortly after the firings, and UK government action will only push the controversy further under the microscope. As always, Insider Gaming will continue to report on new evidence and developments in the ongoing case.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Guns and blades.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, the great holiday shopping deals would end after Cyber Monday. That is apparently no longer true. Case in point: today only, Best Buy is offering the console versions of Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for under $40 each. Specifically, <strong>you can get the PS5 or Xbox</strong> version of <strong>AC Shadows </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPVL6j?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $34.99</strong></a>, and <strong>Black Ops 7 </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/zEJLpo?object_uuid=5cde1036-b3aa-4021-86f6-ad86ad038773&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>for $39.99</strong></a>. Both deals go away at midnight, so grab them fast if you want them.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Today's Best Game Deals</h2><div id="233605" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 SteelBook Cross-Gen Bundle Edition</h3></p></div><div catalogid="c826a57c-825a-4266-a8c1-bfbe6ffbfce2" id="233606"><div id="233606" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Black Ops 7 deal is particularly good, because it’s on the steelbook cross-gen bundle editions of the game. That means you get a free steelbook case for the game with your purchase. And regardless of whether you buy the PS4 or PS5 version, it’ll work on both systems natively. The same is true of the Xbox version, with the Xbox One and Xbox Series X.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike most similar sales we’ve seen recently, no other retailer is matching the prices, meaning they’re exclusive to Best Buy. These are by far the best deals we’ve seen so far on both of these 2025 games. In other words, I wouldn’t expect to see either game drop to a lower price this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real question, of course, is whether the games are any good. If we’re talking about Assassin’s Cree Shadows, the answer is yes, absolutely. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-review">8/10 review</a>, critic Jarrett Green wrote, “Assassin’s Creed Shadows takes a flashing blade to the series’ established norms, trimming them to a more precise form in lieu of chopping them down outright. Combat is aggressive and requires more intentional parrying and skill management than in the past, and exploring the gorgeous provinces of Sengoku-period Japan is encouraged thanks to the revamped map that deemphasizes collecting icons and checking off lists.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, the answer is a little more complicated. While the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">campaign</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-zombies-review">Zombies</a> modes are a little lackluster, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> remains strong. In our review of the latter mode, critic Seth Macy wrote, “Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s multiplayer is a great time. The first crop of maps are excellent, taking into consideration the new wall run and wall jump mechanics and how that extra dimension of movement adds so much to the fun. The weapons are all solid with the exception of the SMGs, and even though none have really captured my imagination, they're fun to use and fun to grind.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both of these deals are absolutely killer for games this new, as emphasized by the fact that even Amazon isn’t price matching them. But the sale ends at midnight, so pick up whichever one you want (or both) before the deep discount goes away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <guid>1380175</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have issued a lengthy statement after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">the <u>Battlefield 6</u></a> Winter Offensive 1.1.3.0 update saw players reporting widespread issues related to the main menu UI, gameplay stuttering, Breakthrough, and much, much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The message, posted both to Battlefield <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1999147496069628313?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>social media accounts</u></a> and the FPS franchise’s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-winter-offensive-launch-and-player-feedback" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>, functions both as an explanation and a game plan. BF Studios says hotfixes and updates will now roll out in the coming days as it attempts to iron out the numerous kinks that started making waves in the Battlefield 6 community earlier this week.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Surprise Attack</h2><blockquote data-theme="light">— CAMIKAZE78 (@CAMIKAZE78) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAMIKAZE78/status/1998371829963280511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Winter Offensive was originally positioned to bring wintery new content hand-in-hand with audio fixes, more reliable hit registration, and balance tweaks as BF Studios continues to flesh out the new Battlefield game’s first season. However, as update 1.1.3.0 made its way to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S Tuesday, players were instead met with an army of technical hurdles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clunky main menu navigation and trouble registering hits on firing range targets were two of the more annoying issues being shared around online. One problem that actually impacted moment-to-moment multiplayer gameplay for many, though, involved micro stuttering that saw players freezing in place as they ran into battle. Another, more bizarre result of the new update had to do with what <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pikb79/stealth_movement_nerf_with_todays_patch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many believed was a stealth nerf to movement</a>, which, despite being applauded by some, has since been reverted and labeled as “<a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1998788825456226525?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>unexpected behavior</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It kind of feels like there's an absolute deadline schedule by which point stuff comes out no matter what," one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1piepe5/comment/nt5mx3f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user commented</a> shortly after the update went live. "I know DICE always had this 'fix X, break Y' modus operandi that's amusingly consistent amongst generations of people who worked there but so far every update has been literally that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The occasional hiccup aside, BF Studios has been steadily moving through Battlefield 6 Season 1, but it feels like that momentum has come to a halt with Winter Offensive. Even if the stop is only temporary, the update’s launch marks a moment of uncertainty for fans as they await Season 2 and as the holidays rush in. Winter Offensive has proven to be so problematic, in fact, that Battlefield REDSEC, the Battlefield 6 battle royale offshoot experience, had its Elite Series <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1998882936569905156?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postponed</a> due to “unforeseen technical issues.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to be upfront: this is on us,” the Battlefield team said yesterday.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is absolutely unplayable after the patch<br>Well done <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@battlefield</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/EA_DICE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@EA_DICE</a> <a href="https://t.co/U5rF4gaDWt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U5rF4gaDWt</a></p>— DANNYonPC (@DANNYonPC) <a href="https://twitter.com/DANNYonPC/status/1998441358604865699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote> <h2 data-cy="title2">Calling for Backup</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios wants Battlefield 6 players to rest easy knowing that, if these issues haven’t already been fixed, they will be fixed soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to give you a clear status update on the issues we are tracking, the work already completed, and our near-term and future plans,” today’s statement says. “The team has been reviewing all reports since the update, including items related to Breakthrough, the Firing Range, Portal, the Main Menu, and performance topics such as micro-stuttering on PC, along with several other issues raised by the community.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Technical difficulties related to incorrect ticket sizes for Conquest, daily challenge rewards, infantry momentum, and battle pass tier skipping have already been resolved. More thorough hotfixes are now scheduled to begin tomorrow, December 12, starting with fixes for micro stuttering, main menu navigation, and the firing range for PC via Steam players. PS5 and Xbox players will benefit from their own update come December 15, which should bring an end to issues for the main menu and firing range.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stat tracking, especially pertaining to bot kills, is another issue that’s persisted through recent weeks that BF Studios plans to address soon, with rubber banding related to minimum spec PCs also set to be addressed. Perhaps the most heavily criticized aspects of Winter Offensive, though, were the changes to Breakthrough and vehicle placements announced via the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-1130-patch-notes-detail-audio-improvements-and-map-changes-coming-with-season-1-winter-offensive"><u>update 1.1.3.0 patch notes</u></a> last week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says it’s heard the complaints related to how the update may have made victory too easy for the attacking team, specifically calling attention to concerns about objective placement, vehicle spawns, and attacker momentum. The developers explain that some fixes in this regard, specifically pertaining to vehicle spawning, have already been published, but stops short of walking players through how or when it plans to address these concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Your feedback continues to guide the direction of our Breakthrough improvements, and we will share more as future adjustments take shape,” the message adds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More tweaks to vehicles should help the overall Battlefield 6 experience, too, with BF Studios saying it’s implemented updated vehicle damage zones, fixed hit registration for vehicle-mounted machine guns, and adjusted some maps for better pacing during matches. Finally, those who enjoy flying jets should know that air-to-air combat is set to receive some adjustments, including reduced jet canon damage, early next year, with a dedicated air radar planned to launch after Season 1.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We will continue validating the resolutions already in development, gathering additional data from your reports, and prioritizing remaining issues based on severity and player impact,” BF Studios adds. “Several items have already been resolved, or will be through our upcoming hotfixes. More improvements are planned in upcoming updates.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S. It’s been on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-devs-leave-wicked-grin-skin-almost-unrecognizable-after-community-calls-out-bright-colors">a bit of a rollercoaster</a> ever since, as players have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-just-had-the-best-month-of-sales-in-the-us-of-any-game-in-the-last-three-years">logged on</a> to both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-won-battlefield-6-fans-rejoice-as-ea-tones-down-bright-colors-on-monster-energy-skin">praise</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rascals-battlefield-6-players-torn-as-323-pack-puts-a-high-price-on-grounded-skins">criticize</a> everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more">map sizes</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-update-quickly-fixes-defibrillators-after-support-players-report-strict-revive-requirements">balance changes</a>.

                <p>The wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> has been long, and fans are eager for any sign of progress--and don't expect any sort of announcement this holiday season. However, that excitement only grew when Bethesda released a live-action comedy trailer to celebrate <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrim-is-now-on-yet-another-platform-but-theres-a-way-to-upgrade-for-free/1100-6536793/1100-65360/" data-ref-id="1100-6536793">Skyrim's sudden launch on the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. The trailer features a mischievous Santa and two elves, and at first glance, it seems like simple holiday fun. But the numbers shown on the elves' character screen quickly caught the community's attention.</p><p>The reason: One elf's speech skill jumps to 27, while their overall level is shown moving toward 20. Some fans believe these numbers are a deliberate hint that The Elder Scrolls 6 is planned for 2027. Supporters of the theory argue that the numbers are too specific to be random, while others think people may be reading too much into a random number. Still, because Bethesda rarely shares direct updates about the game, even small details like this can spark big debates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxhOQsSj6E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nHxhOQsSj6E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This honestly might be the best piece of evidence we have for a release date," one fan said. "Those are very specific numbers, and I don't think they would use those numbers by accident."</p><p>There's good reason for both curiosity and caution. Bethesda leaders, including Todd Howard, have repeatedly said the game is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/1100-6536089/" data-ref-id="1100-6536089">"a long way off,"</a> even though it was first announced back in 2018. The studio has confirmed that early development began in 2023 and that playtesting is now underway, but no release window has been announced. Fans feel the long gap more sharply because Skyrim's re-releases kept the series in the spotlight while the next main entry remained out of reach.</p><p>Howard has admitted the wait has been unusually long, though he says the team needed a creative break and wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starfield/">build Starfield first</a>. He's also expressed interest in surprising fans with a sudden release, similar to the shadow-dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">Oblivion Remastered in 2025</a>. Whether or not the numbers in the Switch 2 trailer actually point to 2027, anticipation for The Elder Scrolls 6 is only growing.</p><p>Bethesda might have its hands full going into 2026 with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyrims-switch-2-port-has-a-bit-of-a-performance-issue/1100-6536879/" data-ref-id="1100-6536879">Switch 2 port marred with lag issues</a> and the Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition still awaiting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime</a> is nearly here, so it’s time to get ready. And what better way to get caught up on what happened in the popular adaptation of Bethesda’s RPG franchise than by watching Amazon’s official season one recap? I mean, it’s not like they would use AI tools to create it and fill it with inaccurate information. Right?</p> <p>Wrong. That’s exactly what Amazon did. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/the-official-fallout-season-1-recap-is-filled-with-ai-and-thinks-the-show-is-set-in-the-1950s/">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, a newly uploaded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-2/dp/B0FLSZBRZJ?tag=kotaku01-20" rel="false"><em>Fallout</em> recap on the show’s official Amazon Prime page</a> appears to use a monotone AI-generated voice to narrate over clips from the show’s inaugural season. It sounds horrible and makes it hard to actually consume the information being delivered. But that might be a good thing because some of what the robot voice spits out is completely bullshit. Just straight up inaccurate.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652683">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For example, at multiple points in the short recap, the AI-generated voice claims that the flashbacks seen in the show take place in the 1950s. That’s wrong. Those flashbacks featuring pre-ghoulified Cooper Howard take place around 2077. Specifically, the flashback showing the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War">nukes falling on America takes place on October 23, 2077</a>.</p>

 <p>The recap also claims that Lucy goes with the Ghoul at the end of the <em>Fallout</em> season finale because she has to choose between life and death. Wrong again, you dumb robot. She actually goes because she wants to track down her father and learn the truth. Something the Ghoul is interested in, too.</p> <p>There are probably other inaccuracies in this horrible, shitty recap, but whatever, I’m going to waste as little time on this as possible, as it seems Amazon doesn’t care enough about one of its biggest TV shows to simply put out an accurate, human-created two-minute recap. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">This isn’t the first time Amazon Prime has upset people by using generative AI</a> to produce worthless slop, and I doubt it will be the last, as every big tech company invests more and more into something very few people seem to want or like.</p> <p>Anyway,<em> Fallout</em> season two arrives exclusively on Amazon Prime on December 17.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/" data-ref-id="2900-5031">US's top-selling games of the year</a>. But it looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-to-change-release-strategy-for-call-of-duty-franchise-as-new-data-suggests-player-count-has-halved-in-12-months" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline.</p><p>Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam.</p><p>"The data points to a foundational engagement challenge for Black Ops 7," reads a statement from Video Game Insights. "Whether the cause lies in franchise fatigue, shifting genre preferences, competition from other titles, or a misalignment with player expectations, the early indicators are clear: this is not a normal launch-cycle fluctuation. It is a significant departure from historical performance."</p><p>Earlier this week, Activision itself acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. That was soon followed by an announcement from Microsoft that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call Of Duty was 2025's top franchise on Game Pass</a>. Both of those things can be true, but it remains to be seen whether the decline in standalone sales is being made offset by Game Pass or other factors.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision haven't shared their Call of Duty plans for 2026 yet. The one thing we do know from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's recent dispatch</a> is that there won't be any more Modern Warfare or Black Ops sequels dropping in consecutive years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Digital Audio Player Renewed My Love Of Music]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Quitting Spotify might have almost beaten Luke, but I’ve fared a little better thanks to my brand new digital audio player</p><p>Before there was the iPod, there was the cheap MP3 player. I remember these devices from my teenagerhood. Small and with barely a UI to speak of, they had robust storage and could hold hundreds upon hundreds of songs. Of course, the design improvements of the iPod would put all these also-rans out of business—it turns out that being able to access any song on your device within three clicks of that scroll wheel was an incredible boon for those of us with huge music libraries. From there the chain of history is easy to link together. The iPod leads to the iPhone leading to no one ever needing to have a standalone music playing device because they’re all subscribing to services like Spotify.</p><p>Because I have a lot of friends who are working musicians, I have absolutely <a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"><u>no love for Spotify</u></a>. They pay artists peanuts and they also make the music sound like shit due all the compression necessary for streaming audio to your device over the internet. I listen to tons of music, and have especially been interested in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-erang-tome-zero-fantasy/"><u>dungeon synth</u></a> scene, a very small scene of very small artists. While almost all the music I want is available streaming, I’d rather buy the music on Bandcamp, knowing that a higher percentage of my money goes to the artist—especially from artists who I know won’t make much money from streaming.</p><p>Up until I bought a Digital Audio Player, those Bandcamp purchases were largely theoretical. Sure, I’d bought the album, but I never downloaded the audio files, instead opting to listen to my music either on the Bandcamp app or on Tidal. Because Tidal also offers its listeners basically all music ever recorded in human history, that meant I wasn’t listening to the music I bought. A digital audio player forces my hand—and I’ve found that I genuinely enjoy this experience of listening to music a lot more.</p><p>While there is a fascinating world of people buying and refurbishing old iPods, when I looked at the broad price range and options for the wide variety of DAPs, I wanted to try something new. While I don’t think any device on the market holds a candle to the classic iPod, design-wise, I am extremely happy with my <a href="https://www.fiio.com/echomini?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Snowsky Fiio Echo Mini</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>What attracted me to the Echo Mini was that it doesn’t have any features I didn’t want and also that it is adorable. If you’re looking into the world of DAPs, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by choice. There are extremely expensive DAPs from <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa306-b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>companies like Sony</u></a> that can also access the internet and download apps like the iPod Touch of yesteryear. But I don’t want any of that shit. I don’t even want Bluetooth. I want an object that plays MP3s that I listen to with my new wired in-ear monitors.</p><p>The Echo Mini is shaped like a tape deck and is even smaller than I expected when I grabbed it. For under a hundred dollars, this device can hold more music that I can reasonably listen to, even on my five hour Thanksgiving flight to Los Angeles. Because the Echo Mini has both onboard storage and a slot for a micro SD card, I have 256GB of storage and I’ve barely scratched the surface. The battery life is also remarkable, especially compared to my phone, which was previously my main music listening device. I haven’t had to charge it once since I bought it about a month ago.</p><p>Although the user experience leaves something to be desired—you’re forced to scroll through nested menus with multiple tiny buttons, reminding me of playing a Japanese RPG on the Playstation, complete menu hell—I love using this device. It slips right in my pocket and it frees me from the yoke of always looking for my phone when I’m out and about. Its clunky UI actually forces me to pick an album and stick with it, where having access to the entirety of all recorded music in history often gave me choice paralysis. It’s also revealed that if I make sure I have a couple of my comfort albums—<em>how i’m feeling now, The Downward Spiral</em>, a handful of Talking Heads albums—I don’t actually <em>need</em> to have access to every album ever. I appreciate the albums I have already bought so much more when I don’t have a choice but to listen to them.</p><p>But most of all—the music sounds amazing. I haven’t even dived into the alternate file formats like FLAC, and I’m already hearing new details in songs I’ve listened to over and over. Rosalia’s most recent album <em>LUX</em> sounds fantastic, surrounding me with the lushness of the orchestral compositions. Even pop music sounds a lot fuller. I was listening to the Dev Lemons album <em>Surface Tension</em>, and you can hear intonations from her deep in the mix that I simply cannot hear on streaming services.</p><p>After a month of using a DAP I can envision a future where I totally ditch streaming. Listening to albums purposefully, instead of just through the convenience of having literally everything available at all times, has allowed me to fall back in love with the music I have. I think there should be a little more friction in life, in general, but the friction of needing to actually buy an album was something I didn’t even realize I missed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI developer Rockstar is currently being accused of <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">union-busting by the 34 workers (31 in UK, three in Canada) it fired and the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain)</a>, and after the story reached UK parliament for a second time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">this time with Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaking on it</a>, Rockstar has released a statement reaffirming its previous claims that the fired employees were dismissed for distributing and discussing confidential information, not because they were part of the union.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, Rockstar not only reaffirmed its previous claims but also specified the alleged confidential information more than it did before. When Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">initially claimed the employees were dismissed for gross misconduct regarding the alleged leak of confidential information</a>, it stated the employees were "<em>found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>This time, the new statement specifies that the employees were distributing and discussing confidential information "<em>including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading</em>," the full statement reads.</p>



<p>After Rockstar first made its claim that the employees were leaking confidential information, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a> have not only refuted these claims, but a recent report points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">Rockstar allegedly trying to use employees discussing changing Slack policies in a union-members-only Discord server as the breach of confidential information</a> that got the 34 employees fired.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has also filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on the evidence it is collecting and its accusations of union-busting, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the government would be investigating the accusations in parliament yesterday, December 10, 2025. </p>



<p>It's also worth remembering that Chris Murray, the MP who brought the issue directly to Starmer during yesterday's parliament, also noted that he came to parliament after having spoken to Rockstar, saying that they "<em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting</em>."</p>



<p>IGN's report also includes further statements from Murray, who told IGN that upon his arrival at Rockstar, the studio attempted to force him and fellow MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur to sign an NDA before they could enter the building to discuss the firings. All three MPs made it clear they would not sign, and Rockstar eventually gave way. </p>



<p>"<em>The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed</em>," Murray said. "<em>The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members, I was not assured their process paid  robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remember Google Stadia? Steam finally made its gamepad worth rescuing]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline</link>
            <guid>1380124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>December 31st, 2025 is the deadline to <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">save the Google Stadia controller</a>. That’s less than three weeks from today — but there’s never been a better time. Last month, I discovered the controller is finally a first-class citizen in Steam and SteamOS.</p><p>The Stadia controller was originally designed to connect to your Wi-Fi network and remotely control games from Google’s cloud servers. But when Stadia shut down in January 2023, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561541/google-stadia-shutdown-precedent-editorial">did an amazing job shutting down the service</a>: it offered full hardware refunds and let you rescue the Stadia Controller by turning it into a generic Bluetooth gamepad instead.</p><p>When I flew to Valve headquarters in late October to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">the Steam Machine</a>, I asked Pierre-Loup Griffais if Steam would ever fully support the Stadia controller the way it’s supported so many other gamepads, letting you turn each of its buttons and joysticks into fully customizable control schemes. At the time, he said he thought the Xbox One wireless adapter might be a higher priority than Google’s abandoned controller.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find Steam not only supports the Stadia gamepad now, it’s made every button useful. That Google Assistant key is now a freely programmable M1 macro button! Google’s screenshot button takes screenshots in SteamOS! The Stadia button is now effectively an Xbox button, letting you activate many (not all) of the Steam Deck’s handiest shortcuts, including Stadia+A to pull up the quick access menu, Stadia+Right Stick to summon a mouse cursor, and Stadia+Left Stick to adjust the volume or brightness.</p><p>On a desktop, the Stadia button can additionally launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode.</p><p>It’s certainly not the best gamepad you can buy for Steam. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/678772/8bitdo-controller-gaming-favorites">This one’s currently my fav</a>.) The Stadia Controller never offered gyro or back buttons, and while I see an “Allow this device to wake Steam Deck” option in the SteamOS Bluetooth menu, it doesn’t seem to work properly. The controller also doesn’t automatically shut off when I put the Deck to sleep — I have to hold down the power button every time.</p><p>Also, don’t expect to plug headphones into the pad’s 3.5mm jack — as Google warned years ago when Stadia shut down, that pass-through audio feature isn’t designed to work in Google’s replacement Bluetooth LE mode.</p><p>But if you picked up a Stadia Controller years ago, perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free">even for free</a>, it’s a great secondary gamepad that might even be a good primary device for certain games. It’s got a tight, clicky, and <em>very</em> directional D-pad, smooth sticks and triggers, and responsive face buttons.</p><p>And through December 31st, saving this gamepad is exceptionally easy. You just plug it into a desktop computer, <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">open a browser to Google’s official page</a>, and follow a few minutes worth of instructions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23559284/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-mode-how-to">Here’s our how-to</a> if you want to see what’s involved first. Afterwards, you just hold Stadia+Y to put it in pairing mode, though it can’t remember pairings for more than one device at a time.</p><p>It’s possible that Google will grant another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/11/24319049/psa-youve-got-another-year-to-save-your-google-stadia-gamepad-from-a-wired-only-existence">last-minute reprieve</a> and extend the deadline another year, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I’ve been asking Google PR for over two weeks, but the company hasn’t offered an answer.</p><p>If you know a friend with this gamepad, or see one at your local thrift store for cheap, perhaps it’s time to save it!</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline]]></content:encoded>
