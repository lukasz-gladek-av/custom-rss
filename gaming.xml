			<p>Coming into 2025, you might've thought that the most significant stories surrounding Rockstar would be to do with Grand Theft Auto VI's development, potential (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">and now confirmed</a>) delays, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-animator-seemingly-shared-grand-theft-auto-vi-animations-in-demo-reel/">or just anything else Grand Theft Auto VI related</a>, that's not where we're landing as the year comes to a close. Instead, the most significant story is the accusations of union busting that have been thrown at Rockstar, and the protests taking place by the fired workers and their former colleagues at Rockstar.</p>



<p>Now, for a second time, the matter has come up in the UK's parliament, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">Liberal Democrat member of Parliament, Christine Jardine, being the first to bring it up</a>, and the second being Scottish Labour MP Chris Murray, who directly asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer about the issue. </p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/uk-prime-minister-describes-rockstar-dismissals-as-deeply-concerning">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, Murray, who is the MP for the constituency where Rockstar North is located in Scotland, brought the issue to parliament after having already spoken to Rockstar. Based on the conversation he had, Murray said that the company "<em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting,</em>" which adds fuel to the fired employees' and IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain) union-busting accusations. </p>



<p>Murray then asked Prime Minister Keir Starmer, "<em>Does the Prime Minister agree, all companies, regardless of profit size, must follow UK employment law, and all workers have the right to join a union?</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="🔴 PMQs LIVE: Prime Minister's Questions - 10 December 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5dg5n49OudY?start=1639&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Starmer responded, "<em>Well, it's a deeply concerning case. Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we're determined to strengthen workers' rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and keep him updated.</em>"</p>



<p>This whole saga began last month, with Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">suddenly firing 34 employees and being accused of union-busting in the process</a>. Rockstar first tried to deny the union-busting accusations <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">by claiming the fired developers had leaked confidential information</a>. That claim has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">directly refuted by the IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members at Rockstar</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">The IWGB has issued legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on evidence it is collecting to support its union-busting accusations, and to make matters look even worse for Rockstar, a recent report seems to reveal that the 'confidential information' Rockstar claimed employees were leaking doesn't trace back to a host of GTA VI information. </p>



<p>Instead, it traces back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">a Discord server that was set up nearly four years ago for union members at Rockstar to discuss work conditions and union issues</a>, and the alleged leak was just employees in that server discussing changes to Rockstar's internal Slack policies. </p>



<p>According to the report, it is a private server that can only be accessed by IWGB members, union members at Rockstar, and employees at Rockstar who are interested in joining the union. All members are vetted before they join the server, with the only potential point of issue being that there are reports of employees who have left Rockstar remaining in the server.</p>



<p>It's still unclear as to how this issue will end. As it stands, the fired workers are just asking to be reinstated. There are no egregious requests; they simply want to return to work and help their colleagues see Grand Theft Auto VI across the finish line. Of course, Rockstar could try continuing to ignore the problem and hope it goes away, or if a fine does come down on their heads, pay it with the pocket change that falls out of GTA Online every month.</p>



<p>Hopefully, that's not how things conclude, and we see the fired workers return to work, if not before the end of the year, then sometime soon in 2026. Particularly because, though Rockstar's executives might wish it would, the protests outside the Rockstar and Take-Two offices, and the accusations, do not seem to be stopping anytime soon. In addition, a source speaking to Wccftech told us, in no uncertain terms, that the protests "<em>will not stop</em>" until the fired employees are back to work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve put maybe five or six hours into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, and I spent maybe two of those hours desperately searching for two items: Raichunite X and Raichunite Y. These two Mega Stones would allow Raichu, my favorite Pokémon who has</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span> never gotten any respect</span></a><span>, to Mega Evolve into one of two forms. I had been begging Game Freak for Mega Raichu for so long, I had honestly given up hope that my boy would get a superpowered transformation in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, then they gave him two. I like them both, but I gravitated toward the X form pre-launch, and now that I’ve seen the guy in-game, I’m feeling very vindicated, because my guy is flying around like Superman.</span></p> <p><span>Raichu never got a Mega form when the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, which was just one of the many examples of Game Freak and The Pokémon Company giving my boy the shaft in favor of Pikachu, his much more popular pre-evolution. Pikachu got the Gigantamax kaiju-style transformation in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, as well as exclusive Z-Moves in </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. The only time Raichu’s ever gotten any “love” is when Game Freak turned him into something else entirely by giving him a floating psychic version in the Alola region, and that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>imposter won’t stop following me around</span></a><span> in every game. Now, however, the OG can float around, too, thanks to Mega Evolution.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to the Pokédex, Mega Raichu X is able to float like this because of the electromagnetic repulsion from his two tails. Before we saw him in-game, I imagined this would manifest in Raichu floating with a vertical stance, almost as if he were ascending with his tails pointed toward the ground. This would’ve probably looked silly, but I liked the design enough to let it go. What I wasn’t prepared for was to see that my super-powered mouse friend pulls a Clark Kent and flies with an arm extended like he’s got a city to save. Y’all, I am obsessed.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652249"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652249"><strong>“Cause I’m a punk rocker, yes I am.”</strong> © The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>It’s a fun stylistic choice, but it actually has some pretty important perks in battle, too. Mega Raichu X can fly up to attack targets in the air, letting him knock Mega Shards off the sides of tall buildings and use physical attacks on flying enemies. This is kind of his whole deal. Mega Raichu X is the physical attacker, while the Y form is focused on special attacks. Now that he can fly, no one is out of range of a punch from his chonky paws. Neither Mega Raichu gets a type change after transforming, so while Mega Raichu X doesn’t become an Electric/Flying-type, I’m fairly certain he will gain the Levitate passive ability that makes him immune to Ground-type attacks, though we won’t know until a future game, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t include abilities. If that happens, Mega Raichu X will be one of the few Pokémon without any weaknesses, as Electric’s only weakness is Ground. That would be such a cool perk, and might make this transformation a force to be reckoned with in competitive play in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i></a><span> next year.</span></p> <p><span>Both Mega Raichus have gotten some flak for looking too similar to Pikachu, with X having its pre-evolution’s color scheme and Y maintaining its body shape, but I couldn’t be happier with these two. I like seeing the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-x-y-gorochu-scrapped-2000652133"><span>entirety of a Pokémon’s lineage show up</span></a><span> in its Mega form, and Mega Raichu X’s flight-based movement is a really endearing new page to add to that history. I hope this form shows up in the anime soon so we can have sick clips of Mega Raichu X flying around and whooping ass. Until then, I’ll be using mine to save the citizens of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>. It’s a Pidgey…it’s a Latias…no, it’s Mega Raichu X!</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s 2012. Barack Obama is president. Gamers are melting down over the ending of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3</span></i><span>. Harvey Smith and Raphael Colantonio, then at </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> developer Arkane Studios, are flying on a Bethesda-chartered private jet to Los Angeles for the Spike Video Game Awards, hosted by Samuel L. Jackson and held at Sony Pictures Studios.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span> is up for several awards, including Game of the Year (it loses to Telltale’s</span><i><span> The Walking Dead</span></i><span>), Best Xbox 360 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Halo 4</span></i><span>), Best PS3 Game (it loses to </span><i><span>Journey</span></i><span>), and Best Action-Adventure Game (it wins). Jessica Alba presents Smith and Colantonio with their trophy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Man, when you get it good, and when someone says, ‘Here’s a bonus, and by the way, we’re going to take you to The Game Awards,’ you cry. Literally. We literally cried,” Smith told me over a video call.</span></p> <p><span>Things are a little different 13 years later. Donald Trump is president. Gamers are melting down over whether or not Lara Croft is hot enough for them. Arkane Austin doesn’t exist anymore (though both Smith and Colantonio are still working on games). And the Game Awards streams online as cable TV is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-paramount-trump-bidding-war-2000651372"><span>dismantled and sold for parts</span></a><span>. The only constant is that the event is still hosted by the same man: Geoff Keighley.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But the video game industry in which he operates has changed dramatically. Back-to-back years of layoffs and studio closures, market consolidation, and a race to embrace generative AI have left many developers dazed, confused, and unemployed. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-launch-paris-hilton-lindsay-lohan-xbox-ps3-1851231204"><span>Video game launches don’t have as much fanfare as they did in the aughts</span></a><span>—there are no appearances from Paris Hilton or Lindsay Lohan. And the Game Awards, while still boasting some Hollywood talent, isn’t as star-studded as the defunct Spike ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Organizing gaming’s Oscars</b></h2> <p><span>There’s a lot of behind-the-scenes organizing for awards ceremonies that doesn’t get as much attention. The teams that work on putting together these events are vast, and often involve multiple companies that aren’t directly tied to the industry being honored that night (they might be production companies, security firms, contractors, and seasonal staff). The Peacock Theater l, where The Game Awards is held, seats up to 7,100, and Keighley and company have to decide how they all get divvied up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cost of putting on an awards show broadcast on cable TV is offset somewhat by the ad sales from the commercials that air during breaks, but the Game Awards are only available on streaming platforms (no commercials), so Keighley sells coveted spots for reveals, trailers, and previews, as well as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472"><span>sponsorships for specific awards</span></a><span>. While some slots are reserved for the biggest surprises and Keighley curates free slots for what he personally wants to champion, others have to pay to get in front of the </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/game-awards-2024-viewership-record-1236253334/"><span>millions of eyeballs watching from home</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>And the prices keep going up. According to two sources familiar with this year’s show, a 60-second trailer during the 2025 ceremony can cost up to $450,000. A three-minute trailer costs over $1 million. Two separate sources in the video game publishing world said that while they had not been briefed on this year’s rates, these sounded in line with what they’d expect from previous years.</span></p>

 <p><span>But what about attendance? Tom Cruise gets to go to the Oscars, but he may only be allowed a single guest, and most of the people behind the latest </span><i><span>Mission: Impossible</span></i><span> flick likely won’t get an invite. You don’t see the gaffer from </span><i><span>Challengers</span></i><span> sitting at the table next to Zendaya, and Keighley clearly wants to evoke Hollywood-style allure for his annual ceremony (why else would Al Pacino be invited?).&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>However, the video game industry isn’t Hollywood, despite its best efforts. It’s not financially viable to invite 100-plus-person studios to attend the Game Awards for free, but do you know of a single awards show that offers for-sale tickets to its potential honorees, tickets which are pulled from the same pool as those sold to the general public (i.e., fans)? The Game Awards does.</span></p> <p><span>According to multiple developers from both smaller indie studios and AAA monoliths who wished to remain anonymous, the Game Awards only offers two tickets to attend the ceremony to studios that get nominated, though there was at least one instance in which a developer received more than that, and some overall confusion about which studios get preferential treatment (aka more than the two generally allotted). The Game Awards’ organizers did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>A source told <i>Kotaku</i> that Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind this year’s </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, bought a swath of tickets at face value (around $300 each) to ensure more of the team could attend. </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span> recently set a record for the most nominations in Game Awards history with 12, so the desire to send as many people to the ceremony as possible makes sense. Sandfall did not respond to a request for comment.</span></p> <p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>But not every studio has the means or the desire to send a large crew of developers to the ceremony—whether it’s due to ticket pricing, the cost of travel, or other factors.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>One developer who worked on a game nominated for Best Accessibility at the 2024 Game Awards told me that their studio had to “buy the rest” of the tickets, as there were “only two up front for our nomination.” The two team members who were given the free tickets through the Game Awards sat in one area, while the larger group was scattered throughout the Peacock Theater. The source said that the tickets the studio purchased for the developers appeared to be full price.</span></p> <p><span>“I was told that the team was offered two tickets as nominees (these tickets come with access to the red carpet and green room experiences), and then provided a link to a page where additional tickets could be purchased,” a lead designer nominated last year who wished to remain anonymous told me. “As far as I could tell, the page was just the publicly available ticket page, and there were no discounts or special access to ticket allotments (i.e., particular seats in the theater) available.”</span></p> <p><span>Because of this, the game director purchased their own ticket from the public-facing ticket pool for around $700. “I didn’t want to miss a likely once-in-a-lifetime experience of being there in person for a nominated game that I’d had a major hand in, so I paid.” The Game Awards did not respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Seat fillers and superfans</b></h2> <p><span>While restricted availability for nominees can be chalked up to limited space and funds, things get complicated when you open up attendance to an industry’s award show to the general public. Matan Even, the 2022 stage crasher, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23502321/game-awards-bill-clinton-rabbi-kid-matan-even-hong-kong/"><span>told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span> he bought a ticket to the ceremony during the general sale and “simply walked up from his seat in the audience alongside the award winners.”</span></p> <p><span>This year, tickets were released on October 30, while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>nominees were revealed on November 17</span></a><span>. “Don’t watch the surprises—be in the room,” The Game Awards official announcement for ticket sales read.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By November 7, I was told by the Game Awards’ organizers that there were already no more free tickets available for press (I received one last year as a freelancer and the year before through my work at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>). On that day, </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alyssamerc.bsky.social/post/3m52o6tzmb22b"><span>the Game Awards tickets ranged in price</span></a><span> from $58.92 for upper mezzanine seats to over $1,000 for resale tickets in the back of center orchestra (most of the high-profile attendees sit in the front of this section). Last week,&nbsp; there were three tickets available in the center orchestra for $997 each (resale), and a smattering of tickets surrounding that section, ranging in price from $500-$800. Upper and lower mezzanine seats, also sporadically available, were going for between $300 and $545.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A freelance narrative writer who worked on a game nominated this year expressed frustration about the Game Awards’ ticketing process. Because they are no longer under contract with the nominated studio, they weren’t invited through the typical email from the Game Awards’ organizers, but still wanted to attend the event to celebrate their work.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>“Even if I had wanted to pay the inflated prices for scalper tickets, I couldn’t find 2 seats together,” they told me, with said tickets, according to them, running between $600-$1000. “At the very least, TGA should wait to sell general release tickets until after the nominations are announced…or have a separate bucket of tickets for devs who can provide proof that they worked on a nominated game.”</span></p> <p><span>Instead of buying tickets that cost more than some people’s monthly rent, the dev signed up for the seat filler program, which is organized by Gotham Casting. It’s unclear how many free tickets are set aside this way, but they wondered if the Game Awards prioritizes giving fans tickets over industry members because “the fans will scream and cheer for the trailers and the devs won’t.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The Eventbrite listing for seat fillers is directed at “ALL GAMERS and Video Game Fans &amp; Enthusiasts!” and promises “huge special performances to be announced” and instructions for what to expect on the day of the event. Seat fillers have to arrive two hours before the show starts and are instructed on how to dress (“men: upscale casual attire/button down shirts ok,” “women: cocktail dresses/upscale outfits”) and told not to wear cosplay, ripped jeans, or sneakers (unlike host Geoff Keighley).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“As a seatfiller, there will be an opportunity that you will be on camera,” the description reads. </span><span>“Seat fillers will begin their night seated in the holding area in the theater. As PAID TICKET HOLDERS ARRIVE, we move seat fillers as needed.” Seat fillers are also reminded that “guests have paid upwards of HUNDREDS a ticket for their seats!” and to make sure they “enjoy show [sic] &amp; have fun!” Gotham Casting did not reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Gaming’s biggest night</b></h2> <p><span>Keighley clearly wants the Game Awards to be big and bold and shiny—the best annual celebration of video games that monolithic studio money and Old Spice deodorant can buy. But there is a clear, consistent tension between putting on a show that honors the people working on video games and one that keeps the millions of fans watching in the hopes of seeing a trailer for </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a balancing act,” Keighley told</span> <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><i><span>The Game Business</span></i></a> <span>in a recent interview. “There’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</span></p> <p><span>No one feels the wobble of that balancing act more than the developers, especially the ones who aren’t studio executives or creative directors and who struggle to even get tickets to the Game Awards every year.</span></p> <p><span>Despite the pricey trailer slots and expensive ticketing problem, many industry members recognize how important the Game Awards are to those who have spent their careers working on games. Smith and Colantonio spoke at length about how life-changing attending the then-Spike Video Game Awards was.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It’s career-changing, the market opens up to you in a way,” Smith said. “If you work in games for decades, you’ve probably gotten your teeth knocked out a few times. I’ve worked on games that got 60 percent ratings, I’ve worked on games that got laughed at, I’ve worked on games that got me fired, I’ve worked on games where the studio was shut down…Then I worked with Ralph, and we made several pitches that got killed, and we almost went under. Then we made </span><i><span>Dishonored</span></i><span>.”</span></p>  <p><span>“It was easy for us to enjoy it, because there was Bethesda behind us, so we did not have to worry about paying for flights, what to organize, when to be there,” Colantonio said, referencing the 2010 acquisition of Arkane by Bethesda’s parent company, ZeniMax. “If Arkane in 2005, when we shipped </span><i><span>Dark Messiah,</span></i><span> had been nominated, it would have been just me there, period. It’s expensive, and it would have felt like a sacrifice.”</span></p> <p><span>Smith, well-versed in Arkane’s humble beginnings (the studio was started in 1999 by Colantonio and just four other men), recognized the struggle indie studios face when attending gaming’s biggest night. “If you’re a tiny French studio like Sandfall [the team behind </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>], the pay difference [between countries] means getting to LA, flying from Europe, staying in a hotel, eating there, all of that is way more expensive,” he said.</span></p> <p><span>For some, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267"><span>the Game Awards has felt more like an E3 presentation</span></a><span> where everyone wears suits (finally) than a proper ceremony honoring the people who made the year’s best games. Yet for those making games, especially at smaller studios, the importance of a Game Awards nomination cannot be overstated—a big win at the annual event could reinvigorate a struggling studio, or guarantee a second game gets greenlit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some think we should all just ignore the Game Awards and their hyper-promotional approach, and instead direct our attention to more celebratory affairs, such as the BAFTA Game Awards and the Game Developers’ Choice Awards, where the focus is more squarely on honoring the previous year’s games rather than on promoting games yet to come.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“</span><span>Tickets for [the BAFTAs] are also paid (and include dinner), but the entire vibe of the event and the apparent reverence it holds for the nominated games and their creators was so much of a better experience,” the aforementioned lead designer nominated last year said. “It was an extremely stark contrast.”</span></p> <p><span>The Game Awards, like the video game industry itself, represent the chasm between the studios that develop games and can shell out for a million-dollar ad slot during gaming’s biggest night without hesitation, and the people who work on them, who struggle to afford a ticket to the ceremony meant to honor their work.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><em>Additional reporting by Ethan Gach.</em></p>

                <p>Three-time Oscar-winning director Guillermo del Toro has revealed some of his favorite video games, including BioShock, Death Stranding, Red Dead Redemption, and God of War, among others.</p><p>Appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52OOT_-5tqE&amp;t=2583s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Sad Confused podcast</a>, del Toro said Sony's God of War series had some of the "best cinematic experiences" he's ever witnessed.</p><p>"When [Kratos] fights Odin [in God of War Ragnarok] and Odin keeps coming back and he looks like a Peaky Blinders brawler. He beats the crap out of Kratos. What a great video game. And the way they use the budget of data on the console to create atmospheric dispersion and light. That is lit like a film," he said.</p><p>The filmmaker went on to say BioShock is the "most immersive" game he's played, while he singled out Death Stranding (a game he is featured in) as another one of his faves. The game with the best universe is Metal Gear Solid, he added.</p><p>Some of his other favorite games include Left 4 Dead and "big sandbox games" like Red Dead Redemption. He also called out Shadow of the Colossus and labeled it a "masterpiece" that is "poetic and tragic."</p><p>Del Toro himself was for a period of time working on a game called Insane that he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/insane-cancelled/1100-6390635/" data-ref-id="1100-6390635">making alongside Saints Row studio Volition until THQ canceled the project.</a> He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toros-insane-to-be-a-trilogy/1100-6285306/" data-ref-id="1100-6285306">aimed for it to become a trilogy</a>, and after it was canceled, the director said he was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/del-toro-not-giving-up-on-insane/1100-6398161/" data-ref-id="1100-6398161">not giving up on it</a> and looking to find another way to bring it to market. That never happened, however.</p><p>At The Game Awards in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-seemingly-teased-by-guillermo-del-toro-at-the-game-awards/1100-6498859/" data-ref-id="1100-6498859">del Toro seemingly hinted at a Silent Hill project</a>, but he later clarified that he was only trying to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-game-awards-tease-was-meant-to-tickle-the-ribs-of-konami-del-toro-says/1100-6499214/" data-ref-id="1100-6499214">"tickle the ribs of Konami"</a> after the publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/">shut down his Silent Hills project.</a> <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-day-fear-changed-the-legacy-of-p-t/1100-6525725/" data-ref-id="1100-6525725">AKA P.T.</a></p><p>Following the cancellations of Insane and Silent Hills, del Toro said he gave up on trying to make a video game. "I have proven to be the albatross of video games," he said.</p><p>"I have decided, in order not to destroy anyone else's life, I will never again get involved in video games. Otherwise, I'll join someone and his house will explode, or something," the filmmaker explained.</p><p>Del Toro is known for making scary and unsettling films, including Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, and Nightmare Alley. He won two Oscars for The Shape of Water and one of Pinocchio. His newest movie, Frankenstein: The Anatomy Lesson, stars Oscar Isaac, Jacob Elordi, and Mia Goth, and is streaming now on Netflix and playing in select theaters.</p>

            <guid>1378987</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest batch of games joining Sony’s PS Plus subscription library in December 2025 has been revealed and it’s not a bad haul. In fact, it has one of the more overlooked JRPGs of the last few years on it: <a href="https://kotaku.com/granblue-fantasy-relink-review-pc-1851209297"><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>The Cygames-developed spin-off to the popular mobile franchise is part linear anime RPG, part <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and includes some excellent real-time combat thanks to the pedigree of the Platinum Games employees who helped make it. It combines the pacing and strategizing of an MMO boss battle with the responsiveness and ability juggling of a great action game. Plus, it’s multiplayer and includes an extensive end game. All told, it was one of last year’s bigger surprises for me and one I still feel like a lot of people haven’t woken up to.</p>

 <p>Here’s the rest of <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/10/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-december-assassins-creed-mirage-wo-long-fallen-dynasty-skate-story-and-more/">what’s coming this month</a>:</p> <h2>PlayStation Plus Extra And Premium</h2> <ul> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Skate Story</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Planet Coaster 2</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Cat Quest III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Paw Patrol: Grand Prix</em> | PS5, PS4<strong><br> </strong></li> <li><em>Paw Patrol World</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <h2><strong>PlayStation Classics (Premium Only)</strong></h2> <ul> <li><em>Soulcalibur III</em> | PS5, PS4</li> </ul> <p><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> aside, the main headliners are <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-ps5-soulslike-nioh-sekiro-1850176726"><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></a><em>.</em> Despite launching in 2023, the former recently got a free update that added new story content and additional parkour options, including a dedicated jump. The latter, also from that year, is a Three Kingdoms-based Soulslike from Team Ninja that’s not quite <em>Nioh 2-</em>quality but is still pretty great.</p> <p>Everything above, with the exception of <em>Skate Story</em> which arrived on December 8, joins PS Plus on December 16. That includes<em> Soulcalibur III</em>, arguably the best entry in the fighting game series. It was also the first to let players create their own characters with the Create-A-Soul mode.</p>

If you're interested in making your own micro-style games, the studio is hosting a game jam between today and January 11th. It'll wrap up with a stream in the week of January 19th, during which Finji staffers and guests will play some of the games created as part of the jam.</p><p>If you want to get a sense for what <em>CorgiSpace </em>will play like and what you can expect from the collection, you can check out a trailer here.</p>

<p>Activision, alongside developers Treyarch and Raven Software, have released the latest patch notes for the December 10 Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 update. These notes focus on multiplayer and zombies while addressing a couple small issues within the endgame content.</p>



<p>In multiplayer, the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-01-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">biggest update</a> sees fixes across multiple maps, such as Toshin and Standoff, where players were able to go outside the play area. Other updates to the mod include challenge fixes and UI concerns.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously awarded players the completion rewards for the Astra Malorum boss fight even when the encounter was actually failed.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer, the developer patches locations where players could leave the intended playspace on the following maps: Standoff, Fate, Scar, Paranoia, and Toshin.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also corrects an issue that previously prevented One in the Chamber from being selected as a game mode in private matches, and it addresses a bug that prevented the loading-screen stats from being displayed in the 20v20 Skirmish mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's Endgame campaign mode gets small fixes as well.

		<p>Skeleton Crew and developer Panic Stations have announced Frog Sqwad, a slapstick physics-based multiplayer game for up to eight players.</p>
<p><iframe title="???? Frog Sqwad ???? Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2BGF12nGU8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a frog with a sticky tongue, and that’s how you’ll get around and solve puzzles in Frog Sqwad. You’ll swing from pipes, drag giant food through tunnels, catapult friends, grow in size to become a megafrog, and more. Why are you doing this? Why are you and all your buddies in the sewers? That’s because of the Swamp King.</p>
<p>The Swamp King is endlessly hungry, and will demand for more and more food each and every day. You’ll go on runs, trying to earn gold to unlock more physics toys and gadgets, and just try to keep meeting quota.</p>
<p>Frog Sqwad – this is seriously hard to type out and not get letters jumbled up – is the first project from newly founded studio Panic Stations, which has been founded by a clutch of ex-Fall Guys developers who just want to make co-op games.</p>

<p>This game – that’s much easier to type – will be launching in 2026, but wait! You can play it tomorrow! A Steam Playtest will start on 11th December and runs through the weekend.</p>

<p>When Epic Games released Fortnite in July 2017, it didn't know at the time that it was about to change the video game world forever. Of course, it didn't change everything overnight. In fact, it didn't even change things with that initial launch. It wasn't <a href="http://wccftech.com/fortnite-battle-royale-mode-release-standalone-free-next-week/">until the battle royale mode launched a couple of months later in September 2017</a> that the real change started to occur.</p>



<p>Fast-forward to 2025, and Fortnite has been a phenomenon like no other. Here's everything we know about the battle royale phenomenon turned platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Fortnite was initially released on July 21, 2017, though the mode that made the game famous, its battle royale mode, wouldn't arrive until September 12, 2017. It has always been a free-to-play game, with in-game microtransactions available for players. It was initially available on PC, Mac, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, though over time<a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-ps5-xbox-series-x/"> it has been made available on every current-gen console platform </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-launches-on-mobile-fortnite-once-again-available-on-ios-in-europe-after-1-billion-fight/">mobile device available</a>. Fortnite is everywhere you want it to be in 2025, with ways to play the game on almost any device you like, no matter its hardware capabilities.</p>



<p>Every premium microtransaction in Fortnite is made with its in-game premium currency called V-Bucks, which can be purchased in bundles of 1,000, 2,800, 5,000, and 13,500. V-Bucks can go on sale and have increased in price in the past, but the current pricing for each bundle is:</p>



<ul>
<li>1,000 V-Bucks=$8.99 USD</li>



<li>2,800 V-Bucks=$22.99 USD</li>



<li>5,000 V-Bucks=$36.99 USD</li>



<li>13,500 V-Bucks=$89.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>In-game skins, battle passes, and premium collaborations will be priced in V-Bucks, and like most live service games that came after Fortnite, V-Bucks can only be purchased in bundles that put you just below being able to acquire a premium skin, or force you to purchase more V-Bucks then you'd need, leaving you with a surplus (though not necessarily enough to buy two premium items).</p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Nowadays, it's difficult to put Fortnite into a particular genre, because the reality is, when you throw in Fortnite Creative mode and the Fortnite Islands you can visit, Fortnite is any genre of game you want it to be. It's a racer, a rhythm game, a first-person shooter, a third-person shooter, a platformer. Whatever you want to build, Fortnite can become that.</p>



<p>But to keep things simple, let's stick to the core gameplay modes that made the game as popular as it is. Fortnite is a third-person battle royale shooter, where players are not only managing their weapon loadouts, but building and deconstructing wooden structures for a myriad of gameplay possibilities. Though mostly players build towers for extra cover and an extremely tall sniper's nest. </p>



<p>The storyline, which is there, however extrapolated it is, began with a simple premise. A company called IO created an island connecting every reality;100 players go in, one comes out, and the loop repeats. That also conveniently made it eternally easy for Epic Games to do every collaboration under the sun and get whatever characters you can think of into Fortnite.</p>



<p>That is at least how it started, all the way back in what's now known as Chapter 1, which includes the first eleven seasons, including Season 0. Now, we're all the way in Chapter 7, with each chapter including at least four seasons, if not more, so you can imagine how much has happened.</p>



<p>But the basic premise of Fortnite being set in a battle royale island that connects every reality ever has not changed, and will not change, so long as more characters from franchises you love can be made into Fortnite characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-chapter-and-season-in-fortnite-so-far">Every Chapter and Season in Fortnite so far </h2>



<p>This section will continuously be updated, because Fortnite is consistently getting new seasons and eventually new chapters. So this list is always only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>

</ul>
</li>



<li>Chapter 7
<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-chapter-seven-pacific-break-golden-goast-self-revive-new-dbno-options/">Season 1: Pacific Break - Nov. 29, 2025-Mar. 4, 2026</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Like every season before it, Season 1 of Chapter 7 includes a few new things for players to keep in mind. A new island, the addition of Storm Surfing, and most importantly for players, self-revives. The new island, Golden Coast, turns the latest map into a Fortnite version of Hollywood, and features a Quentin Tarantino collaboration <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">that also made history for fans of Tarantino's work, specifically his Kill Bill movies</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Describing the gameplay in Fortnite in 2025 runs into the same problems you have when trying to decide what genre to put the game in. Technically, the gameplay can be a whole host of things because of Fortnite Islands, which let you jump from entirely different kinds of games made within Fortnite, made either by Epic Games, other professional development studios, or just other users. </p>



<p>So, narrowing the scope down to just the core mode that initially put Fortnite on the map, Fortnite is a third-person battle royale action game/shooter, where players compete to be the last one standing out of 100 other competitors. You'll drop into a large map, search for loot to arm yourself, and (in the original build mode) gather resources like Wood, Stone, or Metal, to build structures that can help give you an advantage over other players with additional verticality and give you cover from opposing attacks.</p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Fortnite is famously not a very taxing game to run, no matter what hardware you have at your disposal. Technically speaking, with services like Xbox Cloud Gaming, Amazon Luna, and NVIDIA GeForce NOW, you can play Fortnite on any device that can connect to those services.</p>



<p>If you have the hardware for it, then you can push Fortnite pretty far, as it supports <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-is-getting-rtx-dlss-and-reflex-on-thursday-september-17th/">ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, and NVIDIA Reflex</a>. But part of its appeal, particularly with its visual language, is that Fortnite doesn't need to be played on top-of-the-line hardware to look fairly decent and run at a solid frame rate.</p>



<p>On Windows, here are the official technical specifications from the game's listing on the Epic Games Store:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Component</strong></td><td><strong>Minimum</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended</strong></td><td><strong>Recommended - Epic Quality Preset</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 10 64-bit version 1703</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td><td>Windows 10/11 64-Bit</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Core i3-3225 3.3 GHz</td><td>Core i5-7300U 3.5 GHz / AMD Ryzen 3 3300U</td><td>Intel Core i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700x</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>8GB </td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td><td>16GB or higher, 8GB of VRAM or higher</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Intel HD 4000 / AMD Radeon Vega 8</td><td>NVIDIA GTX 960 / AMD R9 280 or equivalent DX11 GPU</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Storage</strong></td><td>100+ GB available (SSD strongly recommended)</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td><td>100+ GB available SSD</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Fortnite is not available on Mac, though you can still play it on a Mac through the aforementioned cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>Here are the official technical specifications for Fortnite on Android devices:</p>



<ul>
<li>64-bit Android on an ARM64 processor</li>



<li>Android OS 10.0 or higher</li>



<li>Minimum 4GB of RAM</li>



<li>GPU:
<ul>
<li>Adreno 530 or higher</li>



<li>Mali-G71 MP20</li>



<li>Mali-G72 MP12 or higher</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>For iOS users, Fortnite is compatible with your device so long as you have at least 4GB of RAM and are running iOS 17.6.1 or higher. As a standard rule, iPhone 11 or higher models are compatible, save for the iPhone SE Generation 2 phones (iPhone SE 2020), which come with only 3GB of RAM.</p>

After the original source code was donated by Oberth’s family to the Video Game History Foundation, the game was rebuilt in partnership with Mega Cat Studios. and Incredible Technologies agreed to donate the rights to the Video Game History Foundation to preserve the game intellectual property and aid the charity’s fundraising for its work within the videogames industry. Through a collective effort rooted in passion and altruism, <em>Xcavator</em> is now finished, staying true to Oberth’s original vision, using the same tools that would’ve been used to fully develop the title in 1991.</p><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>CorgiSpace has been revealed by Canabalt creator Adam “Atomic” Saltsman, a collection of original Pico-8 sized games that have “short legs” on purpose. It’s available now from Steam and itch.io.</p>
<p><iframe title="CorgiSpace | Out Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaH_5CDT7Vo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been at Finji for a good long while and helped create larger games such as Night in the Woods and Tunic, Adam Atomic felt like getting back to smaller experiences, and started to create little quirky games based off quick and funny ideas.</p>
<p>There’s more than a dozen games in the collection, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rat Dreams – a soulslike where you have to dodge roll everywhere</li>
<li>Dust Settlers – a tetris-like where you’re terraforming planets</li>
<li>Skeleton Gelatin – a metroidvania with no upgrades or jumping</li>
<li>Prince of Prussia – a game where you’re stabbing Nazis, but in a fun way</li>
<li>Vampire vs. Pope Army</li>
<li>Dust Bunny – Eat all the dust</li>
<li>Dermis – Shoot asteroid and save the Moon</li>
</ul>
<p>And plenty more beyond that.</p>

<p>You should be able to explore each game in under an hour, but some of them with –&nbsp;<em>gasp –&nbsp;</em>save your progress!</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/10/scramble-knights-royale-blends-classic-zelda-with-a-bit-of-battle-royale/</link>
            <guid>1378861</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funktronic Labs has revealed Scramble Knights Royale, a game that essentially blends together the Zelda-like adventure genre with the battle royale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Scramble Knights Royale - Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMWryL7--F0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game start you off with a steam boat that chuffs around the battle island, and when you choose to depart, you’ll surf on the back of a turtle to make it to land. From there, you’ll do all the Zelda-like things of grabbing loot, delving into dungeons and fighting bosses. That rewards you with better gear, secondary abilities, blacksmith upgrades and more.</p>
<p>It will eventually come to a head where you face off against the other players that have done the same in other parts of the world. Will you have grabbed enough upgrades and abilities to beat them?</p>
<p>Scramble Knights Royale has a claymation art style to go with the top-down view of the world, which looks delightful. The game is obviously online, but there’s also local split-screen, so you can team up on the same system. That’s pretty neat!</p>

<p>The game is still deep in development, but if this piqued your interest, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379350/Scramble_Knights_Royale/">ask to join the Steam Playtest</a> from its store page.</p>

            <p>
I am most certainly the kind of sucker that has few complaints about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> being split into multiple parts. Those are my guys! I love my grumpy idiot all too realistic looking Cloud, I think Midgar being so well realised helps to justify the splitting of the game, and as maximalist as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Rebirth</a> is, there's a quality to it I can't help but admire, even with its many flaws. Keeping things fresh is still something necessary in dividing the game up though, and in a recent interview, director Naoki Hamaguchi spoke of how he's trying to do that with the as-of-yet untitled third part.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://x.com/JulienChieze/status/1997995919128559623">YouTube Julien Chièze</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-has-reached-a-stage-where-its-finally-starting-to-match-the-vision-i-had-for-it-director-teases-and-the-new-experience-is-almost-complete/">GamesRadar</a>), Hamaguchi noted that first of all, he "never intended to make a three-part series that would offer the same kind of experience each time. For the first game, the goal was to define what a remake actually is, and in the second title we added an open-world dimension to expand the scale of the experience." When it comes to the third game, the director noted the need to "implement a new experience and a new scale. And in that evolution, one of the key words is 'Highwind.'"
</p>
<p>
Hamaguchi went on to explain that the "new experience the game will offer is almost complete," heading into the fleshing out phase. The entire game has even apparently hit a point where it's "starting" to match the director's vision, though very politely asks all of us to wait a tad longer for it, with the promise of more info coming "soon."
</p>
<p>
Whether that's Geoff's Night of Ads and a Few Statues soon, or Random Thursday in February soon, I haven't the foggiest. Mostly the question is whether us PC lot will be getting it the same time as everyone else. Square Enix did undergo <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-might-not-wait-so-long-for-the-next-ff7-remake-as-square-enix-plan-to-win-over-pc-users-with-aggressive-shift-away-from-console-exclusives">quite a big internal shift within the last year</a>, outlining its intention for more multiplatform releases, so fingers crossed the gap won't be too wide.

</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Light Up The Town Is The Perfect Cozy Christmas Lights Simulator]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213</link>
            <guid>1378852</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love this time of year. Cozy weather. Tasty cookies and warm cocoa. <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-still-hasnt-taken-down-its-christmas-decorations-1841522397">Festive events in games</a>. And of course, all the <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ai-christmas-ad-deleted-comments-removed-bad-2000651791">Christmas</a> lights hanging on houses, businesses, and elsewhere. In particular, I have a soft spot for all the colorful lights that get hung up during December. They just look so magical at night and fill me with nostalgic feelings. What can I say? I’m a sucker for plastic lights.</p> <p>So when I randomly discovered <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/"><em>Light Up the Town</em></a>, a newly released cozy indie game all about decorating a wintry small town with Christmas lights, I immediately installed it and happily discovered a wonderful holiday treat that I can’t stop playing.</p>

  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3419910/Light_Up_The_Town/">Out now on Steam, <em>Light Up the Town</em></a> has a super simple premise. You play as a young anthropomorphized ferret named Bean who is going through some stuff. His father, in an effort to lift his spirits, asks Bean to follow in his own footsteps and handle lighting up the entire small Colorado town of Bellflower. If he does this, he’ll get a new bike for Christmas. There’s more going on, but I’ll leave that for you to discover on your own. The narrative isn’t bad at all, but it’s not why you should play <em>Light Up the Town</em>. The real reason is that decorating this snow-covered town with various Christmas lights and decorations is sublime.</p>

 <p>In real life, putting up lights across multiple buildings, roofs, and interiors can be a hassle of tangled cables, extension cords, and broken bulbs. <em>Light Up the Town</em> doesn’t include any of that. Instead, you are able to fling strings of lights in different colors and shapes across large distances like a Christmas Jedi. You can also undo your actions and cut light strings whenever you want, letting you create massively long or incredibly short strings of light. Also, don’t worry about plugs or running cords. Lights just work, regardless of where you put them. Is this realistic? Nope! And I love it. It’s all the joy of hanging lights up and making a home glow without the hassle or headaches the process can create in the real world.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652227" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652227"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652227">©Meadow Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Light Up the Town’</em>s decorating controls are finicky at times, but mostly work great and let you quickly cover areas in lights and other decorations, like presents, candy canes, and more. I recommend playing in first-person mode, but regardless of what view you pick, the end result of putting up all these lights is always magical. The lighting in this game is phenomenal and changes based on how you decorate. Cover a house in just a few white lights? The glow will be softer and dimmer. Fill a room with 20 strings of red and green lights? You’ll create a vibrant Christmas rave. As you hang up lights, look for coins to collect. These can be spent at stores to unlock more varieties of lights and new decoration items.</p> <p>Each time I stepped back after putting up lights for an hour or so, I’d find myself lingering the same way I do in real life when spotting Christmas lights at night. <em>Light Up the Town</em> truly nails the festive and cozy vibes of a cold, dark night in December filled with thousands of tiny bright lights in the snow. For fans of the holiday season, put on your favorite festive songs, make a hot beverage, grab a blanket, and then dive into <em>Light Up the Town.</em>&nbsp;Just set a timer so you don’t spend your whole night decorating.</p>

<p>Marvel Rivals has been confirmed to show up at the 2025 Game Awards. Season 5.5 is right around the corner, and there’s plenty that could be revealed for the game’s future. </p>



<p>The latest playable character for Marvel Rivals has just been teased, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-showcases-rogues-vanguard-moves-in-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rogue is set to join the fray</a>. It’s the third consecutive season that a new vanguard has been added into the mix, but that doesn’t stop fans from wanting to know more about the future of the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-will-be-at-the-game-awards">Marvel Rivals Will Be At The Game Awards</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The announcement came directly from Geoff Keighley, who shared a promotional image featuring Jeff the Land Shark sitting in a theatre seat marked with both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-statue-mystery-possibly-solved-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-unveils-new-gacha-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> branding. The artwork is loaded with personality, featuring Blade looking unimpressed in the background, Emma Frost sitting casually beside Jeff, and Gambit and Rogue sharing a kiss behind them—a playful nod to both the game’s tone and its growing roster.</p>







<p>What Marvel Rivals will actually showcase remains a mystery. Keighley’s only caption was a teasing “Tomorrow,” leaving fans to speculate wildly. The safest bet is a deeper look at the upcoming Season 5.5, but given NetEase’s recent momentum, it wouldn’t be surprising if they have a bigger reveal planned.</p>



<p>Fans will have to tune in to the Game Awards live to find out the truth for themselves. Do you have any theories about how Marvel Rivals could showcase at the Game Awards?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yep, I found a way to save $15 on Pokémon Legends: Z-A and the Mega Dimension DLC just as the expansion drops, proper legend I am. Not just that, but Woot has gone mad with discounting loads of First Party Nintendo Switch games, many of which have Switch 2 upgrades. More on that below.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've also been on the lookout for stocking fillers, and Tomy's Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushies are just awesome. There's a few Mario, Sonic and TMNT ones discounted across the web at the moment, so don't miss those.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Happy Cyberpunk 2077 5th anniversary! There's some very cool colaborations releasing for it too thanks to CD PROJEKT RED, Viture, Corsair and of course Secretlab put their Cyberpunk 2077 Titan Evo Gaming Chair in their holiday sale. Happy days, let's get into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh yeah, and Skyrim came out for the millionth time on a new console, so turn that Nintendo Switch 2 on:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station</h2><div id="230488" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Allpowers R600 299Wh LiFePO4 Power Station with 100W Solar Panel</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Allpowers is the most popular power station on brand on AliExpress for good reason: it's generally less expensive than other brands while offering the same features. Even the least expensive power station - the compact R600 - boasts a LiFePO4 battery that lasts at least 10 years before you even need to start worrying about battery degradation. Other features include both AC outlets and USB ports, solar panel hookups, and smart app functionaliy. All of the power stations listed include a 5 year warranty and have plenty of reviews commenting on the responsiveness of their customer service. If you're looking to get the highest capacity at the lowest price possible, Allpowers is legit.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Legends: Z-A + Mega Dimension DLC</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Haven't played Legends Z-A yet? Well I can save you some money on Switch 1 and 2. Kick things off with the Woot deals on the region free copy for $44.99. If you're playing on Switch 1, just buy the Mega Dimension DLC for $29.99 and you're fixed up for $74.98.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Switch 2 owners, you'll need to also buy the Switch 2 upgrade pack for $9.99, which brings the total price to $84.98. That's a $15 Switch 1 or Switch 2 savings, you're welcome!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Skyrim: Anniversary on Switch 2</h2></p><div><div id="233532" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital Code: Free upgrade to Nintendo Switch 2</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><div id="233533" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Digital code upgrade: Only for owners of standard Skyrim for Nintendo Switch</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim | Anniversary Upgrade</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd love to say that I found a magical way to knock some money off getting Skyrim for the 15th time, but it would require you to already have the game. Here's how it works, if you have Skyrim Anniversary for Switch 1 already, the Switch 2 upgrade is free. If you have the base version of Skyrim, you need to get the $19.99 Anniversary upgrade that will include upgrading to Nintendo Switch 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't have it at all, it seems the only way to get hold of Skyrim Anniversary on Switch 2 currently is buying the full fat digital code. Nintendo Online and all retailers are rocking that $69.99 price tag, so make of that what you will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly it's still 30 FPS even when docked but it's a night and day difference when it comes to sharp and crisp visuals in a portable form factor. So if you're on Switch 2 and don't have a gaming PC handheld, you'll get a ridiculous amount of mileage from it!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Woot Nintendo Switch Game Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've got some gaps in your backlog for Nintendo Switch games you've missed, now's the time to top your shelves up. There's plenty of games here with Switch 2 upgrades also, and a lot are either free or included with Nintendo Switch Online. Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild are big ones, with their Switch 2 enhancements locked behind a $10 pass per game or included in Nintendo Switch Online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet has practically been remade thanks to a free Nintendo Switch 2 update, although I don't think Game Freak would have got away with a paid update thanks to the goodwill lost on S&amp;Vs Switch 1 performance issues. We now get a smooth 60 FPS which clocks at 4K when docked, more Pokémon appear on screen and it's a pleasure to play. The dull textures still remain, but it's the fix we were looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games like Super Mario Wonder will be getting new content and a Switch 2 performance / visual upgrade in January also. Other games will generally run and load a little better, so it's well worth having a look through and checking which titles you're missing.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Club Mocchi Mocchi Plushie Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomy actually came up with a product to rival Squishmallows when it comes to feathersoft huggage plushies, and I'm a big fan of Mocchi Moochi. It's rare you see discounts this good on them, plus you can pretend you're tucking Super Sonic into bed when you get up in the morning, just expect your bed to set on fire in the process. Sorry, it's still a bargain though!</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Gear</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've only gone and found the perfect setup for playing Cyberpunk 2077 on PC! Let's start with Secretlabs  TITAN Evo Cyberpunk 2077 edition, which matches the box art perfectly and represents Johnny Silverhands band logo, "Samurai" on the back cover. Awesome right? Both the regular and XL models are on offer, that goes for accessories too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VITURE and CD Projekt RED have teamed up to bring the most savage set of XR glasses i've ever seen. Limited to 100,000 units, these bad boys project a 152-inch virtual display at 120hz with 1,500 nits of brightness. That's all packed into Sony's latest MicroOLED panels, one for each eye. Forget a gaming monitor or TV, this is a one-stop solution for Street Kids, Corpo and Nomads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Corsair have shown up and killed it too thanks to a new mechanical keyboard, wireless mouse and massive cloth gaming mouse pad. You can get all three at a discount for $269.99, or you can buy them seperatley. If you can I'd go for the bundle and save nearly $50, but these aren't just gimmicks budget products, they're based on the below Corsair products:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>MM300 2XL Anti-Fray Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad</li><li>K65 Plus Keyboard</li><li>M75 Wireless Mouse</li></ul><p id="nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World">Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233411"><div id="233411" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Amazon going in and out of stock, still in stock at Walmart</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal is priced the same as a solo Nintendo Switch 2 console, making Super Mario World a free pack-in game over at Walmart. Amazon seems to be going in and out of stock right now, but regardless it's the same price there too.</p></div><p id="x-arcade-arcade2tv-xr"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR">X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233511"><div id="233511" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>Integrated Meta Quest 2/3 Functionality and works on all consoles / PC</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At a generous $205 off, this is a cracking one-stop-shop arcade gaming solution. Want to hook it up to your current gen consoles to play Smash Bros on? Sorted. Want to make your own Meme Arcade setup with a mini PC or Raspberry PI? Sorted. It's two player and complete with authentic feeling arcade buttons and sticks, roller balls and room for upgrades such as a soundbar, pinball haptics and more. This takes the pain out of making a cabinet or spending a fortune on one and allows players to plug and play like you would a normal controller.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elgato Streaming Gear Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gold brand in streaming and content creation is Elgato, and there's plenty of its high-end gear on sale here such as the power-streamer Stream Deck XL down to $204.99 to one of the best budget-focused condenser microphone options in the $84.99 Wave Neo. Even the Facecam Mk.2 has been knocked down to $126.34, allowing streamers to stop worrying about mirrorless XLR camera setups and have a quality wcamera solution that plug and play. And who doesn't want an Elgato prompter for a marked down $228.99?</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Excentric Christmas Gift Deals</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought i'd have a bit of fun today with some cool Christmas or White Rabbit gift ideas with some brilliant discounts. I've already touched on Sony InZone wireless earbuds, but they really are the best all-rounder earbuds i've tried in recent memory, and the included USB-C dongle fits in the charger case and is ideal for connecting to PC and PlayStation 5. And they're $42.99 off, bargain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saving over $100 on a 300W Kareoke machine with an included 10.1" tablet and wireless microphones is a cracking deal too. Ikario has RGB lighting and hooks up to YouTube or Karaoke app via WiFi for absolute endless banter for house parties this holiday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative might not be the front and center of PC audio like it used to be, but it haven't lost its eye for quality. $69.99 for a soundbar and subwoofer combo is an awesome shout for a gaming setup or smaller home theatre setups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've spotted a loved one forever filming themselves for TikToks or video calling to their friends, the Maono wireless lavalier microphone is USB-C compatible and clips to a users clothes for a pro sound wherever they are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stationary cameras are great for keeping an eye on a room in general, but cats and dogs don't like staying still. Enabot EBO Rola PetPal provides 2.5k video and allows owners to roll about the house to check what their pets are really up too. Attachable feeders and cat toys allow for owners to interact with their pets more than ever before and is a great gift for the craszy cat person in your life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the HOZO NeoBlade for a while now whilst cleaning up my 3D prints and creative projects. It's an ultrasonic knife that can take different microblades and is rechargable. This bit of kit just makes cutting jobs miles easier of toucher materials with acrylic, PLA, wood and softer metals. I use it to cut supports off my prints and clean up projects, and I can't go back to regular scalpels and blades. Plus this bundle is $10 off and you get a self healing A3 matt.</p><p id="new-switch-2-games-this-holiday"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="New Switch 2 Games This Holiday">Switch 2 Games Releasing This Holiday</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">December is stacked for Nintendo Switch 2. We gave Metroid Prime 4: Beyond a solid 8/10 for nailing the Prime vibe whilst introducing some interesting mechanics and a pseudo open-world sandbox to explore. Considering how long we've been waiting for it, Metroid 4 is a solid comeback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Mega Dimension DLC drops on Wednesday, which adds a post-game story, brand new Mega Evolutions and new mechanics such as an alternative dimension Lumioise City and Pokémon hitting over the long-standing level 100 mechanic. Insane. </p><p id="audible-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Audible Holiday Sale">Audible Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fancy knocking a $14.95 per month subscription to 99 cents for three months? That's what's on offer for Amazon Prime members right now, which can easily be cancelled down before the discount dries if you don't want to continue, win-win.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst Audible Plus, the cheaper membership tier, has 10,000 audiobooks to listen too, Premium Plus has 500,000. Premium Plus members get to pick an audiobook to keep in their library indefinitely too, with 30% off purchasable Audiobooks. Usually this crops up as a free 30-day trial, and these trials are only for new subscribers, so this is the best deal you're going to get.</p><p id="mega-evolution-booster-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Mega Evolution Booster Box">Mega Evolution Booster Box</h2></p><div catalogid="80e0ff81-3606-4105-a4f2-43697c5c3b1d" id="233437"><div id="233437" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Evolution Booster Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not often Amazon gets their Pokémon TCG products down to market value, but here we are. Yes, you can save $6.99 at TCGPlayer if you're not bothered about waiting a few days for delivery, but many would argue the extra $6.99 is worth getting it in your hands quicker with 1-day Amazon Prime delivery. The choice is yours but both sites have this at or near market value right now, which is great for one of the box in-demand Pokémon TCG sets right now.</p></div><p id="secret-lab-holiday-sale"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Secret Lab Holiday Sale">Secretlab Holiday Sale</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no secret that Secretlab is one of the most premium gaming chairs and brands available right now, and the brand tax is real.

But builds like Lenovo's LOQ RTX 5060Ti build has a cracking budget price of $949.99 after using the discount code "<strong>EXTRAFIVE</strong>", capable of DLSS 4 upscaling and the latest Nvidia AI frame generation. The Ryzen 7 8745HX CPU backs up the 5060 Ti well, making this a lean and mean 1080p gaming monster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Out of the two Alienware builds, i'd save the money and go for the Intel Core Ultra 7 265 build. Both of these builds are going to kill it when it comes to high frame rate 4K gaming, and I simply don't think the extra $350 is worth it for the extra gains of a Core Ultra 9 285K CPU. Of course it's faster and better, but I think the $3,899.99 build is far better value for money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Someone has calculated exactly how many hours of recorded dialogue there are in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, a task so unnecessarily large that even Larian Studios hadn't done it before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3-fan-discovers-the-game-has-nearly-237-hours-of-spoken-dialogue-in-it-and-a-whopping-14-hours-are-narrator-amelia-tylers-alone-though-astarion-gives-her-a-run-for-her-money/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported by PC Gamer</a>, Everwhite-moonlight <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">put together a spreadsheet</a> breaking down all the dialogue in the game: who spoke it, how long the dialogue is, even how many files they speak in.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This survey results in some interesting facts surfacing: it's unsurprising that the narrator, Amelia Tyler, has the most dialogue at 14 hours, 43 minutes, and 55 seconds. Behind her, though, is Astarion, voiced by Neil Newbon, with 13 hours, six minutes, and 23 seconds. And behind him is Shadowheart, with 12 hours, 25 minutes, and 26 seconds. The smallest amount of dialogue is a many-way tie between numerous NPCs that all have only one second of dialogue, including four different Mind Flayer NPCs. In total, the game contains 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds of spoken voice lines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every voice actor is catalogued in here, including small lines by random NPCs and even cut dialogue. One mystery that's arisen, per Everwhite-moonlight, is who exactly voices which Giant Rat NPC in the game. "There are four instances of a character named 'Giant Rat,' and there are four actors credited to have played 'Giant Rat.' I have separated the Giant Rat UIDs and could tell they are played by four different people, but I don't know which one is which." Those actors are Akbar Kurtha, Joseph Capp, Leemore Marrett Jr., and Sean Baker. Now we just have to sort out which actor is which rat.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Baldur's Gate 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another fun bit that's surfaced from this is that Larian Studios actually didn't know how much dialogue, time-wise, was in the game. On Twitter/X, Larian boss Swen Vincke shared the news about the finding, saying, "We weren’t really keeping track which I think was for the better."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vincke did, however, know the word count of the game's script, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals">as we learned back in 2024</a>, saying that Baldur's Gate 3 has triple the word count of The Lord of the Rings, and its cutscene runtime is twice as long as HBO's Game of Thrones. Holy moly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For lovers of Baldur's Gate 3's particular brand of delightful wordiness, it might be worth tuning into The Game Awards tomorrow, as Larian <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">seems to be teasing a brand new Divinity game</a> for reveal at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3</link>
            <guid>1378837</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you hadn’t already heard, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-mysterious-the-game-awards-statue-reportedly-isnt-teasing-the-elder-scrolls-6-diablo-or-god-of-war-so-what-is-it-teasing">a weird, spiky monolith in the Mojave Desert</a>. Adorned with a massive eye-like orb and a legion of demonic creatures, it’s a hint at something due to be revealed as part of The Game Awards 2025. And, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-think-we-know-what-geoff-keighleys-weird-desert-statue-is-teasing">the registration of a few new trademarks</a>, it seems like we already have the answer as to what it is: a brand new game from Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios called “Divinity”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are one of the millions of players who first learned of Larian through the gargantuan success of Baldur’s Gate 3, then the word Divinity may not mean much to you. Fans of the studio, however, will tell you that BG3’s success is rooted in Divinity, a series of six games that Larian worked on almost exclusively between 2002 and 2017. <em><strong>If</strong></em> this monolith and trademark leak really do point towards Divinity, then the Belgian studio is returning to its original fantasy universe… and likely bringing a whole new fanbase along with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If such a currently-very-much-hypothetical game would mark your first foray into the Divinity universe, then you may want a quick primer on what to expect. Let us be your guide to Divinity, and be the first to (very pre-emptively) say…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Welcome to Rivellon</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-blogroll-1765383245117.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like how Baldur’s Gate takes place in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting of the Forgotten Realms, Divinity has its own rich, original setting: the world of Rivellon. There are broad similarities between the two; both are rooted in Tolkienesque fantasy tropes, with classically styled medieval landscapes and locations. There are multiple races; like in D&amp;D, you can expect to meet humans, elves, dwarves, lizard-like beings, and the living dead. Magic is commonplace in Rivellon, although sorcery is considered more dangerous and is more heavily regulated there than it is on D&amp;D’s Sword Coast.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Baldur’s Gate, Divinity also features a number of more esoteric elements, from steampunk to sci-fi and beyond, that make its world a little quirkier than the lands explored in more traditional fantasy like The Lord of the Rings. Rivellon can also often be a very silly place, and the influence of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels has frequently been felt in Divinity’s writing. In fact, Terry’s daughter, Rhianna Pratchett, even wrote a tie-in novella for the second game. But that’s not to say Rivellon is frivolous – there’s a deep vein of fascinating lore that has been mined over the series’ six installments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Rivellon is the stage for stories similar to those you enjoyed in Baldur’s Gate 3, but is beholden only to Larian’s rules, rather than those set by the owners of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Wizards of the Coast. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Divinity?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-2-1765383400580.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity is an RPG series, but its evolution has been far from usual. Take a quick look at each of the six games, and you’ll find at least four different approaches. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, the very first game in the series, and its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/beyond-divinity">Beyond Divinity</a>, are Diablo-influenced action RPGs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-ii-ego-draconis">Divinity 2: Ego Draconis</a>, meanwhile, is a third-person RPG that feels a <em>little </em>closer to the likes of Dragon Age and The Witcher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-dragon-commander">Divinity: Dragon Commander</a> is a <em>slightly</em> Total War-flavoured strategy game, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin">Original Sin</a> duology – the most recent games in the series – are classic-style RPGs that bear the most resemblance to Baldur’s Gate 3. Larian has experimented wildly over the years, and so there’s no clear indication as to what format the next game in the series will use (although considering the success of Baldur’s Gate 3, the sensible bet would be on something similar).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unusual element is its approach to the timeline. While Rivellon does have a coherent history and storylines that are threaded across the series, each game is set years (sometimes even centuries) apart, meaning each one is something of a standalone experience. Similar to how Baldur's Gate 3 demands no experience of the series but has plenty of nods to the two earlier games, you can play Divinity: Original Sin 2 without any experience of its predecessors. I suspect any future game in the series would continue this tradition, especially since Larian now has a legion of new fans who are unfamiliar with the studio’s previous work. If the leaked trademark is to be believed, this new project is simply called “Divinity” – a name that has likely been chosen since it comes with no suggestion that you need to have played multiple other games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Does “Divinity” Mean?  </h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-logo-1765383966045.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new Divinity logo, trademarked ahead of The Game Awards 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity’s name is drawn from its foundational lore. Thousands of years before the events of Divine Divinity, the first game in the series, Rivellon’s ruling body, the Council of Seven, sacrificed themselves to defend the realm from evil wizards. The “Divine Order” was established in remembrance and assigned to pass on their knowledge to the next generations.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the events of Divine Divinity, a prophecy tells of a messiah who will protect Rivellon from the next existential threat, a demon called Chaos. That messiah, it turns out, is you, and you ascend to become Lucian the Divine – a character that goes on to make appearances in Divinity 2: Ego Draconis and Divinity: Original Sin 2. The concept of the Divine is frequently explored in the stories, although it’s not the central focus of each and every game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Similar is Divinity to Baldur’s Gate 3?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-os2-screen-1765383448435.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Since the series has changed so much over its lifetime, most of the Divinity series is actually pretty different from what Larian created with Baldur’s Gate 3. However, the Original Sin duology is very clearly the blueprint for BG3. These are isometric RPGs set across multiple regions, with tactical turn-based combat and a similar “hands-off” approach to quest design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both are worth playing, Original Sin 2 is by far the most accomplished, both in terms of gameplay depth and narrative strength. It is where Larian pioneered the “origin story” characters that would later become the heroes of Baldur’s Gate 3, and Rivellon’s answer to the likes of Astarion, Gale, and Shadowheart are just as brilliantly written. It’s also the game in which the studio established “tags”, the system that provides character-specific dialogue options to help you better roleplay your specific race or class. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the Original Sin duology’s most lauded system is its elemental effects – cast a rain spell to make something wet, and then use a lightning ability to conduct electricity through that sodden surface. Tip over an oil barrel to create a puddle, and then shoot a flaming arrow into it to create a blaze. Stab an enemy, freeze their blood, and watch them slip on their own icy innards. Much of this elemental interplay made it into Baldur’s Gate 3, but it’s much more pronounced in Original Sin. Expect at least a quarter of your battles to result in arena-wide bonfires. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">How to Play the Divinity Games in Order</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/divinity-dragon-commander-1765383513679.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously mentioned, the timeline gaps that separate the Divinity games mean there are no strictly <em>direct</em> sequels, and you can more or less play them in any order you choose. If you’ve played Baldur’s Gate 3 and are looking to learn more about Divinity, I’d only truly recommend playing Original Sin 2, which is widely regarded as the best in the series. Initially a PC exclusive, it is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and even iPad. But if you really do want to delve into the lore and explore the entire timeline, this is how you’d need to tackle the series:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Dragon Commander (2013)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A grand strategy game set thousands of years prior to the events of the RPGs.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin (2014)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG with turn-based combat, set 1000 years before the original game, focused on a pair of “Source Hunters” tracking down dangerous magic users.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divine Divinity (2002)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A Diablo-like ARPG that chronicles the ascension of Lucian the Divine.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Beyond Divinity (2004)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The ARPG sequel to Divine Divinity, set 20 years later, tells the story of one of Lucian’s servants, who has been soulbound to an evil Death Knight. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity: Original Sin 2 (2017)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A CRPG that’s a sequel to Original Sin in terms of game design, but takes place after the original two games and deals with an outbreak of “Voidwoken” monsters in Rivellon. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Divinity 2: Ego Draconis (2009)</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>A 3D action RPG set decades after Lucian’s ascension, during an era when the Divine’s adoptive son has become a tyrant, in which you play as a knight who can transform into a dragon.  </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3]]></content:encoded>
