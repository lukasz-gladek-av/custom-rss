			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/echoes-of-the-end">Echoes of the End</a> was a pleasant surprise, when it originally released last year. It’s an action adventure game that draws inspiration from the God of War reboot pretty heavily, but dispenses with the open world for a linear experience and a more focused story. The result was a good game with particularly well written characters that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/01/echoes-of-the-end-review/">held back by some polish and control issues</a>. So to improve all that, Myrkur games released a free Enhanced Edition update.</p>
<p>Not only has combat been reworked to improve the overall flow, which was perhaps my biggest issue, but it’s even changed the opening of the game to get you to the main story that bit quicker. Then there’s a new gear and armour system, allowing you to customise Ryn’s outfit and abilities and adding further depth to the game as well. They’ve since added a photo mode and some additional outfits on top of that.</p>
<p>It’s also been added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue, so it’s easier than ever to try out for subscribers. I revisited to see some of the improvements for myself and reevaluate my initial review, now the game has been thoroughly updated.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Updates &amp; PlayStation Plus - Echoes of the End" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q58Ype92SHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First off, the combat is clearly improved, but still not perfect. The issue I had with not flowing between inputs – for example, dodging, and then a follow-up input to aim an ability not being registered, leaving you vulnerable – has been reduced, but not eliminated entirely. It doesn’t happen as often, but it does still happen. The combat overall is improved though, whereas previously it could feel a little too loose to the point that I lowered the difficulty because it got frustrating. It now feels tight enough that I don’t feel that the challenge is unfair anymore, and that’s a significant enough improvement on its own.</p>


<p>But then there’s the outfits and relics system, which is quite a large change to patch into a game. The outfits are crafted once you find a schematic in the world, using a resource called Glimmerweave that you’ll loot during gameplay. However, an outfit can come with a relic that can be added into one of two slots for a gameplay bonus, such as gaining additional health whilst draining enemies or extra damage reduction. These relics can also be found in the world and some of them are meant to game-changing effects, though I’m too early in my new playthrough to have found one of those yet. What’s already obvious is that they add a more depth to character customisation, allowing you to tailor Ryn to your playstyle, not to mention some more rewards for exploring the game world. In New Game+, you even have an extra relic slot to use as well.</p>

<p>Then there’s the newly added photo mode as well, which obviously lets you take photos of the game. Frankly it’s surprising it wasn’t already in the game, as Echoes of the End is a really stunning game. The Icelandic-inspired environments in particular are gorgeous and the huge backgrounds give the game an impressive sense of scale, so there’s plenty of places to be taking pictures.</p>
<p>Outside of all this, it’s still Echoes of the End. The combat was already a lot of fun when it worked properly – I mean, what’s not to like about throwing enemies at other enemies, or slamming them into the ground? Now it’s been improved, it’s even better, even if it still isn’t perfect. However, the characters are the star of the show here. Ryn and Cor are convincing from the off and Abram, once he arrives an hour or so into the game, is immediately engaging. This is all thanks to well written, witty dialogue and excellent performances particularly from Ryn and Abram’s voice actors. The conversations can be surprisingly introspective and vulnerable, and it doesn’t hurt that there’s plenty of mystery in the background to keep you guessing about what’s happening.</p>

<p>Echoes is a pretty short game by the standards of other games that play similarly these days, taking me just under eleven hours on my first playthrough, though there’s no doubt it would have been longer if there were relics and outfits for me to find as well. Frankly, restarting the game made me realise I actually miss some of the characters a little bit. I don’t think there’s much higher praise for writing than that, which is why I’ll be giving New Game+ a go.</p>

			<p>With exactly a week left before the official launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a></strong>, here's a semi-exclusive interview with Blizzard where four members of the development team open up on the key areas of the game's eleventh expansion, such as dungeons, raids, delves, the Zul'aman zone, and the new Prey system.</p>



<p>I said semi-exclusive because I shared the remote interview session with <strong>Carrie Lambertsen</strong> from Screen Rant, so you'll see her name pop up as well throughout the transcript when she was the one asking questions. The following Blizzard developers were involved: Associate Game Director <strong>Paul Kubit</strong>, Lead Encounter Designer <strong>Dylan Barker</strong>, Game Designer <strong>Jake Shillan</strong>, and Senior Game Designer <strong>Kim Flack</strong>.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight goes live on <strong>March 3</strong> for PC and Mac. Hopefully, <strong>John Romero</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-most-played-game-john-romero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't slip back into his addiction</a>...</p>

<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): What are you most excited for players to see in the upcoming expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Oh my gosh. Some of it is behind spoiler territory. So, some of the things that I'm most excited about are still things that have yet to be uncovered on beta or yet to be shared anywhere, really. One of the things that I'm most excited about is the Prey system. I have been playing Prey on the beta daily.</p>



<p>I had an experience yesterday where I was playing on Nightmare mode on a Survival Hunter. For your audience, if they are unaware, Prey is an outdoor opt-in system where you can go on a hunt against a dangerous enemy, but that enemy is hunting you as well. It can ambush you while you're fighting anything. As you escalate in difficulty from Normal mode to Hard mode to Nightmare mode, there are additional torments that can happen along the way—pools of damage appear by your feet, ghostly followers chase after you, and whatnot.</p>



<p>Anyway, I had this experience where one of the torments is "kill something now," where you have a limited amount of time (15 or 20 seconds) to kill something, otherwise you take a big DoT [Damage over Time]. There were no enemies nearby. I looked over into the water off the coast of Zul'Aman, and there was an eel in there. So, I jumped off a cliff, did my harpoon pull to get myself onto the eel and kill it in time. And then, while I was underwater, I was ambushed by my target. In addition to dealing with pools of water appearing underneath me, it was the exact type of moment you want to have happen in Prey. It adds this level of chaos to the outdoor world, where you could normally fall into a routine of completing world quests and doing your special assignments, which are relatively cozy and simple. If you're not feeling really cozy that day and you want to be hunted, Prey is a new feeling. That's one of the things I'm most excited about. What about you, Dylan?</p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> I'm somewhat strange in that I love to jump between different classes a bunch during the expansion. So I have two things I'm really looking forward to. First off, a whole slate of new Delves and new activities that have learned from what went well in Delves in The War Within and improve upon that. Just a bunch of fresh delve stuff so that when I'm playing a class where I'm not necessarily familiar with their buttons yet, I can just jump in and feel that out.</p>



<p>Dovetailing into that, I kind of want to try and tank this expansion. I think it'll be fun. We've put in an affix for Mythic Plus called "Lindorm's Guidance". The easiest way to understand it is like a highlight on a creature in a pack to indicate the series of packs that you'd pull in a Mythic Plus run for a reasonable line. It's not necessarily the fastest. It may not be optimal for your group, and at higher levels of Mythic Plus, it might lag behind, but when you're getting your feet wet in Mythic Plus as a tank, it can be very stressful. It's nice for the designers to say, "Actually, if you just do this, you'll be doing a reasonable job." All you have to worry about is how the mobs interact with you and how you survive, rather than "what route do I need to be going?" and "will I get flamed for going the wrong way?" So yeah, definitely looking forward to that.</p>

<h2 id="pre-launch-twilight-ascension-and-welcome-back-weekend">Pre-Launch: Twilight Ascension and Welcome Back Weekend</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): I know that you've activated the Twilight Ascension pre-launch event. How is that going for you, and what's the community's reaction so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Yeah, Twilight Ascension is the name of our pre-launch event, and it's meant to be a prelude to some of the themes and enemies you might be seeing in <em>Midnight</em>. We're seeing the activation of the Twilight's Blade cult sort of arising in Twilight Highlands, as appropriate a place as any for them to be. This is a world group which is going to be particularly relevant as we start adventuring through Eversong Woods and Zul'Aman as well. You're going to see a good amount of cultist activity going on in Zul'Aman.</p>



<p>So, this is the introduction to that story, and also an opportunity for us to see some of the really cool Void enemies we're going to be fighting, not just against those cultists, but also as we enter incredibly voidy spaces like the Void Spire, some of our dungeons, and the raids. Lots of void! So it's been a good opportunity to get people jumping into the story. Also, as players have been going through it, we've found that plenty of folks have enjoyed using this event to get their characters caught up on gear or experience. We've monitored that and made adjustments to rewards along the way to make sure it's efficient and feels appropriate if you've got a character that is falling behind, or many characters (maybe you played a lot of Mists of Pandaria Remix / Legion Remix) that you want to get up to a higher item level so you can get a head start in Midnight.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): As a quick follow-up, I know that you also hosted a Welcome Back weekend a couple of weeks ago. Did you see many lapsed players come back, eager for World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Yeah, for sure. We've done a couple of welcome back weekends in the past, and it's always a good opportunity for people who have played World of Warcraft in the past and are interested in hopping back in to try some of the new features. We saw a lot of people able to experience Housing for the first time because of the welcome back weekend. You can go in and start building out your house, collecting decor, and playing around with that mode, as well as starting to use some of the new transmog systems and the additional stuff which entered into the pre-patch. So yeah, we saw a good number of people come back to see what's new.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WoW_Midnight_Raid-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="raids-and-dungeons">Raids and Dungeons in World of Warcraft: Midnight</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): I was curious about all the changes happening with the add-ons. I know a lot has changed, specifically for raids and dungeons. Can you talk for a minute about how that affected your design going into the raids for World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> It was pretty foundational. I think the exciting prospect of it is that there are mechanics we've tried in the past that asked raid groups to basically say, "Hey, all of you arrange yourself in this way." We didn't tell you ahead of time, but you knew something was going to happen; we just didn't know in what order or which players were going to get picked. In the past, that was automated [by add-ons], and the way that we had to challenge players at higher difficulties was by shooting a bunch of swirlies or bullets at them to get them to stress while doing something that was otherwise automated.</p>



<p>So, just on its face, we have encounters across the whole spectrum of the raid, from one of the very first ones to the very last one for Midnight, that will ask players to coordinate in a way that is not automated. It will be very neat to see how this plays out. We're able to just change the difficulty of a coordination test using elements of the test itself instead of having to layer multiple pieces over it. From a strict design perspective, that's very exciting for our team. It's also called on us to be clearer and intentional about what mechanics we're showing players. It's not about things being simpler; it's about things being cleaner, easier to read, condensed into a number of mechanics that, when they are happening, they are the serious thing you need to worry about. We've had enough space to do that throughout <em>Midnight</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Staying on the raids topic, what was your philosophy behind deciding to split the bosses? Instead of one large raid, you're doing separate raid instances that are being released across Season 1 of World of Warcraft: Midnight. Was that partly because of community feedback over previous expansions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> For sure. We have had several raid tiers in the last several expansions where our raid has been a single location with roughly eight bosses. Variety is the spice of life, and the spice of WoW for sure. We want to make sure we always have novel and surprising experiences, and that it doesn't become too standardized. So the feedback of, "Gosh, I miss when we used to have single boss raids like Onyxia's Lair, Magtheridon's Lair, Gruul's Lair," giving you a little more flexibility in how your group puts together its raid evening—that feedback flavored our choice.</p>



<p>Also, a lot of it came from the narrative. As we were putting together the story of what happens at the end of this first chapter of Midnight, we looked at the Void Spire, where the culmination of the void storm happens. We bring down the shields and open up—I won't spoil too much—but you take the fight to Xal'atath by bringing a big Light army against her big Void army. That raid is, in every sense of the word, a war between Light and Darkness.</p>



<p>At the culmination of that raid, there's still a little bit more story that has to happen. So we have some questing after you complete that raid. If you are someone who doesn't normally raid with a group, you'll have Story Mode available to play through it on your own with followers. After completing that raid, you have additional questing which leads into a second raid at a second location: the "March on Zul'Aman" raid. That story necessitated us having the raid take place in two different places and at two different times. The unlock of those raids will be separated by two weeks for Normal/Heroic difficulty, or a single week for Mythic difficulty. We're really excited to see how players respond. And of course, there's that last raid, which is not part of the campaign—the Dream Rift raid. That's a single boss lair where we're fighting a big spooky monster.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Since you mentioned the Story Mode raids, I absolutely love them as someone who doesn't like being part of a giant raid group all the time. Going forward, is the Story Mode raid mechanics continuing to evolve, or has it changed going into World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It's changed numerically in a couple of different ways. We're looking at the final boss of a raid, which is the main loadbearing story boss. The things we see changing are that, well, there are two this time. We have two campaign raids (the Void Spire and March on Zul'Aman), and both of the final bosses will be available on Story Mode. The Dream Rift does not have Story Mode because it's not really part of the campaign.</p>



<p>The second thing is that we've gone backwards into the leveling experience. We identified that Dragonflight is actually a pretty good expansion for new or returning players to learn the ropes. It's entrenched in WoW fantasy (dragons), has varied spaces, and a cool story. We've added Story Mode raids to be able to fight Raszageth, Sarkareth, and Fyrakk as a leveling player while playing through the entire story of that expansion. We're taking the technology that made it possible to use followers and bringing it into Midnight and backwards. For whatever reason, from preference to accessibility and social anxiety, things like follower dungeons and Story Mode raids enable more players to enjoy the story.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WoW_Midnight_Cinematics-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="worldsoul-saga-trilogy">The Worldsoul Saga Trilogy</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): World of Warcraft: Midnight is the middle chapter in the World Soul Saga trilogy. Some creators believe the middle work is the hardest one. Do you agree? And how do you plan to tell a satisfying story for Midnight while serving the larger trilogy arc?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It has been a challenge. Not only is it our first middle chapter, but this is the first time we've intentionally framed multiple expansions as a trilogy. There's been connective tissue before (Gul'dan carrying from Warlords of Draenor, Sylvanas, etc.), but this is the Worldsoul Saga. The Arathi set up in The War Within. We are now exploring their story. The saga between Xal'atath and Alleria has led us to where we are right now, where the Voidstorm is going to attack the Sunwell.</p>



<p>It's been a challenge to make sure players feel comfortable hopping in. If you just want to play Midnight, the story stands on its own. You'll understand who the good guys and bad guys are. If you want to catch up on The War Within, we have a recap feature where you can play through an abbreviated version of that story (major moments, cinematics). We also have "story so far" videos available online and in-game. Second chapters are also often some of the most epic—the dark middle chapter where events from the previous chapter come to full fruition, with unexpected twists and climaxes.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): It's not going to end on a cliffhanger, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It's not the end of the story. I can tell you there will be more story after Season 1 and after Midnight. Call it a cliffhanger or "to be continued," but we're going to have more strings to pull on by the time we're done.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): I know we're coming up to the end of our time with you two. What is your favorite raid, dungeon, or delve for this new expansion that you are most excited for players to see?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> I think right now I'm probably most interested in the Den of Narak dungeon. I got to work alongside the designer responsible for that. The art pitch was really cool: entering the mindspace of a bear that hibernates and survives winter, forcing a group of players to endure those same trials in a surreal landscape. It's you against the environment as well as the enemies. It's not in Season 1 for Mythic Plus, but it will be available at launch. Even the way the sub-zones are named is more like what the bear is dreaming about. It's very evocative.</p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I gotta go with a couple of the Delves. The Shadow Enclave in Eversong Woods—these are darker spaces where we're fighting against dark cultists. You are redirecting light through this space by using mirrors to point light from one pool to another. The designers put together this really cool, easily understood mechanic that feels natural. Another one is Fungal Folly. It is our smallest delve; basically a big arena where you're fighting against Fungarians. As opposed to winding through hallways, the enemies come to you in waves. It flips the script on its head. Plus, Fungarians are silly, and I'm silly.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Housing is perhaps the defining feature of World of Warcraft: Midnight. So far, the reception is very positive. Is there a concern that it might overshadow other content or systems for a while, though?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I'm sure for some people it already has! One of the great things about World of Warcraft is the diverse audience. If you took 15 diehard WoW players and asked what they do, you'd get 15 different answers: raiding, Mythic+, collecting transmogs, and now housing. If you're looking to roleplay, collect decor, and express yourself artistically, then housing might take the spotlight for you. For others, it might not be for them, and that's fine too. The goal has always been to have a lot of fun stuff so you can always feel like, "This is my way to play."</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WoW_Midnight_Zul_Aman-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="zulaman-zone">Zul'Aman: From Raid to Zone</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Old Zul'Aman was one of my absolute favorite zones. How has it changed with its significant glow-up in World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Physically in world space, we went from an area that was a raid (and eventually a dungeon) to a massive zone. We had to bust down the walls and show you what Zul'Aman, the territory, looks like. We remade that original raid space; it's the first thing you run into when you get past their giant wall at the Amani Pass. It'll definitely look familiar. But we took that architecture and characters and combined it with all the surrounding history of the Amani forest trolls and Zul'jin, and basically went to town. We filled in the blanks and created depth for the entire culture.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Was it harder to design a zone when you already had existing lore and a basic area from the raid, compared to starting from scratch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Both have their challenges and rewards. There is so much depth in Zul'jin; he represents the Amani culture effectively all on his own. We wanted to find out what the stories were outside of Zul'jin. We asked, "Why did Zul'jin do the things he did?" and dove into the history of the Amani specifically. You sort of have to play historian and archaeologist, because a lot of Amani history is told through the perspective of other cultures like the Zandalari, the humans, and the blood elves, who see them as antagonists. We had to extrapolate the real story and fill in the blanks to create context for Zul'jin's actions 17 years ago and who the Amani are now. It was challenging, but so rewarding to add puzzle pieces to a landscape we started 15-25 years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Was it hard to tell a story centered on Zul'jin's grandchildren (Zul'jar and Zul'jan) without them living in his shadow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Almost the entirety of the Amani culture lives in his shadow and the consequences of his actions. We will explore that heavily in the campaign narrative and the surrounding local stories in Zul'Aman. They will react to you based on your interactions. If you're playing the same character that adventured through the raid years ago, they'll react to the fact that you slayed one of their most honored leaders. It's interesting to see the after-effects of a raid boss's actions from the perspective of their people.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WoW_Midnight_Prey-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="the-prey-system">All About The Prey System</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): The Prey system feels so novel to World of Warcraft. What inspired it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Inspiration came from a lot of places. We started by looking at Delves and the nemesis bosses (like Zekvir/K'yza) who will pop out and jump you unexpectedly. Players really enjoyed that unpredictability. We wanted to bring those experiences to the outdoor world in a rough way. Since it's outdoors, it caters to the more chill audience, but also to high-end Mythic+ and Raiders doing their world quests. That's why Prey has three difficulties: Normal mode for chill players, and Hard/Nightmare for those looking for a lot of challenge. If you AFK in Nightmare mode, you're probably going to come back to a dead character.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Is the Prey system a spiritual successor to Dragonflight's Great Hunts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> It's not going to feel too similar. The vibe of hunting is there, but Prey is much more focused. I refer to it as a really messed-up bounty hunt. Alor isn't asking you to hunt respectfully like the Centaur; he's asking you to harvest their anguish for his dark Blood Elf magic research. You have a hunt phase where you engage with the outdoor world, and then a final encounter that feels like a really high-tier Delve boss.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): So the goal was to inject a bit more thrill and tension into the open world?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Yeah, the hope is to break up the flow state of routine gameplay. On the higher difficulties, you have to think about moment-to-moment gameplay and your talents, flasks, things you don't usually think about in the outdoor world.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Was it challenging to design content that could serve such a wide range of players without feeling watered down either way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Definitely. We had to figure out how to make players of all skill ranges and classes feel like they can engage and progress. Putting this in the outdoor world was a big challenge. In a dungeon, you're in a controlled space, but outdoors, you have to worry about a random player walking past who isn't on Prey. We had to ensure a smooth progression across the three modes so players wouldn't jump straight into Nightmare, get destroyed, and decide Prey wasn't for them.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): How does it work if you are out in the world doing Prey, and there are other players near you who aren't part of it? If a giant mob ambushes you, does it affect them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Figuring out how to make this feel very personal in an open world was a fun challenge. On Nightmare mode, when an ambush happens, the creature fixates on you. Someone can't just stand on top of you and take aggro. There might be a little AoE splash damage, so they should stay away, but they <em>can</em> help you kill it if they want. It creates spontaneous cooperation. For torments, like an invisible creature fixating you or a puddle of gore appearing under your feet, other players aren't going to see those and won't be affected by them. You might look a little crazy dodging invisible things to other players, but it's a very personal experience.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Did you design the Prey system to be expandable in future seasons or expansions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> I can't speak to future plans, but the Prey system definitely lends itself to all sorts of expansion. We've got 30 different targets across three difficulties in four different zones at launch. It's incredible grounds for reimagination. We'd love to hear what players like about it going forward.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): How easy is it to get out of Prey if you've opted in and suddenly decide it's too much?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> It's very easy. Prey acts like picking up a quest from Alor. If you get into Nightmare mode and realize it's too rich for your blood, you just abandon the quest. Also, if you just want to pause your progress to go do a Mythic+, join a raid, or step away for pizza, you can port out, go to a different zone, or pop into an inn. As soon as you aren't in the zone where your target is, Prey effectively turns off. Your progress is paused, and you can come back to it at any time.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): What is your favorite thing about the new expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Mine is tangential to Prey. Alor, the guy who gives you your Prey quests, his base is in Murder Row. If you remember old Silvermoon, Murder Row was that one little dark, nasty alleyway with warlocks and rogues. It has been expanded into this massive area in New Silvermoon. I just love walking around there, listening to the ambiance, looking at the rogues holed up in the crannies. That dark Blood Elf vibe is perfect.</p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> All of my favorite things are in Zul'Aman! But there's a feature we created called "Abundance." It's an endgame, repeatable feature rooted in Zul'Aman, though found in each zone. The Loa of Abundance is a floating, glowing green rat who acts like a game show host. He wants you to harvest abundance for him in return for professions-themed rewards. It's a very fast-paced, arcade-y romp where you're collecting orbs and triggering jackpots. For something calmer, the ambiance in Midnight is incredible. Hang out in the Temple of Akil'zon or Halazzi in Zul'Aman, or the hot springs at the shrine of Shirvallah with the capybara creatures. For something darker, go to the Myzrael/Myzara cavern dungeon and just listen to the troll necromancer theme music.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s still plenty of months left in the year for someone to steal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-violet-reviews-metacritic-opencritic-dino-crisis-2000658906"><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> crown</span></a><span>, but one new game has already come awfully close to its abysmally low review scores. Unfortunately, this one did have a small amount of hype behind it, as some people were genuinely excited about </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span><em>.</em> The Switch 2 exclusive, </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>-inspired survival horror game was revealed in a Nintendo Direct earlier this month. Now it’s out and getting panned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tokyo-scramble-worst-reviewed-game-2026/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> was released almost two weeks ago, on February 11, but reviewers clearly haven’t been in too much of a rush to cover it. Perhaps this is due in part to a lack of review codes, a lack of interest, or a combination of the two, but the scattered list of review scores resulted in a grim consensus. The dino horror game earned itself just a 19 percent Critic Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble">OpenCritic</a>, and a “Generally Unfavorable” 40 out of 100 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/">Metacritic</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the plus side, because the scores for </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> are still trickling out, </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>has temporarily retaken the throne as the worst-rated game of the year on OpenCritic. A last-minute 66/100 score from </span><i><span>33Bits </span></i><span>helped bump it up to a 48 Top Critic average, a far cry from the 37 score it previously held on February 19, which was three whole points lower than </span><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> average score. I’m sure that will be great news for whoever decided that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> deserved a spot on Nintendo’s Partner Showcase earlier this month.</span></p> <p><span>One thing that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> does have over </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is its user score, which is currently sitting at a respectable 6.6/10 on Metacritic. However, there are only 14 total user reviews for <em>Tokyo Scramble</em> on the site, and the overall score has been slightly influenced by one guy who gave it a 10/10. I’m not usually one to diss random review scores, but that same guy also gave </span><i><span>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</span></i><span> a 0/10 for some indiscernible reason. Also, if we’ve learned anything </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><span>from last month’s</span></a><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> vs. </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> debacle, it’s that you probably shouldn’t put too much stock in Metacritic’s user reviews.</span></p>

            <guid>1445311</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Voice Actor Zeno Robinson has achieved a Black nerd milestone that even Black anime fans thought might never come to pass: playing an honest-to-God Black character in an anime as Jabber in <em>Gachiakuta</em>. It’s a notable accomplishment in the voice acting sphere that’s made it harder and harder for Black actors to succeed.</p><p>Back in 2022, I spoke with <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/AJ-Beckles/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>A.J. Beckles</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Kimberley-Anne-Campbell/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kimberley Anne Campbell</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Zeno-Robinson/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Zeno Robinson</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Anairis-Quinones/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Anairis Quiñones</u></a>—four Black voice actors whose stars were rising across anime series like <em>My Hero Academia</em>, <em>Fire Force</em>, and <em>The Promised Neverland</em>. Even as their careers gained momentum, they were candid about how much harder it had been for them to break into the anime industry because they were Black. Weathering racist backlash whenever their casting was announced, the pressure to contort their voices into what people thought an anime character “should” sound like, and the painful process of unlearning the idea that their blackness was a liability, were common denominators of <a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-black-voice-acting-funimation-crunchyroll-hero-ac-1848603377?ref=aftermath.site"><u>voice acting while being Black</u></a>. But the numerator keeping them going was the responsibility they felt to bring representation behind the mic and leave the door wider for those who come after.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p>Four years later, Robinson and his contemporaries, have become household names as the newest generation of voice actors in big marquee shows Robinson says that while the industry has made followed through on structural progress in hiring more people of color in roles, it still often feels like the burden falls on individual actors like himself to keep pushing that boulder uphill.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, there are many people at work pushing diversity and representation into the animation space. Of them, Robinson shouted out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/6-things-we-liked-and-4-we-didnt-about-your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-2000565111?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</u></em></a>'s showrunner, <a href="https://x.com/MrJeffTrammell?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jeff Trammel</u></a>, on Disney+, where Robinson plays a Black Harry Osborne with fresh braids, and the incomparable Colman Domingo plays a wave-check-ready Norman Osborne. Though the series had its premiere marred with the likes of Hudson Thames, the voice of Peter Parker in Marvel’s <em>What If</em> series, in a <a href="https://collider.com/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-star-woke-concerns-hudson-thames/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Collider </u></em></a>interview, voicing his “biggest fear” that the show <a href="https://gizmodo.com/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-hudson-thames-woke-2000555885?ref=aftermath.site"><u>“was that it was gonna be annoying and woke.”</u></a> While he’d follow up his offbeat comment with praise, lauding the show as “awesome” and “well written,” the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1idpxmb/my_friendly_neighborhood_spiderman_writer_jeff/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>burden fell upon Trammel</u></a>, as it often does with Black people put in a situation where they should otherwise be celebrated for their achievements, to maintain an air of professionalism while also framing Thames’ comments as well-intentioned and misspoken.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpHxpu2xStU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Craig of the Creek is ending but don't be sad! #cartoon #cotc #blerd"></iframe></figure><p>Robinson feels blessed and honored to work with Trammel, a creator who first made his claim to fame with the Cartoon Network show <a href="https://gizmodo.com/cartoon-networks-craig-of-the-creek-is-an-excellent-sho-1824209804?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Craig of the Creek</u></em></a>. The cartoon which ran for seven years before <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1125136/why-ending-cartoon-networks-craig-of-the-creek-is-a-huge-mistake/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>getting cancelled in 2022</u></a> in the wave of Warner Bros. animation purge, with its final episodes later airing in January 2025. Trammel now has a <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-season-2-release-date-venom-1236538273/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>second season of <em>Spider-Man </em>in the wings</u></a>. But while <em>Spider-Man</em> has the Disney machine behind it to keep it going, Robinson feels like animation and anime as a whole are in a bit of a dry spell, with little push for diversity behind the mic and on screen. Robinson says this lack of momentum mirrors a broader political climate in which <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>DEI is treated as a manufactured threat</u></a>, and that the fallout has affected the creative industry as well, making it more risk‑averse.</p><p>“The projects that are there have been amazing and great, and I’m fortunate to be able to work on cool things still, but I think companies aren’t making a lot of things and thus not making new stories. I also think, as DEI has kind of become this big spooky word, and programs that helped underrepresented creators are disappearing, the fight sort of starts over and becomes harder to get feet in the door and be seen,” Robinson said. “There are definitely really cool things still happening, but honestly, the truth is that everything’s a bit slow right now. I think the pendulum always swings back and forth, and it’s just swinging the other way this time around.”</p><p>While Robinson wouldn’t say companies aren’t actively hiring Black people in the industry, the space is in a completely different place than it was a couple of years ago, when it felt more experimental and progressive, with bigger, riskier swings. Now, everybody’s a little more reserved with the industry being a little slower with making and greenlighting projects, and by proxy, fewer work opportunities for everyone. Black folks in particular have been impacted, unless they’re auditioning for works clearly influenced by Black culture, like Sony’s recently released animated film, <em>Goat</em>, starring <em>Stranger Things</em> standout Caleb McLaughlin.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oMke8X0f7RM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="THE COMIC SHOP | A Workplace Comedy - PILOT"></iframe></figure><p>The only alternative route is for folks to do what industry leaders like <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-bell-finally-tolls-for-tyler-perry/"><u>Tyler Perry purport to do</u></a>, by making their own things for Black audiences to enjoy. Black, queer filmmaker <a href="https://x.com/CheyenneTheGeek/status/1986921873779871753?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cheyenne Ewulu</u></a> did this with her <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheyennethegeek/the-comic-shop-a-mockumentary-sitcom?ref=aftermath.site"><u>crowd-funded</u></a> workplace comedy series, <a href="https://x.com/CheyenneTheGeek/status/2001368858079486028?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Comic Shop</u></em></a>, which Robinson stars in.

Both projects provide proof of power that there’s a desire for Black voices in the space and an audience for them.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zf7bsmT-Jn0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Pretty Pretty Please I Don’t Want to be a Magical Girl (PILOT ANIMATIC)"></iframe></figure><p>Although it’s become harder for voice actors—especially actors of color—to find their footing in the industry lately, one bright spot that’s made the<a href="https://www.cbr.com/kei-urana-apologizes-for-gachiakuta-live-action-actors-in-blackface/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> long-beleaguered Black representation in anime</u></a> feel genuinely exhilarating is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-doesnt-just-redefine-shonen-anime-it-anoints-itself-as-the-next-big-thing-2000622249?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Gachiakuta</u></em></a>.

And in the dub, Robinson has been on a tear, bringing villain Jabber to life with an unapologetically Black performance that’s become a major draw for viewers—a rare feat in an era when <a href="https://kotaku.com/video/chainsaw-man-anime-subs-dubs-denji-makima-crunchyroll-1849825038?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the old subs‑versus‑dubs debate</u></a> somehow still rages on in 2026, despite how <a href="https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-magic-system-anime/"><u>strong the show already is on its own merits</u></a>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GDix8EdaG4w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Zanka vs Jabber | Gachiakuta"></iframe></figure><p>When he first read <em>Gachiakuta </em>and saw Jabber on the page, Robinson told me his reaction was essentially, “A Black dude in this manga? Heck yeah.” Figuring that’s how a lot of fans felt too, his goal in the dub, he said, was to lean into that—embracing the cultural threads woven throughout the series and making that presence unmistakable rather than muted.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Zankalings flocking as one 🥹 <a href="https://t.co/kVPXJOuKvk?ref=aftermath.site">https://t.co/kVPXJOuKvk</a> <a href="https://t.co/nYq7WexaYY?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/nYq7WexaYY</a></p>— Corey Wilder 🎙🍉 - Is the NUMBAH ONE Enjin Fan 🤓 (@WilderCorey) <a href="https://twitter.com/WilderCorey/status/2023539165598806223?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">February 16, 2026</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>“I see people try to do that with Yoruichi, like, ‘Oh, Yoruichi actually might be Southeast Asian or Indian,’” Robinson said. “What it can feel like is whenever Black people sort of see themselves in a character, there will be people who will try to see that character as anything other than black, which can feel a little racist.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q7e4bA11HlA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Yoruichi Beating Askin — With Style 😎 | BLEACH: Thousand-Year Blood War (ENGLISH DUB) | VIZ"></iframe></figure><p>Robinson wanted to cut through that noise and make sure there was no question in the English dub over Jabber’s Black identity. He wanted Jabber’s Blackness to feel intentional, grounded, and undeniable in every line he and the dubbing team took to enrich Jabber with the exaggerated swagger of a Black teen, as it were, from the way he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eqm9Hd6F5zc&amp;t=38s&amp;pp=ygUSamFiYmVyIGdhY2hpYWt1dGEg&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>talks, freestyles, and disses <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s protagonists</u></a>.</p><p>It’s one thing to voice a character people casually accept as Black, but it’s entirely different—and far more rewarding—for Robinson to play a character who is unmistakably Black or clearly shaped by Black culture.&nbsp;</p><p>“Someone just sent me a Katsucon video of a crowd of people singing the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgYebzDi_Bk&amp;pp=ygUSamFiYmVyIGdhY2hpYWt1dGEg&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jabber rap</u></a> in the middle of a group of cosplaying Jabbers, and I felt myself sort of getting a bit emotional about it,” he said. “The rap was something I heavily contributed in making [and] our version of it that has sort of taken on this life of its own, ingrained not just in the culture of Black people, but the culture of Gachiakuta [and] how it's received in the world. To see so many Black people embrace that was really heartwarming for me.”</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>wow. I’m speechless yall.

</figure><p>Unfortunately, as was the case four years ago, the loudest racists online still make it their mission to harass Black fans for simply enjoying seeing themselves represented in anime. Sometimes it’s friendly fire, like the guy who briefly became Twitter’s main character for accusing Robinson of lacking an “afro heart”—whatever that’s supposed to mean—only for the phrase to immediately become a meme that <a href="https://x.com/childishgamzeno/status/1960776901963997660?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>he</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/AJBecklesVO/status/1960760114778136639?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Beckles</u></a>, <a href="https://x.com/anairis_q/status/1960699449094889711?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Quiñones</u></a>, and <a href="https://x.com/search?q=afro+heart&amp;src=typed_query&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>the rest of Black Twitter gleefully roasted</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">have yall seen this??

</figure><p>But the more insidious detractors are the ones who try to gatekeep anime from Black fans altogether, despite Black audiences playing a massive role in pushing the medium into the mainstream. One moment that crystallizes how absurd the backlash can get was in 2024 when a young fan drew Okarun as Black because Beckles voices him in <em>Dan Da Dan</em>, only to be swarmed by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/racists-are-trying-to-make-dan-da-dan-the-latest-front-in-their-culture-war-2000536054?ref=aftermath.site"><u>chuds furious that a harmless piece of fan art</u></a> was somehow “insulting” to the Japanese creators. Beckles changed his profile picture to the fan’s drawing in solidarity, which only made the trolls angrier. It’s a perfect snapshot of how representation in anime, whether in <em>Gachiakuta </em>or <em>Dan Da Dan</em>, still brings out the worst in people who have nothing better to do than police who get to enjoy a medium that’s made for everyone.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I ended up doing them :3 <a href="https://t.co/Oe8LlrJKGu?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/Oe8LlrJKGu</a></p>— 𝗟𝘆𝗻𝗻 🐡 comms closed (sorry guys) (@Lynn6Thorex) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lynn6Thorex/status/1863074026773471529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>The last time we spoke, Robinson told me that if he saw a hateful remark aimed at himself or other Black folks in the voiceover community, he’d clap back. He’s since learned to be more intentional about where he puts his energy. It’s not because he’s lost the smoke, but because he’s realized there are healthier, more productive ways to respond when racists start chirping on the timeline—especially since a lot of them are financially incentivised to engagement farm on Twitter nowadays.</p><p>“It’s not that my fire for speaking out and being outspoken against what’s wrong has died down in any capacity. I think anyone who knows me knows that. I think now I’m at a place where I’m trying to figure out how to best channel that fire, instead of aiming it at everything I find wrong with the world, and I look up, and I’ve been in the trenches for like 3 hours,” he said. “I want to find better, more effective, and impactful ways to use my voice. I want to still be the person who isn’t afraid to speak up; I just want to do so more intentionally and effectively.”</p><p>As Robinson puts it, there will always be people who refuse to understand him, no matter how patient or levelheaded he tries to be. So instead of burning energy arguing with them, he’d rather pour that effort back into becoming a better artist and leading by example in ways that actually matter. Still, the notion that race shouldn’t be a factor in voice acting is one Robinson finds funny because it’s always the topic of conversation, good or bad, whenever he gets announced for a new role that’s a problem Black folks face more often than not than other ethnicities.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>“Turn up the volume!!”</p><p>PRAISE.

</figure><p>“I think it’s antithetical to the idea that my race doesn't matter. I think it does matter, and that's okay. What should matter more than my race is the quality of the art that I produce, or that I am able to sort of play X, Y, Z character.” Robinson said. “For Black voice actors, I want to say now is the best time because there's simply more of us now,” he continued. “I live in a time when I can be confused with A.J. Beckles because there is another prominent black voice actor working on major properties. So, as humorous as that is, I'll always see it as a blessing because it means we're starting to become less tokenized and we're starting to become more homogenized within the industry.”</p><p>Likewise, other Black voice actors—<a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Gabe-Kunda/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Gabe Kunda</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Corey-Wilder/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Corey Wilder</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Shara-Kirby/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Shara Kirby</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Kimoy-Lee/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kimoy Lee</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Amber-May/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Amber May</u></a>, <a href="https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Kevin-Thelwell/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kevin D. Thelwell</u></a>—are steadily building their résumés, chipping away at the barriers Robinson once felt he and his contemporaries had to shoulder alone. But the challenge of voice acting while Black has shifted in 2026. Now, instead of the herculean task of breaking into the industry being the sole hurdle, they have to navigate being public figures—whether they want to be or not—while also fighting to maintain space for themselves in a landscape where their presence and race are constantly politicized and scrutinized.</p><p>“[It’s] because I am a Black man, and my race is so evident. I live in a world that forces me to be political because of how the world views people of color and Black people,” Robinson said, adding that this barrier isn’t exclusive to being Black in voice acting but being Black in 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>“The challenge for all of us is existing in a world where our race is being looked at more critically,” he said. “You will get the racist comments. Your race will be looked at under a magnifying glass at some point in your career. It does not matter how much you don't want that to happen. If you're Black, that is the thing that will most likely happen at least once.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Crunchyroll/Bones Film</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the end, Robinson feels that Black voice actors are still navigating many of the same obstacles he faced years ago—only now the pressure has intensified. The political climate has made conversations about race and representation even more fraught, and with so little work being produced, every opportunity comes with heightened scrutiny for Black performers trying to build a name for themselves in a predominantly white industry. As he puts it, the biggest hurdles remain access and scale, but the slowdown across animation means there simply isn’t much happening for anyone right now. All he and his peers can do, he says, is keep pushing forward, keep growing as artists, and persevere through a landscape that hasn’t gotten easier, just tighter.</p><p>“The industry has to embrace art again, and artistic voices and integrity again, but in the meantime, individual artists and more indie studios are picking up the torch. So many shows and projects about other cultures have been cancelled or ended prematurely. I think what really needs to happen in the next 5-10 years is a return to making art, and creating opportunities for the artists to make that art, which gives us as artists more diverse worlds to play in.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord won’t roll out age verification globally on its platform next month as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out">previously announced</a>, and says in a blog post that it’s <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">delaying the launch</a> until the second half of 2026. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why,” writes Discord CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy.</p><p>Discord says that before it rolls out age verification globally, it will add more options for users to verify their age (including with a credit card), include documentation of every verification vendor used, add an option for “spoiler channels” in Discord as an alternative to age-gated channels for walling off certain topics, and publish a technical blog post explaining how its age estimation systems work.</p><p>In countries where laws currently require the use of verification platforms, like the UK, Australia, and soon Brazil, the post says, “any adult who tries to access age-restricted content will need to verify their age through a vendor like k-ID to get access.”</p><p>The delay follows user backlash after Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out">announced plans</a> to set accounts to a “teen-appropriate” experience by default unless they could be verified as adults. Discord claims that the plan will only affect about 10 percent of accounts, as most don’t interact with age-restricted content, change default safety settings, or already have their age determined by its internal systems.</p><p>The blog post also provided more information on how those internal systems work to estimate age and decide who to potentially prompt for verification:</p><div><blockquote><p>Discord already runs safety systems that catch spam rings, prevent raids, and detect coordinated abuse, powered by our rules engine (which we just open sourced as Osprey for other platforms to use). Age determination works the same way, using the same category of account-level signals: how long your account has existed, whether you have a payment method on file, what types of servers you’re in, and general patterns of account activity. It does not read your messages, analyze your conversations, or look at the content you post. We know “trust us” isn’t enough here, which is why we’ll publish the methodology before global launch.</p></blockquote></div><p>Some of the criticism stemmed from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">a data breach</a> at one of Discord’s third-party vendors last year that exposed user info and scanned photo IDs; however, Discord says it works with outside vendors so that it doesn’t associate accounts with identification data, while the vendors can’t associate the data with Discord accounts either. Discord has also said that it has since stopped working with the vendor involved in that data breach.</p><p>Users were also concerned about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/878369/discord-persona-age-verification">age verification provider Persona</a>, which Discord used to run a “limited test” for age verification in the UK in January. Discord added in Tuesday’s blog post that it plans to offer more transparency on its age verification vendors, stating: “We’ve also set a new requirement: any partner offering facial age estimation must perform it entirely on-device. If they don’t meet that bar, we won’t work with them.” Now, it says Persona did not meet that bar.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/policy/883852/discord-age-verification-global-walkback-delay]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1445272</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, Jedi and giant space battles are cool and an important part of the<em> Star Wars</em> franchise. But as I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-games-dont-always-need-to-include-jedi-1840696384">not every <em>Star Wars</em> game needs to include lightsabers and Force powers</a>. Thankfully, later this year, we are getting <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>, a very different kind of <em>Star Wars</em> game that is promising a fast-paced racing experience similar to past games like S<em>tar Wars: Racer’s Revenge.</em> If that sounds like something you want to know more about, well, just keep on scrolling down to learn even more about <em>Galactic Racer</em>.</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced during the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is a high-speed arcade-like racing game that will feature a full single-player story featuring new and old characters and plenty of different race tracks to speed around on.</p> <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> launching?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but it is scheduled to launch sometime in 2026.</p>

 <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2> <p>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>  <h2>Is there podracing in this game?</h2> <p>Yes! Fans were a bit nervous that <em>Galactic Racer</em> might not feature podracing when its first teaser trailer didn’t feature any podracers.<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-racing-game-podracing-confirmed-2000665131"> But the devs have since confirmed that yes</a>, it will include podracing, and a new trailer even shows it off. But it should also be clear that this isn’t exclusively a podracing game, but a <em>Star Wars</em> racing game that will let players mix and match different types of speeders and other vehicles together.</p> <h2>Is it true that some former <em>Burnout</em> devs are making this?</h2> <p>Yup. Fuse Games is a studio formed by a bunch of developers who previously worked at Criterion on games like<em> Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">So these folks know speed and racing</a>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> an open-world game?</h2> <p>No! <em>Galactic Racer</em> isn’t an open-world racing game like <em>Forza Horizon</em> or<em> Burnout Paradise</em>. Instead, it is a track-based racer similar to older <em>Burnout</em> titles.</p> <h2>Is there multiplayer in the game?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://www.pcgames.de/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer-Spiel-75467/News/star-wars-galactic-racer-tga-1488889/">Fuse Games says 12 people will be able to race together online</a>. There will also be some sort of online ranking system.</p>

 <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> set in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is set after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em> But beyond that, the creators behind the game don’t seem to be too worried about <em>Galactic Racer</em>‘s placement in the grander <em>Star Wars</em> canon. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">Here’s what Fuse Games CEO and founder Matt Webster told <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“I don’t think it really matters. As you say, you’re on Jakku after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi,</em> the galactic civil war is over, and that’s where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don’t think we’re ever specific about timeline beyond that.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Wait, was that Sebulba from <em>The Phantom Menace</em>?</h2> <p>Yes, it was. But he is older now and sports a cool beard. Maybe he’s learned his lesson after cheating against Anakin and other racers all those years ago. But I doubt it…</p>  <h2>Will <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> include a battle pass or seasons?</h2> <p>When asked about seasons in the previously mentioned <em>IGN</em> interview, Webster bluntly said “No” and said the game is a “premium” release.</p>

 <p>“We have our campaign, and we have arcade mode, and we have multiplayer, and it’s a self-contained thing,” said the CEO. “But what we also recognize is that the landscape of <em>Star Wars</em> evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more<em> Star Wars</em> or new<em> Star Wars</em> over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post-launch is going to look like, [seasons are] not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that’s not what we are making.”</p> <h2>Will you be able to walk around on foot in <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p>Yes! Your main character in the game’s campaign is named Shade, and they will be able to walk around a social hub area and interact with NPCs while also being able to upgrade their vehicles.</p> <h2>This is cool and all, but I wish we’d get a big <em>KOTOR</em>-like RPG <em>Star Wars</em> game again…</h2> <p>Good news, that’s also a thing that is happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">You can learn more about it here!</a></p>

            <p>
The time is upon us! The time to once again become radical, as from the ashes of developers Radical Entertainment and Hothead Games a sort of but not really new studio has been born: New Radical Games. It does seem like Hothead drew the short straw here name wise. But given that Radical were known for the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prototype">Prototype</a> games, and Hothead made, uh, The Baconing, the choice feels apt.
</p>
<p>
This, as spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/simpsons-hit-run-and-prototype-studio-radical-entertainment-is-back-as-new-radical-games/">VGC</a>, was revealed not so much with a bang, but more of a snazzy, seemingly new <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">website</a> that is adorned with imagery of the old Radical's games like the aforementioned beloved Simpsons game, alongside references to Prototype and a couple of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crash-bandicoot">Crash Bandicoot</a> games they made too.
</p>
<p>
Heading up this somewhat new venture as CEO is Ian Wilkinson, one of the original Radical's co-founders, and also the former president of Hothead Games before they shut down in December 2024. Over on Wilkinson's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ian-wilkinson-28658912/">LinkedIn</a>, it says he's been CEO and president of New Radical Games since the same time period, but with the website seemingly being quite new, it's unclear how long they've actually been around for (a <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/post/welcome-to-new-radical-website">blog post</a> on the site is dated from April 11, 2025, so, it's at least that old). Joining him around the top as COO is Tim Bennison, previously Capcom Vancouver's studio director, but since 2020 also worked at Hothead, also as COO.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what they'll actually be making, well, New Radical Games' website says they can do things like work for hire full game development, co-dev, porting, and remastering. This certainly doesn't sound like they've got anything original in the pipeline, and I truly wouldn't place any bets on anything Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run right now given how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/matt-selman-simpsons-hit-and-run-remake">complicated it sounds like it would be to wrangle even a remake</a>. At least this might explain that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prototype-remaster-speculation-kicks-into-super-gear-after-a-surprise-steam-update-adds-to-its-credits">odd Prototype update from last year</a>?

            <link>https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309</link>
            <guid>1445245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Discord hears you. It gets your concerns. It wants to win back your trust. That’s the message from cofounder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who announced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">company’s controversial new age-verification requirements will be delayed</a>, but not reversed, as it works to try to better explain what’s happening to its millions of users. “We’ve made mistakes,” he wrote.</p> <p>Vishnevskiy says he’s just like you, getting off work and hopping on voice chat with friends while playing games like <em>Baby Steps</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Leveraging his gamer cred, the executive tried to quell the recent backlash while making clear that nothing is fundamentally changing about the age-verification rollout coming, other than the timing and optics. For Discord, the issue appears to be a failure to properly communicate the policy rather than the policy itself.</p>

 <p>“In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works,” he <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">wrote in today’s update</a>. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”</p> <p>Vishnevskiy continued, “We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you.” He then went on to insinuate that Discord’s hands are tied as new regulation rolls out across more countries and U.S. states. The company promises more transparency about its vendors and processes, but otherwise nothing about the age-verification rollout is fundamentally changing other than the timing.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the newly delayed rollout will work as outlined <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">on Discord’s website</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>We’re delaying our global rollout to the second half of 2026.</strong>&nbsp;Where we have legal obligations, we will continue to meet them, but we will only expand globally after we’ve done the following:</p></blockquote> <ol role="list"> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Adding more verification options.</strong>&nbsp;We already had alternatives in development, including credit card verification. We’ll complete and expand those before scaling globally so you have more options you’re comfortable with.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Vendor transparency.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll document every verification vendor and their practices on our website, and make it clear in the product who each vendor is. We’ve also set a new requirement: any partner offering facial age estimation must perform it entirely on-device. If they don’t meet that bar, we won’t work with them.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A new spoiler channel option.</strong>&nbsp;We know many communities use age-restricted channels not for adult content, but for topics people prefer to engage with on their own terms: spoilers, politics, and heavier conversations. We’re building a dedicated spoiler channel option so communities don’t have to age-gate their server just to give members that choice.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A technical blog post before global launch.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll publish a detailed post explaining how our automatic age determination systems work, including the signal categories and privacy constraints. So you can evaluate our approach for yourselves.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Age assurance data in our transparency reports.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll include how many users were asked to verify, what methods they used, and how often our automated systems handled it without any user action.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>The apologetic backpedaling comes after weeks of Discord users pushing back on new requirements that would require some users to submit photos and IDs to the gaming chat platform if its AI tools decide you’re not over the age of 18 and you try to access “adult” content servers. A prior “<a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570">experiment</a>” with this new policy that was implemented in the UK became a lightning rod for some frustrated users when it was revealed that one of the vendors involved in the process, a firm called Persona, was backed by funds from surveillance company Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel.</p>

 <p>Discord later said it cut ties with the vendor and that it has new safeguards in place to prevent user data from being hacked as it accidentally was last fall. But the bubbling cauldron of AI surveillance, data security concerns, and Discord’s reportedly impending IPO has left even some of its most hardcore users skeptical.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to see what’s lined up for the next season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elder-scrolls-online/" id="354">The Elder Scrolls Online</a>. The team announced that the 2026 Season Direct presentation will be held on March 31 at 3:00 p.m. ET on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda-2/" id="3469">Bethesda</a>‘s Twitch channel.</p>



<p>The presentation will lay out the year ahead, providing a roadmap of content for 2026 in The Elder Scrolls Online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-history-of-the-elder-scrolls-online">History of The Elder Scrolls Online</h2>



<p>The Elder Scrolls Online has been active for over 12 years, first launching on PC in April 2014. It launched on current-generation consoles in 2021. In 2025, the developers discussed enabling cross-play across multiple platforms, noting they were working on technical changes to make it possible. After full comments here.</p>



<p>The game has actually been in development since 2007, nearly 20 years ago. As fans of the franchise continue to await Elder Scrolls 6, TES Online provides a steady experience. Speaking of the sixth Elder Scrolls game, don’t expect it anytime soon. However, we do know the game will be powered by Creation Engine 3, as Todd Howard recently shared.</p>











<p>Even though The Elder Scrolls 6 is a long way away, at least one Elder Scrolls game is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 very soon. </p>



<p>During a Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase earlier in the month, Bethesda confirmed Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered for Nintendo Switch 2 as part of its growing third-party lineup. That game will be coming out in 2026. Learn more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026/" id="174499">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro shareholders who filed a lawsuit last month against the company, alleging its management was overprinting Magic: The Gathering Cards, breaching its fiduciary duty, and deceiving consumers, have decided to drop the suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A notice of voluntary dismissal filed last week (and spotted by <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2026/02/23/hasbro-shareholders-drop-suit-alleging-toymaker-overprinted-magic-the-gathering-card-sets/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rhode Island Current</a>) shows Joseph Crocono and Ultain McGlone dropping the case without prejudice, suggesting they may attempt to file again at a later date. There are no further details in the notice as to the reason the lawsuit was dropped.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - "Prints Charming" Secret Lair Drop</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit, filed in January, alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement, abuse of control, and violations of the Exchange Act on the part of Hasbro management. Its primary claim revolved around the idea that leadership was steering the company poorly by overprinting card sets, thereby devaluing the existing ones and putting the company on track to financial ruin. In particular, it named the culprit as Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, alleging that the company was teeing up the crossover sets to release any time the other segments of its business were struggling and the company needed cash to make up for the shortfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And indeed, Hasbro subsidiary Wizards of the Coast has been printing more sets in recent years than in the past, though its revenue has been increasing along with it. In fact, upon its last earnings call, it was revealed that Magic just had its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-just-had-its-most-successful-year-everagain">most successful year ever</a>, in no small part thanks to the very sets that the lawsuit claims were at issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, the lawsuit claimed that Hasbro management essentially faked being out of stock of the controversial, extremely expensive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-players-are-up-in-arms-over-999-dollar-anniversary-set">Magic 30th Anniversary Set</a> in order to encourage demand, sharing testimonies from former company leadership claiming that they had opted to "pause" sales to give the appearance of the product being out of stock. With the lawsuit dismissed, the merit of this anecdote in particular remains up in the air. It is worth noting that in the weeks since the lawsuit, Wizards of the Coast has put out another <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-newest-product-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud">controversial, weirdly-priced card offering</a> in its "Prints Charming" Secret Lair set, which consists of five identical listings, all at different prices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering is gearing up for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-preview">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set</a>, which releases on March 6.

The Stitcher and Venator pistols have also had their headshot multipliers reduced. These are targeted nerfs from Embark that will have a noticeable impact on PvP lobbies, while buffs for the Jupiter and Aphelion will likely make them more useful across the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PvE players will likely appreciate the update’s improvements for the two energy weapons, but they didn’t make it out of Shrouded Sky without also facing nerfs. Let’s rip the Band-Aid off: the Deadline, Trailblazer, Wolfpack, and Showstopper will now be much more difficult to craft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As each piece of equipment can be extremely useful when taking down Arc, Embark is asking players to gather at least one more Arc resource to build them. That’s not so bad in the case of the Vita Spray, which only requires an additional Tick Pod. The Wolfpack and its flurry of aerial homing explosives, on the other hand, now asks Raiders for one Rocketeer Driver per craft. The Rocketeer resource is quite rare and notoriously difficult to farm, making this one of the more substantial crafting adjustments and a steep ask for PvE fans.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders - Shrouded Sky Update Images</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew Shrouded Sky would be one of Embark’s biggest updates so far, but the version 1.17.0 patch notes reveal more highlights following its launch earlier today.

Raiders will also notice that troublesome feats can now be rerolled three times per day, while PvP feats have been removed entirely.

Scouts have spotted two new ARC types in the Rust Belt; we advise caution while the storm runs its course, but those who know how to read the weather will find opportunity in the chaos.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What’s New?</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Hurricane Map Condition</li><li>Two New ARC Enemies</li><li>The Weather Monitoring System - Seasonal Player Project</li><li>Free Raider Deck</li><li>Dam Battlegrounds Map Update</li><li>Expedition Window</li><li>Facial Hair Customization</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Read more here:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-content-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shrouded Sky update: The hurricane strikes</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-content-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 23, 2026</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Patch Highlights</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Weapon balancing for Stitcher, Kettle, Venator, Jupiter and Aphelion.</li><li>Added a piano as an interactable object in the world.</li><li>Prevented enabling all NVIDIA Freestyle filters simultaneously to remove an unfair visual advantage.</li><li>Feats can now be rerolled three times per day for free.</li><li>Removed PvP Feats, updated a few existing Feats and added a few new ones.</li><li>Ziplines can no longer be placed on carryable objects.</li><li>Mines, traps, or remote flares can no longer be placed on other deployables.</li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Balance Changes</strong></h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapons</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.13 we shipped an update that included an optimization fix for our weapons, but as many of you noticed this had the unforeseen consequence of lowering the total fire-rate of semi-automatic weapons. In 1.13.1 we reverted that fix, but something else made it into the update that shouldn't have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of you have reported a "shadow buff" to the weapons, and after investigating it we found that 1.13.1 had inadvertently impacted our weapon input buffers. Where you previously would have to time your inputs to the intended cadence of a weapon to reach its full potential, you could now instead spam-click the button, effectively bypassing any skill requirement to learn the weapon's cadence. We want to keep some of that skill expression, but we also recognize that what we had previously didn't feel very responsive. To address that and land in some sort of middle ground, we have since added more levers for us to control the weapon input buffering window on a gun-to-gun basis, and we've adjusted the semi-automatic weapons accordingly. The weapons should now still be more responsive to fire when spam-clicking, but the players who choose to pace their shots will see better results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these changes, we've also been looking into the balance between our low tier and high tier weapons. A lot of you have expressed concerns that some low tier weapons outperform our higher tier weapons at significantly reduced cost, and we're hoping to shift that balance a bit while still keeping some of that flexibility to punch above your weight if you are skilled enough. We're starting by reducing the overall TTK of the Stitcher and Kettle, and increasing the maneuverability of the Aphelion and Jupiter. We're also taking a second stab at the Venator, which still seems to be dominating a lot of our PvP encounters.</p><strong>Stitcher</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Stitcher has played its role well as a close quarter weapon that rewards thoughtful positioning, but we've found that its fast TTK can sometimes lead to situations where you're ambushed and killed before you have much time to react. As many of you have pointed out, the high headshot damage is a large contributor to this problem. The TTK is often fine when the weapon is aimed at the center of mass, but when you get close enough to land the majority of the shots in your target's head, we see TTK numbers that are much faster than other weapons. These changes aim to bring that headshot TTK a bit closer to the body shot TTK by both reducing the full-spray accuracy of the weapon, and reducing the headshot multiplier.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 1.75</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 7 to 6.5</li><li>Increased Per Shot Dispersion by around 50% (Making it bloom faster)</li></ul><strong>Kettle</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>The Kettle has been in a bit of a weird place. Its high damage output was intended to be used in a more medium range setting at a more deliberate pace, but we see many of you bringing it up in close quarters and effectively turning into an SMG. We want to distinguish it more from the Stitcher, but we also see that you enjoy the versatility of this weapon. So we're reducing the base damage to bring its TTK more in line, but we're keeping the high headshot multiplier to see if we can push players to go for more headshots.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Damage from 10 to 8.5</li></ul><strong>Venator</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note:</strong> Since the last nerfs to the Venator in 1.3.0, we've kept an eye on our data to see how it performs. During this time many of you have raised concerns that it's still dominating in PVP, and our data has shown that it is one of the highest performing weapons in the game right now. For a weapon of this tier we want it to perform well, but maybe not this well. We're looking at an overall nerf to its damage to bring down its TTK, and if that doesn't work we might need to look into its ammo consumption and cost efficiency.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Headshot Multiplier from 2.5 to 2</li><li>Reduced Base Damage from 9 to 8</li></ul><strong>Jupiter</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>In PVP, the Jupiter does the most headshot damage in the game, but it's quite difficult to hit headshots with it at longer ranges. You're also quite vulnerable when you use it in closer ranges since missing one shot will make you a sitting target until you either reload or swap weapons. We're increasing how much you zoom when you use ADS to give you a better view of the targets you're trying to hit, and we're reducing its equip and unequip time to make it easier to swap to a secondary weapon to follow up on your shot.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Improved ADS Magnification from ~1.9x to ~2.2x</li><li>Improved Equip Time from 1.2s to 1.05s</li><li>Improved Unequip Time from 0.9s to 0.75s</li></ul><strong>Aphelion</strong><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dev Note: </strong>We weren't quite happy with the previous balancing of the Aphelion. It was intended to be a more PVP focused legendary weapon, but it couldn't quite keep up with the pacing of many of our other PVP weapons. We've made some changes to make it feel less bulky and a bit more nimble to use, to make it more viable in PVP.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced Base Reload Time from 4.5s to 3.5s</li><li>Reduced Time Between Shots from 0.9s to 0.7s</li><li>Reduced Vertical Recoil by ca 50%</li><li>Improved ADS Settle Speed by ca 35%</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Item and Crafting</strong></h3><strong>Energy clip</strong><ul data-cy="list"><li>Now available by default in the Workbench.</li></ul><strong>Item Value and Cost Changes</strong><p

Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time. We also leverage broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques to spot patterns that aren’t obvious at first glance. These methods take longer to develop, must adapt as game systems change, and don’t always offer instant certainty the way blunt software detections can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve recently taken action against different exploits and we are further tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement. Serious infractions now carry stricter consequences. Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior. Recent updates to Family Sharing have strengthened our ability to curb misconduct and streamlined the removal of bad actors from the game. We are preparing to launch a systematic manual review of ban appeals. The game is young and the volume of telemetry is enormous, but this process ensures every case is handled with care as we continue to learn quickly and invest heavily in the precision of our enforcement tools.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our dedicated anti-cheat team works tirelessly to keep the game fair. It’s an ongoing fight, and we’re committed to it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">//Ossen<br>And the ARC Raiders Team</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/xbox-co-founder-suggests-the-brand-is-being-sunsetted/</link>
            <guid>1445209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>One of the original team who pushed for the creation of the first Xbox, Seamus Blackley,&nbsp; has suggested that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, has been appointed to see the gradual wind down of the brand – because it’s nothing to do with AI.</p>
<p>“Xbox, like a lot of businesses that aren’t the core AI business, is being sunsetted,” Blackley told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/what-an-xbox-founder-thinks-of-the-new-xbox-ceo-seamus-blackley-interview/">Gamesbeat</a>. “They don’t say that, but that’s what’s happening. I expect that the new CEO, Asha Sharma, her job is going to be as a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night.”</p>


<p>“It just seems really true. I imagine asking somebody if it made sense to put a major motion picture studio into the hands of somebody who didn’t like movies, or a major record label into the hands of somebody who’d never seen a live show. Why would you do that?” he adds.</p>
<p>“The job of all these people is to just gently usher all of these business units into the new world of AI,” he continues. “That’s what you’re seeing here. Whether or not you agree with it, whether you agree with AI having the potential to do that, whether AI will be successful, is a separate matter. But that’s what we’re seeing.”</p>
<p>He also had some views on how the gaming community would react to Sharma’s appointment, first stating the gamers are very tolerant of non-gamers telling them what to believe, but then make it’s clear he is joking, “No, they’re not tolerant of any of these things.

<p>Baldur is described as Odin’s most dangerous weapon. He’s also described as charismatic and razor-sharp with a tongue. He was cursed as a boy with the inability to feel pleasure and physical sensation; he replaced those feelings with anger and bloodlust.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/death-stranding-2-pc-specs-revealed-along-with-performance-enhancing-options/</link>
            <guid>1445155</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has announced the requirements for the PC version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, some free DLC, and the performance options for the game.</p>
<p>“Death Stranding 2 for PC offers a range of Graphics Presets from Low to Very High, catering to both budget gaming PC’s and high-end systems,” say Nixxes, who are handling the port. “We’ve also added a Portable preset, aimed at handheld gaming devices, for those Porters who want to “keep on keeping on” while on the go.”</p>



<p>The performance-enhancing options are a special Chinese herb that has been used for millennia, which guarantees at least three extra inches to satisfy…. wait, wrong press release.</p>
<p><em>“The PC edition of Death Stranding 2 launches with support for NVIDIA DLSS 4, AMD FSR 4 and Intel XESS 2. Both upscaling and frame generation options are available for all technologies.”</em></p>

<p><em>“For the first time on PC, you’ll find Pico as an option in Upscale Settings. This “Progressive Image Compositor” is developed by Guerrilla for the Decima engine and is the same upscaling technology that’s used for Death Stranding 2 on PS5. Pico upscaling can be used with all supported graphics cards and can be combined with the various options for frame generation offered in the game.”</em></p>
<p><em>“All upscaling options can be used in combination with Dynamic Resolution Scaling, or with an upscaling quality setting of choice to improve performance. Native AA options are also available for maximum fidelity.”</em></p>
<p>You will also be able to play on ultra-wide screens if you have one, with all of the cut scenes in 21:9 aspect ratio and gameplay in 32:9 ratio.&nbsp; If you do not have an ultra-wide screen monitor you can still play in those resolutions but with some black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>This mode will also be coming to the PS5 version of the game, and PS5 players will also get the Porter Suit: Link and Patch: Link for free when the game launches on PC.</p>

<p>I reviewed the PS5 version of Death Stranding 2<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/23/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/"> scoring it 8/10.</a> “Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end,” said I. “The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can’t help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor.”</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-amazon-series-rebel-moons-ed-skrein-will-play-baldur/</link>
            <guid>1445152</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ed Skrein</strong>, who you might recognize as the main antagonist in the first <strong>Deadpool</strong> movie or as the antagonist in Zack Snyder's ridiculous <strong>Rebel Moon</strong> films has been tapped by <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Productions </strong>to play <strong>Baldur</strong> in the upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>.</p>



<p>Skrein is the latest to join the cast, taking up one of the last major characters whose casting had yet to be revealed. We know who is playing <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">Kratos</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/callum-vinson-will-play-atreus-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-show/">Atreus</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-adds-to-god-of-war-tv-cast-with-alastair-duncan-returning-as-mimir-and-two-new-picks-for-brok-and-sindri/">Brok, Sindri, Mimir</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Thor</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/">Heimdall</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Sif</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/broadway-legend-mandy-patinkin-will-play-odin-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/">Odin</a></strong>, and we now know who will be stepping into Baldur's numb feet.</p>



<p>Announced in a new report from <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-live-action-series-cast-ed-skrein-baldur-1236671517/">Variety</a>, Baldur's casting just leaves <strong>Freya</strong> as the only major character for whom we don't know the casting. Skrein's involvement also keeps the trend of Alastair Duncan (Mimir) and Ryan Hurst (Kratos) as the only actors who were involved in <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and/or <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> that are also involved in this upcoming series. Alastair Duncan is also the only member of the cast to be reprising his role, since Hurst has gone from playing Thor in Ragnarok to playing Kratos in this live-action series.</p>



<p>The show is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming next month</a>, so we'll hopefully have confirmation of who will be stepping into the role of Freya soon. While the rest of the casting choices suggest we shouldn't be expecting <strong>Danielle Bisutti</strong> to be reprising her role, her performance in both games was excellent, and it would certainly go a long way with fans of the games to see her continue with the character she clearly knows so well.</p>



<p>Here's the full cast list so far for Amazon's God of War TV series, led by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Ronald D. Moore</a>:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ryan Hurst - Kratos</li>



<li>Callum Vinson - Atreus</li>



<li>Alastair Duncan - Mimir</li>



<li>Danny Woodburn - Brok</li>



<li>Jeff Gulka - Sindri</li>



<li>Teresa Palmer - Sif</li>



<li>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson - Thor</li>



<li>Max Parker - Heimdall</li>



<li>Mandy Patinkin - Odin</li>



<li>Ed Skrein - Baldur</li>
</ul>

<p>As the name suggests, the game will cast you as Wolverine, and while it's not an origin story, you won't need to know anything about the character's comic book exploits to play this one.</p><p>The story will revolve around Wolverine searching for "answers about his past", which is a pretty bog-standard setting to plonk Wolverine into, and he'll need to use "brutal claw combat, violent rage and relentless determination" to reach his goal.</p><p>From the gameplay segments we've seen so far, Wolverine will be battling both in his traditional yellow X-Men attire and in a more downhome plaid shirt outfit, and the combat will be suitably brutal as well, with plenty of blood to go around.</p><p>Strangely enough, it shares at least one thing with IO Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-delayed-may-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e0d84f2a-3cf3-41a8-9a3a-eb43f66bc545" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upcoming <em>007 First Light</em></a> in that it'll be a globetrotting adventure for our hero as well, taking him to locations as diverse as Tokyo, Canada, and Madripoor, to name but a few.</p>
<p>News of <em>Wolverine</em>'s release date comes hot on the heels of news that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shutting-down-bluepoint-games-in-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97877112-5514-4226-8057-9d99ef1d61c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">will close <em>Demon's Souls </em>and <em>Shadow of the Colossus </em>studio Bluepoint</a>, suggesting that there might be a little more riding on Insomniac's latest than just the studio's reputation.</p><p><em>Marvel's Wolverine </em>launches <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvels-wolverine/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">exclusively for PlayStation 5</a> on September 15th (although, again, I'd be very surprised if there's not a PC port of the game waiting somewhere down the line). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Insomniac.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Remember how literally only two weeks ago, PlayStation held one of their "Look at the State of the Place, You've Made Such a Mess!" presentations? There were plenty of announcements that landed with suitable aplomb, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/castlevania-belmonts-curse-sees-dead-cells-devs-bring-back-vampire-whippage-and-konami-say-its-just-the-start-of-a-revival">new Castlevania</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-first-person-walk-around-a-foggy-scottish-town-in-the-90s-silent-hill-townfall-is-certainly-serious-about-instilling-dread">proper look at Silent Hill: Townfall</a>, and a reveal of remakes of the OG three God of War Games. So it strikes me as perhaps a bit odd, and funny, that today Insomniac Games have, with quite little fanfare, confirmed the release date of their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> joint.
</p>
<p>
I'm serious, the studio has literally just released a six second video across its socials which literally just shows the date for four of those. Oh, it's September 15th, this year, sorry, forgot that's the important bits, though for us in PC land this means next to nothing as the game will be a PS5 exclusive at launch. But given that all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games eventually made their way to PC, we probably safely assume Wolverine will do much the same.

In terms of when that might be, well, I can make a guess. The first Spider-Man game came out before Sony started their PC porting strategy, but for the second smaller entry, Miles Morales, it took two years to make the jump, and for the full-on sequel the wait was about a year and a half.
</p><p>
It is worth considering the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> is getting a PC release next month, less than a year after its PS5 launch, but Kojima Productions aren't owned by Sony like Insomniac are, so that might make a difference. All of this is to say, we should expect to wait at least roughly a year, if not a bit more.
</p>
<p>
Since its announcement, we honestly haven't seen all that much of the action game in, well, action, apart from a short gameplay trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-wolverine-at-long-last-gets-a-borderline-uncomfortably-bloody-gameplay-trailer-and-a-ps5-release-window">shown last year</a>. I expect it'll be a good few months before we see anything lengthier, perhaps in a summer showcase, but hey ho, marketing has to do its thing! And I'm sure it'll continue to do its thing when it's our turn to play.
