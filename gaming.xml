<p>Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series celebrates its 40th anniversary this year, and it appears First 4 Figures will be joining in on the fun.</p>
<p>In a new announcement this week, the statue maker has given its followers on social media and YouTube a "sneak peek" of a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> - Link statue. If it looks familiar, it's because the standard edition is already available at "GameStop and other major retailers".</p>
<p>This particular statue, which is limited to the First 4 Figures website, is an "exclusive edition" - so expect it to be a little fancier than the rest and possibly have additional features such as LED functionality. The full reveal of the 9" painted PVC statue will take place "soon", and pre-orders are set to open online on <strong>26th February 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>If you sign up to the First 4 Figures newsletter, you'll also get <strong>$10 off</strong> the full price when pre-orders go live. Pricing and other details will be revealed on launch day, so when we hear more, we'll let you know.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Steam Deck Is Still Out Of Stock And Valve Says Get Used To It]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-steam-deck-is-still-out-of-stock-and-valve-says-get-used-to-it-2000669487</link>
            <guid>1437868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People started noticing last week that the Steam Deck was <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-becoming-impossible-to-buy-a-steam-deck-sold-out-valve-prices-ram-shortage-2000667790">becoming impossible to buy</a>. Valve declined to comment on the situation at the time but has now updated the PC gaming handheld’s store page to note that, yes, the Steam Deck is currently out of stock and will remain that way from time to time for the foreseeable future due to the AI-fueled memory crisis currently threatening every piece of the economy that relies on computers to run.</p> <p><b>“Note:</b> Steam Deck OLED may be out-of-stock intermittently in some regions due to memory and storage shortages,” reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">new disclaimer</a>. “Steam Deck LCD 256GB is no longer in production, and once sold out will no longer be available.”</p>

 <p>Valve still hasn’t offered any clearer sense of when the $550 Steam Deck OLED will be back in stock or if the price will be going up. The company put the original $400 Steam Deck LCD model on sale last fall until inventory sold out at which point it was discontinued. Arguably the best bang-for-your-buck PC gaming handheld is now just completely unavailable in some regions just two years after the latest version of it launched.</p> <p>It’s the latest victim of the AI arms race in which “hyperscale” companies are investing hundreds of billions in building out data centers in order to supply compute for running models like ChatGPT and Claude Code to churn out everything from meme slop to finished app projects. No one quite knows where it’s all headed outside of promises that one lucky AI company will either create God or pop a 2008-style financial bubble in the process.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, markets that rely on affordable memory, like consumer electronics generally and <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424">gaming in particular</a>, are getting completely hammered. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">PS6 until 2029</a>, the Nintendo is probably going to have to raise the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a> just a year after it launched, and developers behind new blockbusters are already scrambling to optimize their games for PC so players won’t need to spend an extra $200 upgrading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-recommended-pc-specs-ram-prices-2000668982">32GB of RAM</a> in order to play them when they come out.</p>

 <p>And of course all of Valve’s own hardware is currently in purgatory. With a new Steam Deck still a long ways off, the <em>Half-Life</em> company’s focus for 2026 was a new compact gaming PC aimed squarely at living room gamers. Valve was supposed to reveal the price and release date by now but had to push <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">the pre-orders back</a> as it figures out how to source a rapidly dwindling supply of affordable PC components. I’m assured it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-viral-ai-slop-post-was-made-by-same-guy-from-the-viral-ai-slop-game-2000668276">all for a good cause</a>.</p>

<p>The new release comes with a "reimagined" soundtrack</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Rayman officially made a return on the Switch and multiple other platforms last week with the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a>.</p>
<p>While many fans are glad to see this iconic video game character return, as highlighted by our colleagues at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-is-missing-the-original-soundtrack-and-fans-arent-happy"><strong>Push Square</strong></a>, not everyone is necessarily happy about the original soundtrack being swapped out for a "reimagined" version, composed by Christophe Héral (known for his work on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/rayman_legends">Rayman Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/rayman_origins">Rayman Origins</a>). There's not even an option to toggle between the two albums.</p>
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rayman/ubisoft-knows-rayman-30th-anniversary-editions-new-soundtrack-might-not-recapture-the-vibe-for-you-so-its-looking-into-the-suggestion-of-adding-the-old-music-again/">as reported by GamesRadar+</a>, a Ubisoft employee has apparently responded to a fan suggestion via Discord about "adding an option to have the old music again" and claims the "proper team will have a look at this". This could also come down to who holds the rights to the music, as further noted by Push Square.</p>
<p>Although there have been reports that future work on the 30th Anniversary Edition wouldn't be happening, as our pals at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/ubisoft-says-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-support-is-planned-physical-version-skips-xbox"><strong>Pure Xbox</strong></a> highlighted, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rayman/comments/1r5eeso/comment/o5icgv2/?context=3">Ubisoft employee on Reddit</a> has supposedly "shot down" these claims. They noted how previous messages provided to customers were "likely a mistake" and have also reiterated how the company was already monitoring requests for the OST and other issues.</p>
<p>So, hopefully, there's still a chance of the original soundtrack returning in some capacity in a future update. Although the main composer Rémi Gazel passed away in 2019, his name does appear in the 30th Anniversary Edition credits.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Another Fortnite crossover is in the rumor mill, and it’s The Vampire Diaries. The show was a teenage dream with spectacular-looking humans (and vampires), captivating audiences for eight seasons.</p>



<p>It’s conceivable that every franchise in gaming, TV, and movie history could arrive in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/fortnite/" id="46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. That said, a The Vampire Diaries crossover would’ve been quite low down the Fortnite crossover list. Let’s see if there’s any bite to the rumor.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-vampire-diaries-come-to-fortnite">Will The Vampire Diaries Come To Fortnite?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It couldn’t, could it? Credit to Outerbanks Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A Fortnite and Vampire Diaries crossover is a rumor and nothing more right now, and it appears to be one source claiming that it’s happening.</strong></p>



<p>It’s incredible how quickly speculation can spread like wildfire. There are many leakers in the world of Fortnite, but even the major ones, for the time being—haven’t outed a The Vampire Diaries and Fortnite crossover.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-1-week-11-quests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">All Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 Week 11 Quests &amp; How To Complete Them (February 12)</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Does this mean it’s not happening? Nope, but the evidence isn’t strong enough to confirm the fascinating collaboration.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-the-fortnite-amp-the-vampire-diaries-rumor">What Is The Fortnite &amp; The Vampire Diaries Rumor?</h2>



<p><strong>Content creator Incitable posted to Facebook <strong>on February 16</strong> saying: “FORTNITE x VAMPIRE DIARIES is COMING!”</strong></p>



<p>Arguably, the biggest sources for Fortnite rumors and leaks are Shiina and HYPEX, neither of which has said The Vampire Diaries is coming to Fortnite; this could be significant.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-has-a-kingdom-hearts-collab-in-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Has A Kingdom Hearts Collab in Development, It’s Claimed</a></li>
</ul>



<p>HYPEX has even outed lots of upcoming crossover leaks, but it doesn’t mention anything about vampires.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXPECTED FORTNITE COLLABS THIS SEASON</p><p>• LUNA &amp; MAGIK → Likely Valentine's Day<br>• HONKAI STAR RAIL → February 26<br>• RESIDENT EVIL REQUIEM → Early March<br>• SOLO LEVELING → Likely Next Update<br>• KERNEL HEARTS → ??<br>• OLIVIA DEAN EMOTE → ??<br>• 1-3 MORE COLLABS → ?? <a href="https://t.co/Bp1lEG058t">pic.twitter.com/Bp1lEG058t</a></p></div>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/2020906649301479642?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Incitable says a lot of The Vampire Diaries content is on the way, including Damon Salvatore and Stefan Salvatore skins:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Damon and Stefan Salvatore are officially coming to Fortnite as part of the Fortnitemares update scheduled for Fortnitemares 2026. It was heavily rumored collab, but has seemed to gain traction and it is in the works along with the Twilight collab which many players are hyped for!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The crossover could happen, and it might be confirmed sooner rather than later. Until it is, take the news with a pinch of salt, as no one can confirm if the image is real.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-2-review</link>
            <guid>1437754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e46423c-496a-4cd0-b4f9-f8b468a6aa1d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> was a decent enough title, but one that I’d never consider overly memorable. Its humor often missed the mark, with basic gunplay leaving each encounter feeling overly samey. <em>High On Life 2</em> wants to change this, but has it gone far enough?</p><h2>A Familiar Tale</h2><p><em>High On Life 2 </em>takes place years after the Bounty Hunter’s successful journey to stop humanity from being enslaved and smoked by aliens. After a whirlwind victory tour, they find themselves in a rut, going through the motions each day. They even start off in their old home, which has since been converted into a museum exhibit.</p><p>Things go south when their sister Lizzie - now a freedom fighter - gets a bounty on their head. Heading out to save them, it starts another adventure with the lives of humanity on the line.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You'll meet a bunch of weird and wonderful characters, though most aren't present for very long.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic premise is very similar to that of the first game. Take out bad guys, collect new weapons, save humanity. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that it’s basically just a weaker retread when it comes to the serious side of the story.</p><p>At least <em>High On Life 2</em>’s humorous side is a slight improvement, cutting down on some of the forced chatter that plagued the original. There’s still plenty of it, mind you, with lots of jokes that just boil down to a simple bit that’s dragged on for far too long.</p><p>Many of the stronger jokes are ones that make use of this being a game rather than a TV show. Messing with the UI, having you draw your own face (that you’ll never see due to the game being in first person), and letting you find plenty of optional scenes if you walk off the beaten path.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that I find <em>High On Life 2</em> to be laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, but it’s at least bearable even at its lowest. At the same time, the focus on attempting to be funny does mean that any time things are made to be more serious, it falls completely flat.</p><h2>So-So Gunplay, Now With A Skateboard</h2><p>General gunplay is something that I was hoping <em>High On Life 2</em> would massively improve upon. The first game’s combat had little real impact and got incredibly stale by the end. Unfortunately, it’s generally the same in the sequel.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Returning Gatlians play the same, for better or worse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While your Gatlians - sentient talking guns - take the place of regular weaponry, they don’t actually feel that different from other sci-fi shooters. You have SMG, a shotgun, and burst rifle equivalents to name a few, and they act generally as you’d expect. Each has access to extra abilities such as time stopping bubbles or electric spikes, but I didn’t use them much outside of platforming and puzzles.</p><p>The main issue is that you’re rarely required to switch guns on the fly during a shootout. Enemies don’t require specific strategies (not even boss fights) and all Gatlians have infinite ammo.</p><p><em>High On Life 2</em> tries to shake things up instead with the skateboard, “borrowed” from another bounty hunter early on. While you can sprint around, you’ll usually instead skate from location to location. It moves at a decent speed, and areas feature lots of jumps and ramps to make use of your new mobility.</p><p>While far from a realistic take on skateboarding, it does add a unique dynamic to movement. It serves as a speed boost, wall ride, and even an additional attack during firefights by launching it at your enemies. Outside of fights, you can also make use of it in skateparks and races for some extra cash and collectables.</p><figure role="group">

<p>It can be finicky at times, such as killing your momentum after slightly clipping a rock, but it’s overall <em>High On Life 2</em>’s best addition over the original. Add in the air dashes you unlock later, and it becomes a fun way to get around both in and out of fights.</p><h2>A Buggy Launch, Again</h2><p>The first game’s launch was pretty rough, bringing with it a lot of performance issues and bugs. <em>High On Life 2</em> repeats this once again, with a framerate that goes all over the place and plenty of softlocks.</p><p>Playing on a relatively high end system with an RTX 5070 Ti, it would still struggle to hit a stable 60fps in some areas at 1440p high settings. Frame generation obviously helps, but even then, there’s still noticeable stuttering. Many textures also take a long time to load in, staying partially (or fully) low resolution until a good 10 seconds later.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-update-jump/</link>
            <guid>1437751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft isn’t finished with Assassin’s Creed Shadows, which dropped last year to a positive reception and a few controversies, particularly those concerning historical inaccuracies. It became a talking point within the Japanese government, amongst other things, which was pretty insane to see.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, February 17, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft</a> will release title update 1.1.8 for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, kick-starting a special, limited-time parkour challenge, and adding a feature that many think should have been there the entire time.</p>



<p>Yes, that’s the ability to <strong>jump</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-manual-jump-coming-to-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Manual Jump Coming to Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>Forced automatic parkour will be a thing of the past in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows/" id="1478">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> with update 1.1.8. Ubisoft is encouraging those still playing the game to participate in a social-driven parkour challenge, creating an unedited shot that they can share to showcase their freerunning abilities in Feudal Japan.</p>



<p>There are prizes up for grabs, but only the cleanest routes will be in with a chance of winning.</p>



<p>To facilitate the challenge, Ubisoft has added <strong>manual jumping </strong>to Assassin’s Creed Shadows. That now means that, at the press of a button, you can <strong>jump</strong>. How’s about that for an update?</p>



<p>If you want to enable manual jumping, you’ll need to hop into <strong>Advanced Options </strong>in the gameplay settings menu and switch the feature <strong>on</strong>. Otherwise, you’ll still be locked in a creative box by automatic parkour.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, Ubisoft is adding a detailed statistics page <strong>and </strong>new ‘visual feedback’ for crit hits landed in combat.</p>



<p>Next month, Claws of Awaji, the game’s major expansion, will be released on Nintendo Switch 2. Then, on March 20, the game’s first anniversary rolls around, and Ubisoft has promised something of a small celebration.</p>



<p>Tomorrow’s update will drop at 14:00 UTC and will measure up to 15.77 GB for Xbox users, and as little as 1.7 GB for PS5 users.</p>







<p>Are you looking forward to making some sweet parkour content in Assassin’s Creed Shadows with <strong>manual jumping? </strong>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Today marks the 10th anniversary of the launch of the first Layers of Fear, and for fans, developer Bloober Team is celebrating in the best way possible: by announcing a new entry. Layers of Fear 3 is officially on the way.&nbsp;</p><p>A live-action teaser trailer features a man reciting William Blake’s poem <em>The Sick Rose</em>, which is all fans have to decipher meaning from regarding what Layers of Fear 3 entails. The trailer did not reveal gameplay, a release window, or platforms, but we did at least get a logo for the game. Some might say that’s something.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VxU-9A3tw80" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“Layers of Fear is a franchise coming straight from our hearts and a beloved Bloober Team story,” says Bloober Team CEO Piotr Babieno in a press release. “The one that we keep on narrating since decade, it was the project that shaped our studio’s identity and set us on the path of crafting unforgettable psychological horror experiences. Ten years have passed, but we’re far from saying the last word - now we are revealing something new in the franchise. We hope it will plant a seed of excitement for the fans of this title.”</p><p>Bloober Team revealed more 10th anniversary goodies. For starters, the Layers of Fear games are being discounted. The first game is 90 percent off right now, and on Friday, the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/04/27/check-out-layers-of-fears-unreal-engine-5-performance-in-new-gameplay-trailer">2023 reimagining</a> will be discounted by 60 percent (but those who own the 2016 game can get this in a bundle for 70 percent off). A series of novels based on the franchise is in the works; the first is written by Marta Bijan and will be released at the end of the year. Fans will also be treated to digital and physical soundtracks for Layers of Fear and other Bloober Team games like The Medium and Cronos: The New Dawn.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Layers of Fear 3, we also know that Bloober Team is making a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill">remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>. It'll be interesting to see which game arrives first.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 16/02/2026 6:00pm ET:</strong> Following the publication of this story, a representative from <strong>Hasbro</strong> sent this statement to Wccftech:</p>



<p>"<em>The Snake Eyes game is <strong>not cancelled</strong>. The team is currently taking time to evaluate the path forward for the game. While decisions haven't been finalized, we're committed to providing updates as soon as we're able</em>."</p>



<p><strong>Original Story 16/02/2026 4:43pm ET:</strong></p>



<p><strong>Atomic Arcade</strong>, the <strong>Hasbro</strong> and <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>-owned studio that was making a game based on the iconic <strong>G.I. Joe</strong> character <strong>Snake Eyes</strong>, has reportedly been <strong>shut down</strong>. The news broke from one of the former team members, gameplay programmer <strong>Dominic Braun</strong>, shared on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominicbraun_opentowork-activity-7429184370877345793-37wz?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> that he had been laid off following "<em>Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast's decision to close Atomic Arcade</em>."</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, there's been no official word from Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast or Atomic Arcade confirming the closure or the fate of the Snake Eyes game. We've reached out to Hasbro for comment and will update this article if/when we hear back or if an official statement is delivered through other verified channels.</p>



<p>We first heard about the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-has-a-big-budget-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-in-the-works/1100-6506502/">back in 2022,</a> with Atomic Arcade seemingly being formed for the purpose of making this Snake Eyes game. While the studio was active in sharing notices that it was looking to grow its team between 2022 and 2025, with the last major update being a sneak peek at the Snake Eyes model from Atomic Arcade back in <a href="https://x.com/AtomicArcadeStu/status/1922305837042991257">May 2025.</a></p>



<p>It's the latest studio shutdown and mass layoff of the year, after <strong>Ubisoft</strong> kicked off 2026 by embarking on a "<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that included multiple studio shutdowns. We've also seen layoffs from <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/"><strong>Meta</strong> that ended <strong>Camouflaj's</strong> award-winning run of developing VR games</a>, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-close-to-half-2xko-team/">cutting nearly half of the <strong>2XKO</strong> development team shortly</a> after the game's 1.0 release, and most notably, <strong>Highguard</strong> developer <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">cutting "<em>most</em>" of its team</a>, barely two weeks after Highguard launched.</p>



<p>But at least in all of those cases, the studios impacted had gotten a game across the finish line. Atomic Arcade, seemingly, did not get the same chance, and now it seems like G.I. Joe and Snake Eyes fans who have been waiting for a major release based on the iconic ninja will have to wait a while longer.</p>



<p>It's also one less game coming from Hasbro's IPs, as we know that there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">currently several games from Hasbro-owned IPs on their way</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a> brings a new MyGM draft format, additional playable GMs, expanded match types, and more, as a deeper level of control takes center stage.</p>



<p>WWE 2K has released a new <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/mygm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report, </a>giving players an in-depth look at the changes coming to the popular game mode. Major changes include more match types for players to select, a longer season mode than ever before, and new choices for the authority figure on your show.</p>







<h2 id="h-default-seasons-are-now-50-weeks-in-wwe-2k26-mygm">Default Seasons Are Now 50 Weeks in WWE 2K26 MyGM</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 features 50-week seasons by default in MyGM. Also, starting budgets have increased and now range from $3 million to $7 million. Everyone’s budget is $5 million by default. </p>



<p>It is expected that higher budgets will increase the average roster size per brand by up to 35 Superstars. There’s also a new difficulty setting, Immortal, for experienced players looking for a new challenge.</p>







<h2 id="h-players-can-choose-to-double-book-stars">Players Can Choose to Double-Book Stars</h2>



<p>Another new feature is the ability to double-book wrestlers in both promos and matches on a single show. This means players will need to manage their roster members’ stamina more closely and pay closer attention to the show’s format, but it adds more realism.</p>



<p>Speaking of promos, invasion promises are new to WWE 2K26. Players can now send a star to attack the opposing brand when playing against friends. A good promo will earn you fans; a bad promo will make your brand look bad and could cost you fans.</p>



<p>As for match types, players can now book wrestlers for a variety of options, including the new 3 Stages of Hell. There’s also now support for 5-way, 6-way, and 8-way matches.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-legendary-gms-are-added-in-this-year-s-game">New Legendary GMs Are Added in This Year’s Game</h2>



<p>This year, MyGM Mode added new playable general managers, including the legendary Bobby “The Brain” Heenan, Stacy Keibler, and the Anonymous General Manager from 2011. They join Eric Bischoff, Adam Pearce, Mick Foley, and Ava.</p>

      <p>On Friday the website Ars Technica published a story about Scott Shambaugh, a coder who made headlines in the tech world last week <a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>with his story</u></a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>AI agents</u></a>, and in particular one that he claims had written what he called <a href="https://crabby-rathbun.github.io/mjrathbun-website/blog/posts/2026-02-11-gatekeeping-in-open-source-the-scott-shambaugh-story.html?ref=404media.co"><u>a 'hit piece'</u></a> on him and published it for the world to see.</p><p>Shambaugh’s story is as interesting as it was horrifying. Agents are just the latest front in tech's war on our collective sanity, a type of AI that's essentially a glorified autocorrect that in this case has been given a uniform and sent onto the internet to try to do human things like propose code changes and then, when humans like Shambaugh decline them, writing pissy blogs complaining about it.</p><p>Among <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91492228/matplotlib-scott-shambaugh-opencla-ai-agent?ref=aftermath.site"><u>other sites</u></a>, Ars Technica covered this last week with a news story that remarkably appeared to have some AI-created filler of its own, citing quotes from Shambaugh that never appeared in the very blog Ars was linking.</p><p>Not long after readers--<a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/journalistic-standards.1511650/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including Ars' own community</u></a>--began noticing this, the story was pulled (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260213194851/https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/"><u>though you can still read the archived original here</u></a>). It's general journalistic practice that published stories which contain inaccuracies are edited and updated, not deleted entirely.</p><p>Ars has since <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2026/02/editors-note-retraction-of-article-containing-fabricated-quotations/?ref=404media.co"><u>published</u></a> an editorial statement, bylined by EiC Ken Fisher, addressing the story, its deletion and the outlet's policies on AI:</p><blockquote>On Friday afternoon, Ars Technica published&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/02/after-a-routine-code-rejection-an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-someone-by-name/?ref=aftermath.site">an article</a>&nbsp;containing fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them. That is a serious failure of our standards. Direct quotations must always reflect what a source actually said.</blockquote><blockquote>That this happened at Ars is especially distressing. We have covered the risks of overreliance on AI tools for years, and our written policy reflects those concerns. In this case, fabricated quotations were published in a manner inconsistent with that policy. We have reviewed recent work and have not identified additional issues. At this time, this appears to be an isolated incident.</blockquote><blockquote>Ars Technica does not permit the publication of AI-generated material unless it is clearly labeled and presented for demonstration purposes. That rule is not optional, and it was not followed here.</blockquote><p>By citing Ars' clear rules, Fisher's statement points the finger for this disaster at the two authors bylined in the piece, with one (Benj Edwards) having since posted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/benjedwards.com/post/3mewgow6ch22p?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a statement of his own</u></a>, assuming full responsibility for the incident and saying the other (Kyle Orland) had 'no role in this error':</p><blockquote>I have been sick with COVID all week and missed Mon and Tues due to this. On Friday, while working from bed with a fever and very little sleep, I unintentionally made a serious journalistic error in an article about Scott Shambaugh.<p>Here’s what happened: I was incorporating information from Shambaugh’s new blog post into an existing draft from Thursday.</p><p>During the process, I decided to try an experimental Claude Code-based AI tool to help me extract relevant verbatim source material. Not to generate the article but to help list structured references I could put in my outline.</p><p>When the tool refused to process the post due to content policy restrictions (Shambaugh’s post described harassment). I pasted the text into ChatGPT to understand why.</p><p>I should have taken a sick day because in the course of that interaction, I inadvertently ended up with a paraphrased version of Shambaugh’s words rather than his actual words.</p><p>Being sick and rushing to finish, I failed to verify the quotes in my outline notes against the original blog source before including them in my draft. </p><p>Kyle Orland had no role in this error. He trusted me to provide accurate quotes, and I failed him.</p><p>The text of the article was human-written by us, and this incident was isolated and is not representative of Ars Technica’s editorial standards. None of our articles are AI-generated, it is against company policy and we have always respected that.</p><p>I sincerely apologize to Scott Shambaugh for misrepresenting his words. I take full responsibility. The irony of an AI reporter being tripped up by AI hallucination is not lost on me. I take accuracy in my work very seriously and this is a painful failure on my part.</p><p>When I realized what had happened, I asked my boss to pull the piece because I was too sick to fix it on Friday. There was nothing nefarious at work, just a terrible judgement call which was no one’s fault but my own.</p></blockquote><p>Look, I understand mistakes can happen when you're sick, but Edwards--who it should be noted is Ars' '<a href="https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Senior AI Reporter</a>'--has used AI not once but <em>twice </em>here, and in doing so has caused a huge amount of reputational damage for himself and his employer in the process. And it's not like he used it to comb through 800 pages of impenetrable legal documents, either; Shambaugh's original blog was only a couple of pages long (<a href="https://theshamblog.com/an-ai-agent-published-a-hit-piece-on-me-part-2/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">he's since written a follow-up</a>), and written in plain English, making the AI's hallucinations (and Edwards' use of it) even more damning.</p><p>It's disappointing someone working in this space felt the need to have to use this garbage, particularly when it violates their employer's own policies. As this whole mess has shown, the tech simply cannot do the most basic things the people selling it keep claiming it can. Citing quotes from a blog for your own story is bread-and-butter stuff for a journalist, it's what the job <em>is</em>, and seeing this busted tech worming its way into a profession that should be its sworn enemy– and fucking the whole thing up in the process--is just a huge bummer.</p>
