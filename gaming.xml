            <p>
Enotria: The Last Song, the "summer Soulslike" from Italian indie developer Jyamma Games, has been delayed indefinitely on Xbox - just weeks before its planned 19th September release - with the studio claiming Microsoft has "decided to ignore us" as it attempts to navigate certification.
</p>
<p>
Enotria - a third-person action-adventure set in a sun-lit world inspired by Italian folklore - has had an erratic relationship with Microsoft's platform so far. Back in March, Jyamma revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-delayed-avoiding-elden-ring-dlc">no longer be launching Enotria on Xbox</a> at the same time as other platforms, so it could focus its efforts on creating a "superior experience for PC and PS5 players".
</p>
<p>
However, two months later, it announced a revised release date - shifting the game's launch from August to September - with an Xbox version suddenly back on the cards. But Jyamma is now slamming the brakes on once more, delaying Enotria: The Last Song indefinitely on Xbox as a result of what it initially <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement">only referred to</a> as "challenges".

<p>
As <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/they-dont-care-about-enotria-and-they-dont-care-about-you-jyamma-games-ceo-blasts-xbox-amidst-indefinite-delay">spotted by Windows Central</a>, though, Jyamma CEO Jacky Greco later went into additional detail on Discord. Following a community manager's statement dismissing speculation the studio had been "paid by Sony", Greco shared his own frustrations relating to the delay. "You can ask Xbox why they haven't answered us for two months," he wrote. "Obviously they don't care about Enotria and they don't care about you... We've Xbox Series X/S version ready, but we can't proceed with submission and release, I spent a lot of money for porting and they decided to ignore us."
</p>
<p>
A similar statement also <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830673938311250263">appeared</a> on Enotria's X/Twitter feed. After a fan inquired about the "main challenge" holding up release, Jyamma wrote, "Communication with Xbox. The game works fine on Series S and X but we cannot go through the submission process and they can take even two months to reply to us."
</p>
<p>
Greco later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/enotria-xbox-release-delayed/">shared</a> a little more on the issue the studio had enountered, explaining it was unable to open Enotria's Xbox store page and submit the game - something Microsoft's support teams reportedly initially took responsibility for, before further communications were ignored. "We really want to release the game on Xbox ASAP," Jyamma <a href="https://x.com/enotriagame/status/1830670151106338864">added</a> elsewhere, "but with lack of communication on their side it is a hard task indeed."
</p>
<p>
The suggestion seems to be things might be resolved pretty quickly if Jyamma could get a response from Microsoft, but in the meantime, Enotria: The Last Song will only be available for PlayStation 5 and PC when it launches on 19th September.

<p>Fortnite is soon entering the third week of Chapter 5, Season 4, and players are worried about whether they can collect all battle pass rewards before the season ends. One of the best ways to gain XP and jump through tiers in the battle pass is by completing weekly quests, as completing a set of them can net you loads of XP. This guide will explain how to complete Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4’s Week 2 Quests.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-fortnite-chapter-5-season-4-week-2-quests">Fortnite Chapter 5 Season 4 Week 2 Quests</h2>



<p>The game releases new weekly quests every Tuesday, each granting 20,000 XP to players. Fortnite’s Week 2’s quests for the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/be-a-marvel-hero-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-5-season-4-absolute-doom?lang=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Absolute Doom</a> season are as follows:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR (3)</li>



<li>Sprint distance after taking damage (100)</li>



<li>Use a Mod Bench in different matches (2)</li>



<li>Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage (150)</li>



<li>Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen (5)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-fortnite-week-2-quests">How to complete Fortnite Week 2 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-opponents-with-the-striker-ar">Eliminate opponents with the Striker AR.</h3>



<p>The first Quest for Fortnite Week 2 can be done quickly. All you need to do is land at one of the new POIs and look for the Striker AR. Alternatively, you can also take on Emma Frost at The Raft and defeat them to acquire the mythic Striker AR. Once you have found the weapon, eliminate 3 NPCs or opponents to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sprint-distance-after-taking-damage">Sprint distance after taking damage</h3>



<p>The next one is also an easy task. For this Fortnite Week 2 quest, pick up a fight with one of the NPCs, let them shoot you once and then run like there’s no tomorrow. Keep on running until you receive a ‘Quest Completed’ pop-up.&nbsp;Players have to run for 100 meters to complete this quest. </p>



<h3 id="h-use-a-mod-bench-in-different-matches">Use a Mod Bench in different matches</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 2 quest is challenging, but not for the reasons you think. The main issue with using a mod bench is that it is only available in limited areas: vaults and the floating island. Moreover, these areas are only accessible halfway through the match, so surviving for that long can be challenging for some. However, once you can access the mod bench, you must add one or more attachments to any weapon across two games to complete the quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-within-5-seconds-of-receiving-damage">Damage opponents within 5 seconds of receiving damage</h3>



<p>The next one is another challenging quest requiring you to engage in battle. Fortunately, similar to all the other quests, you can complete this quest, too, by damaging NPCs. So just head on over to one of the NPCs, let them shoot you first and reply instantly with a shotgun to the face. One or two tries should be enough to finish the quest. If you feel confident, try completing this against a real player.&nbsp;To compete with this question, you must inflict 150 damage in the first 5 seconds of receiving damage. </p>

<h3 id="h-hire-characters-or-recruit-defeated-henchmen">Hire Characters or recruit defeated Henchmen</h3>



<p>The last Fortnite Week 2 quest has players hiring other characters and henchmen to do their dirty work. Players can find many characters across the map who can be employed with gold bars. On the other hand, Henchman needs to be knocked down first, and then you can interact with the downed Henchman to recruit them.&nbsp;Hiring or recruiting 5 of them should do the trick. </p>

<p>It’s another week, so more headlines about Xbox are due to hit the internet. Enotria: The Last Song has taken the spotlight this time and claimed in its recent press release that it will have to delay its Xbox version due to encountering challenges with Xbox.</p>



<p>As always, social media erupted with wild theories and accusations, with the usual console war bullshit spreading, such as the game had to be delayed due to the Series S. </p>



<p>I managed to talk a little more in-depth to Giacomo Greco, CEO of Jyamma Games, about the issues and why the game has been delayed for Xbox. The TL;DR answer is that the game has been postponed due to a lack of communication from Xbox regarding an issue where the developer can not open its store page and submit the game. Greco tells me that the issue has nothing to do with the hardware limitations of the Series S. In fact, Greco assures me that everything on the Series S runs fine and that there have just been some minor tweaks to the graphic settings.</p>



<p>Greco says that the company has had this issue for months [not allowing them to create a store page] and has been back and forth with various Xbox support teams and people. Still, none of them have figured out the issue and have admitted the problem is on their [Xbox’s] end. In the end, Jyamma Games’ requests eventually fell on deaf ears, meaning that they had to postpone the Xbox version.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen whether Xbox will resolve this issue so that Enotria can be released soon, but Greco said, “We will do our best to make the release [on Xbox] as soon as we can.”</p>



<p>For now, though, Jyamma Games has no answers and a significant hole in its bank from spending on an Xbox port.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Xbox for comment.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-you-complete-fortnite-week-1-quests">How do you complete Fortnite Week 1 Quests?</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-while-airborne">Damage opponents while airborne</h3>



<p>The first one is simple: players only need to inflict 500 damage while airborne, and there are two ways to do so. First, you must get your hands on War Machine’s Hover Jets. Then, head to any location with NPCs, fly up in the air, and start riddling them with bullets. Alternatively, you can jump while shooting, and the damage in the air will count towards this Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-an-opponent-with-doctor-doom-s-monarch-pistol-nbsp">Eliminate an opponent with Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is pretty simple; however, acquiring Doctor Doom’s Monarch Pistol might be challenging. To do so, you must head to Castle Doom and square off with Doombot. Defeating him will grant you the Monarch Pistol and the Doom Gauntlets. Once you have acquired the Monarch Pistol, beat a player or an NPC to complete the quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-reach-10-players-remaining">Reach 10 players remaining</h3>



<p>This Fortnite Week 1 quest is purely skill-based and may need some tries. Reaching 10 players remaining can be difficult in solos, so consider inviting your friends for this quest.</p>

<h3 id="h-travel-distance-while-airborne-in-a-vehicle">Travel distance while airborne in a vehicle</h3>



<p>For this one, players need to travel 100 meters while airborne in the vehicle, and you can do this in one go if you find the correct slope and use the boosts at the right time. One good strategy would be to drive it off a cliff as the long descent would also help towards the meters travelled. Alternatively, you can also visit the welding tower near Castle Doom and use the wind to get a jump start and then boost away in any direction to complete the Fortnite Week 1 quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-search-chests-in-named-locations-eliminate-opponents-and-collect-common-or-uncommon-weapons-nbsp">Search chests in Named Locations, Eliminate opponents and Collect Common or Uncommon weapons.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The following 3 Fortnite Week 1 quests are pretty simple. The first one needs players to search for 25 chests across all named locations, which can be completed across multiple matches. The next one needs you to eliminate three opponents. For the last one, you must collect 15 common or uncommon weapons. None of these three quests require individual effort and might be completed as you play the game.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-will-be-an-optimization-challenge-admits-dune-awakening-developer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developers have often cited the Xbox Series S console as a limitation and/or a significant optimization <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-split-screen-xbox-series-s-challenge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenge</a> during game development. Microsoft's choice to deliver a cheaper but considerably less powerful hardware (the Xbox Series S only has 20 Compute Units clocked at 1.565 GHz for an estimated computing power of 4 TFLOPS, whereas the X has 52 Compute Units clocked at 1.825 GHz for an estimated computing power of 12.16 TFLOPS) still has fans debating whether it was worth it, four years alter. Xbox console sales are still dwindling, and developers continue to point at the issues of optimizing their games for the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>The latest to do so is Funcom's Chief Product Officer Scott Junior, whom we <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-qa-funcom-talks-endgame-post-launch-updates-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> as part of our Dune Awakening Gamescom Q&amp;A. In another interview at the Cologne convention, Junior <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> VG247 that one of the reasons for the game's delay on consoles compared to PC is the need to optimize for Microsoft's weaker console.</p>
<p><em>So, it's one of the reasons we're coming out on PC first. There's a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox. But yeah, Xbox Series S is a challenge.</em></p>
<p><em>Unreal does a lot of the work for us in some ways. What we're more doing is optimisation of assets, and using various technologies, be it FSR or something else, to replicate frames. We want the game to look stunning on high-end, whether you have a 3070 or a 4090, but we also want it to look good... I don't think we've released our min-spec yet, but you know, powerful cards from a few years ago should be able to run the game. It should look good - it won't be able to leverage the ultra-spec options, but it'll still look nice.</em></p>
<p>At Gamescom 2024, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-currently-runs-at-25-fps-on-series-s-but-xbox-is-helping-with-optimization-devs-praise-their-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a> from GSC Game World that the Ukrainian developer is now optimizing STALKER 2 for the Xbox Series S after successfully bringing it to 60 frames per second on the X. The game is currently running at around 35 frames per second, but they're aiming to improve it (with some help from Microsoft's team) before the launch on November 20.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dune-awakening-xbox-series-s-challenge-funcom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-a-%E2%80%9Cchallenge-%E2%80%9D-funcom-says.970272/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dune-awakening-xbox-series-s-challenge-funcom/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It seems as if Xbox is taking nothing but “Ls” lately, with numerous developers stepping forward to discuss how difficult it is to work with their hardware and restrictions. We still don’t have word on Black Myth: Wukong on Xbox, with countless rumors circulating about why. Now, developer Funcom says bringing Dune: Awakening to Xbox Series S is giving them some trouble. It’s a “challenge,” they said.</p>



<p>When talking about the issues surrounding Dune: Awakening’s development on Xbox Series S specifically, chief product officer Scott Junor, at Gamescom last month, as reported by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>, said the game is set to release on PC and PlayStation 5 simultaneously but not on Xbox day one due to the Xbox Series S proving to be a “challenge.” He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>So, it’s one of the reasons we’re coming out on PC first. There’s a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox. But yeah, Xbox Series S is a challenge. </p>



<p>Unreal does a lot of the work for us in some ways. What we’re more doing is optimisation of assets, and using various technologies, be it FSR or something else, to replicate frames. We want the game to look stunning on high-end, whether you have a 3070 or a 4090, but we also want it to look good… I don’t think we’ve released our min-spec yet, but y’know powerful cards from a few years ago should be able to run the game. It should look good – it won’t be able to leverage the ultra-spec options, but it’ll still look nice.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-dune-awakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">For those who don’t know</a>, Dune: Awakening brings the world of Frank Herbert’s design to a grand scale with a massively multiplayer online survival game in which players will loot, craft, and wage war across the deserts of Arrakis in a bid for power and spice. You can eventually form a House and become more powerful.</p>



<p>With such a massive endeavor, it makes sense that Funcom finds the lesser hardware of the Xbox Series S a “challenge” to work with to create its vision without sacrificing quality or content. </p>

            <p>
Thatcher's Techbase - the Doom WAD that sees players descending to the Tenth Circle of Hell to thwart the return of "one of humanity's greatest threats" - has been yanked from Bethesda's new in-game mod browser after being reported for "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thatchers-techbase-sees-the-return-of-one-of-humanitys-greatest-threats">initially released back in 2021</a>, but developer Jim Purvis recently decided to take advantage of Bethesda's official community-published mod support - which launched for PC and consoles as part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-1-2-enhanced-bundle-surfaces-on-steam-with-new-episode-from-machinegames">Doom 1 &amp; 2's enhanced bundle</a> back in August - giving Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox owners the opportunity to play the WAD for the first time.
</p>
<p>
But alas, the four-map Thatcher's Techbase - which includes a soundtrack by Paradise Killer composer Barry "Epoch" Topping and voice work from Hades' Laila Berzins - has now seen its moment in the console spotlight come to a premature end.

<p>
In a takedown notice <a href="https://x.com/letshugbro/status/1829549197429027287">shared by Purvis on social media</a>, Bethesda said Thatcher's Techbase had "been reported for real-world politics and has been removed". While the company stressed the mod was not in violation of its Terms of Service or Code of Conduct, it encouraged Purvis to "educate yourself on Modding Guidelines and Community Rules".
</p>
<p>
Thatcher's Techbase does, of course, remain available to PC players through the usual, non-Bethesda channels - and while console players will now be missing out, they can at least take some solace in the fact they're playing a decent version of Doom. Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-doom-and-doom-2-are-nightdives-latest-remasters-the-definitive-editions">recently took at look at developer Nightdive's latest remasters</a> of the id Software classics, calling them, "Not quite perfect - but excellent nonetheless."

<p>Jyamma Games has just announced that Enotria: The Last Song has been delayed indefinitely on Xbox Series X|S. It’ll still be released as intended on PC and PlayStation 5 on September 19, in digital form. Further down the road, a physical edition will be released. Per a press release issued by the team, insurmountable issues have blocked the Xbox release.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-there-is-bound-to-be-some-darkness">‘There Is Bound To Be Some Darkness’</h2>



<p>Jyamma Games <a href="https://enotriathelastsong.com/news/enotria-the-last-song-official-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed in a recent release</a> that it’ll be some time before Enotria: The Last Song is released on Xbox, if it ever surfaces at all:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Even in the beautifully detailed world of Enotria, there is bound to be some darkness.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, at this time, we have to announce an indefinite delay of the Xbox version.</p>



<p>We understand how disappointing this news is to the Xbox community. Unfortunately, despite our best efforts and the hard work of our dedicated team, we’ve encountered challenges that have delayed our release on the Xbox platform. We want to emphasize that this is not a decision we’ve made lightly.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Enotria is a Soulslike with a unique aesthetic based on ‘Italian folklore’. The world in the game is detailed and sumptuous, boasting intense architecture and rich environments filled with cathedrals, castles, and ancient ruins. </p>



<p>Here’s a gameplay reveal teaser that was showcased during the Tokyo Game Show in 2022:</p>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 4 has brought Marvel back to the island, with some great cosmetics up for grabs in the battle pass. However, earning enough XP to cross all those tiers can be difficult for some players. A great way to acquire XP in Fortnite is through weekly quests, and this guide will walk you through all the Week 0 quests of the latest season.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-you-complete-fortnite-s-week-0-quests-nbsp">How do you complete Fortnite’s Week 0 Quests?&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-damage-opponents-with-dual-micro-smgs">Damage Opponents with Dual Micro SMGs</h3>



<p>For this Fortnite Week 0 quest, players must use the Dual Micro SMGs; this weapon can be found anywhere on the Fortnite island, through chests, on the ground or through other players and NPC characters. Players have to inflict 1,000 points of damage with this weapon, and fortunately, you can damage NPCs for this quest. Therefore, consider landing at Castle Doom and taking out the Doombots for this quest.</p>



<h3 id="h-search-containers-in-different-named-locations-in-a-single-match">Search containers in different Named Locations in a single match</h3>



<p>In this quest, players must loot as they usually would during matches. Just land at one of the named locations and open chests, Avengers chest or ammo box, then head to another named location and do the same to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-hide-in-hiding-places-or-bushes-in-different-matches-nbsp">Hide in hiding places or bushes in different matches.&nbsp;</h3>



<p>To complete this quest, you have to hide in three different places. These include bushes, dumpsters, and porta potties. You can find them at POIs like Castle Doom, The Raft, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-returns-for-ios-devices-in-eu-and-android-devices-globally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Returns for iOS Devices in EU and Android Devices Globally </a></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-opponents-with-smgs-or-shotguns-nbsp">Eliminate opponents with SMGs or shotguns&nbsp;</h3>



<p>This is one of the Fortnite Week 0 quests requiring some skill, as players must eliminate ten opponents with either the Dual Micro SMGs or the Sovereign Shotgun. Fortunately, this quest can be completed over multiple matches, but remember to provide the finishing blow with either your shotgun or the SMGs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-eliminate-an-opponent-with-captain-america-s-shield">Eliminate an opponent with Captain America’s Shield</h3>



<p>Captain America’s Shield is the new mythic weapon in the latest Fortnite season; it allows players to shield themselves, damage multiple opponents at a time, and ram through stuff, too. Finding this mythic can be difficult, but an Avengers chest might be your best. Once you have acquired Captain America’s Shield, you can eliminate an NPC to complete the quest. If you are confident, take on a real opponent for this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rocksteady-reportedly-hit-by-layoffs-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>London-based game developer Rocksteady has suffered layoffs, according to a report freshly published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eurogamer</a>. The bulk of the layoffs is reportedly found in the studio's Quality Assurance department, which had its headcount nearly halved to 15 down from 33. Moreover, at least one non-QA member of the studio has publicly revealed on social media he was fired while on paternity leave.</p>
<p>Sources within Rocksteady cited by Eurogamer acknowledge that this round of layoffs will inevitably cut into the quality of game development, as well as burden the remaining developers with more work.</p>
<p>The cause can easily be found in the failure of the studio's most recent game, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It took Rocksteady nine years after Batman: Arkham Knight (eight if you count Batman: Arkham VR), and despite all this time, the final game was highly disappointing. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a mediocre 5 out of 10 score from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful. Perhaps most damning, not even the thing promised in the game’s title – fighting and dispatching the Justice League – ends up being particularly fun or memorable. Those who really want to see what becomes of the Arkhamverse may not be able to resist picking this up, but I suggest waiting for a steep discount before subjecting yourself to this tedious team-up.</em></p>
<p>Its performance was just as bad, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-revenue-decline-suicide-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causing</a> Warner Bros. a 41% decrease in game revenues year-over-year compared to February 2023's outstanding launch of Hogwarts Legacy, which would become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game of 2023</a>. Rocksteady has attempted to improve Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch but with little effect on its overall reception.</p>
<p>According to a previous rumor, a portion of the studio is currently helping make a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Director's Cut version of Hogwarts Legacy</a>. The good news is that even after these layoffs, Rocksteady doesn't seem to be in any real danger of being shut down, and there are whispers it will go back to what it does best: Batman games.</p>

It absolutely captured that late-70s sci-fi aesthetic of dark gray cladding broken up by utilitarian-gray panels covered in dull blinking lights, and I stopped to think about how much work must have gone into that wall. Looking elsewhere on the screen, I was then overwhelmed. This wall was the most bland thing in a vast hanger, where TIE Fighters hung from the ceiling, Stormtroopers wandered in groups below, and even the little white sign with the yellow arrow looked like it was a decade old, meticulously crafted to fit into this universe. I felt sheer astonishment at the achievement of this. Ubisoft, via multiple studios across the whole world, and the work of thousands of deeply talented people, had built this impossibly perfect area for one momentary scene that I was intended to run straight past.<br></p><p>Except I ran past it three times, because the AI kept fucking up and I was restarted at a checkpoint right before that gray wall over and over.</p><figure id="" data-id="1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-recommend-id="image://1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-recommend-id="image://1544c79cf0a7baf50fd41f412a051e25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stands in front of a planet-set, with rocky mountains against the orange sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m struggling to capture the dissonance of this moment. This sense of absolute awe, almost unbelieving admiration that it’s even possible to build games at this scale and at this detail, slapped hard around the face by the bewilderingly bad decisions that take place within it all.</p><p>To be excited about a beautifully crafted wall is to set yourself up for an aneurysm when you start to notice the tiny, inflecting details on characters’ faces, or the scrupulous idle animations of a bored guard. Then as I tried to conceive that this same level of care was taking place across thousands of locations in multiple cities over a handful of planets, my genuine thought was: “It’s ridiculous that we mark these games on the same criteria as others.” How can someone look at <em>this</em>, this <em>majesty</em>, and say, “Hmmm, seven out of ten?” And then a guard sees me through a solid hillside and ruins fifteen minutes of painstaking stealth, and I wonder how it can be on sale at all.</p><p>In 2024, we have reached the most deeply peculiar place, where AAA games are feats that humanity would once have recognized as literal wonders, and yet play with the same irritating issues and tedious repetition as we saw in the 90s. This contrast, this dissonance, is absolutely fascinating.</p><figure id="" data-id="7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-recommend-id="image://7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-recommend-id="image://7bd24507683aa2a95cfcbf43ea0289ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flying toward a wreck in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft strikes me as the leader in this bizarre space. I have, for years, been delighted and bemused by what that company is capable of creating, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-employees-have-grave-concerns-over-toronto-stud-1844277486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-employees-have-grave-concerns-over-toronto-stud-1844277486">albeit often not in positive ways</a></span>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series routinely builds entire cities, even countries, in authentic detail, to the point where we almost take it for granted. It has always struck me as the most horrendous waste that a game like <em>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey </em>can recreate ancient Greece in such wonderful detail, and then gets thrown away, that entire digital space never used again for anything else. It could be given to the world, offered as a setting for a thousand indie games, reused and recycled as such an achievement deserves. Instead, it’s there for that single game, where we reasonably kvetch about the frustrating details of a broken quest, or at how crowd AI bugs out at crucial moments.</p><p>And this is only to touch on the art and architecture. We’re not even mentioning the fantastic writing, the exquisite voice acting, the sound effects, the musical score, the lighting, the concept art that makes such designs possible, and the direction and leadership that can bring all these disparate parts together. All as a backdrop to my repeating the run across the gantry because a distant AI decided to be triggered by a Nix it couldn’t possibly see, or because that time when I pressed Square it decided to throw a punch instead of trigger a takedown.</p><figure id="" data-id="071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-recommend-id="image://071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-recommend-id="image://071ea941915445cd7a7006921b73c2c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay stares at an industrial complex." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m old enough to remember a time when we’d lament that a beautifully drawn point-and-click adventure was no fun to play, and be so disappointed that such lovely artistic skill had been the backdrop for illogical puzzles and bad writing. Imagine the camera shot pulling out from that adventure game and revealing the room it’s in, the house that contains that room, the town that house is in, the city that town forms part of, and the country in which that city exists—that gets you close to the scale at which the same issue plagues us 40 years later.</p><p>Just that opening city in <em>O</em>utlaws, Mirogana, is more than gaming was capable of ten years ago, let alone 40. It, alone, would be enough for an entire game, with plots and missions and characters. And it’s a blip in this game’s mindblowing breadth. I cannot over-express the scale of what’s offered here, and how incongruous it feels that it can all feel so easily dismissed given such fundamental errors. Errors that mean the game attracts headlines like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/star-wars-outlaws-simple-gameplay-combat-stealth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/star-wars-outlaws-simple-gameplay-combat-stealth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Is Too Simplistic For Its Own Good</a></span>.” And I get it! I know what the article means! It’s right that its stealth is banal and badly implemented, and yet such a core element of the game. But God damn, why are we able to reasonably call <em>this creation</em> “simplistic”?</p><p>I’ve no idea what the solution can possibly be, but I feel it sits somewhere in a new order of priority. One that involves scaling back the ambition of everything that a large-scale developer knows it <em>can </em>achieve, and re-focuses resources on fixing the absolute basics that it so often cannot. Because the tragedy of a piece of art like <em>Outlaws</em>—or any number of other architectural masterpieces that we see come and go in this industry every month—being able to be sniffed at with a (deserved) 7/10, is too awful.</p><p>Read More: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>At Gamescom this year, I saw a talk (currently embargoed) about how wind will cause a game’s world to behave differently, and on one level it was incredible stuff, a technological marvel. But on another, it’s going to offer absolutely <em>nothing</em> if that game’s basic loops are dreary, or if the enemy AI is going to endlessly run into beautifully rendered walls. It could end up being a 7/10 game with technologically astounding wind.</p><p>And so I come back to that wall. And I thank everyone involved in making it so special, the artists who spent so long ensuring it felt authentic, and the level designers who placed it, and the people responsible for collision detection who ensured I couldn’t walk through it, and the people who coded the Snowdrop engine so it could exist at all, and the producers who encouraged the developers who implemented it, and every single person who was in some way responsible for making me that wall to momentarily stare at. And I wish I hadn’t had to sneak past it <em>quite</em> so many times.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As someone who typically spends more time in single-player campaigns than competitive multiplayer scenes, I’m excited for more bombastic gameplay from Call of Duty in October. But as the game primarily focuses on multiplayer, there’s more info about the competitive gameplay than anything else. So, here’s everything you need to know about the Black Ops 6 campaign before release!</p>



<h2 id="h-will-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-have-a-campaign">Will Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Have a Campaign?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, yes, Black Ops 6 has a complete campaign with numerous missions that allow you to approach your objective uniquely. They’re not all moving to Point A, shooting everything in sight, watching a cutscene, rinse, and repeat. Players are said to have access to a safe house between missions, where they can play out upcoming objectives with an evidence board, along with upgrades and NPC dialogue to help further the story.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-story-of-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">What is the Story of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s story mode is set in the early 1990s, following the fall of the Berlin Wall. We’ll interact with high-profile politicians and military personnel, contend with cutthroat spycraft, infiltrate compounds, and utilize spy gadgetry to complete objectives.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>As is typical with the Black Ops storyline throughout the years, the sixth game features numerous story twists that should keep the gameplay and storyline fresh and leave us guessing what’s to come. </p>



<p>Of course, being Call of Duty, there’s a lot of bombastic gameplay, too. We’ll breach and clear safe houses, engage in all-out warfare, and utilize a number of unique pieces of equipment and weapons to get each job done.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-campaign-in-black-ops-6">How Long is the Campaign in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Following the rather disappointing and depressing length of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III’s campaign last year, which took some players just a few hours to finish, Treyarch aims to impress this go-around. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-campaign-wont-be-a-long-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign length</a> for Black Ops 6 is said to be approximately eight hours from start to finish. As always, some players may finish it sooner, and many will take longer, depending on their play style.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-6-a-sequel-to-cold-war">Is Black Ops 6 a Sequel to Cold War?</h2>



<p>Set in the early 1990s, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be a direct sequel to Call of Duty: Cold War, which was set in the 1980s. As expected, Frank Woods returns as part of the storyline, “adjusting to a new role within the CIA.”</p>



<p>Furthermore, we know that Alex Mason and Jason Hudson, both of whom played significant roles in the original Call of Duty: Black Ops, are dead in Black Ops 6.</p>

			<p>Survival Horror is going through a big resurgence at the moment (even if it never really went away) with genre titans <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/05/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Resident Evil</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/19/check-out-two-new-trailers-for-silent-hill-2/">Silent Hill</a> being joined by originators like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/20/alone-in-the-dark-review/">Alone in the Dark</a> and indie breakouts such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>. Amongst this assortment of monstrous experiences, Conscript stands out with its setting and visuals. Largely the work of a solo developer, Jordan Mochi, the end result is a traumatic and challenging game that takes the tried and tested tropes of the genre and mixes them with a truly horrific tone and feel.</p>
<p><iframe title="CONSCRIPT | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xg0_nVHmbWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While not unique in its wartime setting – relatively recently both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/07/psychological-horror-ad-infinitum-new-trailer/">Ad Infinitum</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/17/amnesia-the-bunker-review/">Amnesia: The Bunker</a> featured a similar backdrop – Conscript really comes into its own by focusing on the real horrors and traumas of The Great War (a name that becomes more ironic as time marches on). Supernatural elements are largely kept to the background here and instead the most horrific aspects are the violence and inhuman acts carried out by soldiers following orders. Your fragility and fears go a long way to replace the usual zombies and monsters that characterise the genre.</p>


<p>Set during the Battle of Verdun, you play as a French soldier who is trying to find his missing brother and make it through the conflict alive. In between chapters you play through short quiet flashbacks that help to familiarise you with your character and their background whilst also serving to offer a dynamic contrast with the dark and claustrophobic nature of the rest of the game. While this highly personal story runs the risk of romanticising or sentimentalising a savage and lethal part of history, the opposite is the case. This story places you within the conflict and gives you the opportunity to empathise with those put in an impossible position.</p>


<p>Conscript’s art direction is very distinctive. Using a top-down camera and employing a PS1 era level of fidelity gives the game a grimy look that is perfectly suited to the trenches and bunkers you’ll be traversing. The use of line of sight and the environmental darkness ensure that you never feel at ease too. Environments themselves are somewhat lacking in variety but that is a necessary part of the setting. That being said, the game does offer a range of locations from the trenches and forts to an occupied French town. The audio accompanying this is suitably oppressive and low key with the main focus being on atmospheric sound effects.</p>
<p>Very much in keeping with the Survival Horror genre, you’ll spend your time scavenging for resources, making choices about how best to best items to craft new supplies, juggling your weapons within a limited inventory and solving puzzles using logic and key items. This is all very on brand and there is little here that deviates from the established traditions, but that isn’t a criticism. In fact, most of the puzzles are well designed and just difficult enough to be enjoyable with a number requiring you to make notes.</p>

<p>Combat is a pretty large component of the game too, with a decent range of melee and ranged weapons to be scavenged and used as you try to survive. Enemies mostly consist of a handful of German troops with armaments that go from shovels to flamethrowers. A couple of more armoured types are used as mini bosses, but the combat is deliberately monotonous to highlight the pointlessness of the conflict. Your weapons can be upgraded by collecting weapon parts scattered across the maps and a recurring merchant is available who feels like an early ancestor of Resident Evil’s more iconic shopkeep. Here, the main currency is cigarettes, an especially evocative period feature.</p>
<p>There are various difficulty levels available, with extra rewards and trophies locked behind specific approaches, such as not killing outside of setpiece encounters or not taking damage. I began on the default difficulty and it mostly felt the right side of challenging, but the pre-release build did suffer from a rodent problem as the swarms of rats that appear after a few hours were far too fast and savage, with their attacks made even worse by a virulent poison effect. You can mitigate this to some extent by using grenades to destroy their nests and by burning bodies to prevent them spawning. This has been addressed in a patch (at least on PC) so should be less of a problem now.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Conscript is a worthy entry into the Survival Horror genre and comes highly recommended. It takes all the ingredients of the genre and marries them to a vital and under-represented part of history in video games to create a standout title that deserves a wider audience.	</p></div>

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has admitted he's made "the worst" decisions "passing" on some of gaming's biggest franchises over the years, including Bungie's Destiny and Harmonix's Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>In an interview called "Story Time with Phil Spencer" at PAX West over the weekend, Spencer opened up about the games that mattered most to him over the years, including Bungie's 2014 sci-fi shooter, Destiny, in his list.</p>

<p>"There's so many mixed emotions and stories for me around Destiny," Spencer explained.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Bungie was part of Microsoft when I started at Xbox, and I shared a floor with Alex Seropian [and] Jason Jones in the building that we were in Redmond. I learned a ton from just being around Bungie."</p>
<p>Despite his natural closeness to Bungie, Spencer admitted that Destiny "didn't really click" when he first played it, and it took until the game's first expansion, House of Wolves, for it to "land" him.</p>
<p>Consequently, Destiny went on to be published by Activision, as too was Guitar Hero, another series Spencer "passed" on, thinking it wasn't "going to work".</p>
<p>"I've passed on some of the worst… like, made some of the worst game-choice decisions," he said.</p>
<p>"An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, he pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars, and they're going to plug into consoles, and then they're going to sell tracks where you're going to play Simon on this guitar and I'm like, really? Do we really think that's going to work?</p>
<p>"I hear that turned into a pretty good game..." he added, laughing.</p>
<p>"I'm not a regrets-type person," Spencer explained. "Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games. I could look back and say-," he clenches his fist, "-but no, I try to look forward and be positive about the things that we are doing.</p>
<p>"I just like to celebrate what the team [at Bungie] has done. I mean, it's incredible."</p>
<p>Spencer also recently addressed the surprise revelation that first-party exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">release on PS5 in spring/Q2 2025</a> just a few months after its Xbox debut, stating Xbox is "a business", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-indiana-jones-ps5-launch-news-by-saying-xbox-is-a-business">"the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back"</a> to parent company Microsoft.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sumerian Six might <em>technically</em> owe its existence to the real-time, sight-cone-dodging stealth-tactics classics of the 90s and early 2000s - think Commandos and Desperados - but Mimimi's wonderful genre refinements, seen in the brilliant likes of Shadow Tactics and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew</a>, are in ample evidence as developer Artificer's rip-roaring, globe-trotting, Nazi-bashing pulp adventure unfolds. But for all its mechanical familiarity, Sumerian Six is - as I approach the seven-hour mark, at least - an absolute hoot, an inventive, richly conceived take on the genre that more than holds its own.</p>

<p>It's 1944 and, as our story begins, cocky young adventurer Sid Sterling is attempting to locate his sister Isabella in a Nazi-infested castle somewhere in the snow-covered Alps.  Isabella has been working undercover to keep tabs on scientist (and scoundrel) Hans Kammler, a former member of her father's disbanded Enigma Squad, who's been experimenting with a mysterious, devastatingly powerful substance known Geistoff - one that might, if the Sterlings can't put a stop to it, win the Third Reich's war.</p>
<p>Sumerian Six is properly rip-roaring comic book stuff, full of pulpy action, globe-spanning adventure, and wise-cracking heroes, that - with its witty banter, warm camaraderie, and a wonderfully weird soundtrack - is an immediately winning affair. And it's a gorgeous thing too, its expansive stages - or at least the mountaintop Nazi HQ, verdant German countryside, vertiginous Moroccan-inspired city, and sprawling factory in the heart of the desert I've seen so far - absolutely packed with detail.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a brief taste of Sumerian Six in action.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmvMX0b90m0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>More than that, though, they're cleverly designed tactical playgrounds, full of diverging pathways, discrete challenge sequences, and optional areas containing XP-boosting crates that encourage exploration and just feel rich with possibilities (I also can't get enough of the heist-movie-like cutscenes outlining possible plans of attack at the start of each mission, utilising scribbled overlays and twirling camera crash zooms). There's a good amount of variety within levels too; one segment might present a more puzzle-y challenge requiring you to think about your toolkit and navigate enemies in specific ways, while others take a more sandbox-y approach, and the organic ebb and flow is enormously satisfying.</p>
<blockquote>Sumerian Six certainly doesn't reinvent the stealth-tactics genre, but it's creative, thoughtfully designed, and enormously fun to play.</blockquote>
<p>That obviously wouldn't be the case if Sumerian Six's moment-by-moment tactical action wasn't up to much, but, so far, it's a pleasure to play. Mechanically, there won't be too many surprises for anyone who's experienced a stealth-tactics game in the last 30 years: it offers a familiar dance of tense sight-cone avoidance and environmental exploitation, borrowing liberally from across the genre's lifetime - including more than a few modern-day refinements from Mimimi Games. You'll scour maps for safe routes and environmental advantages, creep through foliage and crawl behind cover, crouch through jagged sightlines, hide bodies, slip through doors that belch you out elsewhere in a level, lay down markers to study who can see what and when, queue up actions to unleash simultaneously, and so on.</p>
<p>But Sumerian Six carves out its own niche with its wonderfully pulpy spirit and a wildly entertaining toolkit. So far, I've unlocked five playable characters (different missions bring different characters into play, meaning you're constantly forced outside your comfort zone if you're the kind of person to lean heavily on tried-and-tested strategies) and they're all wonderfully diverse, sporting complementary abilities that are a joy to experiment with. Isabella, for instance, can turn invisible for a set number of steps or instantly swap places with enemies (science! if you're wondering how all this is explained in-game), while her brother can go gung-ho with a noisy pistol, or sort-of possess opponents, hitching a ride and hopping from Nazi to Nazi as they pass each other on patrol.</p>
<p>Exiled chemist Rosa Reznick, meanwhile, is an absolute delight, with some truly fiendish tricks up her sleeve. She can root enemies to the spot with an IV drip, melt them into a puddle so their bodies don't need to be hidden (this isn't a quiet process, however), or turn them into walking bombs - useful for taking out groups of their cohorts as they patrol on by. Alistair Sterling commands lightning and can access hilariously entertaining directional spring traps, while Wojtek, when he's not distracting enemies with a well-time bottle toss, can maul them to death by turning into a werebear. It all adds up to an enjoyably flexible toolkit that's rich in tactical potential - bolstered by varied enemy design requiring subtle shifts in strategy, and a gradual progression of new environmental wrinkles, including reinforcement alarms, ability dampeners, and deadly barriers.</p>

<p>Sumerian Six certainly doesn't reinvent the stealth-tactics genre, but - from what I've played at least - it's creative, thoughtfully designed, and enormously fun to play. It is, though, a little lacking in polish, my playthrough marred by issues that make the whole thing feel sloppier than is ideal. I've had abilities suddenly stop working without a reload, crashes when trying to access quick saves from other levels, enemies being alerted to my movements way outside the indicated noise range, sight cones refusing to display for no obvious reason, weirdly inconsistent enemy placement on quick loads, and more. Thankfully, none of this is a regular enough occurrence that it detracts from what Sumerian Six gets right, but there's definitely a sense it could have done with a bit more cooking time.</p>
<p>I am, though, having a blast with Sumerian Six, tinkering around with its inventive toolkit and unleashing sneaky, Nazi-felling mayhem across its cleverly designed world. I was worried Artificer might struggle to impress after Mimimi Games' wonderful Shadow Gambit - not to mention last month's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-breach-wizards-review">stellar genre-adjacent Tactical Breach Wizards</a> - but Sumerian Six is a pleasure so far and, issues of polish aside, a wonderful surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This list ranks all 19 films Tim Burton has directed since 1985, honoring a decades-long career that celebrates the weirdos of this world.

The film depicts clueless Americans being overtaken by extraterrestrials—big-brained creatures with giant heads, bulging eyeballs, and mean mugs. The obviously fake CGI is meant to honor the kitschy aesthetic of the ‘50s, but it’s so goofy-looking it’s hard to take any of it even remotely serious. The film’s cast is stacked with stars such as Jack Nicholson, Danny DeVito, Glenn Close, Annette Benning, Michael J. Fox, Martin Short, and Pam Grier, but all the star power in the world can’t make up for how <em>Mars Attacks</em> is nothing more than a hodgepodge of bizarre gags that are painfully unfunny and too long. All the strangeness—such as Sarah Jessica Parker’s head on a Chihuahua or the hokey skeletons people turn into when they’re zapped by Martians—feels more creepy than comical. The innocent charisma of the original B-movies is lost here and any attempts to satirize it doesn’t translate well to the 1990s.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0ef801c47f6cabdfe6aba89a10aeaea8" data-recommend-id="image://0ef801c47f6cabdfe6aba89a10aeaea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mark Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter (in full ape makeup) stand together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In between the sloppy sequels of the 1968 original and the epic prequel series with Andy Serkis’ stunning motion-capture performance, there was Tim Burton’s tepid 2001 remake of <em>Planet of the Apes</em>. The main issue with Burton’s version is that it’s either far too campy (like some of the apes complaining about a bad hair day) or struggles to deftly handle the heavier themes of race and class. Mark Wahlberg seems adrift in this blockbuster about a planet where humans are enslaved by far more intelligent apes, and is no match for Charlton Heston, who starred in the first film. The clear standout of <em>The Planet of the Apes</em> is artist Rick Baker’s incredible special FX makeup, which seamlessly transformed well-known actors such as Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Paul Giamatti into primates while still retaining some of their recognizable features.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4176a3f8b1a6c74124e930e7fc97a954" data-recommend-id="image://4176a3f8b1a6c74124e930e7fc97a954" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Johnny Depp as a vampire sits at a table.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Tim Burton is all over the place trying to adapt <em>Dark Shadows</em>, a popular soap opera from the 1960s about a wealthy vampire Barnabas Collins in a centuries-long feud with the witch Angelique Bouchard. Of course, Collins’ sprawling Maine estate looks incredible, showcasing Tim Burton’s signature Gothic style with ominous spires and stone statues displayed with exquisite attention to detail. The dramatic lighting and wide shots, which take in dust-covered chandeliers and old-fashioned paintings, bring the mansion to life in ways the original television show never could. But for all its spellbinding production design, the story is lacking.<br></p><p>While Tim Burton is usually an expert at striking the right tone, he doesn’t know whether to lean into the campiness or scariness, resulting in a film that toes a boring line down the middle. Rather than indulging us in another chameleonic performance, Johnny Depp seems to be sleepwalking, making this his weakest collaboration with Burton to date (and, thus far, his last). Most of the magnetic power comes from the female cast such as Eva Green and Michelle Pfeiffer. <em>Dark Shadows</em> fails to capture the essence of the original series and doesn’t add anything of its own. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f7c2f238ca17ed4474dc9c4fb22ed9f" data-recommend-id="image://6f7c2f238ca17ed4474dc9c4fb22ed9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dumbo stands with friends.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With an eye for marvels and curiosities, Tim Burton has always had a thing for circuses, and they have appeared in most of his films. So, who better to direct a new <em>Dumbo</em> movie and tell the tale of a baby circus elephant rejected for his enormous ears who discovers he can fly? With his big blue eyes, the CGI version of Dumbo is just cartoony enough to avoid the uncanny valley of the ultra-realism seen in <em>The Lion King</em> “live-action” adaptation. But the issue with Burton’s version, as with many live-action Disney flicks, is that it stretches a short film into a nearly two-hour one. </p><p>While some changes, such as removing Timothy Q. Mouse and the racist crows, were necessary, the post-World War I story of a one-armed veteran and his children who take care of Dumbo isn’t engaging enough—despite all of Colin Farrell’s charms. Try as we may to invest in them, we just want to return to the main attraction: Dumbo. Unfortunately, <em>Dumbo </em>is Tim Burton’s ugliest film with haphazard CGI and muted colors that make it seem like the camera lens was smeared with mud. The only thing <em>Dumbo </em>has going for it is that the elephant is really, really cute.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60c9cdd04ad8af6bad4386dafec0a09b" data-recommend-id="image://60c9cdd04ad8af6bad4386dafec0a09b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alice stands with the white rabbit.

While the 2010 <em>Alice in Wonderland </em>has everything that makes a Tim Burton movie so uniquely his—enchanting yet strange character designs, a Victorian Gothic aesthetic, and exquisitely-detailed, surrealistic sets—it still somehow manages to be lackluster. </p><p>The film’s standouts are its main characters, whose spooky qualities contribute to a more twisted version of Wonderland. Johnny Depp’s Mad Hatter, with his pale face, bright green eyes, and orange frizzy hair, resembles a crazed clown, while Helena Bonham Carter’s Red Queen has a giant CGI head to emphasize her haughtiness. Tweedledee and Tweedledum, with their eerie sunken eyes and rotund bodies supported by tiny, thin legs, recall The Penguin from <em>Batman</em>. But this version of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> attempts to inject a bland, #girlpower brand of feminism into Alice’s character. She becomes a warrior leading boring battle sequences set against dull grayish hues. </p><p>This type of expansion on the original narrative, often in service of creating stronger female characters, would become a hit-or-miss trend in future Disney live-action adaptations. Despite all the visual abundance,<em> Alice in Wonderland</em> falls short. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d76181fc41058132e57d15f640445508" data-recommend-id="image://d76181fc41058132e57d15f640445508" data-format="webp" data-width="1440" data-height="959" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The peculiar children stand together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The cover of Ransom Riggs’ book <em>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</em> looks exactly like a Tim Burton movie: black and white, featuring a creepy Victorian child, and bare, bent trees in the background. The book and movie follows a young boy who discovers a group of children with paranormal abilities known as the “Peculiars,” and their time-looping caretaker who can transform into a peregrine falcon. As Miss Alma Lefay Peregrine, Eva Green has a quiet, intense presence that makes her performances hypnotic to watch. Emma Purcell, playing a girl who can manipulate air, is another highlight, her expressive, owl-like eyes convey an earnestness that drives the story forward. </p><p>In Burton’s hands, the Hollowgast villains are transformed into surreal, nightmarish creatures with pale bodies, eyeless heads, sharp teeth, and multiple pointed tongues. While the imaginative premise, peculiar characters, and Victorian mansion setting are undeniably Burtonesque, there are too many plot and pacing issues. <em>Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</em> feels rushed and uncaring in the emotions of what’s happening on screen, merely hitting the story beats of the YA phenomenon to set it up for future sequels. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="baa672231ad12cf2f5093bc947a1546d" data-recommend-id="image://baa672231ad12cf2f5093bc947a1546d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pee-wee hitchhikes.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pee-wee scared me as a young child, so I was never a big fan of <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em>, though I know it’s a nostalgic favorite for many. Paul Reubens’s over-the-top performance as the optimistic boy who never grew up and in search of his bicycle was too grating; his wild antics, such as dancing for a motorcycle gang or sneaking onto a Warner Bros. lot, were too goofy. But as Tim Burton’s debut feature film, it’s an important showcase for the quirky aesthetic he would soon become famous for. The dream sequences in particular, with killer clowns and a stop-motion T. Rex, have the kind of scary playfulness that foreshadow his later work. <em>Pee-wee’s Big Adventure</em> has a relentless childlike absurdity that many find charming—especially younger audiences. But if you don’t find Pee-wee funny or cute, there’s not much here aside from the eye-popping special effects. <br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a3f28aa5eeaaa319f29ac90598114db1" data-recommend-id="image://a3f28aa5eeaaa319f29ac90598114db1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy Adams holds a painting.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Big Eyes</em> is a biopic of a misunderstood artist, and while it doesn’t hit the emotional or visual highs of<em> Ed Wood</em>, it’s anchored by a nuanced performance from Amy Adams as Margaret Keane, the real woman behind the famous paintings of sappy-eyed children (her abusive husband, Walter Keane, passed himself off as the true artist). It’s the little moments that make Amy Adams’ performance, everything she doesn’t say as she tightens her lips or the flickering disappointment in her eyes over her husband’s lies. Once again, Tim Burton uses color to communicate the story’s emotions: the joys of their early marriage are bathed in saturated colors but become darker with cooler tones during their conflicts over the paintings. It’s refreshing to see Tim Burton explore the intimate lives of ordinary people; he does it so well that one wishes he would more often.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b4d4d9bd026e7989247ccc4477c4447" data-recommend-id="image://3b4d4d9bd026e7989247ccc4477c4447" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Willy Wonka stands with the chocolate factory guests.

Tim Burton lovingly crafts Willy Wonka’s vast candy palace with built sets instead of CGI, filling them with bright, green grass, giant candy cane trees, and a chocolate waterfall. All the sweet goodies look glossy and almost too perfect to be real. Burton creates a striking contrast between the wondrous factory and the drab, industrial town in which it resides, with Charlie’s thatched house exaggeratedly leaning to one side. </p><p>With a lighthearted voice and fussiness, Johnny Depp creates a version of Willy Wonka that is less psychopathic than Gene Wilder’s. He’s funnier and has more emotional depth, more like a socially inept, overgrown child with daddy issues. We sympathize with him as we learn more about his traumatic childhood and strained relationship with his father, played by the great Christopher Lee. </p><p>Instead of the horrifying, hypnotic drone from the original, Burton’s Oompa-Loompa musical sequences are catchy and fun, using a variety of genres from heavy metal to hippie folk. <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> uses pre-existing material that was perfect for the Burton’s brand of childlike wonder and weirdness. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1776d39dd917fa1ab6817afab2adb86f" data-recommend-id="image://1776d39dd917fa1ab6817afab2adb86f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The corpse bride stands with her new hsuband.

Johnny Depp sounds so different from his other roles as the shy and skittish Victor who, shortly before his arranged marriage, accidentally marries a dead socialite named Emily. She brings him to the very lively Land of the Dead, filled with bright green, purple, and blue hues, toe-tapping musical numbers, and kooky skeleton characters (including an adorable dead dog named Scraps). </p><p>Burton clearly enjoys juxtaposing this surprisingly upbeat world with the dour, stuffy grays of Victorian England. <em>Corpse Bride </em>features all kinds of creative, gross-out humor, such as a maggot that pops out of Emily’s eye socket. Many of the deceased characters in <em>Corpse Bride</em> resemble the way they died, such as a pair of generals with cannon holes and swords in their stomachs—Victor’s bumbling and terrified interactions with them are hilarious. </p><p>There’s also very moving moments, like Emily’s murder by her fiancé for her fortune. Helena Bonham Carter’s feathery voice conveys a wounded young woman, and her singing is beautifully haunting. One particularly touching scene with butterflies will bring you to tears. <em>Corpse Bride</em> is funny yet melancholy, creepy yet cute, and a whole lot of fun. It proves that kids can enjoy dark stories, too. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee022b26363c798a5efd6096d3efd87b" data-recommend-id="image://ee022b26363c798a5efd6096d3efd87b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="930" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Batman runs down the steps of a museum.

Burton transforms Gotham into a living, breathing urban jungle that perfectly matches Bruce Wayne’s tortured self. The cramped buildings with sharp spires and bold facades are reminiscent of German Expressionist movies such as Fritz Lang’s <em>Metropolis </em>and F. W. Murnau’s <em>The Last Laugh</em>. </p><p>Despite the exaggerated sets, <em>Batman </em>is grounded by Michael Keaton’s performance; he shades Batman and Bruce Wayne with a blend of coolness, toughness, and vulnerability. His soft, composed Batman voice indicates a hidden strength and steady confidence that other actors playing Batman rarely have. Jack Nicholson, of course, is iconic as the Joker, delivering a wonderfully ostentatious performance with his trademark cheeky smile; he behaves like the manic ringleader of a twisted circus. </p><p>It may not be the best <em>Batman </em>adaptation—that honor belongs to the Christopher Nolan trilogy—but it has a darkly atmospheric look thanks to Burton’s direction that effectively taps into the pulpy aspects of the comic book.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1af5ca553c401d05891f71bcf781d290" data-recommend-id="image://1af5ca553c401d05891f71bcf781d290" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

After discovering their child has physical differences, a snooty rich couple dumps his cradle in a freezing river—on Christmas, no less! Backed by the eerie choir of Danny Elfman’s score, it travels down to the grimy sewers where penguins wander.The film is defined by this type of cruelty, particularly in Danny DeVito’s Penguin. He is a loud, brash character with a grotesque appearance—lumpy and misshapen with a beak-like nose. His short and round features, waddling walk, and volatile outbursts make him seem more animal-like than human.</p><p>DeVito’s campy performance is the true highlight of <em>Batman Returns</em>, along with Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman, of course. Her performance is delightfully unhinged and exudes eroticism, particularly in her BDSM-esque leather suit and enjoyment of tying people up. The movie has cartoony elements, like the Penguin driving a giant duck car, but there’s also intense violence where he bites off a man’s nose and blood oozes in between his teeth; another man is electrocuted, his white eyes popping out of his burnt, crispy flesh. </p><p><em>Batman Returns</em> is far more interesting and visually dynamic than the first because it leans into a certain kind of loony ugliness that only Tim Burton could create.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c89fc4577133c1007624c49ab3ad2278" data-recommend-id="image://c89fc4577133c1007624c49ab3ad2278" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Sleepy Hollow cast stands together.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Sleepy Hollow</em> is one of Tim Burton’s most gorgeous films, flaunting a rich, Gothic aesthetic that recalls the bold Hammer horror classics. The images of plunging bodice necklines, gnarled trees, misty roads, and thatched-roof cottages create a dark and detailed period film. Every shot is drenched in somber grays and blacks, giving all of the characters ghostly facial hues while making the rivers of blood in this very gory movie pop off the screen. </p><p>Johnny Depp’s performance is a big part of what makes <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> work so well as a vibrant mix of campiness, black humor, and genuine terror. He fully embodies the persnickety Ichabod Crane who believes more in science than the supernatural. He has a toolkit of bizarre inventions, including a set of bug-like eyepieces that he likes to fiddle with, but he gets sick having to conduct autopsies and wound examinations of the headless victims. <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> builds to a thrilling climax with Christopher Walken as the evil Headless Horseman.&nbsp;</p><p>As one of Tim Burton’s best, <em>Sleepy Hollow</em> is one of the few horror movies where you have lots of fun but also get chills.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06aa98f9a7977b6523598b7a82253eba" data-recommend-id="image://06aa98f9a7977b6523598b7a82253eba" data-format="jpg" data-width="512" data-height="288" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett sit together at the beach.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street </em>resembles Sleepy Hollow in its meticulous period detail and dreary, overcast colors—the red blood from slashed throats is brighter than anything on screen. Johnny Depp stars as Sweeney Todd, a man who loses his wife and daughter to the evil Judge Turpin and returns from imprisonment in Australia seeking vengeance. </p><p>Depp’s singing voice has a rock and roll edge that really works for the character and articulates his raw, heartbroken rage. Sweeney forms a devious partnership with Mrs. Lovett, murdering his barbershop clients and turning them into meat pies in preparation for his reckoning with Turpin. Helena Bonham Carter’s vocals, on the other hand, are far too soft and weak for a character as brash as Mrs. Lovett. </p><p>Burton adds a touch of his whimsical flair to some of the scenes, particularly Mrs. Lovett’s fantasy “By the Sea” where <em>Sweeney Todd</em> wears a Beetlejuice-esque black and white bathing suit. All of the musical numbers have this type of creative vision and fluid and dynamic camera movements. <em>Sweeney Todd </em>is a killer mix of horror, black humor, and melodrama, and one of Burton’s bests.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="345da1f221c90ae594e6c08b3d113164" data-recommend-id="image://345da1f221c90ae594e6c08b3d113164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frankenweenie looks at his owner.

Ironically, Disney ended up firing Tim Burton for making a kids film that was too frightening, but in 2012, Tim Burton was able to make a 3D, stop-motion version of his short. </p><p>The new <em>Frankenweenie </em>is sophisticated and touching, reflecting Tim Burton’s many years as a seasoned filmmaker. The sharp, black-and-white visuals make the impressive quality of the puppets really stand out, particularly the odd little children with giant saucer eyes and little dots for pupils, and the adorable, energetic Sparky. </p><p>Set in 1957, the monochromatic <em>Frankenweenie </em>serves as a tender homage to the classic monster movies that inspired Tim Burton growing up. <em>Frankenweenie </em>has a childlike sensibility with its morbid and gross humor, but there’s also a sweetness that comments on the special bond between children and their pets. It’s a wonderful family film that was clearly made with Tim Burton’s heart and soul. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="64d94308ef11064e299587ca5a71266f" data-recommend-id="image://64d94308ef11064e299587ca5a71266f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ed Wood sits in the director chair.

Ed Wood was a Hollywood outcast who directed fiascos with threadbare budgets and past-their-peak movie stars. As Ed Wood, Johnny Depp brings a determined cheerfulness to the role that is difficult to resist. The scenes of Ed’s on-the-fly movie-making are hilarious, showing a director who likes to shoot everything in one take, no matter what. He just enjoys the process of making a movie! The emotional heart of the film is Ed Wood’s relationship with Bela Lugosi, a formerly famous horror actor struggling with drug issues, played by a superb Martin Landau. Ed Wood’s life story was a perfect match for a Tim Burton film because he has such an affection for outsiders. That tenderness and care shines through in Burton’s treatment of this unique slice of Hollywood history.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="49397c0f5d790a4fbdf31f17d524b4f9" data-recommend-id="image://49397c0f5d790a4fbdf31f17d524b4f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Beetlejuice smiles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Beetlejuice smiles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Michael Keaton delivers an unforgettable performance as the title character, completely transforming himself with a spastic walk, electric-socket hair, and peeling green skin. He is an uncouth showman whose evilness manifests in irreverent humor and boundary-crossing antics. All of the characters in <em>Beetlejuice </em>are striking, and the performances are equally memorable, from Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis as the ghost couple, to Catherine O’Hara as the melodramatic sculptor, and Winona Ryder as the enigmatic teenage Lydia.</p><p><em>Beetlejuice</em> is a delightfully absurd and creative romp that depicts the sunny, all-American innocence of suburbia with a macabre twist, topped off with demon-possession musical numbers by Harry Belafonte It’s this oddball mix that not only makes it a great movie, but a Halloween favorite.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a03fe76d5b1c8279d0b32c73d0f8052" data-recommend-id="image://8a03fe76d5b1c8279d0b32c73d0f8052" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward Bloom stands in a field of flowers.

Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor are perfectly cast as the older and younger version of Edward Bloom, a charismatic salesman with a love of adventure and a twinkle in his eye. Edward loves to share colorful stories about his life kissing mermaids, catching a massive fish, meeting a giant at the circus, and witnessing his future in the glass eye of a witch, all of which are visual spectacles full of fantastical settings, vibrant colors, and dreamlike details. </p><p>After dazzling us with whimsy and setting up the core problem (Edward’s son, William, played by Billy Crudup, is tired of his father’s tall tales), <em>Big Fish</em> reaches a highly emotional climax that solidifies the film as one of Tim Burton’s best. Beautiful and sentimental, <em>Big Fish</em> reminds us of the importance of family and sharing memories and stories with one another so our legacy lives on. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-recommend-id="image://361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-recommend-id="image://361bd104a5c5b3547a9cdbe8616b6a0e" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward wields his bladed fingers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Edward Scissorhands </em>is Tim Burton’s crowning achievement, marking a significant departure from his more comic or action-oriented films that gives the eccentric aesthetic he’s known for a profound emotional gravitas. It’s also the first time Tim Burton worked with Johnny Depp, who would go on to star in seven more of his films. </p><p>Depp plays a young man with scissors for hands who is taken in by a kindhearted Avon lady. With minimal dialogue and an unassuming presence, his performance resembles a silent film actor’s. In frequent close-ups, Johnny Depp communicates so much through his sad brown eyes: confusion, child-like innocence, a broken soul. Winona Ryder plays the blonde cheerleader whom Edward falls for, and their unspoken, empathetic connection draws you into the classic story of an ostracized “beast” falling for a beauty. </p><p>Unlike Tim Burton’s other films, which often emphasize the comedic elements of his fanciful settings, this one juxtaposes the monotonous rows of pastel-colored houses with the ink-black Gothic castle where Edward lives to make thoughtful observations on societal rejection of outsiders and people with differences. There are so many moments that feel straight out of a storybook, such as when Kim twirls in the “snow” created by Edward, accompanied by Danny Elfman’s enchanting choral score. </p><p><em>Edward Scissorhands</em> is not only Tim Burton’s best film, but one of the greatest modern fairy tales ever told.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
