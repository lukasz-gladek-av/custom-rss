		<p>We now know who we will be playing as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/alien-rogue-incursion/">Alien: Rogue Incursion,</a>&nbsp; Zula Hendricks. She is described as “an unbreakable ex-Colonial Marine, on a dangerous mission that brings her to the uncharted planet Purdan.”</p>
<p>”&nbsp;With her sentient AI companion, Davis-01, Zula must fight her way to the heart of the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions black-site facility.&nbsp;There she will need to survive deadly attacks from the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered and discover new horrors and threats that once unleashed could spell the end for humankind.”</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Zula Hendricks Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/49WAFl7u6gA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Alien game project has been in development for the last two years at VR specialists Survios. The company burst on the scene with the dawn of VR with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/raw-data-review/">Raw Data</a> in 2016, before bringing the rapid releases of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/22/sprint-vector-review/">Sprint Vector</a>, Electonauts and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/21/creed-rise-to-glory-psvr-2-release-date-april/">Creed: Rise to Glory</a> through 2018.</p>
<p>There’s a rich pedigree for Survios and VR, in other words, but really the main reason why people will be excited for Alien: Rogue Incursion is because of 2014 game Alien: Isolation. The celebrated horror game was once shown as being playable in VR prior to release, and fans have long wanted to see a VR version of the game released – hopes that will sadly never be realised at this point. Hopefully Rogue Incursion can be the VR horror surrogate that we need.</p>

<p>“Our team at Survios are huge fans of Alien and have been building Alien: Rogue Incursion for a long time, honing our ability to pair the most technically advanced, immersive, and engaging VR experiences with best-in-class franchises,” says TQ Jefferson, Chief Product Officer at Survios. “This fully original story embraces all our favorite elements from 45 years of Alien, from kinetic action and heart-pounding exploration to our terrifyingly resourceful Xenomorphs that will truly make your skin crawl. We can’t wait for fans to get their hands on it this holiday season.”</p>
<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion will launch on&nbsp; PSVR 2, Meta Quest 3 and Steam VR this&nbsp;Holiday 2024.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> director Aaron Keller has posted a lengthy blog on Steam about the transition from 6v6 player matches in the first Overwatch to 5v5 in the poorly received free-to-play sequel. It's a juicy read for armchair designers and lapsed Overwatchers like myself, packing in analysis of class roles and the shift from the free choice of heroes to single hero picks and enforced team compositions.</p>
<p>In broad strokes, Keller summarises how the Overwatch experience has drifted away from "player freedom and creativity in order to create a more balanced, consistent and competitive experience for players". It's possible, however, that Overwatch 2 will swing back in the other direction, as Blizzard are now "exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results", with a view to restoring some of the joyful chaos that saw entire teams of Reinhardts charging the objective in formation.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The community has, juuuust once or twice, suggested a test," Keller <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2357570/view/4352250327659121671?l=english">writes in the post</a>. "Why not put various forms of 6v6 in the game in order to gauge the results? We agree, and based on your feedback, we're exploring how we can test different forms of 6v6 in the game to gauge the results."</p>
<p>Don't expect those tests to begin anytime soon, however, as there are a number of obstacles. "The first, and honestly largest, reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance (I'm referring to framerate and memory constraints) with 12 players in a match," Keller goes on.</p>
<p>He notes that Overwatch 2 has seen several upgrades and additions that impact performance, such as HUD outlines for allied heroes and fancier map fixtures. "In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can have significant impacts for our players, causing the game to underperform on older systems. Overwatch is a fast-paced game, and maintaining a game that runs smoothly across all our platforms is important for the player's experience."</p>
<p>As such, "while a limited time test could arrive sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently increase performance across the game," Keller writes. "This would be a large effort that would most likely take at least several seasons to accomplish."</p>
<p>The bigger issue, however, may be the effect of a return to 6v6 on the game's multiplayer queue times. A fair chunk of Keller's blog is devoted to explaining how the combination of role queues and the original 12-a-side format led to delays finding a match. Blizzard were not able to really address this problem in the first game, Keller comments, hence shrinking the headcount in Overwatch 2. He's not 100% confident they'll fare better second time around.</p>
<p>"Another issue, and one that still gives me anxiety about opening this Pandora's Box, is what to do with queue times if enough players prefer 6v6 to keep some form of it around," the post goes on. "The team was not able to solve this issue previously. While we have some ideas now, there's no guarantee that they will work. </p>
<p>"Is there a world where people are willing to live with long queue times to play this format? Maybe, but that's a pretty risky move to make. We also have tens of millions of new players that have only played 5v5. We want to be openly mindful not to frustrate those who like the game as it is today."</p>
<p>In the event that Blizzard do host some 6v6 tests, these would likely run for a few weeks, with the results being compared against regular Overwatch 2 modes. "We would reflect carefully on the learnings from whatever test we run and explore how to best give players what's being asked for," Keller says. "Whether that's a world of 5v5, 6v6 or even both, is for future us to figure out."</p>
<p>Keller is upfront about the fact that the evolution of Overwatch into Overwatch 2 was a trade-off that has alienated much of the first game's audience. "The game started its life with six players on each team," he writes. "I discussed why we moved away from 6v6, but that doesn't mean it's without any merit. There were moments and madness that could happen with twelve players in a match that just don't quite coalesce when there are ten."</p>
<p>The occasional feeling of overwhelm was "part of the charm", Keller adds. "There are big moments in Overwatch 2, but they don't quite have that same chaotic, over-the-top feeling to them." More specifically, having two tanks in the mix per side "had a stabilizing effect on gameplay" whereby "teams would fold a bit slower than they do now".</p>
<p>The sequel is a more focussed competitive experience and perhaps, the superior esport, but it doesn't have the same sense of abandon, Keller acknowledges. "When you look at the changes to Overwatch since its inception, it's clear that many of those have reduced some of the variety within an Overwatch match," the post concedes. "We get feedback from some players that Overwatch can feel "the same" from game to game."</p>
<p>"While much of this gets attributed to 5v5, we feel that there is more at play here. Besides running experiments with 6v6, we'd like to run some that re-examine the ways we tried solving previous problems, specifically with the goal of bringing some of the freedom back to an Overwatch match without the severity of issues that accompanied it."</p>
<p>The on-going dislike for Overwatch 2 (it still has a Mostly Negative user review consensus on Steam) is about more than 5v5, of course. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/overwatch-2s-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-launch-brings-years-of-frustration-to-the-boil">Take your pick</a>: the first game no longer being available, making the sequel a forced replacement; the retiring of certain grand plans for story modes; nickel-and-diming players with the battle pass. Still, there's a great hero sandbox in there somewhere, and the prospect of a tentative move back toward the first game's looser, wildcard ethos is encouraging.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> fans believe a trademark for "Starborn" registered by Bethesda parent company Zenimax earlier this month points to the game's currently unrevealed second expansion, likely due in 2025.</p>
<p>Bethesda's space RPG released last year, and is set to launch its first expansion Shattered Space in the coming months. In conversation with YouTuber MrMattyPlays back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Bethesda's Todd Howard confirmed there would be at least one more expansion to come after Shattered Space</a>, stating the studio was already "planning for the one after this".</p>
<p>It now appears that this 'planning' has made further progress, thanks to that aforementioned trademark. As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222">Timur222</a> on social media platform X, Bethesda has filed a trademark for something known as <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/986/45/starborn-98645285.html">Starborn</a>. What is a Starborn? We'll explain below - so <strong>beware of small Starfield spoilers</strong>.</p>

<p>A mysterious group known as Starborn feature in the base game. They have passed through a portal known as the Unity and travelled between universes. Starborn only reveal themselves to the heroic Constellation group after enough of the game's Artefacts have been collected.</p>
<p>Purely speculatively for now, this trademark suggests that Starfield's next DLC after Shattered Space could focus on this group, perhaps expanding on the group's origins and their abilities to visit different universes.</p>
<p>We shall have to wait and see.</p>

<p>As for more imminent DLC, we got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-look-at-starfields-shattered-space-expansion-but-still-no-release-date">first proper look at Starfield's Shattered Space expansion</a> earlier this year, when Bethesda released a space-horror flavoured trailer during Xbox's summer showcase. You can check it out in the video above.</p>
<p>Shattered Space will offer a fresh mystery involving the snake-loving House Va'ruun, at some point later in 2024.</p>

If you disagree, you can do that somewhere else,” due to “brigading” in the comments.</p><p>The post followed a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">controversial statement</a> issued by Ubisoft to Japanese fans in which the company apologized for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">promotion materials</a> it said “have caused concern” among the community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows Concept Art With Historical Re-Enactment Group's Flag</h3></div></output><p>The four-page message, posted in both English and Japanese, explained that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is not intended to be a factual representation of history. Instead, it is described as “a compelling, historical fiction set in Feudal Japan. Ubisoft added that it hoped Shadows would “spark curiosity” in players who then research the historical period the game is inspired by.</p><p>In addition to the apology regarding the marketing materials, the message also discussed Yasuke, one of Shadows’ two protagonists: “While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin’s Creed Shadows, we acknowledge that this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven this carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles.”</p><p>While Yasuke has often been presented as a samurai in popular media, both in Japan and beyond, his depiction in Shadows has given rise to debate regarding the historical truth. The argument has lived side-by-side with criticism over Ubisoft’s decision to feature a Black man as a lead protagonist in a Japan-set Assassin’s Creed game – <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-condemns-hateful-acts-against-developers-following-ac-shadows-backlash"><u>a backlash Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot alluded to while condemning “malicious and personal online attacks.”</u></a></p><p>The statement noted that the Assassin’s Creed series has always taken “creative license and incorporated fantasy elements” into its historically-inspired settings. “The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of this. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an Assassin’s Creed story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>The mod team behind r/assassinscreed said Ubisoft’s statement “exacerbated” what it called “this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death,” and gave users of the subreddit a “final reminder” of what the Assassin’s Creed franchise entails.</p><p>Here’s the r/assassinscreed mod team’s statement in full:</p><blockquote>With the reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows, there has been an influx of certain individuals spilling into various communities online such as this subreddit and raising arguments about "historical accuracy". As we are all exhausted of this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death, not to mention exacerbated by a recent official statement from Ubisoft, we would like to give a final reminder to those participating in these debates as to what exactly this franchise entails, and why there was never any point to these discussions to begin with outside of thinly veiling bad faith intent.</blockquote><blockquote>Assassin's Creed is historical fiction. This means that while certain locations, events and figures may be based on reality, and can even have a slight focus on accuracy, their depictions are largely exaggerated for the sake of a more enjoyable video game. While all of our player protagonists have been fictional to date, the introduction of Yasuke has given some people the false impression that the above rule does not apply. It still does. Yasuke, who is a samurai as confirmed by multiple reputable historians around the world including from Japan, may not have held as large as a role in the real world as he does in Shadows. This is okay. It is a video game. You are not meant to use Assassin's Creed as a sourcebook for actual historical knowledge - it is meant to compel you to do your own external research after immersing you in a glimpse of authenticity.</blockquote><blockquote>We are not here in this community to debate on historical record. Most of us understand as fans that while these games provide us a great look into what historical settings could have felt like and have fun comparing them to actual record, we do not chase accuracy within this franchise and primarily play for other reasons. So if you are specifically here to leave comments about your displeasure about Yasuke's inclusion or various other inaccurate details that have been pointed out in Ubisoft's depiction of Feudal Japan, it is time to understand that this is not the place for this discussion and it never will be. Feel free to take your displeasures elsewhere, away from this franchise and its communities.</blockquote><blockquote>Any further comments attempting to dispute Yasuke's societal status, disparage his inclusion in game or containing statements bordering on concern trolling for historical accuracy will be swiftly removed and met with a ban.</blockquote><p>The mod team also provided a list of links to reddit posts explaining how the Assassin’s Creed series has handled historical accuracy in previous games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The post outlines the subreddit’s firm stance on Shadows, and is a clear attempt to draw a line under what has become one of the big talking points around the game. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-reddit-takes-firm-stance-on-yasuke-debate-says-ubisoft-exacerbated-issue-with-statement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> pointed out, this debate has spilled over into the real-world, with a fringe Japanese politician requesting the Japanese government comment on the matter. But so far there has been no meaningful result.</p><p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches November 12, 2024 for those buying the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-collectors-edition"><u>Gold, Ultimate, Deluxe Editions</u></a>, or Collector's Editions, while the Standard Edition is available on November 15, 2024.

<p>ICYMI, Balatro is getting a physical edition. Localthunk confirmed last month that fans will soon be able to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-is-getting-a-physical-edition-on-playstation-switch-and-xbox-consoles">pick up a physical copy of the game on PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles</a>.</p>

            <p>
Doctor Who and Star Trek are officially crossing over, with David Tennant's iconic Tenth Doctor and his future wife River Song meeting characters from the animated Star Trek: Lower Decks series. 
</p>
<p>
The crossover will take place as a limited-time event beginning 1st August in two mobile games: <a href="https://bit.ly/STLD">Star Trek: Lower Decks - The Badgey Directive</a> and <a href="https://bit.ly/46OOf53">Doctor Who: Lost in Time</a>.
</p>
<p>
Events in both games will show different perspectives of the same wibbly-wobbly space-time macguffin, with Ten onboard Lower Deck's USS Cerritos and River Song joined by crewmembers Lieutenant Brad Boimler and Ensign Beckett Mariner.
</p>
<p>
Both mobile games are developed by the same studio, Eastside Games, which specialises in making licensed spin-offs for major TV series brands. Each offers their own selection of new stories for their respective franchises, unlocked via collecting a large cast of characters.
</p>
<p>
This is, as far as I can recall, the first time Star Trek and Doctor Who have joined forces in the world of video games - though the two long-running sci-fi series have nodded to each other multiple times over the years. 
</p>
<p>
The latest season of Doctor Who included Ncuti Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor making reference to visiting Star Trek, the latest of various references in each show to the other. Most notably, Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor teamed up with the legendary Jean-Luc Picard in an eight-issue comic book series back in 2012, which saw the pair fighting a combined threat of the Cybermen and the Borg. 
</p>
<p>
Behind the scenes, showrunner Russell T Davies has said he's attempted to get an actual TV crossover episode made where the Doctor visits the Enterprise - though, so far, it's yet to happen. Perhaps this could be used to gauge interest?
</p>

			<p>The NVIDIA DLSS upscaler continues to be the best upscaler on the market, achieving impressive results that look considerably better than native resolutions.</p>
<p>A new comparison video based on the 3.7 version of the upscaler put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts native 1440p, 1440p in Quality mode and 4K in Performance mode side by side in five games - Cyberpunk 2077, Horizon Forbidden West, The Witcher 3 Next-Gen, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 and Ghost of Tsushima, highlighting how, in terms of visual quality, 4K with DLSS Performance mode is clearly better than native 1440p and 1440p in Quality Mode in every game. The performance hit, in some cases, such as in Cyberpunk 2077, may not make 4K with Performance mode worth it for some, but generally, it is always the better choice, especially if the game also supports Frame Generation.</p>

<p>As time passes, NVIDIA DLSS continues to be adopted by a variety of different games. Among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-supported-latest-games-include-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-marvel-rivals-beta-final-fantasy-xiv-online/">new games</a> supporting the upscaler are <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, which also supports Frame Generation, the Bladekisser DLC for Trepang 2, and Final Fantasy XIV Online, which received NVIDIA DLSS 2 support with the update that introduced support for the latest expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-benchmark-test-previews-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-additions-and-graphics-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dawntrail</a>.</p>

            <p>12 years after it first arrived on Steam, and 16 years after it debuted on Xbox Live Arcade, Castle Crashers is getting new DLC.</p>
<p>Premium DLC Painter Boss Paradise not only includes new player and weapon artwork for all official characters and new character Paint Junior, but it also adds Steam workshop functionality, so players can create and share their own skins "with the world".</p>
<p>Although Castle Crashers debuted on Xbox and is still available on Sony consoles and Nintendo Switch, the DLC is only coming to Steam.</p>

<p>"Didn't have a Castle Crashers DLC in my 2024 bingo card," said one happy fan in the YouTube comments.</p>
<p>There's no price tag or firm release date yet – "coming soon" is all Behemoth will commit to for now – but, as always, we'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>"Much like The Behemoth's last Live Arcade effort, Alien Hominid HD, this is a resolutely old-fashioned side-scroller," Dan Whitehead wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/castle-crashers-review">Eurogamer's Castle Crashers review</a>, waaaaay back in 2008.</p>
<p>"Where it differs is in a much less brutal learning curve, a vastly increased amount of peripheral stuff to play with and a generally more rounded gaming experience."</p>
<p>If you're a fan of Xbox 360 games, don't forget that Microsoft is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-360-digital-store-will-close-next-july">close its Xbox 360 digital store later today (29th July)</a>.

            <p>NetherRealm has announced Mortal Kombat 1 DLC Khaos Reigns, which will expand the game's story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative.</p>
<p>"When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger," reads the <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-223900046.html">official blurb</a>. "If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy."</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the Mortal Kombat 1 team has revealed its next Kombat Pack, which will provide players with more fighters to add to their roster. Upcoming fighters include returning kombatants Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang; Cyrax, voiced by Enuka Okuma; and Sektor, voiced by Erika Ishii. These three all have "unique backstories as part of the reimagined Mortal Kombat 1 Universe". For example, Sektor and Cyrax are both women in this universe.</p>
<p>As well as the fighters mentioned above, Kombat Pack 2 will also bring three guest fighters into the fray: Scream's Ghostface,  T-1000 (the liquid metal-based Terminator and cybernetic assassin from Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Conan the Barbarian. T-1000 will not only feature the likeness of Robert Patrick. The actor will also be providing the voice as well. Conan, meanwhile, only features the likeness of Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p>
<p>Kombat Pack 2 is not available as a standalone character bundle.</p>
<p>Rounding out the most recent batch of Mortal Kombat 1 news, the team also announced Animalities will be returning as a free content update for all owners. This upcoming feature will allow characters to "morph into their spirit animal". Then, once in their animalistic forms, they can "annihilate" their defeated opponents.</p>
<p>You can see a suitably bloody trailer for it all below.</p>

<p>We awarded the game three out of five stars on its release last year. "Death, Taxes, and Mortal Kombat. The name is established, the lore is beloved, the roster is compelling, and the community is extremely passionate," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-1-review">Eurogamer's Mortal Kombat 1 review</a> from September.</p>
<p>"It will be a part of the fighting game scene, both competitively and casually, now and forever. But serious evolution is needed if this franchise is to keep up with the pace of its modern competition, and galvanise itself for the coming decades."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this year it was announced New Line Cinema's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025</a>. Mortal Kombat 2 serves as a sequel to 2021's Mortal Kombat, and is again directed by Simon McQuoid.</p>
<p>Joining the cast for the upcoming release is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/karl-urban-reportedly-in-line-to-play-johnny-cage-in-mortal-kombat-2">The Boys and Lord of the Rings star Karl Urban</a>, who will play Johnny Cage.</p>

			<p>The ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator continues to make impressive progress, and its latest version is now capable of getting in-game in yet another title.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BRUTALSAMM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BrutalSam</a>, the emulator can now get in-game in Red Dead Redemption Remastered. The game is evidently not in a playable state, but considering the emulator was only capable of booting the game up<a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-remastered/"> two weeks ago</a>, this is impressive progress that bodes very well for the future.</p>
<p>In the video, BrutalSam also tests a few other games, including One Piece Unlimited World Red, Tomb Raider I-III Remastered, Steamworld Dig 2, Persona 5 Royal, and others. You can check out how these games run below.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 Emulator Progress, Red Dead Redemption in-game | 16 Games Tested" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHmBY1zjolU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The ShadPS4 isn't the only PlayStation 4 emulator in the works, but it has quickly become the most promising thanks to the amazing progress it has been making in a short amount of time. The emulator's progress is also getting followed closely by a lot of players as it could become the only way to finally play <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-emulator-improves-bloodborne-pc/">Bloodborne</a> on PC in the future. The emulator can currently boot the game up, but the day PC players will finally be able to participate in the hunt may not be too far off in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-starborn-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trademarks-suggest-%E2%80%98starborn%E2%80%99-is-starfield%E2%80%99s-second-expansion.939255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-starborn-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new trademark filing suggests that Starfield’s second expansion may be called ‘Starborn’.</p>



<p>First spotted by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1817853485028725009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>, the new trademark was filed on July 12, 2024, and is registered by ZeniMax Media Inc.</p>



<p>For context, Starborn refers to the group of humans who have passed through Unity, which allows them to travel between universes. In the game’s story, they reveal themselves to&nbsp;Constellation&nbsp;after the&nbsp;Spacefarer&nbsp;collects enough&nbsp;Artifacts. </p>



<p>There’s no indication of when Starfield Starborn will release, as players are still eagerly waiting for a definite release date of Starfield’s first DLC, Shattered Space. Shattered Space was initially revealed before the release of Starfield and included in the game’s Premium Edition.</p>



<p>At the very least, it seems Starfield’s Starborn DLC is at least a 2025 release.</p>



<p>Starfield achieved an 83 on Metacritic for the Xbox Series X version of Starfield, whereas PC gained 85. </p>



<p>What do you think of Starfield having a second DLC? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>The story of Mortal Kombat games in recent years has been a mish-mash of double-crosses, weird friendships, and alternate dimension wobbles. They often feel like a casualty of Marvel movie bloat. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> was marketed as a "reboot", for example, but is really just a continuation of previous nonsense, with developers NetherRealm saying "I don't know, stick a multiverse in it." Yet from that multiverse now arrives another bad guy, bringing new story chapters for the fighting game's first big expansion, as well as extra characters like the liquid metal murderer from Terminator 2, a Conan of the barbarian persuasion, and the masked killer of the Scream movies.</p>

<p>The new story chapters will see the various realms of reality threatened by an alternate world version of Havik, the gravelly voiced, zombie-faced C-lister of the Mortal Kombat franchise. Some other characters will appear alongside him, including a bizarro-land Noob Saibot and a gender-flipped Sektor and Cyrax. Heavens knows how they're going to make any of this sensible. Then again, the most fun part of the base game's storyline came from ascending a pyramid swarming with mash-up characters, and pulverizing said hybrids into pulp. So maybe, just maybe, the storyline doesn't matter a damn?</p>
<p>The "Khaos Reigns" DLC will come out September 24 and also include a bunch of guest characters. Like I say, the T-1000, Conan, and Ghostface will all make an appearance. A free update releasing along with the expansion will also add "animalities" to the biff 'em up. These are a zoological spin on the series' traditionally violent finishing moves, and <a href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Animality">first appeared way back in Mortal Kombat 3</a>. When you perform one, your character will transform into a gorilla, hippo, or other charismatic megafauna, and then tear your opponent asunder. The trailer shows Mileena transmogrifying into a giant preying mantis and nibbling on her foe's head, for instance. It remains unknown if Johnny Cage's kangaroo kill will reappear, but one can dream.</p>
<p>Like I said in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mortal-kombat-1-review">Mortal Kombat 1 review</a>, I was not keen on the Marvel-esque kliché of its storytelling. But the fighting was solid, with a fun "kameo" system that allowed for other characters to appear on screen and briefly throw a spanner into the brawl, by saving you from a hit or extending a combo. It's not my go-to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> if I'm in the mood for getting pummeled by strangers online (that's still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken</a>), but put the comic book bloat aside and you'll find MK1 isn't too shabby.</p>

            <p>
The main Assassin's Creed reddit, subscribed to by more than 717,000 users, has taken a firm stance on the continuing backlash to Black samurai Yasuke protagonist in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ee83ow/there_is_no_debate_yasuke_was_a_samurai_if_you/">post</a> from the popular reddit's moderation team has drawn a line under the ongoing "'debate'" over whether the real-life figure of Yasuke was a samurai or not, and to what extent his depiction in Assassin's Creed Shadows will be historically accurate. 
</p>
<p>
It's a matter Ubisoft appeared to wade into last week via a vaguely-worded statement that raised eyebrows after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">apologised for "some elements" in the game's promotional materials it said had "caused concern" among some Japanese fans</a>. Now, in a lengthy statement, the moderation team says Ubisoft's statement had "exacerbated" the matter further.

<p>
"With the reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows, there has been an influx of certain individuals spilling into various communities online such as this subreddit and raising arguments about 'historical accuracy'," the Assassin's Creed reddit moderation team wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"As we are all exhausted of this tedious discussion that has been endlessly talked to death, not to mention exacerbated by a recent official statement from Ubisoft, we would like to give a final reminder to those participating in these debates as to what exactly this franchise entails, and why there was never any point to these discussions to begin with outside of thinly veiling bad faith intent.
</p>
<p>
"Assassin's Creed is historical fiction. This means that while certain locations, events and figures may be based on reality, and can even have a slight focus on accuracy, their depictions are largely exaggerated for the sake of a more enjoyable video game. While all of our player protagonists have been fictional to date, the introduction of Yasuke has given some people the false impression that the above rule does not apply. It still does. 
</p>
<p>
"Yasuke, who is a samurai as confirmed by multiple reputable historians around the world including from Japan, may not have held as large as a role in the real world as he does in Shadows. This is okay. It is a video game. You are not meant to use Assassin's Creed as a sourcebook for actual historical knowledge - it is meant to compel you to do your own external research after immersing you in a glimpse of authenticity."
</p>
<p>
The moderation team goes on to provide an extensive series of links to a "helpful list" of historical inaccuracies in every Assassin's Creed game so far, collated by fans.
</p>
<p>
"We are not here in this community to debate on historical record," the statement continues. "Most of us understand as fans that while these games provide us a great look into what historical settings could have felt like and have fun comparing them to actual record, we do not chase accuracy within this franchise and primarily play for other reasons. 
</p>
<p>
"So if you are specifically here to leave comments about your displeasure about Yasuke's inclusion or various other inaccurate details that have been pointed out in Ubisoft's depiction of Feudal Japan, it is time to understand that this is not the place for this discussion and it never will be. Feel free to take your displeasures elsewhere, away from this franchise and its communities.
</p>
<p>
"Any further comments attempting to dispute Yasuke's societal status, disparage his inclusion in game or containing statements bordering on concern trolling for historical accuracy will be swiftly removed and met with a ban."
</p>
<p>
The post itself has now been locked due to "brigading", an update from the moderation team states.
</p>
<p>
Online discussion around Yasuke, stoked up by outraged YouTube and social media channels, has centred on the Black character's prominence in the fedual Japan-set game alongside shinobi co-star Naoe, and criticism of a particular historian Ubisoft consulted with over Yasuke's real-life background.
</p>
<p>
The debate has spilled over into the real-world, too, enough that a fringe Japanese politician requested the Japanese government comment on the matter - to seemingly no meaningful result. 
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/mrjeffu/status/1815993456579461156">thread</a> on X by Jeffrey J Hall, a university lecturer on Japanese politics, the outcome was described thus: "Foreign Ministry: it's not our concern. Education Ministry: canned answer saying games shouldn't violate 'public order and morals'. METI [Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry] declined to answer because it doesn't concern them."
</p>
<p>
"Internet culture warriors hyped up the NHK Party's questions like they were a huge thing, not understanding that Japanese government ministries aren't in the business of censoring works of historical fiction," Hall concluded. "This kind of questioning is common in Japanese politics and is often just performative. Many of these content creators did not inform their audiences that the NHK Party is a tiny party with almost zero practical political influence in Japan."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot spoke out to condemn "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Assassin's Creed Shadows' development team</a> in the wake of the game's reveal.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has also addressed the matter, and discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">how he reacted to a tweet from billionaire X and Tesla owner Elon Musk criticising diversity in game design</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Starfield players know the Starborn moniker very well, as it's discussed thoroughly in the main storyline of Bethesda's latest sci-fi role-playing game. However, a trademark registered earlier this month by Bethesda (and <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/1817853485028725009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by the ever-vigilant Timur222) suggests Starborn could be the title of an upcoming expansion for the game.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Bethesda Game Studios is currently working on the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-drops-new-content-creations-mod-kit-and-shattered-space-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shattered</a> Space. Due to launch at some point in the Fall season for PC and Xbox Series S|X, here's its official description:</p>
<p><em>A mysterious power stirs in the city of Dazra on House Va'Ruun's hidden homeworld. Investigate a frightening cosmic threat, explore a new planet, and find unique weapons, spacesuits, and gear in this all-new adventure.</em></p>
<p>Todd Howard <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed </a>that Shattered Space will take place on a single planet, which should bring back the exploration feeling that was somewhat missing from the base game. We also learned that it is roughly as big as Fallout 4's Far Harbor, which lasted around 15 hours.</p>
<p>On that occasion, Howard also mentioned that Shattered Space would be the first in a series of 'annual story expansions'. It follows that Starborn could launch next year, with Bethesda planning to support Starfield for a long time, just like it did with The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim and Fallout 4. However, those games didn't get annual expansions. Bethesda is leveling up in that regard.</p>
<p>Are you excited about the Starfield expansions? Let us know below!</p>

            <p>US workers body SAG-AFTRA says its voice actors strike could still impact projects that have been in development for over a year, including games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, despite the terms of its agreement stating they should be safe.</p>
<p>Initially, last week's shock announcement of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">strike action by video game actors over AI concerns</a> was thought to have minimal impact on games expected to release later this year, as it did not include games that commenced production before August 2023.</p>

<p>Now, however, SAG-AFTRA says all "members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work", intimating that it believed the strike could be more disruptive than previously suspected and impact "non-struck" games.</p>
<p>"Members who want to show solidarity with the union can elect voluntarily not to work on these titles," SAG-AFTRA's chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sag-aftra-strike-video-game-ai">Inverse</a>.</p>
<p>"And we know that many of our members are going to become unavailable to work on those.</p>
<p>"So while [non-struck games like GTA 6] may not be subject to a strike in the technical sense, their production is also subject to being disrupted by members who don't want to work without the protection of AI terms and who don't want to undermine solidarity with the union."</p>
<p>Last week, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">US actors' union announced a strike after failing to reach a deal with major video game companies over the use of AI</a> following "more than a year and a half of negotiations".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-actors-union-equity-stands-in-solidarity-with-sag-aftra-but-wont-authorise-its-own-strike">UK actors' union Equity says it stands "in solidarity" with SAG-AFTRA</a> following news of the strike, though won't be authorising a strike itself.</p>

            <p>Happy this week! I return from holiday to find that Nic, James and the others have been experimenting with the use of Maw-shaped sock puppets to feed the Maw, in the hope that the Maw might form a filial bond with our news-wranglers. Unfortunately, we've learned in the process that anything that <em>resembles</em> the Maw <em>behaves</em> like the Maw. The sockpuppets were last seen tunnelling towards Los Angeles, like the sandworms in Dune. Sorry, America! Anyway, let's have a looksie at the PC game release sheets.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>On <strong>Monday 29th July</strong>, there is nothing but sadness and desolation and desperate SOS messages from Los Angeles. On <strong>Tuesday 30th July</strong>, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-garden-path">The Garden Path</a>, an autumnal horticulture sim whose demo Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-5">enjoyed</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-landlord-sim-space-for-sale-looks-thrillingly-unsavoury">Space For Sale</a>, in which you build domed houses on unreceptive planets. Also on 30th July, the turn-based Neon Evangelism of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-seed">Arc Seed</a>, and the early access launch of free-to-play Blizzardy RTS <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stormgate">Stormgate</a>. <strong>Wednesday 31st July</strong> has us managing planes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2289650/Mini_Airways/">Mini Airways</a>, organising frog toes in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708320/Tidy_Cauldron/">Tidy Cauldron</a>, and breaking bad in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2450700/Drug_Lord_Tycoon/">Drug Lord Tycoon</a> (See also: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/revisiting-dope-wars-98-for-some-ungodly-reason">Nic's recent piece on Dope Wars 98</a>). On <strong>Thursday 1st August</strong>, the chance to play travelling salesman in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You're Here</a>, from the Untitled Goose Game devs. Alternatively, you could try free-to-play tactics RPG <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526380/Sword_of_Convallaria/">Sword of Convallaria</a>, which appears to be Final Fantasy Tactics plus an undetermined quantity of gacha. And on <strong>Friday 2nd August</strong>: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1894720/Motordoom/">Motördoom</a>, a horde shooter which is also a Tony Hawk game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a>, a metroidvania out to steal Hollow Knight's lunch, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-goo-2">World of Goo 2</a>, sequel to the Prometheus of indie physics puzzlers, which came out shortly before I got into james gournalism <em>16 years ago</em>. Time for more sadness and desolation!</p>
<p>It's possible these are not the week's best and most interesting games. It's possible I'm lying, plying the readership with talk of indie comebacks, while quietly sliding a copy of Half-Life 3 into my trenchcoat. Only you, the intrepid gourmand of interactive entertainments, can set me straight. Let us know about any games we've missed in the comments, and find our weekly news liveblog below. Have a good one.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-new-gameplay-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChinaJoy </a>2024 is in full swing, and we've got several new gameplay showcases for high-profile games like Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, courtesy of Gematsu.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is Sony's flagship game for this year. Developed by Team Asobi (formerly Japan Studio), it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> during May's PlayStation Showcase event. We've since learned that it is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game</a> made by the studio yet, featuring over 80 levels spanning three different worlds for a total length <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-length/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> to be between 12 and 15 hours. Game Director Nicolas Doucet also <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that Team Asobi considered using open world design but decided against it to provide optimal variety.</p>
<p>Astro Bot is scheduled to launch for PlayStation 5 on September 6. A PC version coming in a year or two is all but guaranteed, though, considering Sony's strategy to bring all of its first-party games to the platform in due time.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASTRO BOT - ChinaJoy 2024 Stage Event" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xdmPCut_mIo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>ChinaJoy 2024 also hosted a stage event for Phantom Blade Zero, the highly anticipated action RPG developed by Chinese studio S-GAME. <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-0-is-a-new-unreal-engine-5-powered-dark-action-rpg-coming-to-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Announced</a> in May 2023, the game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused </a>on boss fights and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot</a> be considered a Soulslike title. Game Director and Founder Soulframe Liang told Wccftech that Phantom Blade Zero will probably still take a few years before completion:</p>
<p><em>Even for the most experienced team, completing a project like this would take several years, not to mention our team are relatively young.</em><br>
<em>We cannot yet estimate the exact time of project completion, but we will try to showcase some of the latest achievements during different stages of development. We hope everyone can continue to follow our progress and stay tuned！</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero - ChinaJoy 2024 Stage Event" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdvmXZxr2a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In addition to Astro Bot and Phantom Blade Zero, ChinaJoy 2024 was also the venue to showcase new projects from Chinese studios like Project: Jinyiwei, Loulan, Infinity Nikki, and Unending Dawn for the first time. You can check out those videos on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gematsu/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu's YouTube channel</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/29/f1-manager-24-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For all that F1 centres on driving talents like Lewis Hamilton or Max Verstappen, it is a sport that’s built on statistics. For the biggest teams, crew numbers stretch into the hundreds, with specialists focused on every aspect of the car, and the variables that can affect it, from sole components to tyre wear and aerodynamics – just look at the fine margins of tyre weight that seemingly led to this weekend’s controversial result! EA’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a> allows you to live out your driver fantasies, but what about those hoping to be the next James Vowles or wanting to channel their inner Hannah Schmitz? F1 Manager 24 lets you take control of an entire F1 team, bringing success through clever strategy, correct car setup and an eye for detail. It’s also the best entry in Frontier’s series so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1® Manager 24 | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMGvWYg7crI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 takes a big step forward over last year’s entry with the arrival of Create A Team. It’s almost unbelievable that we’ve had to wait for this feature, but now that it’s here it lives up to expectations, allowing you to personalise and take true ownership of your team’s journey to the top of the podium.</p>


<p>The inclusion of real-life footage immediately makes you feel like you’re entering the world of F1, and as a newcomer to the paddock, you’re heralded with the right level of excitement. What isn’t exciting, is the very short character limit for your team name, so my dreams of operating Leighton Motorsport were immediately dashed. Come on Frontier, if you can’t input at least one of the real team names – McLaren International Ltd character counters – surely we could have had one or two more letters for custom teams?</p>
<p>Once you’ve made peace with the name your team will be sporting, you have to settle on an origin story, from living the life of a billionaire and starting your own team, to joining forces with a high-quality tech startup. It’s a nice little touch that dictates the quality of the car, facilities, drivers and staff you have access to, as well as your starting capital, bringing in a touch of narrative to a game that is ostensibly about the numbers.</p>


<p>Then it’s time for the fun stuff, selecting your drivers, and key staff members. Depending on your earlier choices, you’re going to have access to different people here, but I was able to go with an Alex Albon and Oscar Piastri pairing, while most of my technical staff were lured away from Red Bull, apart from Mercedes Bono, who’s a star in his own right. You can be right in the thick of it from the start, and it’s so appealing if you’re a fan. If you’re not, well, I’m surprised you’re still here.</p>
<p>While there’s plenty of fiction going on, the sport remains grounded in the real world, and it was interesting to note how our second season began, with moves like Lewis Hamilton’s jump to Ferrari happening in sync with the real world. That said, a few shifts like the disappearance of Perez from the grid and his replacement at Red Bull by Carlos Sainz, remain the stuff of (plausible) fantasy.</p>
<p>Progressing the calendar is your main focus between sessions, and from here there’s plenty of the cut and thrust of the F1 back office, including sponsor negotiations, staff appraisals and car development. Balancing the needs of your sponsors, and for the essential income it provides, is done in an interesting way, forcing you to balance the knock-on effect of each event against different sectors of your operation. I mostly focused on not impacting my team’s drivers, but at the expense of my other staff and the effectiveness of the facilities. Moving from being the worst team on the grid to the seventh suggest that it was a solid enough strategy.</p>

<p>To a certain extent, you get out what you put in here. F1 Manager is a very menu-heavy game, and just like the real sport, it’s all about maximising every aspect of the car, the team and the driver. If you’re turned off by the idea of clicking through multiple menus and changing different sliders by a couple of notches, then I don’t think F1 Manager 24 is the one for you.</p>
<p>That extends even further into the races themselves. The overall presentation here is fantastic for a management sim, with multiple camera angles available throughout the race, and the option to accelerate time so you can whiz through an event if you need to, with faster speeds switching from track cameras to a track map instead. However, you’re missing the point if you do. Watching the races unfold naturally, albeit at double the speed – which is a decent balance between realism and feeling like a Benny Hill sketch – while altering your driver’s strategy on the fly and adapting to this entry’s new mechanical failures is the most fun and engaging part of the game.</p>

<p>You feel like you’re in control, cementing the idea that you’re an integral part of this race team, and while it might ultimately boil down to watching a series of numbers tick along, it’s hypnotic and satisfying in equal measure. It doesn’t feel overwhelming either, letting you control as much or as little as you want. If you’re in a hurry you can simulate sessions or whole events, but it does feel you could probably be doing something else altogether if you’re not interacting with it.</p>
<p>F1 Manager 24 really does look and sound the part, and the combination of opening commentary, audio snippets and compelling visual style, make this feel as true to life as possible. It might not be as flashy as Codemasters’ F1 24, but Frontier has captured the sport with a refined eye for detail. It’s even more appealing when you watch your created team’s car zip past a Red Bull too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/toronto-ultra-ewc-overwatch-final/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Crazy Raccoon has lifted the Esports World Cup trophy for the Overwatch 2 category, waltzing through to the Grand Final and decimating Toronto Ultra, one of the frontrunners to secure victory at the historic tournament. Crazy Raccoon’s dominance was visible for all to see, with the team pushing through the entire event and dropping just two maps.</p>



<p>Toronto Ultra was sharp, but Crazy Raccoon was on another level entirely.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weird-name-great-team">Weird Name, Great Team</h2>



<p>Crazy Raccoon is a Japanese organisation that was founded in 2018 – but it didn’t enter the Overwatch 2 scene until April of this year. The organisation stood up a roster to compete in the Esports World Cup, and by all accounts, it went <strong>very</strong> <strong>well. </strong>In June, the squad won a $100,000 prize by securing victory at the OCS 2024 Major, setting the tone for the months to follow.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that this isn’t a nobody team that has made it big – Crazy Raccoon’s roster is represented by some of the best Overwatch players of all time. Last year, CH0R0NG won the OWL playoffs – the final stage before the competition was ultimately shut down for good. Then there’s Shu, who has won several high-tier tournaments to become one of the wealthiest Overwatch players in the business.</p>



<p>They perhaps pale somewhat in comparison to Lee ‘LIP’ Jae-won, a pivotal player on the squad who claimed the top spot in the 2021 Playoffs and at a further 12 major events (not counting the EWC), almost all of which were won when playing with the Shanghai Dragons.</p>



<p>This weekend, the team almost swept Toronto Ultra, but the latter squad managed to win just one map with the closest finish we’ve seen for years in competitive Overwatch. On Runasapi, the Push came down to the closest distance break possible, with Toronto winning with 130.43 meters over CR’s 130.42 meters. </p>



<p>It wasn’t enough, though – Crazy Raccoon shut Ultra down in the next map, winning $400,000 and a much-needed allotment of 1,000 Club Championship points.</p>



<p>This was a pretty big defeat for Toronto Ultra, as the team was looking strong through the bracket. The squad was able to push LGD, Twisted, and ZETA out of the running, making it to the GF with relative ease – and that’s where it all came crashing down. Still, the squad walked away with a $160,000 prize, so it’s not <strong>all </strong>bad.</p>

<p>Spacestation has <span>dominated the entire HCS Atlanta Major, pulling off a memorable win and decimating all comers while dropping just&nbsp;<strong>two maps&nbsp;</strong>during the&nbsp;</span>tournament. On a grand stage in the Gateway Center Arena, the top HCS teams faced off for a $250,000 prize pot, but it was Spacestation that soared above the competition, skyrocketing to the grand final and walking clean through OpTic Gaming to secure the $100,000 prize.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-like-never-before">Like Never Before</h2>



<p>Spacestation is quickly becoming one of the best Halo teams ever – this past weekend proved that. Earlier this year, the team clutched up at the Arlington Major and beat OpTic in the grand final to secure another $100,000 prize – since then, the squad has also won a couple of Opens. This latest victory was massive, and Spacestation was in a flow state closing down the grand final against OpTic again.</p>



<p>Special commendations must be arranged for SSG’s Bound and StelluR – these players found their feet with white-hot momentum in the final series.</p>



<p>The loss came as a shock to OpTic Gaming fans worldwide. In the Pool Play stage, OpTic secured the same record as SSG but a defeat against Shopify in the Champs bracket pushed Team Green into the loser’s run. From there, the squad wiped FaZe and Pure, and got revenge against Shopify, coming into the GF with immense energy.</p>



<p>It just wasn’t enough to overcome SSG, which had charged through the Champs upper bracket at that point without dropping a single map.</p>



<p>Now, all eyes turn to the Salt Lake City Major, which will take place next month in Utah.</p>

This is the fifth set since Lorcana launched almost one year ago. Alongside a new expansive set, two starter decks will be released: An Emerald/Steel deck featuring The Lion King’s Scar and The Emperor’s New Groove’s Kronk, and an Amethyst/Ruby deck featuring Frozen’s Elsa and Wreck-It Ralph. Starter decks are always a good jumping-off point when getting into a new card game; these two new decks are no exception.</p><p>Starter decks usually have a theme, and the hope is that the included cards have a unifying playstyle. Usually, starter decks will get you part of the way to an optimized deck before players begin to brew some ideas. The Emerald/Steel deck, for instance, focuses on keeping your opponent's characters damaged throughout the game and capitalizing on that board state. The featured Scar character has an ability that allows the player to draw a card whenever one of their characters challenges a damaged character. Another example includes Scar’s hyena minion Ed, who is protected from being challenged if the opponent’s character is damaged. There’s even a location card, Tropical Rainforest, that forces opposing damaged characters to challenge if able. All of this disrupts the opposing player from playing their cards how they want to. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Disney Lorcana: Shimmering Skies Starter Decks</h3></div></output><p>And those are just some of the emerald cards in the deck. Regarding steel, there are some cards that can help with this overarching damaged character control strategy, like Tug-of-War, which gives the player a choice of dealing damage to all opposing characters with the Evasive ability or without, or Yzma, who can deal 1 damage to a character if any of the player’s characters banish another character through a challenge. This disruption deck is kind of interesting in the sense that you somewhat dictate how your opponent plays some of their cards if the setup is there. The only potential concern with this deck is that the player is leaving all of these opposing characters on the field. So if the player were to lose the ability to disrupt, all these surviving characters can now wreak havoc. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/23/0124-dlcs5-rrc-vanellopevonschweetz-randomrosterracer-en-733x1024-1721777132929.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>With the other available starter, the Amethyst/Ruby deck doesn’t synergize as much as its counterpart. The new Wreck-It Ralph characters Vanellope and Snowanna, for instance, have the rush ability to challenge opposing characters as soon as they are played, but don’t have a huge benefit like the current Amethyst/Ruby decks do when potentially trading characters in this way, such as drawing when banished. Sure, there are amethyst cards that exert characters to make them targets, but the rewards seem disappointing compared to what the new Emerald/Steel starter deck can pull off. With that said, there are just some good cards in the Amethyst/Ruby starter deck that players can most likely use in their own constructed decks. For example, The Sword Released is an item card that lets the player gain lore as well as force your opponent to lose lore if the player has the strongest character on the board. Another useful card is Finders Keepers, which lets the player draw three cards. Drawing and filtering the deck down is always useful when fishing for certain cards at pivotal moments in the match. Although the deck itself isn’t great on its own, the guaranteed cards can be useful in deck brewing if your options are limited. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>...if the player were to lose the ability to disrupt, all these surviving characters can now wreak havoc.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Both Shimmering Skies starter decks, like other starters, continue to give players a pre-constructed taste of what their respective set will be like. We have new characters and abilities to mess around with, and that’s always exciting for any card game. Although one starter deck seemingly plays better, both work as a means to get into the game for those looking to try out the latest Disney Lorcana has to offer.

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 is coming to PC Game Pass in the future. According to a new rumor from Tez2 on Twitter, Rockstar Games is getting GTA 5 ready for the service.</p>



<p>“Rockstar Games is preparing [GTA 5] to be playable via Xbox’s PC Game Pass for future availability,” <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1817699079876407495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he posted</a> to Twitter.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to be available</a> on Xbox Game Pass before it was removed earlier this year. It lasted just six months on the service before it was taken down. A reason for the game’s removal from the service was never provided after it happened. It was also removed from the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog earlier this year.</p>



<p>There’s no mention in the rumor if GTA 5 would return to Xbox Game Pass for console owners. </p>







<p>Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify the GTA 5 to PC Game Pass rumor. Until that comes — or an official announcement is made — please take this rumor with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games is working on GTA 6, which is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. If you are hoping to play the latest GTA from Rockstar on PC when it releases, you’re <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-about-not-announcing-gta-6-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going to have to wait</a> even longer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-game-could-be-closer-than-you-think-hints-gearboxs-ceo-randy-pitchford/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-borderlands-game-could-be-closer-than-you-think-hints-gearboxs-ceo-randy-pitchford/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox's CEO Randy Pitchford has revealed that the "next Borderlands title" is near getting its curtains pulled down and that fans won't have to wait long.</p>
<p>Pitchford, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/borderlands-boss-says-fans-will-be-very-very-happy-with-the-next-video-game-and-were-not-going-to-be-making-people-wait-for-a-long-time-before-we-announce-it/">GamesRadar</a>, revealed that they are aware of the fact that fans are awaiting the next iteration of the franchise, which is why the studio won't take much time to announce plans for the future. Here is what he had to say:</p>
<p><em>I haven't been perfect at hiding the fact that we're working on many things, and that we're working on big things. I’m confident that our fans are going to be very, very happy with the next video game project when we are ready to announce it. And I will tell you that we’re not going to be making people wait for a long time before we announce it.</em></p>
<p>In terms of Borderlands in general, games got New Tales from the Borderlands back in 2022, along with the fantasy-focused Tiny Tina's Wonderlands; however, focusing on the main title, we have seen a massive five-year gap since the release of Borderlands 3 back in 2019. Rumors surrounding the next sequel, or Borderlands 4, did ignite when it was said that <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-reveal-summer-game-fest-rumor/">the title would be 2K Games' big Summer Game Fest reveal</a>, but later on, this rumor was refuted, putting the hype to a halt.</p>
<p>However, it looks like the newest statements by Pitchford have reclaimed our hopes in the franchise, and those who admired the "Wonderlands" universe should be pumped up as Pitchford has revealed that the next sequel will be built upon it, given how big of a hit it was.</p>
<p><em>We had a bigger result with the first Wonderlands game than we did with the first Borderlands game, so that's something we can build on. I love fantasy. That's why we did the original Dragon Keep DLC for Borderlands 2, because I love fantasy so much. </em></p>
<p><em>So many of us at Gearbox love fantasy, and it gives us that kind of place to to mess around with that in the context of the Borderlands themes and universe. I think it's reasonable for our fans to expect more there</em></p>
<p>Now, in terms of any hints surrounding the release date or maybe a showcase, Pitchford decided to hold the details, but he did see that fans wouldn't need to wait much. In the meanwhile, make sure to keep your eyes open for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-borderlands-movie-trailer-is-finally-here-at-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands film</a>, which is set to debut in theaters by August 9th in the US.</p>
