<p>Whereas most American outlets have April 9 penciled in for Nintendo Switch 2 pre-orders, the UK has bucked the trend and decided to start taking Switch 2 orders ahead of schedule.</p>



<p>April 2 was a huge day. An hour-long <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> finally revealed a good chunk of information about the Nintendo Switch 2. We got to see exciting first-party software in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-is-getting-a-new-3d-adventure-on-the-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and there was also a hefty amount of controversy about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-nintendo-switch-2-games-cost-physical-digital-game-prices-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost of games</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-all-nintendo-switch-2-games-include-game-on-cartridge-despite-prices-of-up-to-90/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game cartridge confusion</a>.</p>



<p>Despite this, many fans are still chomping at the 8-bit, ready to pre-order. The official word is that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-when/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders</a> would go live in the United States on April 9, with the UK getting a 24-hour headstart on April 8. UK residents are currently bemused as Switch 2 pre-orders are already live—sort of.</p>

<p>Most UK residents know of <strong>Argos</strong>—a classic retailer in these parts. If you head to the <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/list/get-ready-for-nintendo-switch-2?tag=ar:browse:plp:nintendoswitchconsoles:m020:cm:nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Argos website</a>, you can already pre-order and pay for a standalone Nintendo Switch 2 unit or the bundle packaged with a much cheaper <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>



<p>We reported the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 price</a> yesterday, and nothing has changed. Argos is offering the base unit for £395.99 and the MK bundle for £429.99.</p>



<p>Other retailers are unmoved in their position, and are still reserving their Switch 2 orders for waiting lists or allowing you to register your interest. It’s unclear if this is an error on Argos’ part or special dispensation has been permitted.</p>



<p>Argos is the way to go if you want to secure your Switch 2 pre-order!</p>

<p>Both games are getting Switch 2 editions on the console's release, which will boast things like improved visuals and loading times, as well as a second save slot.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over on the Nintendo Switch Online app (which is being rebranded Nintendo Switch app later next month), users will be able to access Zelda Notes. Zelda Notes is a "new feature that can help you get even more out of your adventures in Hyrule", and is "designed to provide a more streamlined gameplay experience".</p>

<p>Zelda Notes looks pretty nifty, I have to say. It will include things like a voiced navigation guide, all-new voice memories which were not in the original games (with Breath of the Wild having Zelda's memos, and Rauru also confirmed to be chirping up in Tears of the Kingdom), and autobuild sharing in Tears of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the My Play Data section will keep track of achievement-like medals, which players can earn for doing things such as traveling a great distance across Hyrule, defeating enemies, scooping up those precious rupees, and so on and so forth. Medal names included things like "Monster's Bane", "Treasure Hunter", and "Citizen of Hyrule".</p>
<p>You can then compare your various achievements with others via the Global Play Data section. The Achievements section here has headers such as "Locations Visited" and "Quests and Adventures Cleared".</p>
<p>You can check out the full video breaking down the Switch 2 editions of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom below. I now wonder if this will open up the door for more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> to get achievements. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour price confirmed in Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-price-confirmed-in-japan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-price-confirmed-in-japan.1153902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-price-confirmed-in-japan/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Revealed during the Direct yesterday, Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is a tech demo tour of the incoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> console, but instead of being a free pack-in, Nintendo stated that this would be a paid experience. Now we know how much (or how little) that will cost.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Clip" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Va65mE9PNDg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The price for Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour has not been confirmed for North America or Europe, but the Japanese Nintendo site has confirmed that this will at least be a very cheap app, priced at ¥990. That’s a little under $7 and a little over £5 with a direct currency conversion, so it will likely translate to $10 and £7.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour is pitched as an interactive exhibit that lets you walk a miniature human avatar around a giant Switch 2 museum, walking up to the various parts of the console and then getting little experiences to explore all the technology that’s gone into it.</p>
<p>“Uncover lots of insights about the console,” Nintendo writes. “Explore basic features, like the magnetic connectors that keep the Joy-Con 2 controllers firmly attached, and more advanced tech details that you might not otherwise notice.</p>

<p>“Roam the exhibit halls, which resemble a giant Nintendo Switch 2. Discover hidden facts, take quizzes, and enjoy playful minigames and tech demos.”</p>
<p>The thing that’s difficult to accept is that this is a paid experience, as opposed to a free pack-in game, and there’s inevitable points of comparison to how Sony have treated their customers to comparatively much more lavish tech demo experiences over the past couple of generations. For the PS4, anyone that bought the PS4 camera could use it with Playroom and get a cutesy little tech demo based around the DualShock 4 controller and augmented reality, debuting Astro Bot for the first time. That was then continued with The Playroom VR that arrived alongside the original PlayStation VR headset, and most recently, the quite excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> that toured the PS5 hardware with hundreds of cute easter eggs to find through a surprisingly well-rounded platformer experience. All of those were free from Sony, but Switch 2 Welcome Tour is not.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also drawn some flak for the way that they’re pricing titles for Nintendo Switch 2. While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/these-games-are-getting-free-nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-from-nintendo/">some games are getting free updates</a> to support Switch 2, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/nintendo-switch-2-edition-paid-upgrades-come-to-mario-party-zelda-kirby-and-more/">Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom are paid upgrades</a> that are alternatively included with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>
<p>The base price of games is also rising.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title-and-its-going-open-world/">Mario Kart World</a> will be £67 / $80 / €80 digitally or £75 / €90 for a physical game card. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will then be £59 / €70 digitally or £67 / €80 physcally.</p>

			<p>It's time for the first analyst reactions to the Nintendo Switch 2 announcements, starting with the higher-than-expected pricing for both the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">console itself</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its games</a>. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-official-switch-2-going-pop-off-rhys-elliott--qtgbe/?trackingId=cnZA73cER1enucCFauha9Q%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to MIDiA Research's Rhys Elliott</a>, whom we often interviewed exclusively on Wccftech, the console is poised to become a smash hit even at the $450 price.</p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is slightly more expensive than many of us analysts thought, but $450 is still within the $400-500 price range I expected. While I still reckon $400 is the sweet spot, and we'll see a cheaper SKU eventually, $450 is still affordable and in line with other consoles and the Steam Deck.</em></p>
<p><em>Unlike other manufacturers, Nintendo relies almost solely on its console and console software business, so loss-leading pricing simply wasn’t in the cards. At $450, the Switch 2 is still cheap enough for mass-market adoption, and given the stacked and diverse software lineup, I believe it will sell well among core gamers, casuals, families, and more.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps an even tougher pill to swallow for consumers is the increase in Nintendo Switch 2 game prices, chiefly Mario Kart World, which will cost $80 (€90 in Europe) if you buy a physical copy. According to Elliott, the rationale is mainly to drive users to purchase digital instead, since Nintendo's split is currently around fifty-fifty (whereas the other consoles made by Microsoft and Sony already skew much more toward digital sales).</p>
<p><em>While the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">orange man’s tariffs</a> and Nintendo wanting to increase ARPPU factor into the reasoning behind Nintendo charging $80 for Mario Kart World, I think there’s more at play. </em><em>Nintendo also wants to nudge consumers to buy games digitally. The lower prices for digital games versus boxed (true for Donkey Kong and Mario Kart) point to this. Another factor is last week’s announcement of the Digital Game Card, which lets players ‘’lend games’’ to their Switch Online Family Plan members.</em></p>
<p><em>A little bit of context here: PlayStation and Xbox have already pushed their platforms to become digital-first, driven by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, digital-only consoles, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch). </em><em>So PlayStation and especially Xbox are very digital-first. But Nintendo is different, more 50-50. </em></p>
<p><em>For consumers, a unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets. But Nintendo’s reliance on physical impacts its bottom line, hence the nudging. </em><em>Nintendo does not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but Nintendo would only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means more revenue and price control for Nintendo. Long story short, Nintendo’s use of framing (sticker shock for physical) is actually pushing people to digital, which benefits Nintendo.</em></p>

            <p>
It’s rare that a video game pumps actual joy into my shrunken, leathery heart, but I definitely felt a certain springtime stirring when I first jumped in 3D platformer Demon Tides. Hit the button again exactly when you land and you’ll be rewarded with a higher, twirlier jump. Hit it a third time and you’ll be treated to a triumphant, arcing somersault. Yes, this is the stuff! This is the old N64 Mario magic I’ve been missing. 
</p>
<p>
Nostalgia is the enemy of critical thinking, you say? The games industry is a flat circle of corporate iteration, is it? A stifling quAAAgmire from which not even moderate oddballs like New York-based developers Fabraz can escape? I know, I know, but please, let me have this. Let me do the “let people enjoy things” meme, just this once. Look, I can turn into a bat as well. I can turn into a fat little frisbee with ground-pound functionality. I can turn into a spindash-capable snek.

In Demon Tides you are a surly devil queen called Beebz who has sailed to a mysterious archipelago to meet a fellow monarch. Things immediately go pear-shaped in the demo when your ship encounters a pop-up coral reef and is swallowed by purple gunk.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Beebz doesn’t really need a ship to get around. She starts the tale with a platforming skillset worthy of an endgame build, extending from more obvious capital-A abilities like the bat transformations to little, speedrunner-pleasing flourishes you tease out by feel. And this is but the beginning, for there are “over 50 unique talismans that uniquely modify or add to your move-set”, including a paraglider tool, the ability to stand on bubbles, and a mod that turns your UFO move into a hookshot. 
</p>

The world, meanwhile, is an infectious jumble of tropical islands and dockyard flotsam and big goofy collectibles. There’s a graffiti system with online affordances that is portrayed as the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a> version of soapstones in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. You can also race the ghosts of other players across the islands, and snap photos. Ah, smell that (Super Mario) sunshine. I think I prefer the crunchy 2D sprite/3D world aesthetic of the developers’ previous <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325900/Demon_Turf_Queens_Edition/">Demon Turf</a>, but it’s a charmer nonetheless.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-subsidiary-deal-and-initiate-legal-proceedings.1153893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/investors-demand-ubisoft-to-renegotiate-tencent-deal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A minority shareholder and a growing coalition of shareholders have issued an open letter to Ubisoft to initiate legal proceedings around the recently announced Ubisoft and Tencent subsidiary deal.</p>



<p>In an open letter to Ubisoft, which was sent to Insider Gaming, the letter demands that Ubisoft hold an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) to give shareholders the right to vote on the recent subsidiary deal. For those not in the know, an EGM is a special kind of meeting that’s held outside of the general annual general meeting (AGM) to discuss significant issues that cannot wait. </p>



<p>The letter, which was sent by the minority shareholder AJ Investments demands that shareholders can vote on two separate resolutions when it comes to the Tencent deal.</p>



<p>Resolution 1 is to renegotiate the Tencent deal and have it restructured into a direct asset sale for no less than €4 billion, which is roughly the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. AJ Investments says that at the moment, “moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.”</p>



<p>Resolution 2 for the EGM would be to vote on a distribution of a Extraordinary Dividend. It’s said that following the sale (if shareholders vote for it), “Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders (totalling €3 billion), while preserving.”</p>



<p>AJ Investments say that the reason for such extreme measures is because “shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to entrench control by the Guillemot family, who now hold less than 10% of the company’s economic interest.”</p>



<p>Following the deal of the announcement and at the time of writing, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-falls-double-digits-days-after-tencent-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft stock has fallen 24%</a> since the subsidiary deal announcement, which will see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three of Ubisoft’s most valuable IP’s</a> move to a new subsidiary. </p>



<p>You can read the full open letter to Ubisoft below:</p>



<div><p><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong><br><strong><br>AJ Investments and Shareholder Coalition wants clarity on the transaction with Tencent, vote on EGM</strong></p><p><strong>Bratislava / Paris – April 2, 2025 –</strong> In direct response to Ubisoft’s decision to transfer the IP and related rights of three major gaming franchises (Assassin Creed, Far Cry and Rainbow Siege) into a newly created subsidiary—before raising <strong>€1.16 billion</strong> from Tencent in exchange for a 25% ownership stake (implying a <strong>pre-money valuation of €4 billion</strong>)—AJ Investments, alongside a growing coalition of shareholders, is initiating <strong>legal proceedings in France</strong>. </p></div>



<p>We are demanding that a French court compel Ubisoft to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), giving all shareholders the right to vote on two critical resolutions:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Renegotiate the Tencent Deal </strong>– This transaction must be restructured into a <strong>direct asset sale to Tencent for no less than €4 billion</strong>, the valuation already accepted by both Tencent and Ubisoft’s board. At the moment, shareholders have no clarity how the deal that was announced last week will eventually benefit shareholders of Ubisoft.<br></li>



<li><strong>Distribute an Extraordinary Dividend – </strong>Following the sale, <strong>Ubisoft shall return €23 per share in cash to shareholders</strong> (totaling <strong>€3 billion</strong>), while preserving<strong> €1 billion to cover remaining corporate net debt</strong>.</li>
</ol>



<p>Additionally, we will seek a ruling that:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Tencent be excluded from voting</strong>, due to its direct interest in the outcome of the<br>transaction.<br></li>



<li><strong>Guillemot Brothers Holding’s voting rights be limited </strong>to their non-Tencent-linked shares.</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The market’s reaction to this deal is clear that shareholders are not sure whether they will get a significant benefit from this transaction. <strong>Ubisoft’s share price fell by more than 20% on unusually high volume</strong>. This signals a clear verdict from investors — the proposed deal is deeply flawed, structured to bypass mandatory public offer rules, and designed to <strong>entrench control by the Guillemot family</strong>, who now <strong>hold less than 10%</strong> of the company’s economic interest.</p><p>We believe this is a critical moment for shareholders. Without immediate intervention, the company may pursue further asset sales or dilution <strong>without delivering value to shareholders</strong>. In contrast, a simple vote at an EGM could deliver <strong>€23 per share in cash ( €3 billion valuation</strong>, source: Euronext outstanding shares for calculation)—more than <strong>double the current share price</strong>—and restore shareholder trust in Ubisoft’s future.</p><p>We suggest that management will explain the benefits of the deal to the shareholders in detail (not 2 A4 pages from where many details are not clear) as the owners of the business and we will have a vote on it. Sell the core IPs to the Tencent as a whole or sell them the 25% stake in a subsidiary that was already announced. Shareholders will choose what they prefer.</p></div>



<p>We call on all minority shareholders to join us now in this legal effort to protect value and demand accountability. The time to act is today—before the damage becomes irreversible.</p>

            <p>When you shoot your beginner pistol in action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hell-clock">Hell Clock</a>, it feels like someone slapped the foundations of the catacombs you're standing in with a pork chop big enough to decapitate god. There is beefy gun feel, and there is this: a gun chutney so chunksome and tactile I had to check my mouse hadn't suddenly sprouted haptics. As a single player, single class genre entrant, it's not quite fair to compare it to more sprawling mainstays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path Of Exile 2</a>. But I woke up feeling unfair today: even in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1782460/Hell_Clock/">its demo form</a>, I'd much rather play Hell Clock than either of them.</p>

<p>In 1897, the near entirety of the Brazilian municipality of Canudos's 25,000 inhabitants were massacred by heavy artillery bombardments, after successfully repelling three previous assaults from government forces. That's a very truncated account, and you can <a href="https://www.aaihs.org/state-violence-and-the-canudos-massacre-in-brazil/">learn more here</a>, but that's the setting that Brazilian studio Rogue Snail (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/relic-hunters-zero">Relic Hunters</a> series) are folklore-ifying and undead-itising here. You play as gunslinger Pajeú, slinging his way gun-fully through dungeons to rescue the soul of his mentor The Counselor.</p>
<p>There's plenty here that'll be immediately familiar to dedicated ARPeGgios, but there's also a good dose of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a> and other action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelikes</a> (lites). You blast mobs with hotkey commands, building mana with one kind of bullet, then spending it on other, better bullets. You gulp down potions. You dodge with space (it hurts enemies though!). You collect shiny loot and…</p>
<p>Wait, but you actually <em>don't</em> collect shiny loot. And even if you did, you'd lose it after your run anyway. Instead, you collect purple crystals to spend on permanent gear and abilities between runs. Everything else - gold, ability buffs,   - is temporary. There's another wrinkle, too. Each run has a time limit of 20 minutes, although there is a 'relaxed mode' option to disable this, and it does pause during boss fights.</p>
<p>Here are some lovely bullet point features from Steam. Actually, I added the bullet points. Wouldn't want to misquote Steam. SEGA once misquoted a review I wrote of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 3 in which I said I'd be "hesitant to call Warhammer III a landmark strategy game in its own right". "A landmark strategy game in its own right" - The Guardian. Utterly shameless. Here's the fact-me-doos:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li><strong>RACE AGAINST TIME</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Every second counts as you battle the undead forces of your oppressors. Risk delving deeper for powerful loot and face the nightmarish incarnations of those who sought to bury the truth.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FORGE UNSTOPPABLE BUILDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Hunt down ancient Relics infused with the strength of resistance. Create devastating combinations that channel Canudos's unbreakable spirit into unstoppable power.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UNLEASH HELLISH POWER</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Master a diverse selection of devastating abilities born from righteous fury. Dance through hordes with lightning-fast knife strikes, smash enemies with Canudos' great bell, or rain rapid-fire death from your trusty sidearm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>REWRITE HISTORY</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Each descent brings new chances to right historical wrongs. Discover unique combinations of Blessings to evolve your build as you face the demons of Brazil's dark past, present, and future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FIGHT AT YOUR OWN PACE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you seek a brutal test against history's oppressors or a thoughtful journey of justice, Hell Clock adapts to your path. Remove all time pressure with Relaxed Mode, or push your limits in Hardcore mode.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VENGEANCE NEVER ENDS</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Experience a complete three-act story campaign, then test your perfectly tuned builds in the challenging Endgame, where your gear, abilities, and playstyle are pushed to their limits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you're a sicko for the long term grind, build theorycrafting, and the like, then sure - it's far too early to say whether Hell Clock can compete with its behemoth genre mates. But in terms of just, like, having fun with a videogame - yeah, this is the only ARPG I'm interested in playing right now. It's due out "Q2" of this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bloodborne is still the name on everyone’s lips years later. Its impact has been profound, and bridged a gap between casual gamers and the Soulslike genre. It’s considered one of FromSoftware’s finest pieces of work, and a Bloodborne 2 sequel is being discussed because of a certain The Duskbloods.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> unveiled a ton of exciting details about the new console. But one of the most shocking reveals was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-lands-fromsoftware-exclusive-the-duskbloods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>—a new FromSoftware Switch 2 exclusive. In an age where exclusivity is dying and multi-platform releases are common, this feels like a huge win for Nintendo.</p>



<p>One thing you can’t help but feel watching The Duskbloods is that it’s a Bloodborne 2 sequel.</p>

<figure><figcaption>I’m getting Majora’s Mask vibes. Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Duskbloods is not a direct sequel to Bloodborne, and is considered more a spiritual successor to FromSoftware’s 2015 hit.</strong></p>



<p>I watched the Switch 2 Direct live and saw <a href="https://www.fromsoftware.jp/duskbloods/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Duskbloods</a> reveal trailer. Hand on heart, I was waiting for a “Bloodborne 2” graphic to pop up at the end. The aesthetic, the vibe, and the enemies exude a distinct Bloodborne feel.</p>



<p>But I think it’s pretty clear this is a standalone title—perhaps borrowing from the Bloodborne library. It’s due in <em>2026</em>, so there’s plenty of time to see what other influences FromSoftware has taken from its own IP—although it’s doing new things courtesy of its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-will-feature-8-player-pvpve-multiplayer-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8-player PvPvE multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if we ever get official new Bloodborne media (a remake or a remaster), but this will do in the meantime.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-bloodborne-getting-a-remake">Is Bloodborne Getting a remake?</h2>



<p><strong>FromSoftware has not indicated they are developing a Bloodborne Remake, nor does it look like we’re getting a remaster or even a basic PC port for extra platforms.</strong></p>



<p>I’d argue Bloodborne is the most influential and most-loved title FromSoft has created outside of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a>. It’s resonated with fans for years, making its continued absence puzzling. Players have begged for a remake for years, or a 60 FPS remaster at the very least.</p>



<p>Worst still, while Sony continues to release its exclusives on PC, Bloodborne still hasn’t received a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-boss-does-not-mind-a-bloodborne-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC port</a>. FromSoftware’s president has even brought up the notion of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-bloodborne-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne remake</a>, too. It probably should’ve happened by now, leading us to wonder if it ever will.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you happy to see FromSoftware making a game that looks to be in a similar vein to Bloodborne? Or are you still desperately hoping for a remake or remaster?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-footage-no-dlss-ps4-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to support NVIDIA DLSS, as it is powered by NVIDIA technology, but the footage shown during yesterday's Direct does not indicate that it is being used.</p>
<p>In a new video going over some of the new Nintendo system's specs, the tech expert at Digital Foundry provided an early analysis of the game footage shown during the event, saying that there's no indication in the footage that NVIDIA DLSS was being used in any of the games, which is definitely surprising, although the footage shown could have been taken from early builds that haven't yet implemented the NVIDIA's upscaler. Interestingly enough, none of the Nintendo first-party titles seem to implement any sort of antialiasing, except for <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-4k-60-fps-nintendo-switch-2/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, continuing a trend that's been going on for a while.</p>
<p>In their early analysis of the Nintendo Switch 2 footage, Digital Foundry also provided pixel counts for several games, including<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> Mario Kart World</a>, which ran at 1440p resolution, 60 FPS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which ran at 1080p resolution, 60 FPS, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-getting-upgraded-nintendo-switch-2-versions/">Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>, which both hit 1440p resolution, 60 FPS and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a>, which ran at 1080p resolution, 30 FPS. The most interesting pixel counts, however, are those of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/"> third-party ports</a> like Cyberpunk 2077, which ran at a resolution ranging from 540p to 1080p at 30 FPS, however, with much better image quality than on previous generation consoles, and Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, which ran at 1080p resolution, 30 FPS, with much cleaner image quality than base PlayStation 4 but with some framepacing issues. Judging from the above, the Nintendo Switch 2 indeed offers a performance level in the ballpark of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 4 Pro, as speculated in the past, although there's no doubt that games launching past the console's release window will take better advantage of the system and push it further than the launch titles will do.</p>

<p>After the brief January reveal, the Nintendo Switch 2 was finally officially unveiled yesterday in the aforementioned Nintendo Direct. The presentation provided additional information on the system's screen, which will support 120 FPS gameplay as well as HDR, the new Joy-Con 2 functionality, and more. The console will launch on<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/"> June 5th</a> worldwide for $449.99 / €469.99.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-will-the-switch-2-cost-after-the-trump-tariffs.1153869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642459/switch-2-price-donald-trump-tariffs-china-vietnam-cambodia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo revealed its Switch 2 in full yesterday, just hours before Trump took to the White House Rose Garden for his own launch: his latest, and largest, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">round of tariffs</a> yet. Unfortunately for Nintendo, the tariffs hit the countries where it builds its consoles, with new rates of up to 49 percent that it may pass on to US buyers.</p><p>The company is in this position in part because it had to adapt to Trump’s trade policy before. Its manufacturing was heavily based in China until Trump’s first term, when the combination of tariffs on China, the covid pandemic, and later, Russia’s attack on Ukraine, created supply chain upheaval. That prompted Nintendo to diversify, and according to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a781c853-3fed-4dfc-b940-4137546180de"><em>Financial Times</em></a>, more than half of its US hardware is now manufactured in Vietnam and Cambodia.</p><p>Nintendo’s problem is that those are among the countries hit hardest by Trump’s new “reciprocal” tariffs, which apply in addition to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/607947/donald-trump-tariffs-china-mexico-canada-explainer">existing rates</a>. Yesterday China was hit by an extra 34 percent tariff on its exports to the US, Vietnam by an extra 46 percent, and Cambodia by an extra 49 percent.</p><p>But will everyday Americans be the ones to pay the price of the new rates? <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w29315/w29315.pdf">Research from the National Bureau of Economic Research</a> on the impact of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622857/trump-china-tariffs-us-cellphones-laptops-tablets">tariffs on China during Trump’s first term</a> found that “US consumers of imported goods have borne the brunt of the tariffs through higher prices,” with manufacturers and exporters passing almost the entirety of the price increase to the end consumer.</p><p>When the Switch 2 launches on June 5th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">it will cost $449.99</a>. Applying some back-of-the-napkin math, if we treat the new tariffs as averaging out around 40 percent, that equates to an extra $180 — leaving a possible final price of $630. Apply the same logic to games, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634632/mario-kart-nintendo-switch-2-trailer"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> already set to cost $79.99, and you get a final price over $110. Use the worst case rate — Cambodia’s 49 percent tariff — and the numbers jump to $670 and $120.</p><p>The good news is that there are a few factors that might mitigate the effect. The first is that Nintendo might well have priced some of this in already. The company didn’t know what Trump’s tariffs would be exactly, but it knew something was coming, and may well have included that consideration into its choice to set the Switch 2 at $449.99 — that’s 50 percent more than the $299.99 original Switch.</p><p>The second is that there’s evidence Nintendo has planned for this in a different way, by stockpiling hardware in the US. The <em>Financial Times</em> reports that the company has already imported “hundreds of thousands” of consoles to the US to get ahead of the tariffs, with 383,000 units across five days in January alone. That’s a lot, but the first Switch <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-switch-becomes-fastest-selling-console-in-us-history">sold 4.8 million units in the US</a> during its first nine months on sale, so there’s no guarantee that Nintendo’s early imports will be enough to get the company through its first holiday season without feeling the need for a price hike.</p><p>Finally, there’s an important caveat to all of this: we don’t know what’s actually going to happen with the tariffs. They’re supposed to go into effect soon, with a global 10 percent tariff starting April 5th, and the elevated rates on April 9th, but Trump’s administration is nothing if not unpredictable — and transactional. This could be a bluff, an opening gambit to start negotiations, or an empty threat, and there’s every chance that tariffs will be either delayed or altered before Nintendo ever pays a cent.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In every round of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gtfo">GTFO</a>, you’re dragged gasping from a cryo-coffin and dropped into the bowels of an enormous laboratory by a horrible pincer-crane. Reaching your appointed floor, you’re asked to hack terminals and reach waypoints while trying not to rouse a sleeping population of mutants. It’s a terrible fate, but as your turrets run out of bullets and the bipedal lampreys overwhelm your friends, you can take consolation in the knowledge that there are no microtransactions - for when 10 Chambers launched the early access version in 2019, they promised to release all DLC for free. “There but for the grace of God go I,” you can say, thinking with a shudder of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, while the Shadows tear your head from your body. 
</p>
<p>
No such consolation awaits players of 10 Chambers’ forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/den-of-wolves">Den of Wolves</a>, a cyberpunk co-op heist shooter in the tradition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/payday-2">Payday 2</a>. According to audio director Simon Viklund , the game will “most likely” have microtransactions, for the simple reason that the studio is now 10 times bigger than when they launched GTFO, and needs to make more money. Don’t be entirely depressed, however – there will be no “maths-fuckery”, no pay to win, and no “buckazoids”.

<p>
“The way we launched GTFO - you pay for it once, and you have the whole game - that was a viable business approach for when we were nine members of staff,” Viklund told <a href="https://www.vg247.com/den-of-wolves-mtx-dlc-interview-simon-viklund">VG247</a> in a recent interview. “But now we’re 100 people, the burn rate is way bigger, and Den of Wolves is a much more ambitious game. So we’re hoping it turns into a live service type thing.”
</p>
<p>
("Burn rate" is the speed at which a company depletes its cash reserves when it’s losing money.)
</p>
<p>
Lest the mention of "live service" give you hives, keep reading. “It’s not going to be a subscription service, it’s going to be a premium price,” Viklund qualified. “Maybe two-thirds of what triple-A games usually cost. So it’s more in the level of GTFO, the Payday games, and Vermintide – those other first-person co-op games. That’s the space we’re occupying.
</p>
<p>
“So, yes, there will be microtransactions, most likely,” he said. “There will be DLC, but nothing that is pay-to-win, nothing that is math-fuckery where, you know, for 20 bucks you buy 100 buckazoids and then everything you can buy in the game costs 64 buckazoids, so you can never ever get rid of all your buckazoids, so you always have that splinter in your mind telling you: ‘I’m leaving money on the table in this game, I need to buy more buckazoids’. It’s manipulative, stuff like that.”
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the interview, Viklund clarified that the game won’t have an in-game currency – if you buy things it’ll be with real money – and there won’t be any randomised lootbox-style elements to get the ratings agencies in a tizz about whether this is literally gambling. People who buy stuff like DLC maps will be able to host friends who haven’t bought that DLC. There are also some interesting allusions to how the microtransactions might form part of the game’s darknet underworld stylings. Please don’t suddenly reveal that this is a cryptocurrency game, 10 Chambers.
</p>
<p>
We missed the chance to go see Den Of Wolves recently because RPS does not, despite much zesty correspondence with management, have access to a cryogenic warehouse full of deployable drone agents. We must conserve our cannon fodder for press events so grandiose you can see them from space. Still - as and when Graham’s horrible hell-pincer selects me for preview build duties, I’m looking forward to playing it.

Find unique combinations and strategies to withstand the horrors. Help the hopeless and free the possessed, or die in the attempt… over and over again."</blockquote>
<p>And that's really all we've got to go on for now, apart from the promise that the game will be "pushing the boundaries of roguelite storytelling and delivering a satisfyingly moody experience". You might hope so, with a narrative lead as experienced as this. Gaider, was lead writer on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Inquisition</a> but left BioWare in 2016 to work elsewhere, before finally setting up a new company, Summerfall Studios. </p>
<p>Malys seems quite different to the studio's first game. Stray Gods was a branching single player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> about the Greek gods trying to exist in a modern US city, but with singing. Every scene would eventually see its cast burst into song, harmonising in a sometimes combative, sometimes cooperative manner. Then you could choose what lyrics to sing next, and in what style. It also got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orpheus-may-be-missing-from-hades-2-but-hes-returning-to-role-playing-musical-stray-gods">some DLC featuring OG sad boy Orpheus</a> a year after release. </p>
<p>"Stray Gods handles big emotions and epic poem tragedies with a dignified touch," said Jon Bailes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stray-gods-the-roleplaying-musical-review">our review of the mythical musical</a>, "then shimmies back to mischief and humour like an especially supple salsa dancer." It's true. I played it on a weekend whim and liked it, although I agree with our review that there was more than a whiff of Whedon in its quippiness. </p>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for Malys and whether or not it hits its crowdfunding target. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is the game that just keeps on giving. From its trilogy of main games, to the steady stream of (now repeating) Elusive Targets, and inventive additions like the Freelancer mode, there’s a ton of sneakily stoic action to be had here. All of that is now available to play in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN World of Assassination - PS VR2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgjyUtnZlVM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is far from the first effort at translating Hitman: World of Assassination into VR, after an original PSVR exclusive port, PC VR counterpart, and last year’s restyled Meta Quest port. There’s naturally some crossover and common ground with those previous versions, but this should be by far and away the most advanced and complete rendition of Hitman in VR.</p>


<p>Compared to the PSVR version, which was limited to using DualShock 4 for controls, you now have separate hands, and compared to the PC VR version, you can now use both of those hands for actions, including dual wielding guns and manual reloading. Compared to the Quest version, Hitman on PSVR 2 looks to retain the art direction and as much fidelity of the flatscreen game as possible. In essence, it’s the best of all worlds.</p>
<p>Having not tried any of the previous VR adaptations, and sinking into this game again for a few hours, it’s almost a little surprising just how well Hitman makes the jump into VR with PSVR 2. To be fair, this is generally quite a slow and considered game series, with a few key moments of high action when you choose to strike, so the pacing works rather well for VR, while there’s a decent amount of interactivity and creative use of objects within the world already, even if it’s shy of a bespoke VR game like Half-Life: Alyx. No, you can’t grab that random watering can or a single volume from a stack of books, but there’s plenty of hammers, busts, briefcases and knives lying around for you.</p>


<p>One of the real highlights of the World of Assassination trilogy was just how busy the levels were. The main areas were quite regularly flooded with crowds of bystanders, whether it’s the guests at the Paris fashion show in the original mission of the original game, the eager motorsports fans in Hitman 2, or the busy party at the cloud-piercing skyscraper in Hitman 3. Of course, they’re not far off being mannequins with minimal AI and interactivity, and seeing them at eye-level does reveal a little more just how plain and static they really are. Things get more complex as you have staff that are on their particular patrol routes and routines, and then you have the targets who meander around the stages with their own agendas, which you have to figure out and pick apart to successfully take down with minimal fuss.</p>
<p>Right from the off, Hitman feels very natural in PSVR 2. We’re at that stage now where developers are confident enough to pull off smooth locomotion in VR, and VR gamers have found their sea legs in the current platforms. Still, the game runs you first through the basics of VR actions, from movement, to throttling, disguises, to throwing, and blasting away with guns.</p>

<p>Knocking out an unsuspecting person has that Original Series Star Trek feel to it, before you can then yank all their clothes off them like they’re a velcro-laden strippergram, and then drag them behind you to whatever large chest or locker you can find nearby.</p>
<p>You can also knock them out from a distance with thrown items. This is by far and away the best feeling part of the game, to me. There’s such a generous auto-aim that you can just flick your wrist and that wrench, apple or drinks can you’re holding will find its way straight to your target’s noggin. You can, however, take a little more care, holding the opposite trigger to display a throwing arc that your haphazard throw will then automatically follow.</p>
<p>Guns are less generous. Small firearms like pistols handle decently, and the manual reload is on a par with other VR games – press a button to ping out the spent magazine, grab a fresh clip from your Kangaroo-like ammo pouch, put it in place and then pull back the pin to cock it – and there’s a frantic feeling when trying to do this under pressure. Dual wielding is also fun, potentially with hammer in one hand and pistol in the other.</p>

<p>Where it really falls apart for me is with the two-handed weapons. Hitman might be filled with playful sandboxes, but even as you mess around within these environments, Agent 47 is cold, calculated and utterly precise. Two-handed weapons in VR are pretty rubbish for that, with none of the real-world heft and weight, giving them this weird floaty feeling. You get to be an expert marksman in games by pressing a button to steady a sniper scope’s wobble, but here I’m trying to steady my aim by touching fingers together, and even then the scope’s looking way off in the wrong direction and impossible to track fast targets. It’s partly a skill issue, to be sure, but games like this are power fantasies that do a lot of the stuff for you.</p>
<p>As always there’s certain compromises made when adapting a flat screen game for VR. In Hitman’s case, all of the cutscenes switch you to a big cinema screen view, as is pretty common, but there’s also some in-game moments that switch views or do simple fades. Whenever you vault or stash a body in a cupboard, the game quickly fades to black to transition and get the action done as quickly as possible, meanwhile, blending in at a bar shifts to a third person camera view. They’re fine, but a little jarring, and other games have kept things like vaulting more interactive.</p>

<p>Even climbing –&nbsp;something that VR games are pretty much perfect for –&nbsp;has been stripped away from you. Walk up to a ladder or a drain pipe and instead of going hand over fist, you’re bumped out to a lower view and stare up at Agent 47 posterior as it shimmies away from you. Or towards you. You can do that too.</p>
<p>After a few hours play, exploring hazily remembered levels I played half a decade ago, Hitman in PSVR 2 feels right on the cusp of VR greatness. I’m sure that many of the quirks fade into the background as you get used to them, and Hitman is a game that’s excellently suited to a VR adaptation, from its pacing and the broad interactivity of the world, to the multi-faceted environments that are often jam-packed with people.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dang. $80 for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, huh?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Direct</a> and subsequent information dump answered many, many burning questions we've been asking about the Nintendo Switch 2, such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launch-games-confirmed-so-far">launch line-up</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-confirmed-during-nintendo-direct">release date</a>. Among those was the question of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-price-confirmed">price</a>, not only for the system itself but also for the games and accessories we're going to need alongside it. And it's a good thing that the rest of the Direct was so enjoyable, because Nintendo needed to do some work to justify some of these prices.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nintendo Switch 2 by itself: $449.99 USD</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 with Mario Kart World bundled in: $499.99</li><li>Mario Kart World by itself: $79.99</li><li>Donkey Kong Bananza: $69.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera: $49.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Controller pair: $89.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip: $34.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Strap: $12.99</li><li>Joy-Con 2 Wheel pair: $19.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set: $109.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case and Screen Protector: $34.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case: $79.99</li><li>Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter: $29.99</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Phew! That's a lot to dish out to play Nintendo games, even assuming most people are just going for the console, a game or two, and maybe a spare controller. Most notable in that list of prices is what's going on with the console itself. $450 isn't far off what a bunch of analysts told me the system was likely to cost when I asked them earlier this year. They predicted $400, but a few said it could likely go higher depending on various economic and technological factors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even more interesting is Mario Kart Tour. It's $80. That makes it the most expensive we've ever seen a AAA game cost without belonging to some sort of Deluxe Edition, and it's certainly the highest Nintendo's ever gone. You can buy it in a bundle with the system to get $30 taken off the game price, but the $80 price tag has a lot of Nintendo fans concerned at the rapidly rising prices of games and what this may mean for the future. Didn't we just see games start to go from $60 to $70 a few years ago? That hurt bad enough without bumping it up even higher so soon after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's happening here? Why are the Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart World priced the way they are? Will we see more game price hikes in the future? As usual, I asked expert analysts to explain it to me. Here's what they said.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Why $450?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Even though most of the analysts I spoke to today were the same folks who predicted a $400 price point when we chatted in January, no one seemed surprised at the $50 extra on the end of the announcement today. Collectively, the six I spoke to offered various reasons for the higher-than-expected price, largely agreeing on the fairly simple confluence of multiple factors: tariffs, manufacturing costs, and competition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SuperJoost Playlist</a>, calls the $449.99 pricing a "strategic balancing act" on Nintendo's part that reflects a mixture of increased manufacturing costs as well as ongoing uncertainty as to whether or not, and if so, what, tariffs the Trump administration in the United States is going to levy on electronics. "Nintendo appears to be building in a buffer against these potential trade barriers while ensuring they maintain their traditional positive margin on hardware."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis wasn't surprised by the $450 price, and said it made sense given the Switch OLED's $350 price tag. But he also shared an interesting speculation in his response related to van Dreunen's point about tariffs, relating to why Nintendo didn't announce the price in the Nintendo Direct itself today. "My view is that they probably had a range of pricing for the US market in play up until the last minute due to the uncertainty on import tariffs."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, threw in another factor: Sony. "Nintendo probably factored in possible tariffs, the current inflationary climate in the world and the US$700 Sony dared to charge for the PlayStation 5 Pro last year."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, also mentioned the PS5 Pro as well as the Xbox Series X, both of which he pointed out sold better than their cheaper alternatives (the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s">Xbox Series X surpassed the Series S recently in the U.S.</a>). But he also pointed out an interesting discrepancy in how the Switch 2 is being sold in Japan versus the United States. In Japan, it's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">releasing a Japanese-language system</a> for 49,980 yen ($333.22), while its multi-language system runs 69,980 yen ($466.56). Why? McWhirter has a fascinating explanation as to the existance of this region-locked system, its pricing, and the discrepancy between it and the pricing of the system in the U.S.:</p><blockquote>Japan is a key market for Nintendo - our console hardware data reveals that Japan accounts for a quarter (24%) of the Nintendo Switch installed base in 2024, compared with just 2% for Xbox Series X/S and 9% for PlayStation 5.</blockquote><blockquote>If Switch 2 pricing in Japanese Yen was aligned with the U.S. Dollar price, it would dramatically weaken Nintendo's position in Japan, representing a doubling in the list price over the classic LCD Nintendo Switch model. Yet if Nintendo continued to rely on region-specific pricing that is significantly cheaper in USD terms, they would face an issue with grey imports to other territories.</blockquote><blockquote>Nintendo’s answer is to navigate this situation with two models – they are offering a substantially cheaper but price competitive 50,000 yen Nintendo Switch 2 model that only includes Japanese language support only.</blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, an international language model at 70,000 yen is being positioned to protect the Japanese market from grey imports from other territories – smart considering there are no other major console markets with a not insignificant number of people proficient in the Japanese language.</blockquote><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario Kart World, at a Premium</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, that covers the console itself, so why has Nintendo hiked the price of Mario Kart World into the stratosphere at $80? When I asked the analysts I spoke to, I assumed it was related to tariff concerns. Perhaps Nintendo was worried about potential tariffs but also didn't want to raise the price of the console too high, so a more expensive flagship game was their solution to offset costs?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Partially. The experts largely concluded that tariffs may have played a role, with Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, suggesting that the higher game pricing was a bit of future-proofing on Nintendo's part. "While pricing for a product can always be lowered over time, it's extremely difficult and painful to raise pricing on a product once it has been announced or released. This is purely my own speculation, but this pricing is most easily explained by trying to be conservative given the current chaotic market conditions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the experts also told me there was more to it than that. McWhirter told me that this was Nintendo taking advantage of a critical moment of change in the games industry to test the waters on what the market will tolerate as far as game pricing goes. And it's using its most successful game series ever on that trial run, because Nintendo knows if any game can succeed at that price, it's Mario Kart. If it doesn't work out, it can always drop the price, either directly or indirectly through methods like Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 Console Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Van Dreunen said something similar, adding, "The timing aligns with the broader industry's gradual price increases for premium content, as we've seen with other publishers moving to $70 base games. Nintendo may be leapfrogging this intermediate step, calculating that the massive built-in audience for Mario Kart will tolerate a higher price point for what appears to be a significantly expanded experience compared to previous entries."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter also pointed out that not only could this higher cost for Mario Kart World be mitigating things like tariffs or manufacturing costs, it also could be helping balance out other, invisible costs. There's those pesky manfacturing costs, for one, with McWhirter noting that the 3D NAND flash memory from supplier Macronix experts suspect Nintendo is using in Switch 2 game cards is pricey.  But there's also the cost of migrating so many first-party titles to Nintendo Switch 2, and the slow build the console will see in its first three years when its blockbuster exclusives are reaching a much smaller audience than was available on the Nintendo Switch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other experts brought up other factors. Harding-Rolls made a compelling point about Nintendo otherwise not aggressively pursuing in-game monetization, and needing to account for inflation somehow. And he added: "Nintendo has a bit of a history of pricing games higher than other platforms when coming to the market later than other platforms - in this case PS5 and Xbox Series. I remember back in the day N64 titles being more than PS1 titles for example. Some of that is related to cost of goods, but Nintendo also likes to follow its own approach and price based on its own appreciation of value."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, said that the discrepancy in physical and digital pricing is a clear move from Nintendo to push consumers toward digital games, especially when paired with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-unveils-virtual-game-card-update-ahead-of-switch-2-launch">Virtual Game Card</a> announced last week.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"PlayStation and Xbox have already pushed their platforms to become digital-first, driven by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, digital-only consoles, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch)," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So PlayStation and especially Xbox are very digital-first. But Nintendo is different, more 50-50. In the last nine months of 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250204_3e.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">51% of Switch software sales were digital</a>. The number was even lower in the holiday period (43.4% digital for calendar Q4), as always. For consumers, a unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets. But Nintendo’s reliance on physical impacts its bottom line, hence the nudging. Nintendo does not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a copy of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but Nintendo would only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means more revenue and price control for Nintendo."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, I asked this question of Toto, who referred to the jump from $60 games to an $80 Mario Kart World as "quite bold." His explanation was short and sweet:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Tariffs could play a role, but I think it is much simpler: Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who's Buying?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone I spoke to agreed that even though the Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart World pricing is a bit  of a shock, it's not going to affect sales of the console. At least... not at first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Based on what we're seeing across the market, sales to higher-income or more affluent households likely won't be impacted by this pricing," Piscatella told me. "And, of course, we have the price insensitive super enthusiasts that will do and pay whatever it takes to acquire the Switch 2 at launch. Therefore, because of the limited quantities that will be available during the launch year, I do not anticipate this pricing to hinder year one sales volumes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The true test will come in year two, as supply is likely to become more readily available, and the addressable market will be forced to widen. So, we'll have to see what happens over the next 9-12 months."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McWhirter's response was similar, saying that Omdia's current forecast has the Nintendo Switch 2 being outpaced in sales by the original Switch by 6 million units by the end of 2028.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/02/image-21-1743625493880.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: Omdia</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even without considering potential tariff-related instability on hardware pricing, Omdia’s console forecast indicates that the list price of console hardware is no longer declining at the same rate it once did, even after adjusting for inflation (see figure, above)," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After four calendar years on the market, the list price of a PlayStation 5 had only fallen by 12%, compared with 21% for PlayStation 4. This could present a challenge for Nintendo if it hopes to hit a competitive $199.99 entry price point with a Lite-style revision at the same point of its cycle (2027)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Van Dreunen largely agreed as well, adding that the rising prices of other consumer electronics will likely serve to make this transition less jarring for consumers than it would be otherwise. "With the PlayStation 5 Pro at $700 and premium gaming handhelds in the $549+ range, Nintendo's pricing looks relatively reasonable by comparison," he said. Van Dreunen projected 12 - 15 million Nintendo Switch 2 units sold within the first 12 months on the market, citing backward compatibility as a significant factor that would drive adoption.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>With the PlayStation 5 Pro at $700... Nintendo's pricing looks relatively reasonable by comparison.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Toto had a slightly different take. While he feels the hardware price will be acceptable for most consumers, games rising to $70 or $80 is a "much, much harder sell." Especially for a chunk of Nintendo's target audience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the first year, these prices will not matter that much because there is an audience of people buying everything Nintendo offers, no matter what," he said. "What I am a bit worried about is if Nintendo will again be able to reach the mainstream audience at scale later, i.e. families that might have much tighter budgets for entertainment in today's economy. Nintendo is clearly betting on people accepting higher prices as a new normal by then."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Toto's point is likely the one that will resonate the most, at least at the moment. Despite the highs of today's Nintendo Direct, one of the primary audience responses we've seen coming out of it has been concerns about how expensive it all is. Tariffs, manufacturing costs, market shifts, economics, whatever you want to call it, none of the explanations make the increasing costs of games and systems feel better on the wallet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's just hope no other publishers get any bright ideas about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto">$100 games</a> next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/03/nintendo-switch-2-tech-specs-confirm-a-shorter-battery-life-than-switch-1/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/tech-specs/">technical specifications for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, putting all the important stats and details into a nice table for you to refer to, and also revealing their all-important estimates for the new console’s battery life.</p>
<p>The good news is that you can get up to 6.5 hours of gameplay out of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and its 5220mAh battery. The bad news is that when it’s pushed to its limits, you’ll get just 2 hours of play before needing to recharge. That’s potentially shorter than even the first revision of the Nintendo Switch.</p>


<p>That compares poorly to the current line up of Nintendo Switch consoles, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">OLED</a> and the “<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/17/nintendo-new-switch-model-battery/">Better Battery Life</a>” models of the Switch 1 both able to game for 4.5 – 9 hours – they quote 5.5 hours for Breath of the Wild. It’s a closer run thing to the original Switch model, though, which was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/01/nintendo-switch-review/">quoted for around 2.5 – 6 hours of play</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it’s not that dissimilar to <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/tech/">the original LCD Steam Deck</a>, which had a 2-8 hour battery life window.</p>
<p>So why the big drop in battery life? Chances are it’s mostly down to the screen. The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a larger 7.9″ LCD screen, which will require more power to run than the older consoles, and that’s before you consider that it’s capable of playing at 120Hz and HDR. Combine that with a more powerful Nvidia chipset that needs to push for 1080p instead of 720p, and you’ve got a recipe for shorter game times.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see what kinds of game options are made available to players. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, for example, will have a 1080p 120Hz mode, but turning that down to 60Hz could help play the game for an extra hour, perhaps.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the tech specs, we get confirmation of the various details from the Nintendo Direct. The Switch 2 is larger, and a bit heavier than the original Switch. It comes with 256GB of internal storage, expandable with the new MicroSD Express card format – it will not play games from old MicroSD cards – it has two USB-C ports at top and bottom for power and accessories, and the built-in microphone is enhanced with noise cancelling. There’s now WiFi 6 built in, and there’s still support for ethernet via the dock.</p>
<p>The screen is a 1080p 120Hz HDR10 capable display, but when docked the maximum output to a TV is 4K at 60fps. 120fps is supported when playing at either 1080p or 1440p.</p>

			<p>Amid the sea of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> news, there was also the <a href="https://x.com/ShinenGames/status/1907437680037646517" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of FAST Fusion, a new entry in the zero-G racing series developed by Shin'en Multimedia, which will be a launch title for the new console. Interestingly, the previous installment (FAST RMX) was also a launch title for the first Switch. Then, the independent German developer did something with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-touryst-renders-at-6k-4k-on-xbox-series-x-s-it-almost-looks-like-a-good-cgi-movie-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Touryst</a>, an action/adventure game launched in 2020 on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>With FAST Fusion, the developer returns to creating exclusive games for a new Nintendo console, and it appears that they'll take full advantage of the Nintendo Switch 2's capabilities. Here's an overview of the features confirmed by the studio:</p>
<p><strong><em>Hypersonic Speed</em></strong><br>
<em>The fastest racing game you may have ever experienced! Non stop adrenaline pumping action at 60 fps in up to 4K HDR.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Antigravity Jumps</em></strong><br>
<em>FAST Fusion vehicles are equipped with antigravity hyper jump technology. Cut corners and get ahead of your oppenents by jumping and boosting over them.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Vehicle Fusion</em></strong><br>
<em>Create hundreds of new Racing machines by fusing your favorite vehicles.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Hyper tracks</em></strong><br>
<em>Zoom through Redwood Forest, Alpine peaks, futuristic cities and many more breathtaking landscapes.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Motion Controls, HD Rumble</em></strong><br>
<em>Play with smooth motion controls, enjoy immersive HD Rumble and customize the buttons.</em></p>
<p>FAST Fusion will also support split-screen play for up to four players, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Game Share feature (both locally and online), TV Mode, Tabletop Mode, Handheld Mode, and, of course, the new Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>

            <p>The most influential game of all time is Yu Suzuki's 1999 proto <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> Gashapon 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, according to a public poll held by BAFTA. To claim that top spot in the top five, it beat out Doom, Super Mario Bros, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a>, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.</p>
<p>Minecraft hovered around the winners table laughing loudly at everyone's jokes at number six. At number 11, Tetris had to sit on a bin because all the chairs had been taken. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> paced up and down the corridor complaining that everyone had nicked its outfit idea in 18th place, tailed in 19th by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> 3. Full results below in descending order.</p>

<li>Grand Theft Auto</li>

<p>If you're wondering why Henry has come to see us - riding atop a muzzled Super Mario 64, no less - Polygon's Oli Welsh <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/550231/shenmue-bafta-most-influential-game-all-time">reckons its evidence</a> of "brigading among passionate game fans," and, yep, sounds about right. I'm not sure KCD 2 has been out long enough to influence anything outside its own DLC. Baldur's Gate 3 at 16 is also a weird one. It's that big number '3' that gives it away.</p>
<p>As for Shenmue, I can see it, even if I'm not sure it would have been my pick. I've long held that Yakuza 0 is, within a certain console tradition of RPG-tinted action adventures, the most and possibly best example of its kind ever made, and that's a lineage you can trace directly back to Shenmue, not least for Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi's own involvement in the 1999 game. Less subjectively, Shenmue's NPC and simulation elements were a big deal for the time, especially for console. "The game popularised the use of Quick Time Events (QTEs)," BAFTA say.</p>
<p>That might not be something to celebrate for some of you, but I'm just going to say it: I like QTEs. I remember first properly encountering them in Resident Evil 4 and excitedly telling a mate "it's like a cutscene, but you can die if you don't press the right buttons!". Then again, I'm also a fan of Dragon's Lair and old adventure games that killed you every five minutes in different ways like 1998's X-Files. Bring back annoying deaths as a form of collectible, I say.</p>
<p>"I am deeply honoured and grateful that Shenmue has been selected as the Most Influential Video Game of All Time," said Yu Suzuki. "At its inception, we set out to explore the question, “How real can a game become?”, aiming to portray a world and story unprecedented in scale and detail. This distinction serves as a powerful reminder that the challenge we embraced continues to resonate with and inspire so many people even today. It is truly the greatest of encouragement".</p>
<p>If you got the chance to crowbar one game on to BAFTA's list and no-one could do anything about it, what would it be? Me? I'm still waiting for the world to catch up and recognise the importance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Spot">Cool Spot</a>. Never has a game influenced so many to say, sure, I'll have a 7UP if literally nothing else is available.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As shared on a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250402.html">separate spec sheet for Switch 2</a>, Nintendo's next console will house a Lithium ion battery, with a battery capacity of 5220 mAh. Meanwhile, its battery life is "Approx. 2 - 6.5 hours". Nintendo notes this is just an "estimate" life span, and adds "the battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions".</p>
<p>While Nintendo itself doesn't go into specifics about which games it is referring to here, it is fair to assume that playing a smaller indie game on a pleasant spring afternoon with a mild breeze blowing will see the console lasting longer in its handheld mode than if you were having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">a full blown battle in Elden Ring</a> during a 40°C heatwave.</p>
<p>Charging time for the console, meanwhile, is approximately three hours while in sleep mode.</p>
<p>To compare the upcoming Switch 2's battery life to other Switch devices, here's what <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html#:~:text=Once%20fully%20charged%2C%20the%20battery,approximately%204.5%20to%209%20hours.">Nintendo's support page states</a>:</p>
<p>Once fully charged, the battery duration for the console varies depending on model and on the software application and functions being used.</p>
<ul>
<li>For Nintendo Switch - OLED Model with a serial number that starts with "XT", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XK", the battery life is approximately 4.5 to 9 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch consoles with a serial number that starts with "XA", the battery life is approximately 2.5 to 6.5 hours.</li>
<li>For Nintendo Switch Lite, the battery life is approximately 3 to 7 hours.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2%E2%80%99s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trump%E2%80%99s-tariffs.1153791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tariffs announced by Donald Trump will drastically impact a number of industries across the world, and video games are in no way excluded. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-supply-chains-hit-with-up-to-a-46-percent-trump-tariffs/">Apple's</a> supply chain issues might not matter as much to gamers, what they likely care more about is the potential the tariffs have to raise the already high price of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo revealed its new console in an hour-long Nintendo Direct event on Wednesday, with the price of the console and the new games we'll be playing on it revealed immediately after. It'll be $449.99 USD if you want to just buy the console, or $499.99 USD to grab the bundle that includes the newly revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-moves-some-switch-production-to-vietnam">2019</a>, Nintendo moved part of its hardware manufacturing out of China and into Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time, though it certainly looked like it, Nintendo stated that the move was not done as a means of avoiding tariffs during disputes between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The tariffs Trump <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-02/trump-says-he-s-signing-executive-order-on-reciprocal-tariffs">announced later on Wednesday</a>, just hours after Nintendo's presentation, include a <strong>46%</strong> tariff levied against Vietnam and a <strong>49%</strong> tariff levied against Cambodia, both of which could end up impacting the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 on a global scale.</p>
<p>Trump also announced a base 10% tariff on all exporters to the United States that will go into effect this coming Saturday, April 5, 2025, while countries facing higher tariffs, like Cambodia and Vietnam, will have their tariffs go into effect on April 9, 2025. The 10% base tariff is also not being added to the ones Cambodia and Vietnam already face.</p>
<p>Unless some kind of deal is reached, including a lower tariff or an exception to certain exports to the United States, there's a very good chance the cost of the Nintendo Switch 2 could go higher than it already is.</p>

And even though the show represents a reboot of the continuity that lets the uninitiated pick things up at the beginning, it’s still deeply rooted in the series’ early ‘00s origins.

Yes, its needle drops for edgy AMV-bait songs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEqHXRrcpc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlEqHXRrcpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Papa Roach’s “Last Resort”</a></span> are cheesy nods to a nu metal heyday that might not resonate with someone who’s never played one of Dante’s demon-slaying massacres, but those were the songs of the early 2000s that <em>Devil May Cry </em>fans were probably listening to during the original trilogy’s PS2 run. After it stopped making me existential, I appreciated how much Netflix’s spin on the series commits to the bit, even if it took me time to warm up to its busy, multi-season setup.</p><p>Most of the important parts of <em>Devil May Cry </em>are here. A younger, spryer version of Dante, played by Johnny Yong Bosch (who plays his nephew Nero in the games), finds himself in the crosshairs of two factions: a demon uprising led by a dapper White Rabbit and a demon-hunting government agency. The White Rabbit seeks to tear the barrier between the human and demon worlds down, allowing the devils of the underworld to pour into the rest of the earth, and they need one of Dante’s only family heirlooms to do it. This version of Dante was orphaned at a young age and only knows the stories his mother told him about where they came from. He’s just a simple demon hunter who doesn’t know why literal Hell is rising around him.</p><p>Longtime fans know where this all leads, but I was surprised at just how elaborate the show’s entangled web of characters became by the end of the season, given that it’s all relatively simple in the games. <em>Devil May Cry </em>is a busy show. Dante is at the center of it all, but there are large swaths of the eight episodes that focus on the supporting cast, such as fan-favorite Lady and the rest of her demon-hunting unit, and the religious zealot Vice President Baines, played by the late, great <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kevin-conroy-batman-arkham-animated-series-voice-dies-1849772983">Kevin Conroy</a></span>. The first half of the show is a bit plodding as it establishes the new setup, and you only get into the meat of what matters after the show’s halfway through and plenty of characters have already fallen. By the time it reaches the second half, the show has dropped a lot of dead weight and started focusing on the stuff <em>Devil May Cry </em>fans are probably looking for. Much of this prolonged setup feels designed to lay groundwork for future seasons, which the finale unambiguously tees up, but for a series that has been known to do a lot with very little, having such a huge ensemble doesn’t do it many favors in the beginning.</p><p>Though it’s a bit bloated to start, <em>Devil May Cry </em>is still a rollicking good time even while it’s getting to the good stuff. Dante is as stylish, rambunctious, and delightful to watch wreck shop on demons as he’s ever been. The action in <em>Devil May Cry </em>is sublime, rapidly oscillating from Dante’s signature campy swagger to dramatic hyperviolence at the drop of a hat. During the early episodes, it’s always a relief when the long-winded exposition is briefly broken up by scenes of Dante facing off against a small pack of poor bastards who have no idea what the gunslinging swordsman is capable of. Then the second half of the season puts all that violence into context, lending it new dramatic weight and even making it cathartic to boot.</p><p><em>Devil May Cry</em>’s first half isn’t bad by any stretch, but the show takes more time than it should to find its footing. I’m curious to see how non-fans react to this show; Netflix’s previous game adaptations like <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners </em>and <em>Castlevania</em> have brought in people who never played those games, but <em>Devil May Cry </em>feels different, like a knowing nod and wink to the people who were playing through Dante’s demon-slaying adventures 20 years ago. Will its cheesy time capsule of edgy 2000s camp be appealing to the modern teenager? That’s not me, so I can’t say for sure. But <em>Devil May Cry </em>had me in its sights, and now that it’s cleared space for a more traditional Dante story next season, I’m down for a second round.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
