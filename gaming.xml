		<p>If you’re a mobile gamer, and in particular an Apple Arcade subscriber, you might know about Fantasian. Arguably, it remains one of the best RPG experiences on the iOS mobile platform, and if you have the hardware to play it I suggest you stop reading right now and go and download it. Go on then. What are you waiting for? However, if you haven’t played or heard of it then it’s time to rejoice, with Fantastian Neo Dimension bringing the Square Enix RPG to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="FANTASIAN Neo Dimension – Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeUv0HH1pNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the main reasons to get excited by Fantasian Neo Dimension is the fact that it comes from Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and the most lauded FInal Fantasy composer, Nobuo Uematsu. This pairing marked the game out as an RPG with huge potential, and they absolutely delivered on it, turning in an enticing fantasy world, compelling narrative and a glorious symphonic soundtrack.</p>
<p>Fantasian plays out in an extensive world, broken down into individual areas, with turn-based combat. That turn-based combat made excellent use of mobile touchscreens, and you can bend your attacks so that they curve through multiple enemies. It introduces a really interesting level of strategy to every attack, and I’m hoping that you’ll be able to use the touchscreen of the Nintendo Switch when you’re on the go. As proven by the Apple TV version, it works fine with traditional controls as well.</p>


<p>Leo, the central hero, is suffering a nasty dose of amnesia, and while that could be the start of any RPG, the setting and ongoing narrative will undoubtedly draw you in. He’s also joined by an intriguing group of characters along the way, with their own batch of special moves and narrative strands.</p>
<p>Fantasian Neo Dimension releases on Nintendo Switch later this year, at some point during Holiday 2024. Stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for more!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-announcements-and-reveals.904740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation to round off the summer showcase season and show off some of the games coming to the Switch throughout the rest of the year. Here's everything that was announced as part of that showcase!</p>
<hr><h2><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>&nbsp;brings back&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi&nbsp;</em>RPGs in November</h2>
<p>First up, it's a look at a brand new&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi&nbsp;</em>RPG in the form of&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>. It's bringing back the series' action-packed turn-based combat and cartoony visual style, and it's launching on November 7th.</p>

<h2><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition&nbsp;</em>offers speedrunning fun</h2>
<p>We got a look at&nbsp;<em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">collection of fun-looking speedrunning challenges</a> based around classic NES games. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>
<h2><em>Fairy Tail 2&nbsp;</em>is a followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail</em>,&nbsp;launching in winter</h2>
<p>If you're a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail&nbsp;</em>manga series (or the associated anime, or, indeed, the 2020 video game), then you'll be pleased to know&nbsp;<em>Fairy Tail 2</em>, a new action-RPG based on the series, is on the way. It's coming in winter.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy creator's&nbsp;<em>Fantasian&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch as&nbsp;<em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></h2>
<p>Didn't get a chance to check out&nbsp;<em>Fantasian&nbsp;</em>on Apple devices via Apple Arcade? No problem - the diorama-based RPG from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi is&nbsp;coming to Nintendo Switch as&nbsp;<em>Fantasian Neo Dimension&nbsp;</em>this holiday season.</p>

<h2><em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>is getting basketball this summer</h2>
<p>Sometime this summer,&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em>is getting a new sport in the form of basketball, which will offer solo play as well as local and online multiplayer modes.</p>
<h2><em>Mio: Memories in Orbit</em>&nbsp;is a desolate-looking Metroidvania coming in 2025</h2>
<p>Next, we got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mio: Memories in Orbit</em>, a rather stylish and stark-looking Metroidvania platformer with some very&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>-esque movement to it. It's coming to Switch in 2025.</p>

<h2>A roundup of cartoon classics</h2>
<p>Nintendo gave us a look at three cartoon classics on Switch. First,&nbsp;<em>Disney Illusion Island&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update with a brand new case to crack later today.</p>
<p>We also got to see&nbsp;<em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>, a cute life sim launching next year, and&nbsp;<em>Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Mario Sports</em>-style arcadey sports game starring Looney Tunes characters. That one's coming to Switch in fall.</p>
<h2><em>Among Us&nbsp;</em>is getting an update</h2>
<p>A major update is launching for&nbsp;<em>Among Us</em>, and it's bringing new crew roles, as well as a new impostor role to sink your teeth into. That update is set to arrive later today as well, and you can <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/new-roles-enter-the-fray-v2024-6-18-emergency-meeting-38/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">read more about it here</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Farmagia&nbsp;</em>is a plant-based action RPG with lots of monster-rearing</h2>
<p>Next up on the slate, it's monster-rearing action RPG&nbsp;<em>Farmagia</em>, which will have you growing monsters from plants and training them for battle&nbsp;<em>Ooblets</em>-style. You'll then engage in action-RPG combat with those monsters, and you can fuse them into mega-monsters for added oomph. It's coming on November 1st.</p>

<h2><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD&nbsp;</em>is coming in January</h2>
<p>Since you can get&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&nbsp;</em>on Switch, it stands to reason you should be able to get&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country Returns&nbsp;</em>as well, and lo and behold, a Switch version of the game is coming on January 16th.</p>
<h2><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>isn't all the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>you're getting</h2>
<p>Next up, it's time for a look at the rather spiffy&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>, which transposes the classic JRPG action of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix">Square Enix's gorgeous HD-2D</a> world. It's launching for Switch on November 14th.</p>
<p>That's not all, though.&nbsp;Square Enix has also confirmed that remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>games in the HD-2D style are also on the way next year!</p>

<h2><em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>sure does have a lot of properties in it</h2>
<p>The next game on Nintendo's roster is&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, an action-adventure game featuring a metric ton of Funko Pop characters from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Jurassic World</em>,&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funko-fusion-release-date">launching on September 13th</a>.</p>
<h2>A spooky, silly, strategic montage</h2>
<p>The theme for Nintendo's next rundown is "spooky, silly, strategic", and that's exactly what we got.&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>is first up - it's coming to Switch on June 27th.</p>
<p>Then, it's time for the sheer weirdness of&nbsp;<em>The New Denpa Men</em>, a strange action-RPG that serves as a followup to the 3DS'&nbsp;<em>The Denpa Men: They Came By Wave</em>. This one's free-to-play and it's coming to Switch July 22nd as a timed console exclusive.</p>
<p>Two more games round out this montage: tower defense game&nbsp;<em>Metal Slug Attack Reloaded</em>, which launches today, and&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon 2</em>, which is coming to Switch on July 15th.</p>
<h2>Nintendo Switch Online classics abound</h2>
<p>Hey, guess what? More Nintendo Switch Online classics are coming! The GBA collection is getting&nbsp;<em>A Link to the Past&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Four Swords</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The N64, meanwhile, is getting a new Mature 17+ collection, with&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>as its inaugural titles. All of them are coming later today.</p>
<h2><em>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero&nbsp;</em>is a cutesy tactical RPG</h2>
<p>I didn't have a return for the <i>Phantom Brave&nbsp;</i>franchise on my bingo card, but here we are!&nbsp;<em>Phantom Brave: The Lost Hero&nbsp;</em>is a cute-looking tactical RPG in which you control phantoms in turn-based combat. It's coming in 2025.</p>
<h2>A massive Marvel fighting game collection</h2>
<p><em>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics&nbsp;</em>is next, and it's a seven-game collection that includes classics like&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Punisher&nbsp;</em>side-scroller. It's arriving this year.</p>
<h2><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree&nbsp;</em>brings the party in October</h2>
<p>That's right - it's time for a new <i>Mario Party&nbsp;</i>game, and Nintendo is promising that this one will be the biggest yet. It'll boast over 110 minigames across several new boards (and two returning ones from the N64's first two&nbsp;<em>Mario Party</em>&nbsp;games), and it arrives on October 17th.</p>

<h2><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>is a brand new top-down&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game</h2>
<p>What's this? A remake of the&nbsp;<em>Oracle&nbsp;</em>games? No - it's a brand new&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>adventure that uses the chibi-esque art style utilized by the&nbsp;<em>Link's Awakening&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>has players playing as Zelda, not Link. He's gone missing, and Zelda must adventure through Hyrule, which is now covered in strange purple rifts, to find him.</p>
<p><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>features a mechanic by which you can "memorize" objects with "echoes", then spawn them wherever you like in order to solve puzzles. You can even "memorize" enemies to get them to fight for you!</p>
<p>This new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game arrives on September 26th.</p>

<h2><em>Just Dance 2025&nbsp;</em>sure does exist</h2>
<p>After the adrenaline rush of a new&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game, it's time for a look at&nbsp;<em>Just Dance 2025</em>, which comes to Switch in October and brings a host of new songs, including Green Day's "Basket Case" and Ariana Grande's "yes, and?".</p>
<h2><em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>looks like blocky fun</h2>
<p><i>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">announced during the Summer Game Fest presentation</a>, and we got another look at it here. It looks like a cute adventure through the world of&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>, and it's got co-op too, which is nice. It's coming this holiday.</p>
<h2><em>Stray&nbsp;</em>brings its feline fun to Switch this holiday</h2>
<p>If you haven't checked out Annapurna's&nbsp;<em>Stray&nbsp;</em>yet, you'll have another chance to do so on Switch this holiday season. You can play as a cat. What's not to like?</p>
<h2><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is a cozy hobbit sim coming this holiday</h2>
<p>Another game arriving on the Switch this holiday is&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, a cozy hobbit life sim in which you can live the idyllic and peaceful life of a hobbit in the town of Bywater. Hopefully, you won't be recruited for the kind of stirring adventures Bilbo and Frodo went on.</p>
<h2><em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>is on the case</h2>
<p>I have to be honest - this one blindsided me. Capcom is releasing&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection</em>, which collects the two DS detective adventures starring Miles Edgeworth, for Switch on September 6th. One of them has never been released in the West!</p>

<h2><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG from the&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>guys</h2>
<p>Coming to the Switch in early 2025,&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>is a new tactical RPG from the creators of&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>. It looks very much like a game created by the guys behind&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa</em>.</p>
<h2><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven&nbsp;</em>is a full remake of the classic RPG</h2>
<p>As its penultimate game, Nintendo revealed a remake of&nbsp;<em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>, titled&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Seven</em>. Unlike the 2017 remaster, this one's a ground-up remake with modern visuals and gameplay tweaks. It's coming on October 24th.</p>
<h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>comes to Switch in 2025</h2>
<p>Finally, it's time for the big one. You guessed it:&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>is real, and we got to see some gameplay footage today.</p>
<p>The game, which is now called&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, looks a lot like a&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>game alright; scanning, targeting, and switching to the Morph Ball are all back, and this time, it looks like Samus is doing battle with those dastardly Space Pirates again.</p>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>comes to Switch in 2025, and I'd be surprised if it wasn't a launch title for the much-mooted Switch successor.</p>

<hr><p>Well, that's everything for today's Nintendo Direct! Finally getting to see&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>after all these years really is a kick. Stay tuned for more, and here's the full show again in case you missed it!</p>

It will arrive later this summer as part of a free update. Nintendo made the announcement today, as part of its Direct showcase.

"Dribble, pass and shoot in two-on-two matches, or aim for the highest score against up to three other players in Five Streak Battle," Nintedo says in its latest Switch Sports trailer, which you can see below.

We were quite taken with Nintendo Switch Sports on its original debut. 
</p>
<p>
"Ultimately, though, these games are so refined, and delivered with such odd, coffee-shop-and-library charm, that it doesn't matter how you play. My daughter is of the age where she completely missed the Wii, so when this new game arrived and we started moving the furniture around, she didn't have a clue what we were up to. But that afternoon we must have played together for hours, with breaks for when a diving header animation made her laugh so much she needed her breath back," our Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-sports-review-online-or-local-its-a-treat">Eurogamer's Nintendo Switch Sports review back in 2022</a> (poet and didn't know it).

"The whole thing was intoxicating," he closed.

            <p>
Turok: Dinosaur Hunter and Perfect Dark are heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-online-games-available-to-play-right-now">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, as part of the Expansion pack's new "mature" games app.
</p>
<p>

Nintendo made the announcement during this afternoon's Direct broadcast. Both N64 shooters are available from today. In addition, Perfect Dark will arrive with online multiplayer, so who is ready for a round or two later? 
</p>
<p>

As well as these mature games, Nintendo Switch Online users will be able to get their hands on GameBoy Advance's Metroid: Zero Mission and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords. You can see a little taste for what's in store via the video below.

Elsewhere during the Direct, Nintendo revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-coming-to-nintendo-switch">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD will be coming to Switch</a> in January next year. The Show's highlight, though? Nintendo only went and announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">new Legend of Zelda game where you actually play as the titular princess herself</a>!

The latest addition is </small><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review"><small><em>Inside Out 2</em></small></a><small>, released on June 14.]</small></p>
<p id="Lcd2wN">Pixar Animation Studios’ drive for innovation has always been one of its biggest motivating forces. Pixar movies profoundly changed American studio animation, ushering in the age of computer-animated features and raising the bar on animated storytelling. They’ve consistently pushed the envelope on taboo subjects for family-friendly films, with the creative teams opening up conversations about everything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review">the meaning of sadness</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">menstruation</a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23660009/elemental-vs-zootopia-immigrant-story-director-peter-sohn">immigration and assimilation</a>. For cinephiles, knowing the Pixar library is crucial for understanding the field of modern animation.</p>
<p id="NVTvnX">Twenty-eight films is a lot to navigate, though, even for animation fans. So we’ve laid out which Pixar movies we think new fans (or new parents) should prioritize, or that existing fans might want to revisit or reassess. Our collective staff ranking, averaged from individual ranked lists, addresses which Pixar films we feel are most exciting, most ambitious, and most moving — the ones that most changed our perspectives on what animation and all-ages storytelling can do.</p>

<p id="Tv9ecu">The worst crime of <em>The Good Dinosaur</em>, which went <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-good-dinosaur-pixars-biggest-production-nightmare-crash-lands-into-theaters">through several incarnations and a lot of behind-the-scenes drama</a> as Pixar tried to figure out what do with its big dino film, isn’t the actual quality of the story or animation. It’s that it rarely lets viewers really care about its characters. </p>
<p id="mMMRlW">The idea of a world where dinosaurs never went extinct is rich. Certain scenes are breathtaking — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENOKlLFNaAM">Arlo the dinosaur sticking his head up into a sea of clouds</a>! A nightscape set aglow with luminous fireflies! — but the odd Western narrative (it’s basically a cowboy movie about a young rancher and his dog) doesn’t quite work for a land full of dinosaurs, where so much world-setting has to be done in order to build up the emotional core. <em>The Good Dinosaur</em> feels more like a panorama of this cool new world — cattle-rustling velociraptors! a farm run by apatosauruses! murderous pterodactyls! — than a transportive look at an alternate universe. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="0GNsLG">2013’s <em>Monsters, Inc. </em>prequel <em>Monsters University</em> comes straight out of the unfortunate franchise mentality that says, “A popular film wrapped up its own story neatly and completely, without sequel-bait or spinoff material, so we have nowhere to go with that narrative. But what if we dug deeper into the backstory no one was asking about?” In this case, likely no one who watched <em>Monsters, Inc. </em>was obsessed with wondering what monsters Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully (John Goodman) were like in college, or whether either of them had any dreams they had to give up on before they entered the workforce. <em>Monsters University</em> is a fun reunion for Crystal and Goodman, who have a strong dynamic together, and it’s a lively enough return to a compellingly weird world that provides a lot of opportunities for monster-y comedy riffs. But it also feels startlingly inessential for a Pixar movie, an agreeable enough feature without much new or innovative to recommend it. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="koOa5p">No one really <em>asked</em> for a <em>Toy Story 4</em>, but it might be the best “fourth movie in a 24-year-old franchise” that we could possibly get. </p>
<p id="g0cEy8">Separated from the first three movies, <em>Toy Story 4 </em>is a fun and heartwarming adventure, showing us a completely new set of characters (save for Woody and Buzz) and a new side to life as a toy. Villain Gabby Gabby has the same sort of motivation as Stinky Pete and Lotso before her: She wants to be loved by a child. But unlike the other two, her grand plan isn’t a grandiose villain scheme, but a pragmatic means to an end. Instead of declaring that no toy should be loved because she can’t be loved, she wants to fix her defective part. </p>
<p id="6V2Yv8">While <em>Toy Story 4</em> introduces some standout new characters — such as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/19/18684232/toy-story-4-forky-how-to-make-craft">beloved spork-turned-toy Forky</a> — the staple characters from the first three movies take a back seat. The movie’s emotional end, where Woody decides to part ways with the toys and Bonnie, doesn’t hit quite as hard when we’ve almost forgotten they exist. <em>—PR </em></p>

<p id="1ehZGF">I have already gone on record about how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming/2021/3/1/22307039/watch-cars-2-disney-plus-new-on-shudder-criterion"><em>Cars 2</em></a> has been unfairly maligned for years. Just because it doesn’t have a big emotional tear jerking moment doesn’t mean it’s not a good movie! Unlike the other two Cars movies, <em>Cars 2</em> turns the spotlight to comedic relief Mater and thrusts him into a high-stakes spy adventure. Nothing about the Cars universe makes sense if you think about it for more than 10 seconds. In <em>Cars 2</em>, this is a feature, not a bug. It embraces all the weirdness that comes with a world full of cars. Car Pope? Sure! Car secret agents shooting wires from their tires? Hell yeah! Car mafia plotting to take over the Car world by commandeering oil reserves? Yeah, why the hell not? <em>Cars 2</em> is the perfect movie to put on and just go smooth brain and that is not a bad thing. And yeah, maybe the emotions aren’t as big and sweeping as typical Pixar fare, but seeing Mater finally embrace who he is despite the world telling him not to be himself is actually pretty touching. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="2Ek5yy">While <em>Cars 2 </em>was a funny one-off side adventure in the Cars universe — more for fun than any substance — <em>Cars 3 </em>is the natural continuation of Lightning McQueen’s character arc. Unlike some of the other <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/1/19102523/toy-story-4-ending-cars-3-pixar-movies-themes">superfluous late-2010 Pixar sequels</a>, it actually makes sense and brings Lightning’s story to a natural conclusion. He can’t be a hotshot race car forever! It’s a surprisingly poignant story about growing older and passing on your legacy to a new generation. Lightning is resistant at first, clinging to his status as a hotshot champion, but he does eventually realize that much like old racer Doc Hudson was a mentor to him, he can now be a mentor to young Cruz. It is a story that couldn’t really be told without the foundation of the first film (the fun romp of the second is basically untouched, but don’t let that deter you from <em>Cars 2</em>) and thus turns into a rare Disney sequel that feels warranted. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="h6ZTiP">In a way, all Pixar’s movies are fantasies, given their focus on living toys, talking animals, and grumpy monsters. But none of them explore the familiar tropes of epic fantasy like <em>Onward</em>, which takes place in a world full of elves, centaurs, fauns, and manticores, and follows two brothers on a quest to power a magical spell to briefly raise their father from the dead. Like <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Onward </em>takes place in a fantasy-skinned version of a familiar world, in this case one where cars and coffee shops live comfortably alongside illusion spells and pet house dragons. But the setting is almost incidental to the story, which is more about an angsty teen who never met his father and has become obsessed with everything he thinks he’s missing along with that relationship.</p>
<p id="JcQabb">There’s certainly some solid grist for emotional connection in that premise, but it doesn’t fully land until the end of the movie, which is more of a straight fetch-quest adventure than any previous Pixar film. There’s plenty of room in the story for car chases, tunnel traps, and magic-assisted problem-solving, to the point where it feels like a pretty decent D&amp;D session, with a powerful emotional punch at the end. It’s also a good-looking movie, packed with rich detail and color. It could just stand to have some of that emotional impact earlier on, to balance out the comedy and the chases. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="CsklO6">Somewhere inside <em>Brave</em> is a fantasy film worthy of <em>Frozen, </em>but the finished product has vision issues. <em>Brave</em>’s creator — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/12/17/18131286/the-prince-of-egypt-director-brenda-chapman-dreamworks">experienced feature director Brenda Chapman</a>, the first woman to take a director credit at Pixar — was removed midway through production and replaced by Mark Andrews, who at that time had never directed a feature film. The reasons given amounted to disagreements between Chapman and disgraced Pixar chief creative officer John Lasseter, which was a bad look then <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/8/17443316/john-lasseter-leaving-pixar-disney">and is an even worse look now</a>. </p>
<p id="l8lCG1"><em>Brave</em> suffers for Pixar’s lack of faith. The dark tone of Chapman’s story, which is based partly on her relationship with her own daughter, feels muddied and the narrative splintered, in particular with the comedic sequences featuring Scottish princess Merida and her triplet brothers. But the forest sprites, the cursed bear, Merida and her mother’s turmoil, the entire “<em>I’ll be shootin’ fer me OWN hand!</em>” sequence — the promise of <em>Brave </em>is frustratingly present amid its pitfalls. </p>
<p id="b0zNkB">It’s also clear that Pixar was unprepared for the intense expectations placed on <em>Brave</em> as the first film in the studio’s nearly 20-year history to feature a female protagonist. The tomboy-princess marketing of <em>Brave</em> elided the fact that in the actual story, Merida isn’t rebelling against femininity, but rather her adult responsibilities — leading to much disappointment in an ending where she compromises rather than triumphs. —<em>Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="d4LOc8">One of Pixar’s many belated sequels, <em>Finding Dory </em>shifts the focus to <em>Finding Nemo</em>’s bumbling sidekick character voiced by Ellen DeGeneres. Dory’s journey to find her parents tugs at the heartstrings, and baby Dory is incredibly, massively, intensely, super-duper adorable. <em>Finding Dory</em> brings back some iconic <em>Finding Nemo </em>characters, but only for brief appearances, choosing instead to focus on a slew of new characters. With the exception of Hank the grumpy septopus, most are forgettable.</p>
<p id="RDpZmC">The movie focuses on a specific aquarium, which offers an interesting take on the setting — watching Hank and Dory cross dry land is pretty fun — but never gets to show off the vast expanse of the ocean that made the first movie so visually stunning. <em>Finding Dory</em> is cute. It’s fun. It will make you laugh, maybe even tear up a bit. But unlike its predecessor, it doesn’t linger in the memory. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="yN81G9">In <em>Cars,</em> hotshot race car Lightning McQueen takes a hard left off the paved racetrack and into a small town in the middle of nowhere, where he is forced to confront what is important in life and makes friends for the first time ever. It’s easy to be jaded by the Cars movies and the deluge of merchandise they’ve gone on to spawn, but the first movie has a whole lot of heart. The animation is also gorgeous, especially the landscapes — the sweeping blue sky! The orange and pink-swathed desert! The soft glow of Radiator Springs’ neon and street lights when Lightning finally fixes them up! In the end, Lightning learns his lesson and gives up his top prize in order to help an old racing legend. The real Piston Cup are the friends we made along the way, truly. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="yOC5lR">With <em>Toy Story</em> now four stories deep, we maybe shouldn’t be surprised that Pixar can pull off a sequel. But the stakes were high for <em>The Incredibles 2</em>, a follow-up to an already delightfully whole tale about a family of superheroes. As sequels go, this one is still pretty  incandescent. Now Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) gets to be the one bringing home the bacon as a superhero, leading to some indelible action sequences as she hunts down the nefarious “Screenslaver.” Bob “Mr. Incredible” Parr (Craig T. Nelson) is left watching the kids and juggling their regular lives with their powered lives. Ultimately the thrust of the film isn’t quite as indescribably neat as this list’s reigning champ, but we get another day out to Edna Mode’s studio, which is no chump change. It might not quite as incisive as the first, but <em>Incredibles 2 </em>is a great sequel and an indelible extension of the super-family’s story. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="d2c86u">Like the movie’s absent-minded hero Flik, <em>A Bug’s Life</em> wobbles while still carrying its weight. Pixar’s loose adaptation of Aesop’s The Ant and the Grasshopper, by way of <em>Seven Samurai</em> and the spaghetti Western, was an ambitious follow-up to the nostalgia-soaked <em>Toy Story</em>. But the animation technology of the time couldn’t quite realize the majesty and chaos of the insect conflict. (The water droplets, though — they were something!) </p>
<p id="2UVKwA">As in the best of Pixar’s films, it’s the characters of <em>A Bug’s Life</em> who save the day. Dave Foley as Flik is an underrated voice-over triumph, while his recruits, the Circus Bugs, have a rapport that the Toy Story gang never quite mustered. The ant-vs.-grasshopper battle stumbles under the weight of landscape textures and jerky arthropod motion, but the fear  and the life-or-death stakes come to life in the performances. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

<p id="mQYB77"><em>Lightyear </em>is about the <em>real</em> Buzz Lightyear — no, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22748569/real-buzz-lightyear-movie-explained">not an actual human person</a>, but a character in a fictional movie that <em>Toy Story</em>’s Andy loved when he was a kid, the film that inspired the toy character we see in the Toy Story movies. But don’t think too hard about the <em>Toy Story</em> connection, because in reality, <em>Lightyear</em>’s director, Angus MacLane, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23034598/lightyear-pixar-director-interview-early-press-day">wanted to make an epic science fiction film</a> that adults could enjoy too. And it’s <em>almost</em> that.</p>
<p id="fIN8Pn">Amid the stellar action sequences and the cool gadgetry, <em>Lightyear</em> is remarkably restrained. There are moments where it feels like the movie could really dig into its emotional beats, but for whatever reason, it holds back, never quite revealing its full hand, even when all the cards are right there. The plot its pretty standard sci-fi fare, but for kids watching, it may be the very first taste they get of the genre. And hey, since this is supposed to be the 1990s movie that became Andy’s first exposure to science fiction, that’s a feature, not a bug. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="pGo5rh">Pixar’s first movie to center on a Black protagonist lands a little oddly when it turns out the film’s big moral message is “The things you love most in life aren’t necessarily the things that give you purpose.” Directors Pete Docter and Kemp Powers blunt what could be a slam-dunk emotional ending by giving it a more adult spin, in a way that may make it hard for children to grasp. (Most 8-year-olds are going to have a hard time empathizing with a character who feels like a failure because he has to hang out in a school and work with kids.) </p>
<p id="s3hBGW">But <em>Soul</em>’s visual verve and pure emotions are hard to beat. Just as lead character Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx) finally gets the jazz-pianist gig that might finally let him drop his time-killing gig as a middle-school music teacher and pursue music full time, he dies in an accident and finds himself in the afterlife, fighting to make his way back to Earth. There are a lot of wacky incidents involving a bratty soul who’s never been incarnated and doesn’t want to be (voiced by Tina Fey), and a therapy cat, and a group of benevolent but neglectful pre-life counselors (voiced by Richard Ayoade and Alice Braga, among others). But <em>Soul</em>’s core is really in the unbeatable moments where Joe expresses himself through music, inspiring other people or pulling himself out of his day-to-day life for a few minutes. Sometimes it’s a goofy and playful movie, but it’s firmly entrenched in the idea that life is a rare and wondrous thing that shouldn’t be taken for granted. —<em>TR</em> </p>

<p id="UpeTrB">Pixar’s second film in two years (after <em>Turning Red</em>) about the tension between a second-generation immigrant girl and a demanding, traditional parent, <em>Elemental</em> looks too familiar at first glance, and the apparent Romeo-and-Juliet romance doesn’t help. But it’s all a lot more nuanced and effective than the surface elements suggest. </p>
<p id="GNBk1d">In a city where the inhabitants are based in the four elements, privileged water-person Wade (Mamoudou Athie) finds it hard to understand the bigotry and familial pressure that his new fire-person friend Ember (Leah Lewis) experiences every day. But the more time the two of them spend together, the more they come to see each other’s perspectives. Their slow-burn romance is just one thread among many in a story that sometimes seems overstuffed because it’s balancing so many themes and ideas, including thoughts on assimilation and integration, prejudice and stereotypes, the importance of family traditions, the oppression of bureaucracy and systemic failures, and even where anger comes from. </p>
<p id="HXzCue">It’s an awful lot for one story, but <em>The Good Dinosaur</em> director Peter Sohn still leaves time throughout for quiet moments of strikingly rich and beautifully composed imagery, and for some full-on goofy gags built around life as an element-person. Not every element of the film fits together or works together, but a tremendously engaging score (from<em> WALL-E</em> and <em>Finding Nemo</em> composer Thomas Newman) and a deep emotional grounding help boost this film and pave over the cracks. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="VraXae">Before Domee Shi stepped up from directing the Pixar short <em>Bao</em> to the feature <em>Turning Red</em>, Pixar’s Enrico Casarosa went through the same process, starting with the 2011 Pixar short <em>La Luna </em>and graduating up to his own feature, <em>Luca</em>. Like Shi, Casarosa turned his fantasy-adventure into a personal story drawing from his own youth, while also experimenting with a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22535601/luca-pixar-3d-cg-animation">more stylized, more cartoonish visual style</a> than past Pixar projects. All of which makes <em>Luca </em>lighter, fluffier, and lower-stakes than any of the classic tearjerker moments that made Pixar’s name in animation. <em>Luca </em>is another “kid rebels against smothering parents” story, with timid sea-monster kid Luca meeting bolder sea-monster kid Alberto and running off to a life on land among humans. There, he gets involved in some fairly small-stakes adventures. But a lot of the joy of <em>Luca </em>is the way it focuses in on the journey, on why a bike race winds up being so profoundly important to the character, and on the lazy, sunny childhood days that lead up to that race. It isn’t a film with profound, heavy impact, but it’s an unusually bright and pleasant look at childhood joys and obsessions, and how sharing them can instantly cement friendships.  —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="hnoawI">Young girls who watched their <em>Toy Story 2 </em>VHS tapes over and over (who may or not be me) were just about to go off to college when <em>Toy Story 3</em> came out. <em>Toy Story 2</em> set up an ominous future — what would happen to the toys when their owner Andy grew up? At the end of <em>Toy Story 2</em>, the toys agreed that a short life of love was better than eternity in a museum. But <em>Toy Story 3</em> brings us to the end of their time with Andy, who has long left his toys in their chest, and is moving on to higher education.</p>
<p id="gG1EUR">Woody and the gang are now desperate in a way only hinted at in <em>Toy Story 2. </em>They <em>need</em> love from Andy. Though the cowboy is the clear favorite to go along with the boy to college, he has to reassure the others that going into storage won’t be so bad. At the end, though, <em>Toy Story 3 </em>doesn’t take that easy path, and instead closes a chapter of the toys’ lives — and of Andy’s life as well. </p>
<p id="E9C85Q">One of the final moments, where Bonnie raises Woody’s hand to wave goodbye at Andy, and Andy’s expression catches for a moment, never fails to make me cry. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="32iBIT">The opening of Pete Doctor’s high-flying odyssey goes so hard people barely remember what makes it a great film. The preface of <em>Up</em>, set to Michael Giacchino’s memorable “Married Life” cue, chronicles Carl and Ellie Fredricksen’s courtship, marriage, buying of a home, dreams of a family, miscarriage, grief, hope, love, settling down, and Ellie’s death all in the span of five minutes. But the weight of Carl’s modestly lived life is no match for his dream of making it to the mythic Paradise Falls (or hundreds of helium-filled balloons, for that matter). Before nursing home goon squad can lock him up, he and stowaway scout Russell take to the skies, and embark on a journey that feels bespoke for animation. </p>
<p id="znhigI">Paradise Falls’ lush jungle setting combined with the corrupt explorer Charles Muntz’s airship and fleet to pilot dogs reimagines the covers of pulp novels in the vivid Pixar style. The aerial photography and action establishes a fantastical set of physics that even Christopher Nolan would struggle to match. The most daring choice might be focusing an entire movie on a crank like Carl. There is no room in the live-action blockbuster machine for an octogenarian with a walker, but in the magical realms of Pixar, our hero can grapple with villains <em>and </em>his late-life purpose. <em>Up</em>’s episodic nature keeps it from floating to the top tier of Pixar, but the ambition of the filmmaking is befitting of the dreamer at the heart of the action. —<em>MP</em></p>

<p id="nXeftU">Kelsey Mann’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems">2024 sequel to Pete Docter’s <em>Inside Out</em></a> gets dinged a few slots purely for not being as vitally original and groundbreaking as some of the other movies further up on the list. But it’s a winning, moving film with a lot to recommend it, even in comparison with one of Pixar’s best. This movie adds <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess">a new group of emotions</a> to the cast list, and sees them jockeying for what they think is best for their charge, 13-year-old Riley Andersen. There are a lot more of the first movie’s mental-landscape puns and visual gags here, and a similar clever attention paid to how emotions interact and come into conflict, particularly in puberty. But what really makes this movie land is how real and relatable Riley’s adolescent conflicts feel, and how well this movie follows up on the original’s investment in Riley’s development and her internal world. Like so many of the best Pixar movies, it’s a tearjerker. —<em>TR</em>  </p>

<p id="0GjiUX">The original <em>Toy Story</em> wondered, “What if toys were alive?” The second introduced the concept of their longevity, the fact that one day their kids would outgrow them. <em>Toy Story 2</em> is both a heartfelt examination of past, present, and future, and a sturdy step toward the more emotional territory of future sequels, introducing the juxtaposition of fleeting childhood and the permanence of toys.</p>
<p id="4rBg7X">Nothing sums up the emotional core of <em>Toy Story 2 </em>more than the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Km4WiqKtZ-E">“When She Loved Me” montage</a>: Sarah McLachlan croons a bittersweet song over scenes of cowgirl doll Jessie and her owner Emily playing together, growing apart, and eventually completely parting ways. The sequence, swathed in a medley of autumn colors, is pure Pixar. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="K0Ghnt">The first <em>Toy Story</em> was something of a miracle: a technological revolution that still managed to tell a story. While the sequels really gnawed away at the existential questions dredged up by the first, the original movie just focuses on the toys and their love for their owner, Andy. The buddy-cop dynamic of Woody and Buzz shines as the two navigate a contentious relationship and an identity crisis. The entire concept could’ve been played straight for laughs, but instead turns into a heartwarming tale of friendship, conflict, and the halcyon days of childhood.</p>
<p id="eQdjaj">Pixar’s first film was born out of conflict — <a href="https://www.retrojunk.com/article/show/3197/a-history-of-toy-story">Disney hands tried to make the plot more adult </a>— but it’s a true testament to how animation can meld with human emotion. Equal parts humor and heart, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gthEMHhS9zI">terror</a> and triumph, <em>Toy Story</em> still holds up after all these years.<em> —PR</em></p>

<p id="seYKtG">The movie that launched a thousand ill-fated pet clownfish sends Marlin (Albert Brooks) across the ocean with a forgetful blue tang (Ellen DeGeneres) from an idyllic coral reef to an eerie sunken battleship, from the depths of the abyssal zone to the roaring East Australian Current. The movie switches between Marlin’s quest to find his son and Nemo’s new life in a fish tank. Neither storyline is dull, with Nemo’s basically turning into an escape plan helmed by Willem Dafoe’s Gill. The movie also boasts a colorful cast of side characters — from the struggling vegetarian sharks and Nemo’s precocious classmates to the quirky tank gang and Crush the surfer-dad turtle — who help the movie “just keep swimming.”</p>
<p id="IP36aW">At its heart, though, <em>Finding Nemo </em>is a story about being a parent, about doing whatever it takes to protect your child — and about learning when it’s time to let them go. —<em>PR</em> </p>

<p id="pcgohZ">Pixar has struggled to present perspectives outside of the experiences of Lasseter and the company’s elder creatives. You can see it in the long wait between <em>The Incredibles</em> and <em>Incredibles 2</em>. You can see it in <em>Brave</em>’s production woes. </p>
<p id="pcpasK">But you don’t see it in <em>Coco</em>. The musical adventure, from <em>Toy Story 3</em> director Lee Unkrich, mixes the best of the Pixar formula with the Disney formula, combining music, character, and a story-first approach to tell a tale of a boy who follows his dreams so hard that he fixes his whole dang family, living <em>and</em> dead.</p>
<p id="3RdyY3">As I said <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/11/8/16621900/coco-disney-pixar-review">in my review</a>, plenty of college kids on semesters abroad have discovered the aesthetics of the Mexican celebration of Día de Muertos, but Pixar’s vision of the Land of the Dead is rich, coherent, and a joy to inhabit. <em>Coco</em> charms; it has a surprisingly evil villain; it gets those Pixar Tears from your eyeballs. You’re probably still humming “Remember Me.” <em> —SP</em></p>

<p id="aeiysA">There are two kinds of people in this world: People who don’t like Domee Shi’s feature directorial debut <em>Turning Red</em> because it’s too specific about a whole lot of aspects of the teen-girl experience not normally seen in movies, and people who love it for exactly that reason. There’s a standard “kid rebels against overbearing family member” story buried in here, but Shi makes it anything but standard, by letting her 13-year-old Chinese-Canadian protagonist Mei contend with everything from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">menstruation talk</a> to a sudden obsession with drawing horny fan-art to <a href="https://twitter.com/TashaRobinson/status/1502366352383877126">getting absolutely messy</a> over her boy-band fandoms. And that’s all aside from her turning into a giant red panda when she’s emotional. <em>Turning Red</em> is weirdly frenetic and cartoony for a Pixar feature, with a hyper protagonist who introduces herself by shouting the details of her life directly into the camera for the audience. And that’s all highly deliberate, as Shi and co-writer Julia Cho navigate the big emotions and big problems of early adolescence, both on a symbolic level, with Mei’s sudden uncontrollable body changes, and on a very literal level, with her friendships and fandoms and school problems. It’s a joyous movie about identity and self-acceptance, but for those of us who like our movies distinctive, idiosyncratic, and voice-y, it’s also joyously weird and wild.  —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="H88zOR">Andrew Stanton’s science-fiction odyssey, set in 2185, is a triptych of disparate stories glued together with feels. There’s the dystopian tale of a worker bot tidying up a busted, deserted world that could easily stand alone as a short; there’s the love story of two robots, a pure blend of Asimov and Disney; and there’s the rescue mission, a galactic journey that whisks WALL-E to the Axiom mothership for an encounter with a HAL 9000-like A.I. Our li’l robot friend, brought to life through the beeps and boops of Star Wars sound designer Ben Burtt, beholds every narrative jump with binocular-eyed wonder. So do we.</p>
<p id="CUWyoA">Elegiac and eerie, <em>WALL-E</em> is a love letter to everything Stanton would miss about Earth (<em>Hello, Dolly!</em> chief among them) and an impassioned plea for us slovenly earthlings to do what we can to save it before it’s too late. We’ll see if humanity can get its act together, but even if we’re destined to decimate the planet and float around in hover chairs on a rocket-powered shopping mall for the rest of our days, we’ll always have WALL-E and EVE dancing among the stars, an ode to the beauty that once was. As is the ongoing mission of Pixar, <em>WALL-E</em> conjures romantic truth. —<em>MP</em></p>

<p id="rwQSzo">I love <em>Ratatouille</em> because the basic premise of this family-friendly film could also be read as horror. Think about it: If someone told you a rat <em>sat on their head</em> and then proceeded to <em>control their body by pulling their hair</em>, would you be rooting for the rat? Probably not. But in <em>Ratatouille</em> you will absolutely be rooting for Remy to succeed in his dream to become a French chef. </p>
<p id="hFILt1">That dream starts small. At first, Remy just wants to get to cook, since rats mostly forage for garbage. Many of us have felt that hopeless desire to make art even if we seemed ill-suited or if our friends and families doubt us. When Remy meets Linguini, the hapless human who can be operated like a hair-inette (an, erm, hair marinette), they create a mutually beneficial arrangement. Linguini, a garbage boy at a Parisian restaurant, will be the perfect vehicle for Remy to develop his cooking skills, allowing them to advance in the kitchen.</p>
<p id="k2R2YI"><em>Ratatouille</em>’s physical comedy is wonderful — the puppeteering technique takes time to perfect, as does learning the art of French cooking — and the food looks so tasty and aromatic. The film’s core takeaway “not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere,” turns a funny premise into a kind of parable about access and platform, and what might happen if we give more people opportunities to develop their craft. —<em>Nicole Clark</em></p>

<p id="fVij8N">When <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> was released, it was early enough in Pixar’s run that critics were still pointing out how the studio’s movies could delight parents and kids alike. You hear those remarks less and less as Pixar has proved time and again that those sensibilities don’t have to be at odds. But <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> is as good an encapsulation as any at what makes Pixar’s work stand the test of time: A creative and colorful new world, a concept that appeals to kids but has resonance beyond childhood, and alternatingly heartfelt and funny construction made <em>Monsters, Inc.</em> feel like an instant classic. There’s good action and good conflict, and with relatively few chinks in the armor. In the end, the world we came to know so well has shifted, and kids everywhere can rest easy with their closet door so nearby. That Pixar sweet spot that sits somewhere between “Mike Wazowski!” and “Kitty!” And our hearts are all the better for it.  —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="fvvecU"><em>Inside Out</em> takes place largely inside the mind of 11-year-old Riley, which allows the artists at Pixar to stretch their world-building and design imaginations. The aspects of the human psyche become bubbly personifications — Amy Poehler is terrifically cast as the embodiment of Joy, along with Mindy Kaling voicing the snooty Disgust — but the movie amounts to more than a wacky adventure into consciousness. <em>Inside Out </em>handles the delicate and complicated feelings of growing up. Joining Sadness and Joy on their quest through Riley’s mind is kooky imaginary friend Bing Bong, who gets a surprisingly poignant arc.</p>
<p id="DS4GXF">Pixar films never shy away from the big emotional beats, but by virtue of <em>Inside Out</em> being a film about emotion,<em> </em>its climax — the epiphany that Sadness (Phyllis Smith) is a <em>necessary</em> part of processing emotions — hits particularly hard. —<em>PR </em></p>

<p id="CifndZ">Back when superheroes were still a goofy thing for kids, or at most a guilty treat for adults, Brad Bird’s <em>The Incredibles</em> bounded onto the big screen, combining the Fantastic Four, the nuclear family sitcom, the entire mid-century-modern aesthetic, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2017/11/9/16623570/watchmen-story-explained-creation-alan-moore">basically the same story setup as <em>Watchmen</em></a> into what might be the crispest, most tightly orchestrated action movie ever made. </p>
<p id="O7qF1a"><em>The Incredibles</em> is superbly plotted and paced, and skips along to a Giacchino soundtrack that wouldn’t sound out of place in a Bond film. There isn’t a single throwaway scene or line — nor are there throwaway characters. The Parr family makes up the heart of the film, of course, while the entitled Syndrome and his ambitions form the spine of the plot. But when you widen the net? No duds, people. </p>
<p id="OwdKFv">Frozone: Instantly beloved. Bob’s weaselly insurance boss, the weaseliest boss to ever exist. Superhero Relocation Agent Rick Dicker, shaped and voiced as if you had distilled every Tommy Lee Jones role down to its most concentrated essence. The Parrs’ hapless babysitter. Supervillain second-in-command Mirage. Even freakin’ gag villain Bomb Voyage — I bet you can picture every one of them. And is there a secondary character more instantly iconic than Edna Mode?</p>
<p id="LKMyRN">And to boot: this collection of memorable character designs, all in the first Pixar film in which the company attempted to present human figures as the leads. It’s nothing short of — well, you can guess. —<em>SP </em></p>

Takumi is part of a group of students at the school who must defend it against monsters in grid-based strategy encounters for 100 days. The academy is apparently very secretive and you will lose classmates over the course of the game, which is not surprising considering this game is from the creators of the Danganronpa series. In the Danganronpa games, the mortality of nearly every character is always on the line.</p>

While collections focusing on series like Street Fighter and Darkstalkers have proven popular, today's announcement might be the most anticipated collection Capcom can put out, as it is bringing back seven of its beloved Marvel-focused games in one package.</p>

<p>Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics is a bundle headlined by the iconic Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, but six other titles join the collection, dating back to 1994's X-Men: Children of the Atom. The full collection includes X-Men: Children of the Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes, Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes, Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, and side-scrolling beat-'em-up The Punisher.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ark-survival-ascended-crossover-makes-me-yearn-for-a-big-power-rangers/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ark-survival-ascended-crossover-makes-me-yearn-for-a-big-power-rangers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Did you know that <em>Ark: Survival Ascended</em>, a game all about surviving on a prehistoric island inhabited by dinosaurs, has added <em>Power Rangers</em>-themed content of all things? I didn’t until I woke up this morning, and it may just be the most bizarre gaming crossover of 2024.</p> <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">I suppose it does make some sense since the crossover is specifically with the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers team, whose giant Zords took the form of prehistoric creatures, like a tyrannosaurus rex and a saber-toothed tiger. It’s also a mod that’s <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/ark-survival-ascended/mods/mighty-morphin-cosmetic-pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">completely free to download</a>, letting you dress your character up as one of the five original Rangers, complete with unique animations, and there are even optional skins for your weapons and specific dinosaurs, turning them into the Dinozords. Sadly, the Green Ranger and his Dragonzord are absent.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="ARK x Power Rangers" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f8JH-E9Cprg?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">The image of roaming around the world with these giant robot dinosaurs while dressed as a Power Ranger is admittedly amusing, but watching the above trailer only makes me think there’s untapped potential in a big budget <em>Power Rangers</em> game. Imagine getting to run around Angel Grove fighting monsters with fun fighting moves and over-the-top weaponry. Then hopping into your Zord or the Megazord itself for large-scale monster battles.</p>
 <p data-characters="671" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">It wouldn’t even need to be open world; I’d happily take something more linear or mission-based so long as it had a lot of cool flair and tight combat. In my head, I’m picturing something akin to PlatinumGames’ sorely underappreciated <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-transformers-devastation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformers Devastation</a></em> (if you know, you know). In fact, Platinum’s expertise with action games makes it a perfect fit for the series. It even made <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-wonderful-101-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wonderful 101</a></em>, which drew a lot of influence from Japanese superhero media like <em>Super Sentai</em>, the source material for <em>Power Rangers</em>. I’m not even that big of a <em>Power Rangers</em> fan, but I’d be all over a PlatinumGames-made <em>Power Rangers</em> title.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">While it may not scratch that exact itch, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-looks-like-a-retro-tastic-good-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</a></em> (which launches later this year) looks like it could be the next best thing. Announced at Summer Game Fest, this retro inspired beat ’em up is one big love letter to the original show, featuring co-op gameplay, some astounding pixel art visuals, and first-person Megazord fights.</p>

<p data-characters="441" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of today’s Nintendo Direct, Square Enix revealed the open RPG <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>, originally released back in 1993, has gotten the full remake treatment. The <em>Romancing SaGa</em> series allows players to forge their own stories as they choose from an arsenal of main characters and expand their legacy, passing down powers and skills with each generation. <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> is headed to Switch on October 24, 2024.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven – Announce Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj_cfyPw9tU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="152" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">Based on the trailer, it looks like <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> features some pretty substantial upgrades both graphically and gameplay-wise.</p>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">In <em>Romancing Saga 2</em> players must oversee a Royal Court, leading an empire to longevity and prosperity by dictating its economy, technology, city construction, and magic. At its core, <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> is about prospering over generations as opposed to focusing on the short term.</p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">This is another one I’ve yet to play, primarily because it was originally released in Japan and I just never got around to playing. It looks like a great time to finally get into it with the <em>Revenge of the Seven</em> remake.</p>
 <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="102" data-injectable="false"><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em> is scheduled to release on Nintendo Switch on October 24, 2024.</p>

		<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay was used to round out the Nintendo Direct, showing the revived first person Metroid Prime series in all its glory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>: Beyond is set to release in 2025 on Nintendo Switch… but could it also come to another console?</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We got to see plenty of Metroid Prime staples, including the morph ball mode, locking onto enemies during combat, and spooky alien environments. The world looks significantly more expansive and filled with life than the last time that we were in the Prime series – to be fair, Metroid Prime 3 was a Nintendo Wii game – and there was a glimpse of some creepy new antagonists with a glowing line up their heads, and with Metroids in tow.</p>
<p>With a 2025 release date now confirmed, this further the speculation that Metroid Prime 4 will be a cross-gen launch game for the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called). Nintendo specifically stayed away from discussing the Nintendo Switch successor during this Nintendo Direct, but has stated that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">they will reveal all sometime this fiscal year</a>. Any 2025 release would see Metroid Prime 4 be in and around the new console’s launch window.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected and was not meeting the company’s high standards in its initial form. As such, they taken the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series with the original Metroid Prime game on GameCube.</p>

<p>While that has slowly but surely come together, there’s been the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023. Both wetted the appetite for more Metroid games for fans, and it’s great to see Metroid Prime 4’s development has come far enough for Nintendo to pin a release date on it. We can’t wait to see more, though.</p>

            <p>
After a long old wait, Nintendo's hugely anticipated sci-fi shooter sequel Metroid Prime 4 has re-surfaced - bringing with it a gorgeous first gameplay trailer, a new 'Beyond' subtitle, and confirmation it's launching next year.
</p>
<p>
Metroid Prime 4 was, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch">first announced</a> all the way back in 2017, almost a decade after the launch of Metroid Prime 3: Corruption on Wii. Nintendo eventually confirmed it was was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-namco-bandai-is-working-on-metroid-prime-4">being developed by Bandai Namco</a> - but 2019 brought the news the project had "not reached the standard" Nintendo sought and was being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-development-rebooted-from-scratch">rebooted from scratch</a>, this time with original Metroid Prime developer Retro Studios at the helm.
</p>
<p>
Since then, updates have been scarce, but now - during an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-right-here-with-us">already treat-packed Nintendo Direct</a> - the long-in-the-works shooter has re-emerged with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMAgmdR8jwU">nearly two minutes of gameplay</a>.
</p>

<p>
Unfolding in the Cosmic Year 20X9 at the Galatic Federation Research Facility (as per the trailer's opening caption), how better to kick things off than with a dramatic entrance from Samus Aran herself? After the toot of a very familiar musical motif, it's straight into the action - Samus blasting and scanning her way across a beautifully desolate alien landscape.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly a thrilling tease, but we'll have to wait a bit longer until it's finally in our hands; Nintendo has confirmed Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will launch for Switch in 2025 - which immediately raises the question, could it be getting a dual-platform launch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">alongside Switch 2</a>?
</p>
<p>
Nintendo, of course, was clear it wouldn't be talking about a Switch successor during today's show, but hopefully we'll learn more about its plans for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - and that fancy helmeted character at the end of the trailer - before excitement overcomes us all.

After Ganon bests Link in battle, Zelda is left to her own devices to battle hordes of monsters that descend upon the game’s take on Hyrule (which seems heavily inspired by 2019’s <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake).</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">series producer Eiji Aonuma</a>, Zelda will navigate and fight through the world somewhat differently in <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>as she wields a magical staff known as the Tri Rod with the assistance of a fairy named Tri. The trailer details how Zelda will be able to use the Tri Rod to create “echoes” of objects and monsters she’s previously encountered and use them to overcome obstacles. </p><div><figcaption><em>You play as Princess Zelda in </em>Echoes of Wisdom<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><div><p>News of the game comes at a rather booming time for the <em>Zelda </em>franchise.

			<p><span>With a release date finally announced during today’s Nintendo Direct, Square-Enix has finally lifted the veil and shown off <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-entire-loto-trilogy/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D</a> for the first time in years in hopes of bringing the Erdrick trilogy to a new generation. While Square-Enix didn’t explicitly come out and say that they had plans for a trilogy during the hands-on preview, they noted that they wanted to start with Dragon Quest III chronologically as it was the first to come in the series. Nintendo spilled the beans during today's Nintendo Direct, announcing that the first two Dragon Quest titles are also getting the HD-2D treatment in 2025.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/02_DRAGON-QUEST-III-HD-2D-Remake.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>Our preview for Dragon Quest III HD-2D opened with a brief greeting by Dragon Quest Creator and Game Designer Yuji Horii and a brief refresher on the series by Producer Masaaki Hayasaka. They spoke briefly on how Dragon Quest III HD-2D is a remake of the <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/games/dragon-quest-iii-seeds-salvation">1988 title Seeds of Salvation</a> and while it is the third numbered title in the series, it’s recommended for new fans to jump in as this takes place the earliest in the series timeline. For the most part, Dragon Quest III HD-2D remains true to the original, with the battle system, storyline, and other fundamental aspects remaining largely intact while introducing many improvements for the modern era.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Later, Hayasaka-san spoke briefly about the changes to how players will experience “a global journey” in Dragon Quest III HD-2D. Many modern conveniences are seamlessly integrated into the core gameplay, from tutorials and the ability to quick-save to mini-maps and destination guides meant to keep players on the right path. Players can also use the Zoom spell of Chimaera Wing to escape dungeons, which was only introduced in later Dragon Quest titles. The team also wanted to touch on how the story has been expanded with additional episodes written with Horii’s blessing but didn’t have the opportunity to tell us what those might be.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/05_DRAGON-QUEST-III-HD-2D-Remake.png"></a></figure>

<p><span>As the series approaches its 40th anniversary (Dragon Quest originally debuted in Japan in 1986), Armor Project wanted to introduce fans to the beginning of the Erdrick Trilogy by telling the tale of Ortega, the hero who failed in his quest to defeat the evil Baramos, and his child called forth on their 16th birthday to take up the mantle and finish what his father had started. Our hands-on session opened up roughly 30-60 minutes after the opening credits, where the playable hero had gathered up three party members and ventured out for their first steps. For the hour or so that I had time to spend with Dragon Quest III HD-2D, this gave me just enough time to venture from the town of Aliahan, explore the Dreamer’s Tower, acquire the Thief Key and Wrecking Ball, and finally leave the starting region and venture out into the world proper.</span></p>
<p><span>For fans who want to adjust their challenge from the default difficulty, Dragon Quest III HD-2D offers two optional difficulty modes. Dracky Quest is the mode for players who simply want to explore the story without engaging too deeply with the combat mechanics. The party will never be wiped out, no matter the damage taken, while also dealing more damage to bosses. Some bosses will no longer automatically heal at the start of their turn. Draconian Quest, on the other hand, flips the script and makes all of the various aspects of Dragon Quest III HD-2D more challenging. Bosses have more HP overall, and the Hero’s party all deal less damage when exploiting weaknesses, while enemies also deal more damage back to the party. EXP and gold rewards are also reduced to prevent players from simply grinding their way through the story.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Combat remains largely the same. The main changes are a redesigned UI and the ability to adjust the battle speed to expedite combat while introducing new animations for the various spells and abilities. Players can also set up Tactics and customize the auto-battle setting for each party member. Beyond that, it’s traditional Dragon Quest combat, with players selecting their moves from a menu and watching each turn play out against foes of various species.</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed subtle changes here and there to the items that players will acquire in their journey across Aliahan and beyond. In the Dreamers Tower, where players might find a Mini Medal, is instead replaced by a Boomerang, another weapon type that was introduced in later remakes of Dragon Quest III. Players will still collect a variety of Mini Medals and turn them in to Morgan Minimann in the town of Aliahan’s well, but they won’t be able to use the same GameFAQs guide to seek them all out. Other less prominent changes were seen in some of the existing items, like the Girl’s Own Annual book that can be used to change a character’s personality turns characters into a Tear-Away rather than a Tomboy.</span></p>

<p><span>Square-Enix asked that we hold our tongue until the news was ready to go out, but as players have heard during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HorTUKvj0K8">Nintendo Direct</a>, Dragon Quest III HD-2D on November 14, 2024 in North America and will be available on PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. No Xbox One or PlayStation 4 versions have been announced. Dragon Quest I+II HD-2D will also be coming at a later time in 2025, completing the Erdrick trilogy.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-finally-gives-zelda-her-starring-role-this-year.904659/</guid>

			<p>For much of the franchise’s history, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda</a> has come in two flavors – 3D and 2D. Unfortunately, fans of 2D Zelda have largely been out in the cold in recent years, with the 2019 Switch remake of The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening being the only bone Nintendo’s given them. That game was good, but it wasn’t enough to fully satisfy.</p>
<p>Well, good news 2D Zelda fans – at the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom was announced. Perhaps even more exciting, is that this game finally, <em>finally</em> gives Zelda herself a starring role. It seems Hyrule has been beset with dark rifts that have sucked in various residents of the land, including Link, so it’s up to Zelda to save the day.</p>
<p>The open-ended nature of recent Zeldas will be preserved here, as Zelda’s abilities revolve around the “Tri-Rod,” a device that allows her to replicate various items she comes across. So, she can, for example, replicate boxes in order to get up on cliffs and past barriers. She also has the ability to replicate enemies, who will fight for her once summoned. You can check out the first trailer for The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking pretty creative! I like that Zelda's first game isn't just a carbon copy of Link's adventures, with seemingly a greater focus on puzzle solving. Here's Nintendo's official description for the game.</p>
<p><em>"It’s up to Zelda and her wisdom to save the kingdom of Hyrule in a brand-new story in&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda series. The people of Hyrule are being stolen away by strange rifts that have appeared, with a certain swordsman among the missing. Team up with the mysterious fairy, Tri, and use the power of the Tri Rod to create echoes – imitations of things found in the environment. Then recreate those echoes whenever you like to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Use echoes of water blocks to reach new heights, make bridges out of old beds, throw rocks at foes – or find your own creative combination of echoes to do things your way. You can even create echoes of monsters to fight at your side in combat."</em></p>
<p>Nintendo will also be releasing a special Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom themed Switch Lite model alongside the game. Here's a peek at that...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is coming to Nintendo Switch on September 26.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-preview-start-of-new-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the excellent <em>Octopath Traveler </em>to the highly tactical and addicting <em>Triangle Strategy</em>, Team Asano might just be the most consistent team at Square Enix. And now, with the studio's downright gorgeous signature HD-2D style for<em> Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, </em>the series has the opportunity to reach a broader audience than it ever has before.</p>
<p>I'm in the camp of "never having played <em>Dragon Quest</em> before," but by all indications, this is a remake meant for both longtime fans, as well as curious newcomers. With the opportunity to play <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>, I can, hopefully, offer a valuable perspective. One thing is certain, though: We have another hit in the making.</p>


<p>As a newcomer, <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is the perfect starting place; the original three games are a trilogy, and chronologically, this is the beginning of it all. Rest assured, if you're worried about getting lost with the story, that shouldn't be a problem with this entry.</p>
<p>My demo starts right near the beginning of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> -- my party is fresh and unleveled. I was given some backdrop to the story, and so we play as a 16-year-old son of a hero setting out to right the failure of his father, Ortega. Ortega failed to defeat Archfiend Baramos, so one can assume that is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>We begin in the town of Aliahan, and quickly venture out into the vast, open grasslands. My immediate surroundings are expansive and empty, though this is clearly by design. As I venture from Aliahan to my next destination, Reeve, the way forward is frequently interrupted by random encounters of various enemies, like <em>Dragon Quest</em>'s signature slimes, and more.</p>
<p>The feeling of "retro" is immediate to me. The development team clearly spent an untold amount of hours crafting a beautiful world, but the intent to stay faithful to the old-school style of the original is evident in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> <em>Remake</em>. This is proven in its minimalist, black-and-white UI as well as nostalgic sound effects, even if it's not a 1:1 comparison to the original.</p>

<p>The combat, however, is where that retro style really comes through. The turn-based combat in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is undeniably less involved than<em> </em>turn-based strategy games that came after it, but it's no less fun. You'll dole out commands to your party, and they will act accordingly -- simple as that.</p>
<p>This can feel a bit drawn out at times if you're commanding each party member individually, but if you prefer, you can set your party AI to act according to a rule-set through the "tactics" menu. The AI seemed pretty smart no matter what option I chose, so having a specific tactic set is likely a good choice for beginners while they get the hang of things. You might even be able to rely on it for the whole game.</p>
<p>Other than that, we can now speed up gameplay, which is a most welcome feature, indeed. Old-school RPGs tend to suffer from slow and cumbersome combat, but that is alleviated with the fast-forward function. That, along with the tactics menu, are but two of many promised quality-of-life features we can expect from <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake. </em>In short, battles are quick and unobtrusive.</p>

<h2>Good ol' Dungeon Crawling in <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></h2>
<p>I soon reached the next town, and once again found very traditional and grounded JRPG mechanics. I bought some new gear with my now slightly higher level party, explored a bit, and found my next destination was a tower on the eastern side of the map. The map, by the way, is a handy tool and it's impossible to get lost with it, if you were ever worried about what to do next.</p>
<p>The town had a church, and this serves as a point to save your progress; however, one new feature is the ability to "remember." This essentially works as another save, so you can now save your progress anywhere in the world without having to worry about where the next church is. I used this to great effect in the tower, since unforgiving nature of an old JRPG was very much present.</p>
<p>The tower was a surprisingly complex dungeon with a undeniable old-school charm. Because of my limited time, I bee-lined to the top of the tower, but I could have explored quite a bit of it. No doubt, going down the many different pathways would lead to treasure, and I can't wait to explore more of it. A handy map helped guide my way efficiently through the dungeon, so once again, I never felt lost.</p>

<h2><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>is Another Artistic Masterpiece</h2>
<p>The HD-2D style uses gorgeous pixel sprites combined with high quality textures and environments. For <em>Octopath Traveler</em>, you have this sparkly, polished feel to everything, giving it an identity distinguishable from, say, <em>Live a Live</em>. <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> still makes wonderful use of this style, but does so in a way that's extremely faithful to the original style.</p>
<p>The late Akira Toriyama's influence is evident, even in this HD-2D rendition of his work. Pixel sprites of characters have an immediately recognizable look, so the unique identities of characters and even NPCs are expressed wonderfully. Monster sprites are simply outstanding, giving us a brand new and improved look for slimes, monstrous crows, evil toads, and more.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the most enjoyable aspects of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> is seeing the new monster designs and their animations. It's clearly reminiscent of the old-school <em>Dragon Quest</em> style fans are familiar with, but with that bit of extra polish to really elevate this remake.</p>

<p>The overworld is this bright and lush green within the grasslands, evoking more of an anime aesthetic than other HD-2D games. Towns and dungeons are crafted to utter perfection, the latter of which making great use of shadows and lighting to create an immersive dungeon-diving adventure. As another modern touch-up, some (not all) NPCs also have voice-acting.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> might not be the most complex JRPG, but it is one of the most promising. The way it streamlines combat to make it faster and more accessible is sure to please newcomers such as myself, and graphically, it's second-to-none. In a year full of incredible RPGs, we can expect <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em> to join in as one of the best come November 14.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-a-funner-animal-crossing.904653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/hello-kitty-island-adventure-switch-preview-funner-animal-crossing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No other brands come to mind as a better fit for an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like than Hello Kitty and the whole Sanrio gang. I don't have Apple Arcade, so this was my first time trying <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>. It was utterly delightful.</p>
<p>I'll be honest with you, I took the appointment to check out <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> more as a curiosity than anything else. It's not a property I am all that personally close to, nor am I the biggest <em>Animal Crossing </em>person.</p>
<p>But, my mother has collected Hello Kitty related objects since the late 70s, having been based in the Philippines and making trips to Japan. So, Hello Kitty has been ever-present in my periphery my whole life.</p>
<p>I am very happy that I took the time to see what <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> is all about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a lot that is appealing about <em>Animal Crossing</em>, but there is so much faff that's not then buoyed by some interesting characters or folks to chat with. They're all <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/animal-crossing-new-horizons-best-worst-normal-villagers">pretty</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/animal-crossing-new-horizons-best-worst-snooty-villagers">one</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/best-worst-lazy-villagers-animal-crossing-new-horizons">note</a> and the gameplay gets too repetitive too quickly.</p>
<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> solves all those issues I personally have with <em>Animal Crossing</em>. The characters have more depth, allowing you to get to know them personally a whole lot more. They're often involved in their own little arcs and stories, and they all know each other pretty well and reference one another frequently.</p>
<p>In other words, there's a real communal aspect to the game full of characters that genuinely feel like real friends.</p>
<p>Beyond just the characters, there's quite a bit to do in <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure </em>as well. You can cook, fish, brew potions, collect critters, give gifts, decorate homes, and all the usual sort of things you'd expect in an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like game.</p>
<p>However, there's some more "traditional" gameplay to stumble on as well, like puzzles, timed challenges, and so on. An overarching part of the game will see you trying to figure out the mystery of the Island, which will help unlock more areas. New areas have more to explore, new characters to find, and all sorts of secrets.</p>

<p>All around there is a delightful little tale or morsel of gameplay to take part in that goes beyond the normal fetch quest. It is endless charm and delight. So much so that I was only scheduled to play for 30 or so minutes but stayed much longer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't have the chance to check it out, but <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> has multiplayer mode as well. You can invite friends to your island and do whatever you want. They even get their own cabin to decorate as well.</p>
<p>The game was a pretty big hit when it first released on Apple Arcade, so the fact that it remains a good time is not much of a surprise. It's a perfect pairing for the Nintendo Switch, but it wasn't all perfect.</p>
<p>Performance on the Switch was pretty poor. From framerate issues to really long load times, it was definitely not in its final form. However, developer Sunblink has a lot of time to get everything in shape before the game launches on other platforms next year.</p>

<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> will appeal to<em> Animal Crossing </em>fans, and if you're like me, it may appeal to those that aren't really. It is not just a reskin, either, offering a lot of its own gameplay. If you're at all a fan of Hello Kitty and friends, I think this is one to keep an eye out for (or play now on Apple Arcade).</p>
<p><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> will release for PC and Nintendo Switch in 2025. It will come to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 at a later date. If you don't want to wait, you can play it via Apple Arcade right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24180971/the-legend-of-zelda-four-swords-perfect-dark-metroid-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Y0ZwQ5">Nintendo announced a small, but mighty list of additions heading to its premium subscription service as part of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch">Nintendo Direct on Tuesday</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Four Swords</em>; <em>Metroid: Zero Mission</em>; <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>; and <em>Perfect Dark </em>are all being released to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22747408/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-faq-price-cancel-guide">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> on Tuesday.</p>
<p id="Dyy54M">Any title on its own would be a formidable addition to the catalog of games offered on the subscription service, but now we get all four. <em>Metroid: Zero Mission </em>is a classic Metroid game and highly regarded as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2019/3/19/18196756/the-best-metroid-games-ranked">one of the best entries in the series</a>. <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em> takes players back to some good prehistoric hunting and exploring on the Nintendo 64. As for <em>Perfect Dark</em>, there couldn’t be a better time to revisit the original given that the reboot just got a big gameplay trailer at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24174838/perfect-dark-release-date-trailer-xbox-initiative-crystal-dynamics">recent Xbox Games Showcase</a> — and the game will have online multiplayer. </p>
<p id="firstHeading">Then, of course, there’s another Zelda game. The standard Nintendo Switch Online already contains the NES version of <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>, but now people will be able to play the quirkier<em> Four Swords</em> addition to the game that came out to the GameBoy Advance in 2002. The best part? This game will also have online multiplayer so now those who didn’t have enough copies of the game (or enough handhelds) as kids might finally be able to revisit and play the classic with friends. </p>
<p id="iBLXKT">An individual subscription to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/22752182/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-best-retro-games">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack</a> costs $49.99 per year or you can also buy a family membership that costs $79.99 per year and can include up to eight users. </p>

  <p id="Uac6UH">After years of anticipation (and a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/25/18197166/metroid-prime-4-delay-reboot-retro-studios-nintendo-switch">major development shakeup</a>), Nintendo gave fans a first look at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/metroid-prime-4/39994"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> during Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Nintendo Direct</a>. The game is now known as <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, and it will come to Switch in 2025, Nintendo said.</p>
<p id="akZi6K">The first trailer for <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> features some actual gameplay, with galactic bounty hunter Samus Aran battling hordes of space pirates, scanning alien environments for clues, and going into ball mode to traverse the environment. It was all classic Metroid stuff, and a tease of a very exciting adventure to come.</p>
<p id="bIzaC9">Metroid fans also got a peek at what appears to be <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>’s villain, a space pirate commander who commands two Metroids as pets. </p>
<p id="PEs8Ry">Nintendo first announced that a new entry in the Metroid Prime series was in the works at E3 2017. At that time, the company only showed a logo for the game, and since then has not provided game details or shown gameplay. At E3 2018, Nintendo did not showcase the game, saying it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2018/6/13/17460856/nintendo-metroid-prime-4-not-at-e3">did not want to repeatedly tease fans</a> until the game was closer to completion. Then, in 2019, Nintendo said it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/25/18197166/metroid-prime-4-delay-reboot-retro-studios-nintendo-switch">rebooting development of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and shifting the project to Retro Studios, the Metroid Prime series’ original developer.</p>
<p id="HzpMQV"><em>Metroid Prime</em><em> 4 </em>marks the return of the popular take on the classic adventure series, which debuted on Nintendo GameCube and was last seen on Wii with 2007’s <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em>.</p>
<p id="rUJkgJ"><em>Metroid</em><em> Prime 3</em>’s follow-up was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/metroid-other-m/12973"><em>Metroid: Other M</em></a>, a Wii game that failed to win over fans of Samus Aran’s intergalactic adventures. Nintendo never made a Metroid game for Wii U, although it released a reimagining of <em>Metroid 2: Samus Returns</em> for Nintendo 3DS in 2017. Samus’ most recent adventure, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22709647/metroid-dread-review-release-date-nintendo-switch-oled"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, was released on Nintendo Switch in October 2021. That was followed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23592880/metroid-prime-remastered-review-nintendo-switch-remake-eshop-dread"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em></a> for Switch in early 2023.</p>

That shouldn’t be too surprising given developer Mistwalker’s team: as mentioned, <em>Final Fantasy </em>series creator Hironbu Sakaguchi produced and wrote the game, while long-time <em>Final Fantasy </em>composer Nobuo Uematsu provided the music. Their involvement alone enough to get gamers excited, and&nbsp;<em>Fantasian </em>does have a certain quality about it that makes it feel like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in everything but name. Honestly, you could put <em>Fantasian </em>next to Mistwalker’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lost-odyssey-is-a-moving-story-about-immortality-memor-1840422305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lost-odyssey-is-a-moving-story-about-immortality-memor-1840422305"><em>Lost Odyssey</em></a></span>, <em>The Last Story</em>, and <em>Blue Dragon</em> and have yourself a little off-brand <em>Final Fantasy</em> collection. </p><p>But beyond creator pedigree, <em>Fantasian </em>offers something fresh to the formula. The most stunning part of the game is its unique visual aesthetic. As an homage to the pre-rendered environments of old-school RPGS,<em> Fantasian</em>’s environments were made with real-world dioramas. It gives the game world a dreamlike texture and feel when the computer-rendered enemies and characters wander around. Mechanically, the big gimmick of <em>Fantasian </em>is its&nbsp;slightly tweaked traditional turn-based combat. Characters can cast spells or launch attacks at single enemies, but if you curve the path of an attack with the touchscreen, you could attack multiple enemies. </p><p>One of my favorite features in <em>Fantasian </em>is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creators-new-jrpg-lets-you-procrastinate-1846391047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-creators-new-jrpg-lets-you-procrastinate-1846391047">Dimengeon</a></span>, which addresses the annoyance of grinding and random encounters. When exploring the world, you can trap encountered enemies in the Dimengeon and continue exploring without fighting. Once the Dimengeon is full you then commence one long battle against all the enemies you have trapped. It’s a neat system that lets players have more freedom and choice in their exploration. </p><p>While all of the visual and mechanical features of <em>Fantasian </em>feel like inventive iterations of classic RPGs, the narrative isn’t much to write home about. You are an amnesiac protagonist sent to save the world and everything goes about as you’d expect. But for those who are tired of replaying all the classics and want a taste of something new, <em>Fantasian</em>’s dazzling environments and inventive combat make it a delightful adventure. I can’t wait for more people to play it when it launches this Holiday season on Nintendo Switch.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still in the chibi art style of the 2019 remake of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, it looks like a puzzle-centric game where Zelda uses a magic wand to clone objects and enemies in the environment. In addition to the overworld map there are also side-scrolling areas. </p><p>Take a look:</p><p>Link appears to get engulfed by a purple chasm early in the game, with Zelda looking for clues about where to find him and bring him back to Hyrule. Pig Ganon is also back to cause trouble. I wonder if Zelda will get to duke it out with him in the final boss fight or if that will be when Link returns to the stage to deliver the final blow as he’s done in every other<em> Zelda </em>game over the last 30 years. </p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how long <em>Echoes Of Wisdom</em> is and if it ends up feeling like the mainline adventure the Hyrule princess has deserved. Fortunately, Nintendo seems to go hard on all of its Zelda games, whether they’re open-world adventures or top-down dungeon crawlers. <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds</em> for the 3DS is still one of the best games the company’s ever released. </p><p>Arriving in September, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>will kick-off what seems to be another low-key stacked year for the end of the Switch’s lifespan. While the reveal of the Switch 2 is expected in the months ahead, today’s Nintendo Direct showed the second half of 2024 is shaping up to be another strong one for the handheld hybrid. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looks like she’ll still be scanning, shooting, and rolling into a ball to get into tight spaces. Check out the trailer below:</p><p>The last time we saw a proper new entry in the <em>Metroid Prime</em> franchise was—get ready—2007. That was the release of <em>Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</em> on the beloved Wii. Since then we’ve had re-releases and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313">remasters</a></span>, and we all agree we don’t talk about 2016's <em>Metroid Prime: Federation Force.</em> But now, some 17 years later, we get some proof of life for Samus’s first-person adventuring.</p><p>The game was originally being developed by series producer Kensuke Tanabe and a new team seemingly involving Bandai Namco, rather than the series stalwarts, Retro Games. However, in 2019, Nintendo’s Shinya Takahashi described their progress as “very challenged,” and that development would start all over again, this time involving Retro.</p><p>At the time, Takahashi said that “it will be a long road until the next time we will be able to update you on the development progress,” adding that “development time will be extensive,” although presumably no one was imagining he meant another <em>five years</em>. But that’s how long it’s been since any further information was given.</p><p>But the cogs have been turning on the franchise, not least with last year’s release of a Switch remastering of the first game, alongside the hugely popular 2D platformer <em>Metroid: Dread</em>. There’s no doubt that people want to play <em>Metroid</em> as much now as ever, and the <em>Prime</em> branch of Samus’ adventures has lost none of its fervent appeal despite people born when the last game came out now being able to drive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has finally taken the cover off Metroid Prime 4, revealing Metroid Prime 4 Beyond with a release date of 2025.</p>



<p>The reveal came at the end of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s Nintendo Direct event</a> on Tuesday. </p>



<p>“The galaxy’s greatest bounty hunter Samus Aran will embark on a new mission.&nbsp;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, a new entry in the&nbsp;Metroid Prime&nbsp;series, is coming to Nintendo Switch in 2025,” Nintendo’s press release said.</p>



<p>Like past Metroid Prime games, the new game will also be from a first-person perspective. The reveal also came with nearly two full minutes of gameplay, showing the type of gameplay Metroid Prime fans have come to expect from the series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>First announced in 2017, Metroid Prime 4 Beyond has gone nearly the entire Nintendo Switch lifespan before its release. In 2019, it was confirmed that the game’s development had been restarted. Based on the timing of the new release date, it could be assumed that the game will also be available on Nintendo’s Switch successor console. </p>

<p>What do you think of the first look at Metroid Prime 4 Beyond? Do you think the game sticks to its 2025 release date? </p>

It is dubbed Fantasian: Neo Dimension and it's the latest game from developer Mistwalker, which is led by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. Fantasian is a full-fledged story-driven RPG with turn-based combat and features music from longtime Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu.</p><p>One of the unique things about Fantasian is that its environments were initially conceptualized physical diorama before being made for the game. It features unique combat mechanics that have you account for enemy positioning and the space around combat arenas. There's also a smart implementation on how to handle random encounters, which lets you essentially stock up on random encounters and take care of them in one fell swoop, mitigating interuptions in exploration. Fantasian: Neo Dimension will launch on PlayStation and Xbox consoles and PC via Steam as well, and will feature significant visual upgrades. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For all the details, check out our roundup of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">everything announced during the Nintendo Direct</a>.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review.904620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When I gave Elden Ring a 10 two years ago, I did so not just because it’s an incredible game, but because it also raised the bar for open-world games as a whole. The way it encourages exploration, rewards curiosity, and challenges you to find your own individual solutions to difficult combat encounters by including tons of different viable weapons, spells, and other build options is absolutely exemplary. Now, FromSoftware is back to raise the bar on everyone yet again, this time when it comes to what you’d expect from a "simple" DLC. Shadow of the Erdtree may not do anything radically different from the base game, but this expansion somehow feels like a scaled-down version of that same experience that recaptures all of the magic of playing Elden Ring for the first time, with more content packed within than many fully priced games. Its unexpectedly large realm is filled with new secrets, new discoveries, a ton of new build options to experiment with, as well as some of the most challenging and unforgettable boss battles Souls fans will have ever seen. </p><p>I strolled into Shadow of the Erdtree thinking I was some kind of Elden Lord badass, having defeated <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Malenia,_Blade_of_Miquella_Location_and_Guide">Malenia</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Mohg,_Lord_of_Blood_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">Mohg</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Dragonlord_Placidusax">Placidusax</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Elden_Beast">Elden Beast</a>, and every other big threat around. My level 150 character was armed with fully upgraded gear and the maximum number of flasks… but let me tell you, it did not take very long for the Realm of Shadow to humble me. Even though the only requirement to access the new areas is to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Starscourge_Radahn_Location_and_Boss_Fight_Guide">beat Radahn</a> and Mohg – which, granted, is no small feat – you’re going to want to over prepare before stepping foot into this new arena, because it is <em>brutal</em>. FromSoftware definitely skirts the line between fair and unfair with some of the later boss designs in particular, perhaps getting closer than ever. But crucially, it never actually crosses that threshold, and that masterful tightrope walk – along with some truly spectacular boss design – results in some of the most thrilling and satisfying bosses Elden Ring, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-soulslike-games">the entire Soulslike genre</a>, has to offer. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It’s not just the quality of those fights, either: Erdtree has them in quantity, too. According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses, with 10 of those being the big, showstopper fights that reward you with a Remembrance upon defeat. Compare that to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Boss_Guides">more than 100 in the base game</a>, and it’s a significant chunk.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>According to our count, there are more than 40 bosses.</p></div><p>When you <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prepare-for-erdtree-elden-ring-interactive-map">bring up the map</a>, it may not seem like The Realm of Shadow is that big, but it is incredibly dense because it’s stacked in layers. Paths lead upwards toward ruins suspended in the sky, others delve deep beneath the surface, and some even pull you in directions you might not have believed you could even be pulled. You might find a hidden ladder tucked away in the far corner of a castle rampart, only to follow that trail for an hour before it eventually spills out into a totally new, otherwise-inaccessible area.</p><p>But even with all of the discoveries to be made, I never felt lost or unsure of where I could or should go next. The main goal of this DLC is to follow the footsteps of the demigod <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Miquella's_Haligtree_Location_and_Walkthrough">Miquella</a>, who left his flesh behind and fled to the Realm of Shadow. These footsteps are marked by large crosses that elegantly serve as subtle signposts to let you know when you’re in the vicinity of a plot-critical path, without it ever feeling like your hand is being held as you’re nudged in one explicit direction. </p><p>Apart from the main quest, there’s a whole host of new NPCs, including seven followers of Miquella that you’ll encounter at various points in the journey. Each of them have their own small questline that ties into the main story, and those can even have an effect on some of the latter boss battles, depending on your actions. And while I consider myself a fairly casual enjoyer of Elden Ring’s extensive lore compared to some of the scholars out there, even my limited knowledge of the deeper plot let me appreciate some pretty fantastic, eye-opening revelations towards the end of this story that are well worth the effort of getting to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature.</p></div><p>It took me about 25 hours or so to beat the final boss of Shadow of the Erdtree, but I could easily see myself putting in another 15 or 20 on just this one playthrough. I still have a handful of optional bosses I need to go back and cross off my list, areas on my map I haven’t fully explored, weapons and skills I haven’t gotten to play around with yet, and sidequests I still want to follow to completion. That’s pretty much exactly like when I completed my review of the base game after about 80 hours, which makes sense because Shadow of the Erdtree is essentially a full Elden Ring adventure made miniature. It condenses the whole experience down to something comparatively compact, all of it satisfyingly tuned specifically for end-game characters who thought they’d seen it all.</p><h2><strong>Weapons of Choice</strong></h2><p>While I haven’t had any “holy ****” moments of awe like the first time I took the elevator down to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Siofra_River">Siofra River</a>, exploration and discovery throughout the Realm of Shadow is still a delight thanks to its stellar art design, a great variety in the areas you get to explore, and the tantalizing rewards pretty much everywhere you turn. There are <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types">eight brand-new weapon types</a>, ranging from <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Throwing_Weapons">throwing knives</a> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Beast_Claws">beast claws</a> to giant odachi <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Great_Katanas">samurai swords</a>. My favorite of the new arsenal, though, is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_New_Weapon_Types#Light_Greatswords">light greatsword</a>, specifically the Milady. True to its name, the Milady has a very regal-looking moveset with combos that flow nicely into each other and hit hard, but are also relatively fast compared to actual greatswords. For me, it’s a sweet spot. I actually swapped off of my powerful dual <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Bandit's_Curved_Sword">Bandit Curved Sword</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-bleed-build-guide">bleed build</a> (albeit, minus the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/White_Mask">White Mask</a>, which I ruined my chance to get) to instead rock a Strength/Dexterity-focused build using one of these and found great success for the majority of the DLC.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Mitchell's Favorite Soulslikes</h3><p>My 15 favorite soulslike games, ranked. </p></div><p>I experimented with a couple of other weapons as well, something that is possible thanks to the ample opportunities to collect a bunch more <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Ancient_Dragon_Smithing_Stone">Ancient Dragon Smithing Stones</a> of both the standard and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Somber_Ancient_Dragon_Smithing_Stone">Somber</a> varieties. However, in all my travels I found that while the new weapon types are fun – there’s certainly an appeal to going hand-to-hand against an army of hands – none of them ultimately measured up to the strength of the weapons that I carried over from the base game. It’s totally possible that there are some <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Talismans">talismans</a> I was missing to really make the new ones sing, but I was hoping to go through the entirety of Erdtree with a brand-new build. Instead, I found myself swapping back to my bread-and-butter bleed build to get the kind of damage I needed when the going got tough – but hey, that build did have two years to get optimized through the original endgame.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are so many promising new builds that I couldn't help but wish Larval Tears were more plentiful.</p></div><p>Besides, variety is the spice of life, and Erdtree is one hot dish. Not only are there a ton of new weapons, there are also plenty of new spells, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Weapon_Skills_-_Ashes_of_War">Ashes of War</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/List_of_Summonable_Spirit_Ashes">Spirit Ash summons</a>, and talismans to cover an enormous range of different playstyles. There’s now a talisman that enhances two-handed attacks; one that decreases spellcasting time dramatically, but causes you to take increased damage; another that increases the damage of abilities that involve stances; and another still that increases your damage every time you defeat an enemy. Yes, there are also plenty that are just better versions of very useful talismans you probably already have, and there’s no shame in sticking to what works. There are so many promising new builds that I couldn’t help but wish <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Larval_Tear">Larval Tears</a> were more plentiful so I could respec my character a little more freely, as I started to run out by the time I finished Erdtree’s campaign. I still have a ton of different builds I want to try, and I’m already happily onto my second playthrough to see them. </p><h2><strong>The Joy of Freedom</strong></h2><p>The journey through The Realm of Shadow is structured very similarly to <a href="https://www.ign.com/maps/elden-ring/lands-between">The Lands Between</a>, in that the map is split up into a number of different regions. Right from the get-go, you’re able to head anywhere you want to: you could follow the initial Miquella Cross to the first big “legacy dungeon,” called Belurat, and deal with the new horrific scorpion enemies; or head across a bridge to the east and work your way over to the magic filled Castle Ensis where you have to deal with this jerk (where you have go up against one of the most challenging bosses of the DLC right away), or find a way to bypass the need to go through either of those and get straight to the Scadu Altus, which largely serves as the central hub of the Realm of Shadow. Then you could head directly toward the Shadow Keep fighting your way to the top of it in order to take on one of the major bosses, or going through one of its other exits to explore otherwise inaccessible parts of the map. It’s a liberating sense of freedom, and the same masterclass level of open-world design as the base game, just on a scale that isn’t quite so vast. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, whether or not you <em>should</em> make a mad dash towards the Shadow Keep is another question entirely. Even though this is endgame content and you probably won’t be leveling up quite as fast as you did in the original campaign, there’s a separate power-scaling system that only works while you’re within the Realm of Shadow. Scattered throughout the lands are Scadutree Fragments that you can collect and turn in at <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Site_of_Grace">Sites of Grace</a> to increase your overall damage and resistances. Likewise, you can also find Revered Spirit Ash blessings to increase the damage and survivability of your Spirit Ash Summons. These are two very smart inclusions as they add a much-needed sense of progression, a valuable reward for exploration, and something else to hunt for if you’re getting wrecked by a boss and need to come back when you’re stronger – all while cleverly preserving some of the original endgame’s balance if you’re bravely tackling this DLC before circling back to beat it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>FromSoftware says Shadow of the Erdtree is the only expansion Elden Ring will get, so it’s fortunate that it’s hard to imagine a better DLC than this – as long as you’re not hoping for it to do anything radically outside the box. Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself. Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
