		<p>Blizzard Entertainment has announced that BlizzCon will be back in 2026, with the weekend of September 12th and September 13th selected as the date of its return. It will be taking place in Anaheim, California. BlizzCon did not take place in 2024, and nor will it take place this year either. Obviously, it is a bit too far out to speculate on what to expect but World of Warcraft will likely be a central focus.</p>
<p><iframe title="BlizzCon | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JrMT3bgU-fs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Blizzard Entertainment said, <em>“One of our favorite traditions, BlizzCon brings us together over our shared passion for Blizzard’s universes, but at its heart, BlizzCon has always been about so much more. It’s about you, the communities you are a part of, and gives us the chance to connect, build friendships, and create unforgettable memories together. We’ve come a long way since our first event in 2005. Over the past nearly 20 years since its inception, BlizzCon has inspired us to innovate, push the boundaries of creativity, and deliver once-in-a-lifetime moments. It’s important that we put on an event worthy of our community. For 2026, alongside BlizzCon staples like Opening Ceremony, in-depth panels, the Darkmoon Faire, friendly competition, hands-on gameplay, and more, we aim to meaningfully elevate this iconic celebration and create an unforgettable experience for all who take part in it. We are building this event just like we build our games: with a deep commitment to our players, with respect for your connections to our universes, and as a celebration of the strength of the bonds formed through shared adventure.”</em></p>
<p>BlizzCon 2026 tickets are not on sale but you can head to the official <a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-gb">BlizzCon website</a> and sign up for updates on what to expect, and get notified for tickets.</p>

And based on how fast past crossovers have sold, these <em>SpongeBob MTG </em>cards will likely sell out in minutes and be sold on eBay and other sites for a pretty penny.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fragpunk-player-count-how-many-people-are-playing-fragpunk-in-2025.1131588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-current-player-count/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>FragPunk is a fresh tactical hero shooter with a unique twist, and the debut title from Bad Guitar Studio is already attracting a steadily growing player count in 2025.</p>



<p>There’s certainly no shortage of live-service online multiplayer titles, and in recent years there’s been an increase in tactical shooters and hero shooters. FragPunk falls under both categories, so how well is it doing in attracting players? The game only just released on March 6th, but the early results for FragPunk are pretty positive.</p>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-player-count-march-2025">FragPunk Player Count (March 2025)</h2>



<p>FragPunk’s player count peaked at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2943650/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">113,946 players on Steam</a> during the game’s opening weekend. In the game’s first three full days, FragPunk reached a new peak each day: 63,958 players on March 7th, 85,203 on March 8th, and 113,946 on March 9th. Almost more impressively, FragPunk drew a player peak of over 100,000 players on March 10th on a Monday.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, the numbers for FragPunk are only for PC players on Steam. Just before the game’s PC launch, the devs announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fragpunk-console-release-latest-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the console versions for PS5 and Xbox had been delayed</a> due to “unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation.” The console release for FragPunk has now been pushed back to an undetermined date.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-fragpunk-worth-playing">Is FragPunk Worth Playing?</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play game trying something new in the hero/tactical shooter space, FragPunk is certainly worth trying and playing in 2025.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What sets FragPunk apart from other shooters in the genre is its reliance on Shard Cards. In the game’s standard mode reminiscent of CS2, VALORANT, and Call of Duty’s Search &amp; Destroy mode, the attacking team attempts to plant a Converter at a site while the other team defends. Players earn Shard points, and a team can use those points on Shard Cards in between rounds for unique buffs and effects. There are 169 different Shard Cards, each with its own unique effect. These effects range from basic movement or damage buffs to a “Turtleback” that blocks bullets from behind, or a snow effect that lets players slide around the map.</p>



<p>For the collector types, there are weapon skins, Lancer skins, stickers, and emotes to collect.</p>

			<p>The whole wide world is talking about this topic: <a href="https://wccftech.com/president-trump-outlines-25-chip-tariffs-as-taiwan-chip-companies-start-plans-to-shift-production-to-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US tariffs</a>. President Donald Trump certainly made some controversial decisions in his first few weeks back in the Oval Office, to say the least. Here, we'll focus on the impact of these tariffs on the gaming world. Historically, hardware manufacturers have tried to shield customers from such state-imposed taxes, although that might not be possible in the same way this time around.</p>
<p>Moreover, as pointed out by analysts like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ljkknpfsa22x" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Circana's Mat Piscatella</a>, this round of tariffs could spell the death of the already ailing retail market for videogames. To help us navigate through this complex topic, we requested a comment from our friend Rhys Elliott, <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/analyst/rhys-elliott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analyst at MIDiA Research</a>, who shared a long and thorough response with Wccftech, outlining how customers will be the ones to suffer.</p>
<p><em>The US tariffs will impact the games market in various ways. Hardware will, of course, be affected, as many components are made in China, one of the key targets of the tariffs. Already, GPU manufacturers like Newegg have announced price hikes for the 50 series NVIDIA GPUs as a direct result of increased tariffs on components made in China. That said, most of those GPUs sold out nonetheless (and scalpers are charging even more than even the marked-up original prices). So the immediate impact in this case has been low. However, further into the future, as inventory of GPUs, smartphones, and other consumer electronics in the US run out, the impact will be felt more widely.</em></p>
<p><em>According to Trump, the US tariffs will result in "a much stronger, much richer nation". However, this is just populist politics in action, as tariffs will actually result in a weaker, poorer nation. Counter to the US administration’s public reasoning for the tariffs, it is ultimately average consumers who will face the brunt of these populist policies.</em></p>
<p><em>Some manufacturers will likely shift their manufacturing to non-tariff-impacted markets as a result, which is already happening, but this is only really possible for the biggest companies that have scale enough to eat the lower profit margins. In most cases, smaller companies – and even some bigger ones relying solely on hardware – cannot afford to do this. However, hardware is sometimes simply a trojan horse for companies to generate software. Manufacturers of some hardware, like the Steam Deck, sell their hardware at a loss, while others barely break even. For that reason, companies like Sony (for its PS5s) and Valve (for its Steam Decks) might simply eat the increased costs caused by the tariffs, as they don’t want to limit their total addressable markets for selling more software.</em></p>
<p><em>As many game discs sold in the US are made in Mexico, another target of the tariffs, physical media will also be impacted. As mentioned by Mat Piscatella on BlueSky, some publishers will ultimately forgo physical versions of their games. But this is just speeding up the inevitable. And most publishers and platform holders on console want physical to die anyway. </em></p>
<p><em>The console market is already moving increasingly towards digital, driven further by strategies like multi-game subscriptions, free-to-play’s rise, and platform holders pushing consumers to digital versions via perks (like extra cosmetics and the ability to pre-load a game so it’s instantly ready to play at launch). Of course, one unique value proposition of physical games is the preowned and rental markets, giving players more choice. But platform holders and publishers do not gain revenues from physical renting and resales. After all, a game could be sold on the reseller market 100 times or rented 100 times, but the publisher and platform holder only capture revenues from that first sale. A digital-only market means publishers and platform holders have more control over prices, too. Price in the physical games market is more elastic vs. digital and is, therefore, more beholden to supply and demand, which is why (pre-owned) physical games are often cheaper than titles found on the PlayStation’s and Xbox’s digital stores.</em></p>
<p><em>The death of physical games would ultimately be bad for consumers, giving them less choice, but positive for publishers. And the introduction of these extreme tariffs will also be bad for consumers, but will be positive for the US administration’s populist façade. Policies that lead to higher prices for everyday people amid a cost-of-living crisis are deplorable. What’s more, time and time again, data has shown that tariffs harm the economy. </em></p>
<p><em>Simply put, tariffs are bad for gamers and the games business. While I won’t comment on the real reason for the US tariffs, it is certainly not for "a much stronger, much richer nation" – in terms of everyday people and fair business, anyway.</em></p>
<p>It's not really the best time for such an economic upheaval, either, as the gaming industry is struggling to grow like it used to until just a few years ago. Between that and the ballooning game development budgets, <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studio closures</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studio-visual-arts-reportedly-hit-with-more-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layoffs</a> are a regular occurrence in news coverage. We can only hope cooler heads might prevail and those tariffs won't be as severe as some fear.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-international-crime-syndicate-preview-harry-potter-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't you love it when a game title is straight and to the point? Take, for example, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em>, a game about you playing as a secret agent wizard boy trying to take down a crime syndicate. Who would have guessed?</p>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is a goofy, outrageous, and hilariously jank simulation/adventure Early Access game that takes place within totally not-Hogwarts. Co-developed by the Szymanski brothers (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friendly-neighborhood-review-c-is-for-creepy" rel="nofollow">John and Evan</a>) and published by the third, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/david-szymanski" rel="nofollow">David</a> of <em>Dusk</em> fame, you can expect a zany and unconventional game from these fellas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=UlbKvPCF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=t2S0Nc6Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go on, create chaos!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em>Brings Out the Child in Us</h2>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is quite literally a sandbox. It's like a parent, dropping their kid in the box and telling them to "do stuff." In similar fashion, this game drops players smack dab in the middle of the school courtyard, and it's your job to figure things out from there.</p>

<p>Sure, there is an objective, and that is to investigate a mysterious door, but that's about it. The most important thing to note here is that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy </em>is very much an Early Access game. It takes roughly three or so hours to see everything it has to offer, and your one objective can be completed quite quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=6pOH-qOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=XrZU96ZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully we see more puzzles or secrets involving the use of your spells.</figcaption></figure><p>I was able to get access to this door and open it pretty fast, thereby "completing" all Early Access has to offer, and that's honestly fine- the main source of fun in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> stems from its ridiculousness. It's a game that can be broken by the player with the flick of a hand, and it's intentionally and cleverly designed to be this way.</p>

<p>Physics are absolutely overturned, and you'll probably come across several ways to die without feeling like you did anything wrong. You just have to accept that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> doesn't take itself seriously, and that's the key to letting loose and having fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=NIiPfmeS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=R1D9HyNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game goes for a lower poly style, and it looks wonderful and captures the atmosphere of a wizard school well!</figcaption></figure><h2>Exploring Not-Hogwarts in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em></h2>

<p>The castle itself is inhabited by students, some of whom have their own quirky lines of dialogue. There are various objects to interact with, a plethora of rooms and areas to explore in the castle, and even new spells to discover.</p>

<p>Here's what I love about <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em>: You can just be exploring the castle, and oh look, there's a small missile sitting in the teacher's office. It looked like a toy, so why <em>wouldn't</em> you throw it? And next thing you know, you explode, and your corpse just ragdolls all over the place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=5ZsRPWxo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=NSsX6CP0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I probably shouldn't have stood on the obvious black button.</figcaption></figure><p>That's really the tip of the iceberg, though. There are various deathtraps waiting for you throughout this castle if you're the curious sort, as well as various secrets that make exploration enjoyable. Even though the game isn't all that serious, it captures the vibe of exploring a Hogwarts-like castle pretty damn well, actually.</p>

<p>After all, in the books and movies, Harry Potter and his friends would explore Hogwarts and get into all sorts of trouble. Hidden rooms, deathtraps, and making mischief? That's the <em>Harry Potter</em> books to a tee, and that's what you'll get here, too.</p>

<p>The castle itself isn't that big, yet. It'll get fleshed out during Early Access, as I understand it, so I'm very much looking forward to seeing new areas. There are courtyards, dungeons, a big ol' tower filled with explosives for some reason, and even student common rooms in its current state.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=_opVd-H7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=j1lOTq6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oho, a secret passage!</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of student common rooms, this reminds me of one funny moment. One area in the basement of the castle, clearly meant to be the "Slytherin" common area, has a student that blocks players off if they aren't wearing a green hat. I didn't have a green hat, nor did I know where to find one. What I did know is this: I can kill.</p>

<p>My sociopathic little wizard boy went to the potions classroom across the basement and concocted an exploding potion. From there, I grabbed it and threw it at the gate operator. Well, he died, of course. I went into his little booth through a vent and stole his hat, and the other green hats accepted me as their own. Genius, I tell you!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-knight.jpg?itok=nZq5bvZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-knight.jpg?itok=QE3PS5zW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yer a knight, Harry.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As I had previously mentioned, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> has unlockable spells. You'll find spellbooks hidden throughout the castle, and those are how you learn new spells to use. Most of them feel useless at first, but we have to remember that this game is all about having fun and messing around.</p>

<p>So, I learned spells that could set things on fire, make things larger, or even allow me to swap bodies with another person. I learned that you can just swap bodies with a&nbsp;whole suit of armor and play as that. It didn't really give the player any benefit, but it's hilarious nonetheless.</p>

<p>The spell to enlarge things, called Biggify, is probably my favorite. You can make tons of objects gargantuan if you keep casting on it. I cast it on a student and made him become a behemoth and switched bodies with him, just because I could. I was so big, I couldn't leave the room I was in. Fantastic stuff.</p>

<p>If everything I've said so far sounds appealing to you, I've done my job. For a game that is as purposefully jank as it is, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em> contains a good few hours of fun. It definitely needs to be fleshed out more, and that'll come in due time. For now, I'm just happy to find out how I can break this game in different ways.</p>

<p>Postal 2 is back for a brand new audience. Developer Running with Scissors has revealed Postal 2 VR for PlayStation VR2, Steam VR, and Meta Quest.</p>



<p>The VR port comes 22 years after the game’s original release in 2003.</p>



<p>“For the first time ever, POSTAL 2 is fully reimagined for VR, bringing its dark humor, open-world mayhem, and unapologetic absurdity to an entirely new level,” the game’s description reads. “Step into the well-worn boots of The POSTAL Dude, a hapless everyman just trying to get through the week in the bizarre town of Paradise, Arizona. Whether you choose to play it cool or go completely POSTAL is entirely up to you.”</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-future-of-call-of-duty-insider-gaming-weekly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Future Of Call of Duty—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>According to the developers, the game will “take full advantage of virtual reality”.</p>



<p>“Feel every reload with manual weapon handling, interact with NPCs like never before using gesture-based reactions, and navigate the chaos with an overhauled inventory and minimap system designed specifically for VR,” they said.</p>



<p>“This is POSTAL 2 like you’ve never experienced before—fully unhinged, wildly immersive, and ready to let you loose in the most chaotic VR playground imaginable.”</p>



<p>An official release date will be announced in the future. In the mean time, you can check out the official reveal trailer for the game, below.</p>

It accuses PlayerAuctions of operating "with full knowledge that its sellers are engaged in rampant infringement and other unauthorized conduct," while it "reaps millions in revenue by taking a cut of every transaction on its marketplace."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Celebrity in GTA 5 and GTA Online</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Specifically, Take-Two alleges that PlayerAuctions hosts listings of modded accounts that have been manipulated to give high game levels and in-game currency, or to unlock content normally unlocked through playing or purchases. Take-Two also claims PlayerAuctions sells money drop services that work using hacking software to give purchasing players large amounts of in-game money, and account boosting services where sellers use hacking software or glitches to inflate a purchasing player's in-game level or currency total.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two further argues that PlayerAuctions goes out of its way to "lull its users into buying illegitimate GTA V content from its sellers" by offering refunds if the hacked accounts purchased are caught and banned post-purchase. According to the complaint, Take-Two has "repeatedly confronted PlayerAuctions with evidence of infringement" and has issued a cease and desist, but PlayerAuction has refused to shut down these listings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The GTA publisher is claiming relief for multiple different types and levels of copyright infringement, as well as intentional interference with contract. Take-Two is seeking a permanent enjoinment on PlayerAuctions from continuing to directly or indirectly sell accounts, currency, or items in any Take-Two game, or participating in or assisting hacking efforts, or infringing the GTA trademarks. It's also seeing damages for trademark infringement, costs and attorney fees, damages, and restitution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take-Two isn't the only company going after PlayerAuctions. Early last month, Roblox filed a similar suit in the Northern District of California Court covering roughly the same accusations, attempts at a cease and desist, claims, and prayer for relief. Notably, PlayerAuctions offers similar sales and services across many other games, including World of Warcraft, Genshin Impact, Valorant, Path of Exile, Final Fantasy 14, Call of Duty, and Fortnite. In total, PlayerAuctions claims to sell various boosts, items, and benefits for over 200 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Take-Two suit is still early in the process, the Roblox case has its first hearing set for March 20 in Oakland, California, where Roblox is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop PlayerAuctions from selling Roblox-related products and services while the case proceeds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lawsuit comes ahead of the fall 2025 launch of GTA 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-still-set-for-fall-2025-take-two-ceo-insists-we-feel-really-good-about-it">which Take-Two recently reaffirmed</a>. The hope is of course that any new version of GTA Online that launches alongside GTA 6 will be as free from cheaters as is possible, and the lawsuit may go some way to helping.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including Take-Two boss Strauss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-its-shown-a-willingness-to-support-legacy-titles-amid-questions-about-the-future-of-gta-online-post-gta-6"><u>Zelnick’s response to concern about the fate of GTA Online once GTA 6 comes out</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Moon Studios - the developer behind the acclaimed Ori series - has announced it's now 'fully independent', having secured the publishing rights to its latest game, No Rest for the Wicked, from Grand Theft Auto and Borderlands publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>.
</p>
<p>
No Rest for the Wicked, which released into early access last year, was originally set to be published by Private Division - the indie-focused label established by Take-Two in 2017. However, those plans changed following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">Take-Two's decision to sell Private Division to an unnamed party</a> last year, as it shifted its focus away from smaller titles.
</p>
<p>
The sale, Take-Two revealed at the time, would include the rights to "substantially all" of Private Division's live and unreleased titles, including the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> - but the publisher confirmed it would continue to support No Rest for the Wicked, despite the sale.
</p>
<p>
Now, however - some four months after Private Division's divestment - Moon Studios has announced it's secured the publishing rights to No Rest for the Wicked from Take-Two Interactive, insisting the move will allow it to "execute our vision without restrictions." The developer's announcement coincides with a major update for the action-RPG, which will have been in PC and Xbox early access for a year next month.
</p>
<p>
As for Private Division, a report in January claimed it had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">purchased by Texas-based private equity firm Haveli Investments</a>. More notably, however, the firm was said to have struck a deal with ex-Annapurna employees - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">departed the acclaimed indie publisher en masse last year</a> following a dispute with owner Megan Ellison - to fund a new company that would distribute former Private Division titles. These include the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program">Kerbal Space Program</a> series (despite the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-sells-private-division-label-confirms-closure-of-olliolli-world-and-kerbal-space-program-2-studios">closure of its development team</a>), upcoming Lord of the Rings farming game Tales of the Shire, and Pokémon developer Game Freak's new action-adventure IP.

With nothing but your wits, limited resources, and the tools at your disposal, you must carve out an existence in one of the most hostile environments imaginable.</p><p>For the first time, the <em>Surviving Mars</em> universe has been brought to virtual reality, delivering a fully immersive survival experience where every decision matters. Establish an autonomous mining operation, carefully managing oxygen, nutrition, and power to keep yourself alive. Construct and expand your base with hands-on building mechanics, optimizing power grids and resource extraction to stay one step ahead of disaster. Before venturing into the unknown, ensure you’re in optimal condition—every decision must be carefully weighed, as survival depends on preparation as much as action. Take on contracts to mine, refine, and export valuable resources, unlocking advanced blueprints, vehicles, and technology that could mean the difference between thriving and barely scraping by. Shape your survival strategy through smart economic decisions, investing in the tools and infrastructure needed to secure your foothold on the planet.</p><p>Beyond your outpost, an entire planet awaits. Strap on your jetpack and traverse towering cliffs, navigate treacherous dust storms, and uncover the hidden mysteries buried beneath the Martian soil. Every choice shapes your survival—because out here, there are no second chances.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/hitman-world-of-assassination-psvr-2-release-set-for-27th-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Hitman: World of Assassination is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> on 27th March, IO Interactive has confirmed, bringing a freshly enhanced VR version of the hit assassination trilogy to Sony’s latest headset. You can see snippets from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hitman-2">Hitman 2</a> level, The Finish Line, played in VR in the latest trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="HITMAN World of Assassination - PS VR2 - VR Games Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPfdRYXgjNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PSVR 2 version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/hitman-3-will-become-world-of-assassination-with-free-upgrade-to-include-hitman-1-2/">Hitman World of Assassination</a> will feature all 22 locations featured through the Hitman trilogy, adding new VR-specific mechanics, designed around the headset and its independent Sense controllers. That grants you dual-wielding, full ambidexterity, and room-scale play, as well as generally improved controls and gameplay mechanics, when compared to the original PSVR release. New interactions mean that you’ll have active reloading, on-body weapon holstering, sniper scope aiming, and manual motions to take on disguises. You even see how you can throw two items at the same time to knock out guards.</p>
<p>Pricing for this release has also now been confirmed. Players who own Hitman: World of Assassination on PS5 can get a VR Access upgrade for $9.99 / €9.99 / £8.99. Alternatively, newcomers to the game can buy Hitman WOA Part One – VR2 Edition, which includes the Hitman 1 campaign and locations with PSVR 2 support for $39.99 / €39.99 / £32.99. You can then upgrade to the full version with Hitman 2 and Hitman 3 levels… I’m assuming. The number of variants and options for Hitman are needlessly confusing on the PS Store, I’ll be honest. The whole rebrand to World of Assassination was meant to fix that, but then IOI created new sub-bundles and versions along the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/11/moon-studios-is-now-self-publishing-no-rest-for-the-wicked-after-split-with-take-two/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moon Studios has secured the publishing rights <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a>, their action RPG which is currently in Steam Early Access, cutting ties with Take-Two following the closure of original publishing label Private Division.</p>
<p>Characterising the change as making them “fully independent”, the studio states “We have secured the publishing rights for No Rest for the Wicked, allowing us to execute our vision without restrictions.”</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - Official Game Overview of The Breach | Wicked Inside Showcase 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CzAtYaSYZms?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Further to this, the team revealed the next big update for the game, The Breach, which will arrive on 30th April, confirmed that co-op is coming after that, and that Ori series composer Gareth Coker is returning to contribute new music to the game.</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is the first game from Moon Studios after their fruitful partnership with Microsoft for Ori and the Blind Forest and its sequel. The studio signed on with Take-Two’s indie-oriented publishing label Private Division, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/08/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-next-game-from-ori-developer-moon-studios/">announcing</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">releasing the game into Early Access</a> in early 2024.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/take-two-sells-private-division-label-to-a-secret-new-owner/">Take-Two decided to sell off Private Division</a> late last year, confirming the closure of multiple studios in the process, but with the sole exception to the sale being that they would retain publishing of No Rest for the Wicked. An odd situation, and while we’re obviously not privy to the behind-the-scenes negotiations since then, it’s clear that Moon Studios felt that they and their game would be best served by self-publishing.</p>
<p>To mark the shift to self-publishing, the studio has launched a 30% off independence sale. This is leading through to The Breach next month, which will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>New Story &amp; Areas</strong> – Players will continue their journey, exploring <em>Lowland Meadows</em> and <em>Marin Woods</em>, encountering fresh threats like the Harvesters and the Balak Taw.</li>
<li><strong>Expanded Combat &amp; Builds</strong> – New weapon archetypes (Gauntlets &amp; Wands), new enemies, and an updated loot system for more build variety.</li>
<li><strong>Replayability Enhancements</strong> – Dynamic world changes with the ‘Alive’ System, where factions and enemies dynamically reshape the game worldt<br>
The Plague System unleashes powerful new plagued enemies and bosses. Pestilence outbreaks now occur all over Sacra, and the player can cleanse these regions to gain potent new plagued resources.</li>
<li><strong>Revamped Systems</strong> – Ability to teleport directly to their house, Improved item stacking, new fast travel options, refined enchantments, and major quality-of-life improvements, including improvements to timers and an entirely overhauled storage system.</li>
<li><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong> – A new option for the most dedicated players.</li>
<li><strong>Visual &amp; Performance Upgrades</strong> – Enhanced lighting, improved DLSS implementation, and optimizations for smoother gameplay.</li>
</ul>
<p>We looked at the game with its early access release, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">our preview</a>, “No Rest For The Wicked is a beautiful dark fantasy epic, and here at the outset of it’s journey through Early Access there’s very few reasons for you not to experience its dangerous charms.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea.1131450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is the first title from Ivy Road, a studio formed by industry vets in 2021. Trailers showcased the title as a tea shop manager, but it’s so much more, and less, than that. Presenting a complex story and taking care of customers’ tea orders is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Serving Up Tea in <em>Wanderstop</em></h2>

<p>You play as Alta, a fighter known for being the best. After having her win streak of three years broken, she enters the woods to find the one person who can train her back to perfection. Weakened from consistent running, you pass out and awaken in a clearing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=snXRUB4e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=45d_NI06 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the 10-15 hours of gameplay begins. You start by exploring the clearing and the tea shop known as Wanderstop. Managed by Boro, you’re stuck helping him make tea until you’re able to lift your sword and leave the woods. I found that having your own cup to savor at this moment can really heighten the experience. I chose a nice herbal blend to sip while serving my first customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tea making process involves multiple steps, but once you have it down, it’s fairly easy. You grow specific fruits to gather, collect and dry tea leaves, then brew the drink inside the shop. All ingredients needed are found in the clearing, and there are no time limits on how long someone will wait for their beverage. If you make it incorrectly, they’ll even let you try again with no penalty to their dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=uCUfjaJt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=WkvQtENr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My biggest issue with <em>Wanderstop</em> is the missing challenge. Aside from a handful of specific client asks, most of the tea making you do is extremely straightforward. From growing the plants, finding the correct ingredients, and making the tea, it’s quite lacking in variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most challenging part is playing the title with a mouse and keyboard, then trying to quickly select one of the items from your inventory. It’s not super difficult, but getting what item you want and where you want it can take some finesse. A controller is far superior when it comes to inventory scrolling and using the shears.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=K6Ks9HPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=ibKsNxy_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While tea creation may have been the premise that drew people in, it’s not the main focus of the title. What <em>Wanderstop</em> lacks in management complexity, it gains in narrative focus. The story is the highlight of the title, evoking emotions I wasn't prepared to experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without delving too much into the story and ruining all the surprises, you go through Alta’s history and attempt to discover how to fix her current situation. It does pull at the heartstrings and could make you ponder your own views as you work through the different stages of the game. The characters are endearing, many of them with distinct personalities and conversational mannerisms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=BhK_0iWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=jBpKkxmX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you progress, you’re confronted with moments that alter what the clearing looks like. These changes bring new color schemes, new plants, and new customers. It also ends prior interactions with customers, cutting some side stories preemptively. This is irksome, but you do get chances to learn more about those characters as the game progresses.</p>

<h2><em>Wanderstop </em>Review <em>|&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Wanderstop</em> is less a tea shop management game and more a visual novel guiding players through a difficult, emotional narrative. It can be a tear-jerking experience, especially towards the end of the game. However, once played, I doubt I’ll personally dive back into the world now that I know the full story. It’s perfect for those wanting less of a commitment, with short windows of game time, or who need breaks between storytelling moments.&nbsp;<br>

It's not even been two months since the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ender-magnolia">Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist</a>, and co-developers Adglobe and Live Wire are already back with a pretty solid update. The major addition is a New Game+ mode, which allows you to start the "evil-purging adventure anew, this time armed with gear and relics from previous playthroughs”, and face “harrowing hordes of smarter, stronger enemies with new attack patterns." 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you've never even heard of the game before, here's a quick rundown: Ender Magnolia sees you playing as Lilac, an "Attuner" whose goal is to save the Homunculi. Working with them, you search for your lost memories, as you accrue a whole bunch of different unique abilities that you can net from turning bosses into your allies. It's cool stuff! And looked well worth jumping into even before this latest update.</p>

<p>
New Game+ aside, Ender Magnolia: Bloom In The Mist's 1.1.0 update adds the ability to rechallenge bosses you've already taken down, with the press release explaining that "allies become enemies once again as Lilac gains the ability to revisit momentous battles of the past." You can replay these battles at rest points to gain additional Fragments for unlocking collectibles.
</p>
<p>
