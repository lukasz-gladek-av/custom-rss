If the <em>Rugrats </em>look too real, it will be a nightmare. If the babies look too cartoonish, it will also be horrible.

But it’s 2024 in Hollywood, so that ain’t happening. So get ready for some creepy CG babies when <em>Rugrats </em>arrives in theaters sometime in the future. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>City 20 could be your next favourite survival sandbox title. I was lucky enough to play City 20 ahead of it launching into early access, and from the moment I was thrown into the dystopian, unforgiving world, I knew I was in for something special. Within minutes, I learned that I was truly left to my own devices, free to carve whatever path I wanted – or to succumb to the harsh environment around me.</p>



<p>If you’ve been waiting for a unique and genuinely intriguing apocalypse-like survival game, it’s here and waiting for you.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-your-typical-end-of-the-world-scenario">Not Your Typical End of the World Scenario</h2>



<p>City 20 might look a little strange on the surface, but the depth it offers is almost unparalleled. Per the game’s description, you’re free to ‘craft your own narrative’, and as I abandoned my starter objectives and ventured out into a wasteland in search of fame and fortune, I quickly found that claim to be true.</p>



<p>One minute, I was focused on fixing a broken door, and in the next, I was on a hunt for exclusive loot for survivors in a nearby town, desperate to impress them and build a stronger relationship so that I could access better trading options and improve my standing with the settlement.</p>



<p>Not too long after that, I was moving into an apartment in a decrepit block a few streets away, kitting it out with furniture while remaining wary of my neighbours, who I wasn’t sure about. Night fell, and I took to the streets with a torch, coming face-to-face with the predatory creatures that stalked the less populated areas of City 20 in the darkness.</p>



<p>It’s not inaccurate to suggest that City 20 has unlimited potential. Players are free to go where they please, build what they want, make friends with who they desire, and kill anyone they cross paths with. It’s not a <strong>true </strong>apocalypse, but it’s not far off the mark, with players being left to survive in a city walled off from the rest of the world 20 years after a radioactive incident.</p>



<h2 id="h-unlimited-options">Unlimited Options</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>City 20 is <strong>intelligent</strong>. In this game, you’re a catalyst, and you decide how the world unravels around you. For instance, if you hunt too many docile animals, you’ll cause predators to become bolder. If you cause too much trouble in a settlement, you’ll make guards more aggressive.</p>



<p>Every NPC is named and has a purpose. You can form relationships with all of them, trading with them and learning about them through conversations — or if you want, you can run up to them and sock them in the face, wreaking havoc on everyone you see. </p>



<p>What’s brilliant about City 20 is that it’s not overwhelming, despite the choices available. If you’d rather take things slow, explore all the corners of the map, and gently make friends with other survivors, you’re more than welcome to do so. If you’d like, you can retire early, set up a homestead, take to farming, and trade with locals to foster those relationships.</p>



<p>Ultimately, City 20 will have you constantly wondering what you <strong>can </strong>do next, not what you <strong>should </strong>do next. Do you want to round up resources and become materialistic and rich, or do you want to become a servant of the people, running endless quests and poking through the wasteland to find rare, long-forgotten items?</p>



<p>It’s up to you – and what’s more, the game is in early access now, so there’s plenty lined up in terms of delivery.</p>



<p><em>City 20 is available now, exclusively on PC.</em></p>

            <p>
Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 will apparently be delving deep into the series' mythology, with one of its returning cast members recently teasing an "intriguing" setting, plus characters including "old favourites" and "really deep cuts" - and if that doesn't include Birdo, I will riot.
</p>
<p>
Super Mario Bros. Movie 2 - the sequel to last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-is-the-biggest-video-game-adaptation-ever">hugely successful</a> (and shamefully Birdo-free) animated cinematic hit - is still some way from its planned 2026 release, but that hasn't stopped Toad voice actor Keegan-Michael Key from teasing some of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
"One thing I can say about the second movie is that it's a little broader in scope, and where it takes place is very intriguing lore and the Mario world," Key <a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/streaming/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2">told Men's Journal</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/super-mario-bros-movie-2-actor-teases-intriguing-setting-and-deep-cut-characters/">VGC</a>). "They're going to find some really fantastic Easter eggs and it's been very exciting so far."

<figcaption>Here's what last year's Mario movie looked like, in case you forgot.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNcTBXTk4I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
"[Creatively] they've really widened out the universe that these characters live in," Key continued, "and we're going to meet some new folks. We're going to meet some new folks that are old favourites and some folks that I think are really deep cuts, but because of the way the story's laying itself out right now, those characters are going to be very intriguing."
</p><p>
The original Super Mario Bros. Movie was, of course, already postively festooned with Easter Eggs (making the Birdo omission even more unforgivable), so it's not exactly a revelation to hear that'll continue in the sequel. But the news does at least open the door for some genteel speculation while we await more solid news.
</p>
<p>
Yoshi, Wario, Waluigi, Princess Daisy, Rosalina, and Bowser Jr. were, for instance, all notably absent from the first Mario movie (as was Birdo, in case you were unaware), making them strong candidates for the sequel - but I'm not sure I'd call any of that bunch particularly "deep cuts". Personally, I'm down with anyone from the western release of Super Mario Bros. 2, whether that be Wart, Phanto, or even a particularly obscure throwback named Birdo.
</p>
<p>
Super Mario Bros. Move 2 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-has-firm-release-date">currently scheduled to hit US cinemas on 3rd April 2026</a>. It'll see Chris Pratt reprising his role as Chris Pratt's voice, alongside the likes of Anya Taylor-Joy's Princess Peach, Charlie Day's Luigi, Jack Black's Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key's Toad, and Seth Rogan's Donkey Kong. And if we're doing dream casting, Matt Berry as Birdo.

            <title><![CDATA[Star Citizen Developer Cloud Imperium Games Imposes 7-Day Work Week Ahead of Citizencon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games-imposes-7-day-work-week-ahead-of-citizencon.998865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/star-citizen-developer-cloud-imperium-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Cloud Imperium Games, the developer of Star Citizen, has mandated its developers to work seven days a week to meet deadlines for Citizencon on October 19th.</p>



<p>An internal email sent to staff yesterday states that the company needs to “double down over the next 18 days to make sure that once again we create an amazing experience for our community.” This includes finalizing patch 3.24.2 for Star Citizen and having a Squadron 42 demo showcase for Chapter 1.</p>



<div><p>The email later continues, “This means for the next two weekends we will be <strong>mandating</strong> extra time for all those working on deliverables for Citcon.”</p><p>The company mandate states:</p></div>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to be in the office on Friday, October 4th and Friday, October 11th (typically a work-at-home day)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to be in the office on Saturday, October 5th, and Saturday, October 12th (for these days, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL (time off in lieu) which can be stored and used for time off at a later date)</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>All staff are to work on Sunday, October 6th, and Sunday, October 13th (this can be a work-at-home day, but the company “encourages” people to be in the office. For these days and for those in the office, the company will provide breakfast and lunch, with staff receiving company TOIL, which can be stored and used for time off at a later date)</li>
</ul>



<div><p>Insider Gaming understands that the recent mandate is the latest in a slew of ridiculous requirements imposed on its developers due to mismanagement, leading to some leaving the company entirely. </p><p>Another internal email sent to Insider Gaming in July 2024 reveals that Cloud Imperium Games “pre-approved” 12 hours of ‘SQ42 TOIL’ per week for developers to meet Citizencon deadlines. The catch? The TOIL will only be made available after Squadron 42 ships, and employees must still be employed with the company by the time the game ships, or the TOIL “will be forfeited.”</p></div>

</p></figure>



<p>The email continues that UK employees “need to be mindful of the hours they work and are asked to have 11 hours outside of work in each 24-hour period.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming contacted Cloud Imperium Games ahead of publication and received acknowledgment but no comment on the matter.</p>



<p>However, 11 minutes after we reached out, another internal email to staff read, </p>



<p>“I want to really thank everyone who will be putting extra time over the next two weeks, it will really make a difference at Citizencon, as we will show our very best.</p>



<p>“To show our appreciation, all those who will in the trenches with us over the next couple of weekends, can have Monday 21st October on the company as a free holiday.</p>



<p>“This hopefully will give a little break for everyone to rest after our long Citizencon weekend and the drive towards it”</p>



<p>As of May 2024, Star Citizen has raised over $700 million in crowdfunding.</p>



<hr>



<p>Employee’s at Cloud Imperium Games can contact me securely and anonymously at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="a4d0cbc9d0cbc9ccc1cac0c1d6d7cbcae4d4d6cbd0cbcac9c5cdc88ac7cbc9">[email&nbsp;protected]</a> as I continue to investigate the issues at the company.</p>

                <p>J Allard, one of the chief designers of the original Xbox, has joined Amazon, but it's too soon to say if he'll be working on anything related to video games.</p><p>Allard confirmed to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260438/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-amazon-hiring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that he is the vice president of Amazon's devices and services team. He declined to go into specifics on what he's working on, but said he'll contribute to "new ideas." Allard's boss at Amazon is Panos Panay, the former Windows and Surface boss at Microsoft, according to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GeekWire.</a></p><p>Allard is an Xbox legend, having worked at Microsoft for nearly 20 years. During his time there, he was instrumental in the formation of the team that created the original Xbox. He also led the development of Xbox Live and the Xbox 360. Additionally, Allard ran the team responsible for Microsoft's iPod competitor, the Zune. Allard left Microsoft in 2010.</p><p>Allard joined Tommy Tallarico's Intellivision as a contractor who worked with the company to <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/xbox-co-founder-j-allard-left-intellivision-short-stint-hints-project-gaming-vet-brother/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">finalize the hardware design of the retro-inspired Amico console</a>.

The <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/what-we-do/devices-services" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">devices and services team</a> he's joining runs the Alexa and Echo products, along with the game-streaming service Luna. This team also runs the Project Kuiper project that aims to launch thousands of satellites into low-earth orbit to increase broadband access around the world.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft is creating a next-gen console that aims to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">offer the "largest technical leap" in console history.</a> These are just words for now, as Microsoft has provided no information on how it might achieve this or any timetable for this console's release.</p>

In an email to <em>The Verge</em>, Allard confirmed his new role but says it’s “too early to have anything to say” about what he’ll be working on at Amazon beyond “new ideas.”</p><p>Allard will report to former Windows and Surface chief Panos Panay at Amazon, according <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2024/former-microsoft-xbox-leader-j-allard-joins-amazon-in-latest-surprise-career-twist/">to <em>GeekWire</em></a>. Panay <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23892462/amazon-hires-panos-panay-microsoft">left Microsoft</a> last year after being at the software giant for almost 20 years. Allard spent more than 20 years at Microsoft, cofounding the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;division, launching&nbsp;Microsoft’s&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;Live network, and developing the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;360 console. Allard also oversaw the development of the Zune, Microsoft’s iPod competitor.</p><p>Allard departed Microsoft in 2010, following his work on the company’s canceled Courier tablet. Courier was never officially announced as a Microsoft product, but the leaked concept combined pen and touch into a digital notepad. </p><p>The Courier was reportedly canceled amid infighting between the Courier group led by Allard and the Windows group led at the time by Steven Sinofsky. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly couldn’t choose between Courier and Windows and needed Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/1/2529666/did-bill-gates-kill-courier">step in to make the final decision</a>.</p><p>Since leaving Microsoft, Allard has spent most of his time running <a href="https://project529.com/">Project 529</a>, a community service organization focused on reducing bike theft. Two Three Bird acquired Project 529 earlier this year, freeing up Allard’s time to “orient my energy towards some new ideas.”</p><div>

On sale with Happy Meals starting October 15, the jack-o-lantern and ghost-style faces have been replaced with smiling monsters, and there’s now a blue bucket in addition to the iconic orange, white, and green. I’m sure the kids will like them a lot more. But let’s be honest, Boo Buckets are for adults at this point, and not everyone is onboard with the UwU-fication of a once glorious nostalgia-trip.</p><p>“Tthese look awful and have those garbage fake lids that do nothing but make them harder to hold, do something right or don’t do it at all,” wrote one militant McD’s poster on Twitter. “Can you just rerelease the 90s ones that glow in the dark and have actual lids! Please!!!!” pleaded another. “Also the 90s Halloween McNuggets buddies! I’m giving you free ideas and all is old aholes in our 30s and 40s will give you money!”</p><p>The Instagram comments were even more brutal. “Fire the design department,” read one. “Where’s the glow in the dark one,” read another. “WHERE ARE THE LIDS ??!!!” begged a third. Not everyone is up in arms about the overhaul, though. Some claim they are “cute” or “REALLY EXCITING.” To those oozing with positivity I can only say, in the words of one new Boo Bucket hater, “Some of y’all never had the 1980’s Boo Buckets from McDonalds and it shows.”</p><p>The Boo Buckets were first rolled out in 1986, with several variations and iterations in the years that followed.  The unbranded simplicity was part of their charm. Just pure mashups of late capitalist pastiche and workmanlike utility. It’s also hard to overstate the omnipresent power of McDonald’s at the time, which burned itself onto every child’s retinas through truly excessive ad buys during the afternoon and weekend cartoon slots, especially around holidays like Halloween. </p><p>Which is to say that I never got a Boo Bucket growing up but was made to feel like everyone else in the world had. So it was an obvious stroke of genius when the company decided to bring the nostalgia-bait merchandise back with the original look and style in 2022. Millennial parents who were stressed to the max and looking to post an easy W with their kids could get 15 minutes of quiet and fill the gap in their own childhood with one quick trip <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-failure-tiktok-1851548668&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-drive-thru-ai-failure-tiktok-1851548668">to the (non-AI) drive-thru</a></span>. It was a nice dream while it lasted. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>He said he tried to impress upon his staffers that they should not be afraid to fail. In fact, it's essential to stumble in the creative process, he said.</p><p>"It's OK to fail--failure has always been in the DNA of the studio; failing is part of creativity, and we have to remember that," he said. "I'm happy that we're out of the circus now and we can focus on what we're doing."</p><p>Vincke went on to say that he hopes Larian's next game can be "something you would be proud to show your friends, and something that you would want to play."</p><p>"That's the core. If that's there, we'll be fine," he said. "These are very talented and skilled people, so if you give them freedom and trust them to do their best, you can't go wrong."</p><p>Larian has bold ambitions for its future projects, and the company's next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/" data-ref-id="1100-6523807">codenamed Excalibur</a>. It sounds like it's still very early days, as Vincke said earlier this year that the team is still "trying to figure out what the hell it is."</p><p>What <em>is </em>confirmed is that the studio is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-isnt-making-baldurs-gate-4-next-thats-not-what-we-were-made-for/1100-6522049/" data-ref-id="1100-6522049">not making Baldur's Gate 4 next.</a> "We want to do big, new things. We don't want to rehash the thing that we've done already," Vincke said earlier this year.</p><p>Given the huge success of Baldur's Gate 3, the series is likely to continue with a different developer. Hasbro, which owns the IP, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hasbro-hopes-next-baldurs-gate-game-is-here-before-2050/1100-6522712/" data-ref-id="1100-6522712">hopes to release Baldur's Gate 4 by 2050.</a></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-best-characters-are-now-dungeons-dragons-miniatures/1100-6526851/" data-ref-id="1100-6526851">Baldur's Gate 3's Best Characters Are Now Dungeons &amp; Dragons Miniatures, Out Next Year</a></li></ul>

Blizzard has clarified how players can access Vessel of Hatred, and there is one answer: <strong>B</strong><strong>uy it</strong>.</p><p>Vessel of Hatred is a $40 expansion to the game, and purchasing it outright is the only way to access it at launch. Game Pass subscribers can, however, save $4 via Game Pass Ultimate, knocking the price down to $36.</p>

            <p>
Throne and Liberty - the latest South Korean free-to-play fantasy MMO to get a western release courtesy of Amazon Games - is off to a strong start this week, hovering near the top of Steam's concurrent charts (albeit still behind that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/banana-clicking-game-now-9th-most-popular-of-all-time-on-steam-knocks-baldurs-gate-3-out-of-top-10">infernal Banana game</a>) despite mixed reviews.
</p>
<p>
Currently, Throne and Liberty - which promises exploration and "massive-scale combat" for "thousands of players at once" across a "dynamic" open world - is Steam's sixth most played game, with 251K concurrent players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2429640/charts/">according to SteamDB</a>. That puts it just behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Banana, PUBG, and perennial Steam favourites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's a strong start for Throne and Liberty, but its early launch week peak of 326,377 concurrent players pales in comparison to Amazon's other previous releases. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, for instance, managed an all-time high of 1.3m concurrents at launch in 2022, while New World saw a peak concurrent of 914k players when it arrived in 2021. The key, of course, will be maintaining player interest in Throne and Liberty, which both Lost Ark and New World in particular have struggled to do - despite the latter's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-mmo-new-worlds-aeternum-overhaul-is-having-an-open-beta-next-month">recent relaunch as New World: Aerturnum</a>.

<p>
Throne and Liberty's arrival hasn't been without incident either. The game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2429640/THRONE_AND_LIBERTY/#app_reviews_hash">currently rated Mixed on Steam</a>, with players dinging it for a whole range of issues - from almost inevitable launch week servers woes to more fundamental complaints, including shallow gameplay design. Steam Deck and Linux players have also been frustrated by the arrival of Easy Anti-Cheat, rendering Throne and Liberty unplayable on those systems - albeit seemingly temporarily, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/throne-and-libertys-steam-deck-anti-cheat-malady-seems-cured-for-now">Rock Paper Shotgun reporting</a> the issue now seems resolved.
</p><p>
All the above only applies to Steam, of course; but if Throne and Liberty has a similar impact on consoles (it's also available on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 with cross-play supported) Amazon will no doubt be wanting to shout about it soon.
</p>
<p>
Throne and Liberty, perhaps surprisingly given how much corporations love the old brand synergy stuff, isn't one of the games being immortalised in Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-working-on-animated-anthology-tv-series-featuring-spelunky-and-other-video-game-worlds">Secret Level anthology series</a> - although the company's New World: Aeternum does make an appearance, alongside the likes of Mega Man, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, Pac-Man, Spelunky, and, er, Concord.

In an Instagram post, the Superman and Witcher star praised the developers at Saber for the action game set in Games Workshop’s grimdark universe, although revealed he failed to complete the campaign solo on the Angel of Death difficulty, which is the hardest of the four difficulties available.</p><p>As we can see from the photo above, Cavill was smart enough to paste over his username with the word “nope.” Yes, that means you could be playing with or against Henry Cavill in Space Marine 2 PvP and you’d never know it.</p><p>Riffing on this in their <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/93-september-community-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">warning</a> to toxic Space Marine 2 players, Saber and Focus said you never know who you might be insulting in-game — it could even be Henry Cavill himself.</p><p>“Be loyal to the cause, be respectful,” reads the statement. “It has been reported that some players were displaying hurtful behaviors or comments in-game. We do not tolerate that and will take action to prevent it. </p><p>“First and foremost, we kindly ask you to remain respectful, mature and mannerly with your fellow Space Marines. You can never know how old the other players may be, how their day is going, how sensitive they may be... overall, you never know who your brothers and sisters are... It could even be 😏... you don’t want to insult Henry Cavill, brother, no you don’t.”</p><p>Whether this warning acts as a deterrent or perhaps <em>encourages</em> toxic behavior from players who think they might be playing with or against Cavill remains to be seen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Elsewhere, Focus revealed the hotly anticipated new PvE Operations map coming to Space Marine 2 as part of Season 2. It’s located on one of the existing planets, Kadaku, and sees the Space Marines once again fight against the Tyranids. The new Operation arrives in October. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>​The Tyranid invasion of Kadaku is ending. The planet’s organic material is being transformed into biomass, and Tyranid Capillary Towers stretch high into the skies above, where the Hive Ships wait to taste their victory.</blockquote><blockquote>The Cadian forces have made a valiant attempt to push back against the Tyranids. A team of Space Marines arrives on Kadaku with a simple mission: help the Cadians destroy the towers. The Tyranids may win the planet, but the Imperium will make it as painful as possible for them.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/02/capillary-towers-1727882783773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Tyranid Capillary Towers in Space Marine 2's upcoming new Operation.</figcaption></figure></output><p>And finally, Focus said a hotfix will arrive "very soon" that is aimed at fixing crashes and improving stability. In the future, players can expect more quality-of-life improvements, additional customization features (such as new colors for the lenses), and, for PC players, a 4K texture pack released for free. There’s also work being done to address ongoing server issues.</p><p>Saber recently released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/big-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-30-adds-pc-ultrawide-support-private-pve-lobbies-and-more"><u>Space Marine 2’s game-changing patch 3.0</u></a>, which made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-patch-30-made-a-seemingly-innocuous-change-to-the-games-ending-and-now-warhammer-40000-lore-fans-are-losing-their-minds"><u>a seemingly innocuous change to the game’s ending that got Warhammer 40,000 fans excited</u></a>.

<p>The next game from Larian Studios could be at least four-to-five years away. When speaking during the SEA Game Awards, Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke said that the next game from the company should be expected sometime in 2028 or 2029.</p>



<p>He then said afterwards that people shouldn’t hold them to that timeline or date.</p>



<p>“I knew you’d pick up on that. It was just a joke,” he told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-studios-head-suggests-next-game-2029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> after accepting a Special Recognition Award a the event. “I don’t know, we’ll release it when it’s ready. They’re big games and it takes time, so don’t hold us to a date.”</p>



<p>As far as what that next game will be, that’s up in the air. It’s known that Larian Studios isn’t working on another Baldur’s Gate title after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-baldurs-gate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">completing work</a> on Baldur’s Gate 3. That said, the studio is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/">working on multiple games</a> right now. At least one of those games will be a brand new IP from the company.</p>



<p>“As an independent studio since 1996, we value the freedom to follow our creativity wherever it leads,” they said at the time. The studio has said that it is leaving Dungeons and Dragons “entirely”. However, it is still currently providing support to Baldur’s Gate 3 via a small team within the company.</p>



<p>When do you think the next game from Larian Studios will come? Join in the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/660/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

Combining challenging hack-and-slash gameplay, role-playing, and roguelike elements with stunning anime aesthetics, you will battle your way up a deadly celestial tower, build your arsenal of skills with each mortal demise to eradicate monstrous angelic enemies and dethrone a god to save the world.</p><p>As a member of M.A.H.O.U Unit—an elite fighting force of super-powered android magical girls—you and up to three allies are tasked with one thing: destroy a god to save the world from the brink of extinction. Starting from the base of the mythical Tower of Babel, you’ll fight your way through an array of powerful enemies from all sides, as you climb each level, gaining crucial skills and magical powers to help you surmount its pinnacle—and the new threats each floor brings with it. Defeat is no excuse; only the most resolute soldiers will reach the heavenly heights in order to dethrone their god—are you up for the task?</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_918880"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

After each run, your unit returns to the lab, where you can use the rewards from previous missions to unlock and equip up to 256KB of skill chips. Customize your unit with these chips to match your unique playstyle.</li><li><strong>Magical Transformations</strong> – The curse of the Tower is ever-present, and spending too much time in one area draws out even more powerful enemies.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> ends with a bit of a cliffhanger. Though Lilith is defeated and Sanctuary saved for a time, another threat, Mephisto, still looms. Seeking to put an end to the Lord of Hatred once and for all, Neyrelle traps Mephisto's essence within a Soulstone before disappearing, leaving only a cryptic note as to her intentions. Enter Vessel of Hatred, Blizzard's first expansion for Diablo 4 releasing on October 8, where players will race to find and help Neyrelle in her struggle before it's too late.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of Vessel of Hatred and alongside the debut of a new in-game cinematic highlighting the physical and mental toll Mephisto's presence has taken on Neyrelle, we got the chance to chat with game director Brent Gibson and associate narrative designer Eleni Rivera-Colon about Vessel of Hatred's cast of characters. How is Mephisto's influence affecting Neyrelle? What is Mephisto's goal, and what is he able to do while trapped within the Soulstone? What is Lorath up to? Gibson and Rivera-Colon wouldn't spoil anything but did help set the table as to what players can expect to see as they journey through Vessel of Hatred's story campaign.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred - In-Game Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In Vessel of Hatred, Neyrelle is seeking the Vault of Light, a location said to be hidden within the dense jungle of Nahantu and supposedly the final resting place of Akarat, the founder of the Zakarum faith. It's there she hopes to be able to destroy Mephisto for good, but his presence within the Soulstone corrupts the world around her, catching the attention of the Spiritborn, the guardians of Nahantu's jungles.</p><p dir="ltr">After teaming up with a new character, the wise Spiritborn elder Eru, players finally catch up to Neyrelle in the newly revealed cinematic. Soulstone in hand, she furiously recites ancient chants in an effort to control Mephisto's power. Gibson said the scene is the moment the player character is "coming to terms" with the scale of Neyrelle's situation and realizing that something must be done as she struggles to tame Mephisto.</p><p dir="ltr">"She's doing everything she can with chants to hold him in the Soulstone," Rivera-Colon said. "He's essentially trying to break out. He's going to do everything he can."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961" data-ratio="0.56226209896683" data-width="1839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376961"></a><figcaption>Players will team up with a new character, the Spiritborn elder Eru, in their hunt for Neyrelle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376961-diablo4vesselofhatrederu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Neyrelle believed that by accepting the burden of the Soulstone alone, she would be keeping her friends safe. Taking on heavy burdens and being forced to deal with situations out of her control is something that Neyrelle as a character is used to, Rivera-Colon said.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the expansion we get to really explore what she thinks about this choice and this decision now that she's been with something like Mephisto and [the] Soulstone for so long," Rivera-Colon said. "It's going to take a heavy, heavy toll on her, and this is something she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to do."</p><p dir="ltr">As much as it's a story about Neyrelle, it's also one about Mephisto, too. Absent in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-25658">Diablo 3</a>, he played a supporting role in the story of Diablo 4, aiding players anonymously in his Bloodied Wolf form on their quest to stop Lilith before eventually revealing his true identity. Gibson said one of the goals of the expansion was to hone in on the Lord of Hatred and tell the next major chapter of his story, teasing that there is "still more to come" in regards to Mephisto that Blizzard will craft over time.</p><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is one of the Prime Evils, and though he is terrifying in his own way, he's quite different compared to the demon from which the series derives its name, Diablo. Mephisto is more keen to sow hatred and division among the people of Sanctuary, finding vulnerabilities in people and turning friends and family against one another for his own nefarious purposes.</p><p dir="ltr">"That's his MO," Gibson said. "If you think about the way he shows up in the base game, making you second guess your allies, making you second guess Lilith. What kind of influence does he have on Neyrelle right now? What is he making her second guess?"</p><p dir="ltr">Though he is still trapped in the Soulstone, his wolf projection seen in the base game returns, once again serving as Mephisto's voice and a way for him to "spread his message." His corruption seeps from the Soulstone into the world around it, with Gibson describing the Soulstone itself as being almost radioactive in nature.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a pretty big deal that Mephisto is back on Sanctuary," Gibson said. "Any time that happens, they get banished back to the abyss and have to kick and scream all the way back. Even though he's stuck in the Soulstone, the danger here is if he gets out, he's physically back on Sanctuary, and so it's important Neyrelle finds a solution to not let that happen."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959" data-ratio="0.56254272043746" data-width="1463" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4376959"></a><figcaption>Mephisto was defeated in Diablo 2 but is finally back on Sanctuary (albeit still inside Neyrelle's Soulstone).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4376959-diablo2mephisto.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mephisto is trying to do everything in his power to break free, though his options are limited and so he must be careful, Rivera-Colon said. Thankfully for Mephisto, the expansion returns him to one of his old seats of power, the jungles of Nahantu where he previously corrupted the Zakarum church and battled players in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-798">Diablo 2</a>. Gibson said that Vessel of Hatred is "revisiting history" in that way, but it's clear that Vessel of Hatred is also expanding on the region and its lore, adding new wrinkles to the story of Akarat, the Zakarum, the Light, and the Spirit Realm.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Zakarum faith didn't get everything right," Rivera-Colon said. "They didn't know Akarat. So it's an opportunity to explore Akarat and Akarat's faith not just through the Zakarum faith but through the land and the impact he had on the land throughout Nehantu."</p><p dir="ltr">There's no doubt the focus of Vessel of Hatred is on Mephisto and Neyrelle. However, one of Diablo 4's main characters, the last Horadrim, Lorath, is notably absent. Gibson said that was by design, as they only had so much room for the stories they could tell in the expansion.</p><p dir="ltr">"Where Lorath is is a mystery," Gibson said. "That will unpack over time, but if you think about the state of the world after the base game, he had some work to do."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is still leaving plenty of details for players to discover come launch day, though a recent trailer may have already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-trailer-may-have-spoiled-its-final-boss/1100-6526669/">spoiled one of the expansion's boss fights</a>. Thankfully, players won't have to wait long to find out what happens next. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-launch-and-preload-times-revealed/1100-6526800/">Preloading for Vessel of Hatred is available now</a> for PC players using Battle.net, while console players can preload the expansion October 5 ahead of its October 8 release.
