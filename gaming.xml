            <p>Mark’s on holiday today, which means we can’t do our usual thing of workplace-bullying him into writing about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> while we sit around in wingback chairs drinking Glenfiddich. But if he were here, he’d surely be thrilled to note <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/fallout-76/thicker-2026-plans">this PCGN interview</a> with Bethesda Game Studios creative director Jon Rush, who says he hopes the multiplayer RPG can become "thicker" in 2026. Oh my.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>More specifically, Rush explains how following the major map-widening expansions of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76-has-a-hellish-new-area-and-bethesda-want-you-to-nuke-it">Skyline Valley</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Burning Springs</a> – the latter also serving as a tie-in with Amazon’s mostly decent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-is-fuelling-another-steam-player-bump-as-folks-once-again-remember-they-like-fallout">Fallout TV adaptation</a> – the hope is now to build up Fallout 76’s existing spaces, adding depth as well as breadth.</p>
<p>"For this next year, I really want our gaze to shift from the outskirts to inwards - make the game thicker," he says, conjuring up mental images of a glowing and uncomfortably spicy roux. "New systems or new ways to engage with existing content, those are all very much on the menu for this year."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Bethesda Softworks / Bethesda Game Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is some pragmaticism behind the shift in update tactics, with "technical considerations" precluding an endless widening of the game’s explorable world – "we can’t just continue making the map bigger and bigger," as Rush puts it. But filling out and adding to the wasteland survival pursuits in more familiar locales has been tried before, with success. Rush points to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-latest-update-relaxes-its-building-rules-so-you-can-try-erecting-a-nuclear-bunker-in-mid-air">loosening of the building rules</a> for Fallout 76’s C.A.M.P. construction, which enabled more ambitious and creative settlement builds across a wider range of terrain, as an example of how such, erm, <em>thickening</em> makes for a better game.</p><p>The C.A.M.P. changes were, he says, designed to "allow people to get to engage with the world in more ways than they could before... [the updates] had a huge impact on our players, and the things that they want to do in the world."</p>
<p>While it might therefore be a good long time before Fallout 76’s vault dwellers will be exploring any truly untouched patches of irradiated dirt, it sounds like Bethesda will be providing plenty more things to do on home turf. In the meantime, why not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-tour-of-fallout-76s-burning-springs-with-our-recently-defrosted-ohioan-historian">take a tour of Burning Springs’ lovingly wrecked Ohio</a> with a gen-yoo-ayyyyyn Ohio historian? It’s what Mark would have wanted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As we’re already a month into 2026 – seriously, how did that happen? – we’re well on the path to salivating over the games we’re going to be playing over the course of the next year. In terms of fantasy action, Crimson Desert from Pearl Abyss is firmly installed at the top of our list, and the more we get to see of it, the more that excitement permeates TSA towers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Features Overview #1: Kliff and the Open World of Pywel | Crimson Desert" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfZCV8EySac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This new 15-minute showcase presents a whole host of new details about the world of Pywel, the central hero Kliff, and how it all comes together in terms of gameplay. I was lucky enough to play Crimson Desert at Gamescom a couple of years ago, and despite it being extremely tough, I came away wanting to play more, and explore the beautiful world that Pearl Abyss are creating.</p>
<p>Pywel features sprawling wilderness, bustling cities, ancient ruins and diverse regions, all set against a backdrop of escalating conflict and supernatural danger. Pywel is divided into five distinct regions: Hernand, Pailune, Demeniss, Delesyia and the Crimson Desert, each offering its own stories, environments and challenges. While the main quest follows Kliff’s journey, you’re free to explore the world in any order, taking faction-driven quests, large-scale battles, fortress sieges and smaller, character-focused missions.</p>
<p>Kliff is a warrior belonging to the Greymanes, a faction from the northern region of Pailune, known for their commitment to peace and unity. Crimson Desert begins in the aftermath of that peace being shattered, tasking Kliff with reuniting the Greymanes and reclaiming their homeland. As the journey expands, players discover that the fate of the entire continent is at stake.</p>

<p>As the story progresses, two additional playable characters join Kliff. Each of these characters will feature unique combat styles, skills and weapons, allowing players to experience exploration and combat in different ways. You have to assume that one of these will be a magic user of some sort, while the other may well be a ranger type, though we’ll have to wait and see for the next glimpse of the game!</p>
<p>Exploration plays a major role, with players able to traverse Pywel on horseback, climb terrain, glide across distances and later access advanced traversal options such as a missile-firing mech and a dragon. The massive open world will be filled with hidden treasures, ancient mechanisms, puzzles and points of interest designed to reward player’s curiosity and discovery.</p>
<p>Combat encounters range from enemy soldiers and sorcerers to ferocious beasts and machines, testing players’ adaptability and skill. Powerful artifacts and equipment can be earned through quests, combat or exploration, while knowledge gathered from the world and its inhabitants provides clues and guidance, or even opens paths to acquire new skills.</p>
<p>Pre-orders for Crimson Desert are now live across <a href="https://store.playstation.com/nl-nl/concept/10002363/?utm_source=official&amp;utm_campaign=fb&amp;utm_medium=gl&amp;utm_content=preorder&amp;utm_term=general" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">PlayStation®5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/nl-NL/games/store/crimsondesert/9NG592G0W474?utm_source=official&amp;utm_campaign=fb&amp;utm_medium=gl&amp;utm_content=preorder&amp;utm_term=general" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/3321460/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">&nbsp;Steam</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/crimson-desert-6d6135" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Epic Game Store</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crimson-desert/id6747100856?mt=12&amp;utm_source=official&amp;utm_campaign=fb&amp;utm_medium=gl&amp;utm_content=preorder&amp;utm_term=general" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Apple Mac</a>. Crimson Desert is due to release on the 19th of March, 2026.</p>

<p>Deep(wood) respect</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We first noticed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/under_the_island">Under The Island</a> almost two years ago, when its debut trailer brought all kinds of happy memories from the glory days of GBA Zelda flooding back. This weekend, Top Hat Studios and Slime King Games showcased even more of their upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/legend_of_zelda_the_minish_cap">Minish Cap</a>-like, and announced that it'll arrive on Switch on <strong>17th February</strong>.</p>
<p>As you'll see in the above release date trailer (narrated by none other than our good friend Jon Cartwright, we might add), the GBA charm is strong with this one — that opening dungeon looks more than a little like Deepwood Shrine, no? But that's not to say that it's without interesting mechanics of its own.</p>
<p>The top-down adventure game sees you play as Nia, an intrepid explorer who sets out to save Seashell Island from its sinking fate. It's got the usual block sliding and button pressing puzzles that we'd expect to see from a Zelda-like, but we're also particularly interested in the 'Treat Bag' item that we spotted in the above trailer, which lets you befriend or otherwise utilise wild animals' abilities to solve problems. Come on, who doesn't like a smiling pixel art dog?</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/UNDER-THE-ISLAND-3017958.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DISCOVER THE LEGEND OF WHAT'S UNDER THE ISLAND!<br>
Uncover a sinking mystery and step into the role of Nia, a newcomer to Seashell Island - and join forces with local girl Avocado to investigate an ominous fate - the island's destined to sink beneath the ocean! Explore colorful regions, battle strange creatures, and uncover the ancient mysteries that could threaten your new home.</p>
<p>CLASSIC TOP-DOWN ADVENTURE<br>
Journey across a lush island, brought to life with vibrant pixel art and timeless top-down exploration. Delve into hidden corners, uncover secrets, and face dangerous foes across diverse, interconnected biomes.</p>
<p>SIX DISTINCT REGIONS TO EXPLORE<br>
From eerie sentient greenhouses, to frozen caverns, and chaotic sawmills, each biome holds its own dangers, upgrades, and treasures to uncover! Become the champion of the cook-off, reunite lost cats, and dodge the rage of the cereal pirates.</p>
<p>STRANGE ENEMIES &amp; UNUSUAL TACTICS<br>
Face off against vomiting eggplants, tunnelling wolves, and other bizarre creatures. Use artefacts, loot, and new abilities you discover to turn the tide of battle. Befriend animals and see if they can help you on your adventure - particularly if you give them treats!</p>
<p>A CAST OF MEMORABLE CHARACTERS<br>
Meet the island’s quirky inhabitants, each with their own personality, story, and a role to play in your adventure. Forge friendships, lend a hand, and see how they can aid you in return.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under the Island arrives on the Switch eShop in just a few weeks for <strong>£17.99 / $19.99</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Are the WH-1000XM5 premium noise-cancelling headphones Sony’s forgotten masterpiece? Since their debut, Sony’s successor model WH-1000XM6 cans are getting all of the attention and praise. That’s totally understandable, since the 1000XM6 are mind-bogglingly good in pretty much every way imaginable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6985/">But maybe we can scare up some love for the WH-1000XM5s now that they’re 30% off at Amazon, which makes them an absolute steal at just $279.</a></p>
<p>Before last May when the 1000XM6 headphones dropped, there wasn’t much debate about what the best noise-cancelling over-ear headphones on the market were, and it was the WH-1000XM5s. Priced less than the competitor Apple AirPods Max and armed with a 30-hour battery, a comfortable fit, and a two-processor, eight-microphone array that made them&nbsp;<em>the</em> premier noise-cancelling wireless headphones, the Sony WH-1000XM5s had a three-year run at the top of the charts. Guess what — they’re every bit as good as ever, except now they’ve had over $100 carved from their price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Opportunity Knocks</h2>
<p>Now that the WH-1000XM6 wireless headphones are Sony’s flagship charged with beating the AirPod Max and other top-class noise-cancelling headphones, the WH-1000XM5s occupy a new niche on the market. We wouldn’t go as far as to call them bargain headphones, because nothing with that tag could possibly sound as good as the WH-1000XM5s, but they’re most definitely in hot-deal territory. This new sale price at Amazon places the WH-100XM5 noise-cancelling headphones a solid C-note beneath their new big brother, and nearly $200 under the AirPods Max. One thing is for certain — if there’s a performance gap between the WH-1000XM5 headphones and AirPods Max at all, it’s nowhere near worth a $200 price gap.</p>
<p>The Sony WH-1000XM5 blew away reviewers and customers alike when they dropped in 2022, mostly due to just&nbsp;<em>how</em> good their active noise cancellation feature was. They represented Sony’s greatest leap forward in that all-important feature, and it took three years and another Sony model to finally push them off the perch as the best ANC headphones. But there was — and is — much more to love about them, including a 30-hour battery life and crazy fast-charging feature that takes only 3 minutes of charge to give you 3 hours of listening time.</p>



<h2>Midrange Monster</h2>
<p>The other features that made the Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless headphones a solid buy at $400 make them an unbeatable deal at $279. Easy multi-device pairing and toggling, equally formidable performance for music, podcasts, and phone calls, Alexa control, and a high level of customization through the Sony Sound Connect app are every bit as impressive now as they were when these headphones were released. The only difference is, now they’re in a whole new, more accessible price category.</p>
<p>Think of the Sony WH-1000XM5 wireless noise-cancelling headphones as a world champion boxer that’s decided to drop down a weight class or two in order to dominate a new division. That’s what’s happening right now, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6985/">as long as these world-class headphones are just $279 at Amazon</a>, they are hands-down the class of that price range.</p>

            <p>HBO’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> TV adaptation is likely ending with its upcoming third season, according to network CEO Casey Bloys. Speaking to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/hbo-casey-bloys-the-pitt-heated-rivalry-euphoria-interview-1236700801/">Deadline</a>, that boy Bloys used his voice to address the noise that the joys of the Naughty Dog-inspired series would end with season three, saying "It certainly seems that way." Pedro Pascal’s dreams, destroyed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Bloys did add that "on decisions like that, we will defer to the showrunners," which in The Last of Us' case is Craig Mazin, also the creator of Chernobyl (the show, not the nuclear disaster). The same Craig Mazin who told <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/">Collider</a>, during the airing of the well-received second season, that "there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season." Which might be reassuring to some, though a) Bloy’s comments are a lot more up-to-date than Mazin’s and b) if network executives truly knew how to "defer" to showrunners, we might have had more than six measly episodes of Garth Marenghi’s Darkplace.</p> <figure>

<p>Still, at current rates of adaptivisation, Mazin might have a point. The Last of Us' first season was a fairly faithful creation of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">original zombies 'n' sadness game</a>, and while season two tinkered more with its take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-2">TLOU Part II</a>, it ultimately covered less than half of the latter's notoriously bleak story. Season three of the show could just be longer, though.</p>
<p>Plans may also have changed in light of TLOU game director Neil Druckmann, who was co-showrunning the adapatation with Mazin, <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">leaving to focus back on Naughty Dog</a>. The Sony-owned dev house is currently working on science fiction adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, though if Druckmann's return from Tinseltown was meant to help keep it on track, that maybe hasn’t panned out: reports emerged late last year that staff were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crunch-returns-to-naughty-dog-for-xmas-as-intergalactic-devs-work-overtime-on-a-demo-for-sony-claims-report">put under mandatory crunch</a> to finish an internal demo, an alleged return to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">brutal work conditions</a> that plagued development of The Last of Us Part II.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has claimed that Embark Studios made ARC Raiders on a $75 million budget, including marketing.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders is easily one of the most popular titles from 2025, with Embark Studios hitting it out of the park with their new extraction adventure. The title also received a massive update recently, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-significantly-impacts-looting-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broke some systems</a> but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-update-1-13-0-patch-notes-solo-vs-squads-bird-city-open-parties-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added a lot of new content</a>. However, today we aren’t talking about that; instead, we are talking about how much it costs to make the game. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-budget-reportedly-revealed">ARC Raiders Budget Reportedly Revealed</h2>



<p>In the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58P5sZJ3Vho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SIFTD Games</a> video, industry analyst Michael Pachter revealed the budget for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a>. The new video explores whether Ubisoft will survive after the recent restructuring announcement, with Patcher sharing his insights on several topics. Towards the end of the video, Patcher discusses different game budgets and timelines, where the cost of making ARC Raiders was revealed. </p>



<p>Patcher states that Ubisoft taking 5 years to develop a game and selling only 5 million units is not sustainable; “3 years is plenty.” He then talks about people bringing Rockstar into comparison, which might be $1.5-2 billion on GTA 6, but don’t understand that “they are going to make that $2 billion back in the first week.” </p>



<p>The analyst adds that everybody shouldn’t be comparing themselves to “GTA, FIFA, or the former glory of Call of Duty,” instead, they should compare themselves to ARC Raiders. Patcher then drops a secret, stating, “ARC Raiders cost $75 million to make.” It was developed over 3 years, had a team of 70 developers, and included marketing in the budget. Patcher added that the game has already made $500 million from 12 million-plus units sold and will “probably” make close to a billion. </p>

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 gave us plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">juicy reveals</a>, but few were as surprising as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-galactic-racer-puts-pod-racing-back-on-the-menu">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a>, a spiritual successor of sorts to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-episode-1-racer">Episode I: Racer</a> and the overlooked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-jail-break-star-wars-racer-revenge">Racer Revenge</a>. It looked stunning, but fans had one fear following its reveal: there were no old-school podracers to be found in the trailer.</p>
<p>While that last-second Sebulba tease already rekindled our hopes and dreams, <a href="https://fusegames.com/">Fuse Games</a> CEO and co-founder Matt Webster has now confirmed podracing will return alongside all sorts of other vehicles: "You can’t really make a Star Wars racing experience and not have podracing, can you? The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the Star Wars galaxy," the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">Criterion</a> vet <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">told GamesRadar</a> following the exciting reveal.</p> <figure>

<p>The question now is whether an older Sebulba, Anakin Skywalker's first nemesis, is the exception among a highly varied roster of racers or he'll be joined by other known faces that we saw in The Phantom Menace's lengthy Boonta Eve Classic scene. Galactic Racer takes place after the fall of the Empire, so it's been decades since podracing's glory days, but it's time to speak up, Ben Quadinaros stans.</p>
<p>What we know for sure is that Fuse Games was looking to reinvent Star Wars racing games without forgetting about their legacy: "We wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. Galactic Racer offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes." The mention of several solo and multiplayer modes is interesting here, as we'd only read about a unique runs-based "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4078430/STAR_WARS_Galactic_Racer/">story-driven campaign</a>" and regular PvP multiplayer via the materials released so far.</p><p>As much as we'd love to know more, it's likely we won't be hearing from Fuse Games for a while following Galactic Racer's big announcement, as the studio is now focusing on getting it ready for a tentative 2026 launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, but with Burnout and Need for Speed pedigree, we have a really good feeling about this.</p>

<p>And it's riding high on Metacritic</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Well, we can't reach them all as they drop, that's for sure. With so many games releasing at any given time, sometimes things that should and do appeal to our Nintendo sensibilities get lost in the mix. And so has been the case — until now! — with Sleepy Castle Studios and Wing It! Creative's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/escape_from_ever_after">Escape from Ever After</a>.</p>
<p>This colourful turn-based RPG launched on Switch back on 23rd January, and it's inspired by none other than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/paper_mario">Paper Mario</a> games. Hold on a minute. Mario? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-super-mario-games-of-all-time">We know that guy!</a></p>
<p>Of course, this is far from the first RPG to attempt to emulate the glorious good times of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</a> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-paper-mario-games-of-all-time">the best one</a>), but it does seem, judging by the reception so far at least, that this might be a bit of a belter.</p>
<p>Assuming the role of Flynt Buckler, players here are charged with setting off for the HQ (that's a big imposing castle made out to look like corporate offices) of arch nemesis, Tinder. Now that's a scary big baddie name, innit. Here's some more from the game's official blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It turns out that storybooks are an untapped market ripe with valuable resources, cheap labor, and profit to be had—so naturally, real-world conglomerate Ever After Inc.™ found a way to intervene! With Tinder’s Castle as their new corporate headquarters, Ever After Inc. is hellbent on taking over every storybook they can. With no choice but to get a job, Flynt Buckler must team up with his former nemesis Tinder in order to climb the corporate ladder and take down Ever After Inc. from the inside!</p>
<p>Fight in a fun, fast-paced battle system that rewards experimentation and strategy</p>
<p>Build and customize your party—every character has unique skills that can be equipped and upgraded throughout your journey</p>
<p>Engage in office banter, help your storybook coworkers, and decorate your office as you climb the corporate ladder</p>
<p>Explore vast storybook worlds brimming with sidequests, treasures, and secret</p>
<p>Stories within stories: experience a charming and lively narrative where the rules are constantly changing</p>
<p>A jazzy, big-band soundtrack that keeps the energy pumping throughout</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Judging by the trailer up top, this looks like it nails the graphical style of the Paper Mario games just about right, and then proceeds to do its own thing (thankfully) with plenty of silly references to modern corporate life and other fun to boot.</p>
<p>It's currently sitting on an <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/escape-from-ever-after/">82 on Metacritic</a>, and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996390/Escape_from_Ever_After/">"Overwhelmingly Positive" response on Steam</a> with over 500 user reviews at the time of writing. Colour us very interested, indeed!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[World War Z x The Walking Dead brings slow zombies to a fast zombie shooter]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/02/world-war-z-x-the-walking-dead-review/</link>
            <guid>1422556</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s two types of zombies: slow zombies and fast zombies. While it’s the slower, shambling hordes of rotting flesh and bitey teeth that defined the zombie horror of 60s and 70s cinema, by the 2000s we needed something a bit more to get our pulse pounding. The House of the Dead games brought speedier zombies to test your lightgun reflexes (and drain your pockets of coins), but it was really 28 Days Later that redefined the speed and ferocity of the undead for the masses.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/world-war-z">World War Z</a> has straddled that divide. Max Brooks’ original novel featured the slower, more implacable kind of undead, but by the time it was adapted into film and video game, those zombies had taken up track and field. Now, with World War Z x <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead</a>, it’s coming full circle in a pretty unusual way.</p>
<p><iframe title="World War Z x The Walking Dead - DLC Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VjphXT9vAMU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>World War Z x The Walking Dead does what it says on the tin. This is the game of the movie with DLC based on the TV show. It’s like sitcom plots where the parents of a young couple also end up falling in love.</p>
<p>Four of the key characters from The Walking Dead are present –&nbsp;Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Michonne, and Negan –&nbsp;all looking like their TV selves. Don’t expect this video game Norman Reedus to trick age verification apps, even if he and Andrew Lincoln did turn up to record their voice lines. Despite Negan being one of the main antagonists of the series, he’s lumped in to fight alongside the others through the DLC’s three missions. These take you back to The Prison, the Alexandria Safe Zone and Grady Memorial Hospital, though it’s not quite clear how these fit in with the timeline –&nbsp;Negan comments about Alexandria in such a way to suggest that he doesn’t know where it is yet. Speaking of Negan, I quickly tired of hearing that he’s “feeding the beast” every other time he reloads.</p>


<p>The immediate difference that you’ll feel is that, yes, these are slower zombie hordes that stumble their way in your direction instead of coming at a mad sprint. They still come in large numbers, exhibit all of the horde mechanics of the base game, like clambering over fences and walls, and can sneak up on your surprisingly well, but it’s really their increased toughness that means they remain roughly as threatening as the faster hordes. Let any one of them get too close and they can still grapple you down to the ground and kill you.</p>
<p>There’s also special zombies as well. The Spiked Walker is all stabbed through with spiky blades, meaning that you need to keep a distance to avoid getting impaled, but all of the specials from the main game return. They’re one of the main stylistic departures, moving faster, leaping and charging, and screaming or exploding in clouds of gas depending on which one they are.</p>

<p>Each of the three levels lasts for around 30 minutes, running through their locations, often having you deal with situations like finding computer terminals or putting out fires through more open patches, and then building up to a climactic horde defence, where you place down extra traps to help stave off the shambling masses.</p>
<p>While you can still find yourself outnumbered and surprised, you’re still running around with plenty of ammo and tools for dealing with large crowds, defusing some of the desperation that’s felt through every big zombie encounter in the comics and TV series. Trying to deal damage to the zombie noggins with regular guns does add a little pressure for better aim, but then you can find the explosive crossbow, which is as powerful as you would expect.</p>

<p>Having more levels for World War Z is always good, and it’s neat to visit key locations from The Walking Dead with key characters and (mostly) slower zombies, but the gameplay ends up as an odd hodge-podge of the two. It might not be saying much given the competition, but this still ends up as the best straight-up action game in The Walking Dead franchise, and proof of concept that a full game could be worth a shake.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> has dropped rather substantially from its second-place debut, and now finds itself way down at 17th — just one place behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which has made a surprise rebound this week, we might add.</p>
<p>Of course, this opens things up at the top of the pile, and the usual suspects have slotted in to fill the gap. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> retains the top spot, followed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. No surprises there, then.</p>

            <p>Bandai Namco has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>'s third season, packing a "back to basics" balance adjustment and four new characters. Three of those characters, returning veterans from the series' history, were also revealed in the announcement.</p>
<p>This update comes following the second season, which proved controversial as it stayed true to the overly-aggressive direction established when the game first released. Mechanics like Heat Dash allowed players to sidestep (ironically) traditional thoughtful defensive play. Season 2 drew plenty of ire from series veterans, and there seems to be a sense of refreshement in the community on the back of this announcemnet.</p>
<p>This season 3 trailer, showing less-flashy combos, sidestepping actually <em>working</em>, appears to be returning to a more traditional Tekken approach.</p>

<p>As for those four characters present in Season 3 as DLC, we saw a brief in-engine appearance of Kunimitsu. She'll be coming in Spring 2026, while Bob is coming in Summer in his regular Robust form. Roger Jr, the (in)famous boxing Kangaroo, will be hopping into the roster come Autumn. The fourth DLC character, as well as a purchasable DLC stage, will be the final addition in 2026's Winter season. These have not yet been revelead, however. Will it be another legacy character, or a brand-new figher? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The season 3 pass will go on sale on the 10th February, which will come digitally packaged with the Aurora costume pack: a total of 44 in-game costumes for the whole cast including upcoming season 3 characters.</p>

            <p>
Nine years after securing $3.2 million on Kickstarter and mere weeks after launching into Steam Early Access, MMORPG Ashes Of Creation is in humongous difficulties. The game’s entire leadership team have allegedly quit “in protest” at decisions made by the board of Intrepid Studios, with creative director Steven Sharif accusing board members of “directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out”. Other staff have announced that they've been laid off, with one calling it the end of the studio.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ashes-of-creation-kickstarter">Kickstarted back in 2017</a>, Ashes Of Creation finally <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/">launched in Steam early access</a> on 11th December. It’s an ambitious concoction - a game in which players will collectively organise to “build cities” and “forge empires” amongst other realm-rewriting feats - but the early access launch version has attracted a mixed user reviewer response. 
</p>
<p>Intrepid sought to reassure the nay-sayers in <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">a blog post on 29th January</a>, listing a few problems such as cheating and performance issues, but a few players noted that this “director’s letter” was attributed to the AOC team rather than Sharif. In hindsight, some of the language in the post strikes me as rather ominous. For example:</p>
<blockquote>Game development, especially at this scale, is rarely linear. Systems evolve. Assumptions are challenged. Foundations must sometimes be reworked, so what comes next can stand strong. That process can be uncomfortable, particularly in an open development environment where you see the seams as they’re stitched. But it is also what allows us to build something ambitious, durable, and worthy of your investment.</blockquote>
<p>
Then, on Saturday January 31st, director of communications Margaret Krohn abruptly declared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that her time at Intrepid had "officially ended”, while claiming that other developers had lost their jobs. Asked whether Ashes Of Creation had been cancelled, she replied: "I don't work there anymore, so I can't answer that for you. Personally, I don't know how they would make it when the heart and soul of the product, the amazing dev team, was all laid off." 
</p><p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGamesN</a>, senior environment artist Adam Anthony, QA engineer Keith McAvoy, senior character artist Jessica Jennings, and animator Brad Constantine have all announced on LinkedIn that they’ve been laid off. Anthony has referred to these events as "the closing of Intrepid Studios”.
</p>
<p>
Sharif has also given some comment on Discord, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ashes-of-creations-leadership-team-quits-in-protest-as-director-accuses-board-of-decisions-he-could-not-ethically-agree-with-or-carry-out">Eurogamer</a>. "I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation," he wrote in the wake of Krohn’s post. "Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out.</p>
<p>"As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support. Following my resignation, much of the senior leadership resigned. Following those departures, the Board made the decision to issue [Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification] Act notices and proceed with a mass layoff.
</p>
<p>
"I cannot responsibly speak to further details at this time due to ongoing legal and governance matters. What I can say is that the developers and staff acted in good faith and deserved better than the uncertainty that they are now facing. I am incredibly dismayed at the situation."
</p><p>
We’ll reach out to Intrepid to ask whether Intrepid has, indeed, been closed. Best of luck to all the devs now looking for new work. Ashes Of Creation is still available on Steam, as of writing - there's a 'development update livestream' planned for Friday 13th February, but something tells me they'll change the schedule.
</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/</link>
            <guid>1422514</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/from-medieval-combat-to-combat-mechs-new-crimson-desert-gameplay-overview-highlights-the-story-pywel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of the first video</a> in a series dedicated to the game's mechanics, <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <span>also conducted&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hPXEVG-X5g" target="_blank">an interview with Destin Legarie</a>, in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;discussed</span> the game's length.</p>



<p>Powers refused to provide a specific number, claiming that it only fostered negative discussion from both ends of the spectrum (those who don't have much time to play and those who have more free time). However, he did share some interesting tidbits: the <strong>main campaign is apparently just a very small percentage of the overall content available in Crimson Desert</strong>, and he said there's lots to do even after the main campaign is over. Furthermore, Powers added that <strong>he spent about 50 hours just on side activities</strong>, such as crafting. Overall, the game is "massive".</p>



<p><em>Respectfully, I dislike this question. I understand why it is asked, but players devour games in different ways. Some barrel through the main campaign immediately, but providing a specific number is difficult. If I give a large number, parents with limited time may feel discouraged or intimidated by the game. Conversely, students with more free time might find the same number too small. Regardless of the figure I provide, it feels like a losing proposition. I have been consistent in my refusal to provide a specific number, but <strong>I can say the game is massive</strong>. What I appreciate about it is the flexibility; you can choose what to do in each session based on your available time. There is a constant sense of progression and reward, even in the smallest activities.</em></p>



<p><em>Last week, I spent 50 hours playing the game. I sat down and played for 50 hours, focusing primarily on side content. I was not even fishing; I was mining, upgrading weapons, and testing mechanics. Since there is a set difficulty for all enemies, you can grind to overcome challenges through sheer willpower if you choose. This is an intended design choice. We never want a player to feel they must simply "get good" to proceed. If you invest time, you can beat everything. Alternatively, an incredibly skilled player could run right through it. The game should not prevent progression simply because a player does not understand a specific mechanic.</em></p>



<p><em>It is impossible to provide a definitive answer for open-world games because people rarely follow only the critical path. However, the main campaign represents only a small percentage of the overall content. For me, <strong>the game truly expanded after the credits. I realized I had barely scratched the surface of certain factions and their entire quest lines</strong>. Because I work on the game, I am aware of the available content, yet even after finishing the story, I realized I had missed entire areas because I was too focused on the main path. There is a vast amount of content to return to, including deep customization options and systems to invest time in. The developers' approach was to create an open world that encourages exploration. Their strength lies in creating emerging, immersive worlds where players can spend thousands of hours.</em></p>



<p>Crimson Desert is definitely one of the most anticipated games set to release in early 2026.

            <p>The new custodians of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> have announced that they’re giving the city builder’s UI an “extreme makeover” in the game’s next patch, while tuning up the day/night lighting, and ensuring that snow actually sticks to the ground. I had an “extreme makeover” once and ended up with ginger hair for several months. Being a redhead didn’t really pan out for me, but I'm cautiously enthusiastic about Skylines 2’s new toolbar.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“We know that the UI can sometimes be a bit confusing when it comes to communicating things,” Iceflake <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/502848649741467986?l=english">write on Steam</a>, “and while it’s still a work in progress, we’re really excited to show you the first changes we have made towards making the UI clearer to understand. </p>
<p>“We have streamlined the onboarding process and changed some icons to be more expressive and easier to understand the context from them. The toolbar has had the most changes as the colors and the visual style have gone through a big makeover. Now there are more round shapes, and the demand bars have more focus.”</p>
<p>Here’s a WIP screen. Behold the additional roundness and focus. Extreme enough for you?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the devs are adding the ability to set custom colours for buildings and vehicles, inspired by yenyang’s “Recolor” mod – they may also eventually let you twiddle with the colour of trees and plants, favourite a colour, and apply colours to whole districts.</p><p>Aside from tuning up the daytime and nighttime lighting, they’ve rebalanced the cloud system so that you’ll probably see more clouds, and made it so that fog levels now respond to other weather – you might get more fog during storms, for example. Snow will also settle properly in lots, once the patch is live.</p>
<p>“We have already begun the process of improving other aspects of the environment, like ground textures and how to make them look more realistic, as well as being able to plop trees much closer together and toggling their age,” the devs add. “While some of these improvements might not be ready for this first patch, we are hopeful that they will be ready for the next one.”</p>
<p>They’ll describe the next patch’s mechanical changes in a separate blog post, and suggest that you “will be able to see these changes firsthand in the second half of February”. One thing that won’t come in the next patch is a planned in-game encyclopedia with a search function.</p>
<p>Iceflake Studios – a Paradox-owned joint previously known for post-apocalyptic city builder Surviving The Aftermath - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-creators-colossal-order-are-handing-the-series-over-to-the-surviving-the-aftermath-devs">took over development</a> from original Skylines 2 developers Colossal Order at the start of 2026, following an announcement last November. At the time, Paradox framed cutting ties as a “mutual” decision, while Colossal Order said they had left to "work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities”. </p><p>The cynical read, of course, is that Paradox actually gave CO the boot and are simply masking their disappointment about how Cities: Skylines 2 has performed. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">had a mixed launch reception</a> and required <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">a lot of fixing</a>. I think it’ll take more than flakier backyards and a rounded UI to right the ship, but it’s a good start.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Beast of Reincarnation Is No Soulslike: “We’ve Made It so That It’s Enjoyable for Even Those Who Aren’t Good at Action Games”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-no-soulslike-confirms-dev/</link>
            <guid>1422499</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Japanese developer<strong> Game Freak</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-this-nier-beast-of-reincarnation-gameplay-and-soundtrack-immediately-bring-yoko-taros-series-to-mind/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the first proper look at their new franchise</a>, <strong>Beast of Reincarnation</strong>, during the recent <strong>Xbox Developer Direct Show 2026</strong>. Following that appearance, several gamers noted the <strong>apparent similarities with the Soulslike genre</strong>. However, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/63919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Famitsu</a>, Game Director <strong>Kota Furushima</strong> revealed <strong>several key differences</strong>, such as the design goal of making the game completable even for those who are not action game experts, and the ability for players to lower the difficulty. This is <strong>famously absent in most Soulslike games</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We're trying to make it so that even people who aren't good at action games can enjoy it. You can also choose the difficulty level, so if you're unsure, I think it's best to lower the difficulty level. Personally, I'd be happy if people could enjoy the game by taking an approach that actually lowers the difficulty level, by devising the skill tree system and Koo's support.</em></p>



<p>That's not to say there won't be times when you will be challenged in Beast of Reincarnation. Again, though, Furushima stressed that <strong>they're not trying to make a game where you're forced to fight a boss hundreds of times</strong>, which is practically a key component of a Soulslike game.</p>



<p><em>I think there will be times when you get defeated, and I want players to enjoy trial and error, trying different fighting styles next time, or changing Kuu's skills. However, I don't intend for players to never be able to clear the game on their first try, or to have to retry dozens or hundreds of times, so I hope that players will pick it up without being too scared.</em></p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the Game Director confirmed that the protagonists, <strong>Emma the Sealer and Koo, each have three skill trees</strong>, enabling a variety of playstyles. For example, as well as close-range combat, you can attack with long-range weapons and perform stealth actions. There are also other ways to change your fighting style; while you can learn action-oriented skills, you can also acquire passive skills that simply boost Emma and Koo's stats or recovery rate.</p>



<p>Beast of Reincarnation is currently slated for a <strong>Summer 2026</strong> launch window on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>. Stay tuned for more details as the release date approaches.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Disney Lorcana Winterspell Expansion: First Hands-On With Darkwing Duck, Pocohontas, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/disney-lorcana-winterspell-expansion-first-hands-on-with-darkwing-duck-pocohontas-and-more</link>
            <guid>1422469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Disney Lorcana kicks off the new year with its upcoming release of Winterspell, the latest expansion set for the popular card game. The eleventh set will have an early release on February 13 at your local game stores, followed by the wide release on February 20. The exciting bit for every card game and their new sets or expansions is the change in gameplay and what that means for the meta. There’s also, of course, the beautiful new cards for those collectors out there. In Winterspell, the game finally brings in characters like Pocahontas, Tod from The Fox and the Hound, and even Darkwing Duck. In addition, different versions of characters already here make an appearance, like Lilo and Stitch, alongside new friends who are prominently featured in this new set. With all these new cards and the expected power creep, players will have a good excuse to tweak some competitive decks or make new ones entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of the newly introduced characters to Lorcana, Pocahontas and friends have a slew of cards to play around with. Namely, the legendary Pocahontas Peacekeeper card, which has a fun shift-related ability. When you play her onto the field using shift (which is upgrading an already played version of Pocahontas in play), you can freeze out your opponent’s characters from challenging until the start of your next turn as long as none of your characters challenged the turn it’s played. This means your characters can quest freely without having to worry about your opponent defeating them through challenges or battles on their turn. It’s quite a strong ability that also lines up with Pocahontas’ character in avoiding battles and creating peace. Some of the other cards from Pocahontas also focus on questing versus challenging, like Wisdom of the Willow or Mother’s Necklace. In a game where questing for lore ultimately wins you the match, I can see Pocahontas decks potentially lore rushing, since there are so many positives to questing with these cards than trying to control your opponent’s characters individually.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/darkwing-1769738267759.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another legendary card showcasing a new character to Lorcana is Darkwing Duck Cool Under Pressure. This character also has the ability to shift, but his power comes from his passive synergy with item cards. During the player’s turn, they may pay 1 ink or mana to deal 2 damage to a chosen character whenever an item is banished or discarded. Being the Batman-like character that he is, this is a pretty cool way to emphasize Darkwing Duck’s use of gadgets. He also has a secondary ability that allows him to challenge or battle ready characters if they have the classification of Villain on their card. Normally, you can only challenge rested or tapped characters, so unlike Pocahontas, Darkwing Dark is all about fighting. Other Darkwing Duck-related cards fall into the Steel and Sapphire type categories, which lines up with that color combo’s style of play. Between the toughness of Steel cards, and the numerous items and control cards in Sapphire, this legendary Darkwing Duck can wreak havoc with the right build. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to these strong character cards, there are some location-based ones that could make games a bit more interesting. For example, the Game Preserve Protected Land location can gain Evasive itself if there’s a character with Evasive on that location. The Tod Playful Kit card, for example, has the ability to give a character evasive each time he quests, so the Game Preserve location will ideally have evasive every turn as long as Tod is on it, giving himself evasive. Another The Fox and the Hound card, Education or Elimination, is a song card with a similar ability of giving evasive. There are other location-based characters, like the new legendary Elsa Ice Artisan, which allows the owner to exert or rest a character with 3 or less strength when that Elsa or a location is played. While she’s at a location, she also gains an additional 3 lore when questing, so you want her on locations at all times. These are just some examples of the fun stuff you can do with various aspects of the gameplay getting further support. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/30/moanaruby-1769749875085.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Now that rotating sets have affected Disney Lorcana as well, that leaves players with a smaller pool of cards to optimize their decks. With that said, some older cards do get reprints, but it’s all for the sake of balancing the game. In a recent big competitive event, the top cut saw a lot of control decks with 5 of the top 8 running Sapphire. Amethyst was also popular with 5 of the top 8 players representing the color as well. Ultimately, a Sapphire/Emerald deck took the top spot in a mirror match that focused on filtering the deck with card draw alongside some removal and hand manipulation. Unfortunately, some of the new rare Sapphire and Emerald Winterspell cards don’t really work on this champion deck like Darkwing Duck, since there are no items in that deck. Still, cards like the new Moana Curious Explorer could be a worthy addition to keep your hand size while building up ink or mana through a different source like the discard pile. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another deck in the top cut is an Amethyst/Steel deck that revolves around playing many characters, and being able to draw more because of low hand sizes and a legendary Dumbo. A new Winterspell card that could fit very well in this competitive deck is Angel Experiment 624, who can gain resist +2 if the player has no cards in hand. A fairly easy feat for a deck that likes to have fewer than 3 cards in hand. Angel also has another ability to discard a card to deal 2 damage to a chosen character. Yet another option to keep that hand size low. The deck is already proven, and this Angel card just optimizes it a bit more.</p><p>The Darkwing Duck cards make him the hero he was made to be.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One color lacking in the competitive scene lately is Ruby, with no representation in the top 32 of that recent major event from late last year. It seems to be due to the card set rotations banning certain staple cards in the currently constructed meta, so hopefully the new Ruby cards can give the color a fighting chance. For instance, this new legendary Wreck-It Ralph Raging Wrecker card is a triple threat with his ability to get stronger, quest for 3 lore, and a potential board clear if given the support. It’s a bit expensive, but it’s nothing Sapphire can’t achieve with its ramping capabilities. With this and the location support Elsa Ice Artisan, there could be some meaningful Ruby decks in this upcoming meta. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this is all speculation, but that’s the fun part about getting into new cards and brewing new decks. Do you follow the meta and tweak decks to their optimized state, or do you build a spicy meta breaker to keep your friends and opponents on their toes? The Pocahontas cards seem to favor questing and the protection of that strategy. The Darkwing Duck cards make him the hero he was made to be while making opposing characters villains with negative effects. Plus, familiar characters like Moana get a new spin for an everchanging competitive scene. Players will have a fun go with these new Winterspell cards, and it’ll be interesting to see what people gravitate towards as the season progresses.

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#967)—Clues and Answers for Monday, February 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-2-967/</link>
            <guid>1422430</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Monday, and while it’s time for a new week in your world, it’s also time for a new NYT Connections puzzle. I know you love them! But I also know you sometimes want to get the best NYT Connections hints squared away as soon as possible to start your day. That’s why I’ve outlined the answers and solutions below, just for you!</p>



<p>Read on to quickly resolve today’s NYT Connections puzzle.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov Anti-Cheat Plea Gaining Community Traction]]></title>

            <guid>1422418</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov has long had an issue with cheaters, and the developer in Battlestate Games has always professed how much of a full-time job it is to constantly combat them. For every head you eviscerate, two more pop up – it’s that adage linked to the concept of the hydra, but in this case, the mythical monster is very real, and it concerns <strong>malicious gamers</strong>.</p>



<p>Recently, a new community-backed initiative (or plea) has started gaining traction within the Escape from Tarkov space. Long-term fans of the hardcore extraction title are requesting that Battlestate Games implement <strong>PlaySafe ID</strong> verification, echoing a successful move made recently by SCUM’s developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-could-playsafe-id-change-the-game-in-escape-from-tarkov">Could PlaySafe ID Change the Game in Escape from Tarkov?</h2>



<p><a href="https://playsafeid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlaySafe ID</a> is all about anti-cheat mechanics and player protection, encouraging the facilitation of verified matchmaking features that link <strong>legitimate players </strong>with <strong>other </strong>legitimate players. The technical infrastructure behind it is much more complex than that, but the long and short of it is that it <strong>works </strong>as an anti-cheat solution and is <strong>not </strong>disruptive.</p>



<p>In a trending suggestion on the Tarkov Community site, which regularly hosts player-backed initiatives ranked by user votes, it has been requested that Battlestate Games ‘finally beat cheaters with PlaySafe ID’.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://tarkov.community/posts/10017/finally-beat-cheaters-with-playsafeid-just-like-scum-did" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the suggestion had pulled in</a> 153 total votes, of which 93% are in favor of the recommendation. In the comments, users spoke positively of PlaySafe ID and the potential protection gains the company could provide if it were to join forces with Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>The suggestion reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This isn’t about punishing legit players — it’s about finally protecting them. At this point, a system like PlaySafe ID feels like the only solution that can actually work long-term.</p>



<p>So, after the successful rollout of PlaySafeID in SCUM, it’s time to seriously talk about bringing it to Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Let’s finally get rid of cheaters, that have plagued us since the alpha of this game</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PlaySafe ID started probing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-firm-plans-rid-tarkov-hackers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Escape from Tarkov space</a> back in June 2025, revealing an interest in working with the developers to improve the state of play in the world’s biggest extraction shooter title.</p>



<p>In August 2025, the company backed an investigative report and survey that revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/report-gamers-encounter-cheaters-online-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">more than 80% of gamers</a> had encountered cheating in an online game. It’s no big secret that Escape from Tarkov is one of the most troubled games in that respect.</p>

      <p>The Pokémon Company has had to issue a formal apology after advertising an event on its official website that was scheduled to be held at the Yasukuni Shrine, a deeply controversial place that has been the epicentre of decades of social and political turmoil in Japan and around the world.</p><p>The event wasn't an official one--<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjn0nmnjmwo?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the BBC reports</u></a> it was being staged by a third party--but The Pokémon Company had it listed on their website regardless, which (after being discovered) prompted Chinese state media to write in the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, as quoted by the BBC:</p><blockquote>Brands that disregard history and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people will ultimately be abandoned...The relevant enterprises must accordingly take social responsibility and not make light of the heavy weight of history in the name of entertainment.</blockquote><p>This has not come at the most opportune time! China and Japan are in the middle of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_China%E2%80%93Japan_diplomatic_crisis?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a full-blown diplomatic crisis</u></a>, and the last thing anyone needed was news that a Pokémon event was being held at a shrine that, while dedicated to the memories of <em>all </em>Japanese soldiers killed in war since 1868, also contains the names of 1,066 convicted war criminals--all of whom served in China and the Pacific in the Second World War–<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversies_surrounding_Yasukuni_Shrine?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>which has made it a diplomatic flashpoint</u></a>.</p><p>A <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-china-yasumuni-pokemon-b826a5a8ecee7888e1a80322544e6b18?ref=aftermath.site"><u>statement </u></a>from The Pokémon Company says that not only are they apologising for advertising the event, but that it had been cancelled as well:</p><blockquote>After the incident was discovered, the event was promptly cancelled. We sincerely apologise for the various reactions and opinions that have been generated as a result of this publication.</blockquote><p>The company also says it will now "thoroughly review and strengthen" its processes, which shouldn't be too hard; adding a "don't promote events taking place at notorious war shrines in the middle of a diplomatic crisis" bullet point to the company handbook should do it.</p>
