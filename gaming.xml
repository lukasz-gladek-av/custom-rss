            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-out-beats-studio-pro-at-nearly-50-off-as-airpods-max-remain-full-price-2000654289</link>
            <guid>1386943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all deserve a pair of top-notch, headphones. Don’t be the person on the subway blasting TikToks at full volume. With a quality set of noise-canceling Beats Studio Pro headphones, you can enjoy watching some guy’s top five movie twists of all time in peace, without disturbing those around you. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">Right now, you can save a massive 49% on a pair of Beats Studio Pros over at Amazon, with each set priced at just $180.</a></p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro headphones support active noise cancellation, so you can filter out distracting background noises when you really want to focus in on whatever it is you’re listening to. This is great for when flying to overcome the loud noise of the plane engine as well as when just trying to ignore nearby conversations in a chatty office. Then when you do want to engage with the world once more, you can switch over to transparency mode to let outside noises come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The personalized spatial audio utilizes dynamic head tracking, ensuring you are placed right in the middle of a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience. Through the USB-C connection, you’ll enjoy pristine, lossless audio, making every track sound sharper and more detailed.</p>

<p>The multi-function on-ear controls allow you to effortlessly manage your music playback, activate Siri, or take phone calls—all without fumbling through your device. The voice-targeting microphone isolates your voice with incredible precision, ensuring that the person on the other end of your call hears only you, even in noisy, crowded environments.</p>
<h2>Match Your Style</h2>
<p>With a wide selection of colors to choose from, you can find a pair that fits your personal aesthetic. The classic black is always a reliable and timeless choice, but there are other fun options if you want to switch things up. Warm, earthy tones like deep brown or sandstone can complement your winter wardrobe, while bold options like matte white offer a fresh, eye-catching look. Personally, I’m partial to the two-toned sand gray.</p>



<p>When it comes to battery life, you’re covered. You’ll get a whopping 40 hours of total listening time before needing to recharge, which is more than enough for long flights or all-day listening sessions. And if you find yourself in a situation where you forgot to charge them and need your headphones immediately, don’t worry. Just 10 minutes of Fast Fuel charging will give you 4 hours of playback time. No more stressing over a dead battery.</p>
<p>Connecting these headphones to your devices is incredibly easy, thanks to their NFC compatibility. Simply tap your phone or tablet to pair it with the Beats Studio Pro. Whether you’re using an Apple or Android device, and you will be ready to go in seconds.</p>
<p>Normally, the Beats Studio Pro Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones are priced at $350, but right now, Amazon is offering them at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">You can grab a pair for $170 off, bringing the price down to just $180.</a> That’s an impressive 49% savings, making it the perfect time to upgrade your audio experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony and Tencent have settled their Horizon clone lawsuit out of court, and Light of Motiram has been delisted from major platforms. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Sony has been battling Tencent in court over allegations of copying its Horizon video game series since August 2025. The case has had several developments over the past months, with both parties agreeing to extend the hearing dates. It now appears the case has been settled out of court. </p>







<h2 id="h-horizon-clone-lawsuit-confidentially-settled-by-sony-and-tencent">Horizon Clone Lawsuit Confidentially Settled By Sony and Tencent</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing has appeared in court, with both Sony and Tencent asking the court to dismiss the case, on the condition that both parties settle the lawsuit through an agreement. The case will be settled confidentially between the parties, and the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice. Additionally, all pending motions have been withdrawn, and Sony and Tencent will bear their own legal costs. </p>



<p>As the settlement is confidential, we do not know the terms of the agreement. However, we do know that the delisting of Light of Motiram might have been one of the points, as it has now been removed from all major storefronts. </p>



<p>There was a lot of back-and-forth on this case before they agreed to settle. Sony called Light of Motiram a “blatant knockoff” title and Tencent’s defense “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsense</a>“. <span>Tencent had also clapped back several times, stating that “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” In the <span>latest development, Tencent </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-agrees-to-pause-light-of-motiram-promotion-while-horizon-clone-lawsuit-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed to pause</a> Light of Motiram’s promotion and public testing</span> and not to prepone the release date. Now, we do not know what the future holds for this title. </p>







<p>In other news, Horizon Steel Frontiers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-the-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t the only Horizon multiplayer game</a> on the way.

It’s down to $121.55, a drop of 32%, which brings each deck down to around $30. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Given World Shaper is currently selling for $43 on its own, while Counter Intelligence is $36 (and that’s on sale), you’re getting a great deal here, allowing you to open up the decks and play right out of the box with a friend - or sell two of them on to buy singles to upgrade with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s saying nothing of the Collector Sample Pack in each, which includes a pair of cards in rare treatments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, this is a great deal for anyone curious about Edge of Eternities. It's also still the last wave of Commander decks from 2025, given they weren't offered in Spider-Man or Avatar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was the best-selling premium game in November, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, NBA 2K26, and other big hitters.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">This data comes via Matt Piscatella</a>, senior director at sales data company Circana. Releasing the findings on social media, Piscatella highlighted Black Ops 7's strong performance in spite of the game's mixed reception from fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>By hitting the number one spot in November in terms of combined physical and digital sales, the series has earned the number one sales spot in its launch month for 18 years in a row. It is worth noting that the other games present in November's top five best-sellers had their own launches in prior months.</p>

<p>As for other games that launched in November, Kirby Air Riders landed at the number 10 spot, though digital sales were not factored in its placement. The same is true of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which secured a spot at number 11.  Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> was the 18th best-selling game last month, over a decade since its initial release.</p><p>In spite of this relatively positive performance in its release month, Call of Duty as a franchise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">will be undoing some significant changes as Black Ops 7 had "not met" expectations from fans</a>. Specifically, there will no longer be back-to-back Modern Warfare or Black Ops releases moving forward.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to try the game out yet,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review"> Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review noted</a>: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

<p>Now, though, and as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/">The Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-8m-in-15-year-old-lawsuit-over-wii-controller-patent">Games Industry.biz</a>), the Japanese giant has finally had success, resulting in a <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">"nearly EUR 7 million"</a> payout ($8.2million).</p>
<p>The judgment in the case, which was reached in October and concerns BigBen's third-party Wiimotes, took a remarkably long time, especially given that the court originally found BigBen guilty of patent infringement <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-before-the-mannheim-district-court">back in 2011</a>. The ruling does give Nacon the right to appeal, and that is something they are currently doing, having "delayed the proceedings several times, for example by rejecting the court-appointed expert", according to <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">the press release</a> put out by Nintendo's German legal team.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The same press release highlights how the case is unusual due to Nintendo's damages calculations being made under a "lost profits theory":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Particularly significant: the court assumed that Nintendo would have made 100% of the sales made by BigBen, without any deductions in view of third-party suppliers that were active in the market. BigBen had argued that buyers, had they not bought the BigBen products, would have opted for other third-party controllers that were available. However, the court found that these third-party products were also highly likely to infringe the patent-in-suit. Citing case law from the German Federal Court of Justice, it stated that hypothetical mitigating circumstances that would have amounted to third-party activities that also trigger damages could not be taken into account in favor of the infringer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case is also of particular note as it's been so long-running that the actual damages have increased by €3 million due to interest rates 5% higher than central bank rates. "These delaying tactics have now proved costly," say Nintendo's lawyers. <em>Ouch.</em></p>
<p>Nacon is appealing, but right now this is looking like a significant legal win for Nintendo.</p>

            <p>Long-time Bioware creative director and lead designer James Ohlen is stepping away from his role as studio head at Archetype Entertainment, developers of Mass Effecty sci-fi shooter Exodus. Ohlen co-founded Archetype back in 2019 with Exodus, which is heavy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-like-exoduss-first-gameplay-video-features-duels-with-space-bears-and-chats-with-thankful-frogs">Matthew McConaughey and space bears</a> from what we've seen thus far, being the studio's debut game. Following abother trailer at last week's Geoff Awards, it's now set to come out in early 2027.</p>

<p>The news of a role shift for Ohlen under Archetype parent company Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast comes via report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/hasbro-hires-new-video-game-boss-as-exodus-studio-head-steps-down">Bloomberg</a>. "At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team," Hasbro corporate comms vice president Abby Hodes told the site in a statement.</p>
<p>She added that Ohlen will be staying on at Wizards of the Coast as a creative consultant, having "asked to shift his creative focus" to tabletop RPGs. Revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-bioware-devs-reveal-exodus-a-sci-fi-rpg-shooter-about-time-dilation-featuring-matthew-mcconaughey">back in 2023</a>, Exodus has looked in all of its trailers to be banking on a marriage of Mass Effecty roleplaying with time dilation-infused choice and consequence, while sprinkling some lens-flarey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exodus-devs-want-you-to-know-that-despite-matthew-mcconaugheys-ai-deal-not-a-drop-has-been-used-in-their-game-so-far">McConaughey movieness</a> on top for good measure. I can't say I'm 100% sure it'll be my cup of tea, but the bears and frogs in the 2024 trailer certainly nudged it slightly in that direction.</p><p>Bloomberg cite Archetype co-founder and general manager Chad Robertson as having recently re-affirmed that Hasbro ideally want Exodus to not only find success as a game, but to balloon out into a bunch of other media they can earn dough from. As such, Ohlen's shift to tabletoppery arguably isn't as surprising as it could be, though it does maybe seem a bit strange from the outside that the studio can shift into polish and tune mode with a year and a bit still to go before the game dons its spacesuit and jumps out of the airlock. Fair play if that's just a case of having been smart with deadline timescales, though.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohlen stepping down, the report cites Wizards of the Coast as having recruited former Blizzard vice president and Dreamhaven co-founder Paul Della Bitta to run one of their divisions. In less seat-filly news, those pesky coastal wizards also lifted the cover on magic-heavy action adventure Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons at the Geoffs, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Td1B8Ne3k">trailer</a> really craking up the smoke machines and declaring it'll be out in 2027 just like Exodus.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-just-crashed-past-yesterdays-record-low-after-another-sudden-price-drop-2000654337</link>
            <guid>1386901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s officially last-minute-panic time with just a week left to get your presents bought and wrapped, and the number of items on Amazon with the “arrives before Christmas” is dwindling, and dwindling&nbsp;<em>fast</em>. Our advice? Don’t panic, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">take a quick look at this awesome 36% off deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet</a>. It’s one of those rare tablets that’s kid-friendly while not being a glorified toy, so it’s a stellar $140 last-minute option for friends and family from young to old.</p>
<p>This 11-inch tablet comes with a robust 7,040mAh battery for hours of games, streaming, or actual work. Split-screen capability lets you run and see multiple apps simultaneously, and the slim and lightweight construction is good for little hands while also being tough enough to endure the occasional knocks and bumps that go hand in hand with kids using tech devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel Sanity Saver</h2>
<p>There’s really not a bad time to share the Galaxy A9+ with the kids, but the time for it to truly shine is when you’re taking a trip and need something — <em>anything</em> — to maintain sanity as you’re buckled in for a long flight or drive. The Galaxy Tab A9+ isn’t one of those kids-only tablets that keeps its allure for a short while before the conversation turns to “I want to use&nbsp;<em>your</em> tablet.” Nor is it a high-priced device that you hand over very reluctantly for fear of damage. Pass it to the backseat, or hand it across the aisle of the plane, fire up the Samsung Kids app, and rest easy while they’re engrossed in only the content you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Chances are that will include some streaming or videos, and the Galaxy A9+ brings that out in vivid fashion across its generous 11-inch screen with 1200p resolution and a brisk 90Hz refresh rate. The built-in speakers are loaded with Dolby Atmos tech for cinema-quality sound, or you can easily pair the A9+ tablet with wireless headphones or earbuds to keep the sound private. Preloading the Galaxy A9+ is easy when you have a generous 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card expansion options.</p>



<h2>Do It All for $150</h2>
<p>Once back in your hands (assuming you can actually get it back), the Galaxy A9+ is a stellar midrange tablet at an entry-level price. It’s especially good if you’re adding it to other Samsung tech products, from big-screen TVs to smart home devices, smartphones, and wireless earbuds. Casting content from the Galaxy A9+ to a Samsung smart TV is remarkably easy, and you can hand off calls and texts from a Samsung smartphone to the Galaxy Tab A9+ and take them across the house, even if you leave the phone behind.</p>
<p>Last-minute holiday shopping panic isn’t fun. But the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is, for adults and kids alike. It’s also the cure for your shopping anxiety because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">Amazon’s offering it for a crazy low $140 price and they can get it to you in time to make it under the tree.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-winterfest-yule-trooper-location-drops/</link>
            <guid>1386898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh content has arrived in Fortnite with a strong festive feel following the start of the Winterfest event, and Yule Trooper is the latest boss waiting to be found in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>Winterfest 2025 kicked off on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-december-18-winterfest-2025-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 18 with a new patch</a>, bringing map changes, new weapons, and a host of new content to the game, including a new boss to defeat and turn into.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Yule Trooper in Fortnite and want to know where he can be found and the rewards he drops, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-yule-trooper-in-fortnite-winterfest">Where to Find Yule Trooper in Fortnite Winterfest</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Start your hunt. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Similar to the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7, the Yule Trooper boss does not have a specific set spawn location. Instead, there are several points across the island where they can be found.</strong></p>



<p>When hunting the Yule Trooper, the best bet is to stick to the snow-covered landscapes in the north of the map, which is home to the majority of Yule Trooper’s spawn points.</p>



<p>Clawsy Lodge, a new location added in the Winterfest update, is a decent place to start hunting, as there’s a decent chance one of the bosses will spawn there. Additionally, it’s fairly close to other potential spawn locations, like Painted Palms, and there’s a large chunk of loot available to claim.</p>



<p>In general, stick to the north of the map and the snowy environments for the best chance of encountering Yule Trooper, though the lack of a guaranteed spawn location can make it tricky to get to him first.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-yule-trooper-drops-in-fortnite-winterfest">All Yule Trooper Drops in Fortnite Winterfest</h2>



<p><strong>Yule Trooper has an array of loot dropped when defeated, with the main reward being the item that allows you to transfer into the boss yourself.</strong></p>



<p>When transformed into Yule Trooper, the Jolly Sprint ability can be activated, which grants increased stamina and vitality. However, like the other boss transform items, the downside is you will be marked on the map for nearby enemies, though you will have additional health and Shields.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, defeating Yule Trooper provides Yule Trooper’s Holo Rush SMG, a Mythic version of the weapon that can be found elsewhere on the map, and, like other bosses available this season, he also drops a Chug Jug when eliminated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Cold Snap update for ARC Raiders has introduced a wave of new content, headlined by a brand-new Project called Flickering Flames. This limited-time Project is split into five distinct steps, each requiring you to track down and submit a specific set of items in order to progress.</p>



<p>Completing Flickering Flames isn’t just about lending a helping hand, either. There are some genuinely worthwhile rewards on offer for those willing to put the time in. That said, the challenge shouldn’t be underestimated—several of the item requirements are demanding, and gathering everything before the deadline will take careful planning and consistent raiding.</p>







<p>With the clock ticking, knowing exactly what to prioritise can make all the difference. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Flickering Flames <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/check-stash-value-arc-raiders-expedition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project in ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have left to complete it before the event comes to an end.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Flickering Flames Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stage 2 of the Project. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Flickering Flames Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil.</strong></p>



<p>None of the requirements at any stage is extensively rare or hard to come by—at least, none other than the Candleberries. In total, you’ll need 260 Candleberries across the five stages of the Project.

<figure><figcaption>It won’t be around forever. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Flickering Flames Project for ARC Raiders expires on January 13, 2026. </strong></p>



<p>With the event launching on December 16, 2025, that leaves just under a month to make meaningful progress. While that may sound generous on paper, the reality is a bit more demanding. The Project requires a long list of specific upgrades and materials, many of which can only be obtained through consistent raiding and successful extractions.</p>







<p>If you’re aiming to complete the Flickering Flames Project in full, it’s best to start chipping away at the requirements as early as possible. Spreading your runs out over the course of the event not only reduces the grind but also gives you more flexibility to adapt if luck isn’t on your side during raids.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione's Horses was the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam - one of if not the biggest digital PC storefronts - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>
<p>Horses has now been out for a couple of weeks, and there is finally some good news for Santa Ragione. The studio has announced its game, in which players tend to a farm of naked humans in horse masks, has sold over 18k copies. In terms of income, that is "approximately $65,000 in net revenue", Santa Ragione said. This means the studio has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved," the studio said.</p>

<p>However, while of course great news for the team, this still isn't enough to secure Santa Ragione's future, and the company has not yet made enough from Horses to begin working on a new game. "If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime," the studio explained today. "Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p>So, while the debut of Horses has "been meaningful and positive in important ways", the fragmented road to release - which along with Steam's controversial ban has also included delays, and key team members taking on additional work elsewhere - has still been damaging for the studio.</p>
<p>"While the launch of Horses compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam's economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," Santa Ragione said. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p>

<p>Santa Ragione closed today's news by taking aim at Valve, which faced 'censorship' criticisms from developers and players following its decision to not distribute Horses on Steam. Santa Ragione is still unsure of the exact specific reason that Valve decided to eschew Horses.</p>
<p>"We want to emphasise that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," Santa Ragione said.</p>
<p>"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly.</p>
<p>"We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-cursed-horror-game-horses-in-which-you-tend-to-a-farm-of-naked-humans-in-horse-masks-hasnt-been-cancelled">though this was delayed into 2025</a>, before it finally released in November.</p>
<p>"Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Eurogamer's four star Horses review</a>.</p>

<p>Although initially receiving a staggered release between 2021 and 2022 on Windows, iOS, and Android, the series arguably saw a huge boost when it made its way to the Switch and PS4 in 2023, with a release on Xbox following in 2024.</p>
<p>Consisting of the first six games in the series, the total sales does, in theory, average out at around 1 million per game, but in reality, it's likely that sales have skewed heavily in favour of more popular entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_iv">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Regardless, it's an impressive result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ka7wISlvfFw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKa7wISlvfFw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf84lhoiqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Square Enix last confirmed in March 2025 that the series had sold a total of 5 million copies, which means it's managed an extra 1 million in the months following.</p>
<p>We imagine Square Enix must be pretty thrilled with the sales so far, but then the company has garnered a rather unfortunate reputation for being constantly disappointed in its games' performance, so who knows.</p>
<p>We'll be seeing more Final Fantasy on the Switch 2 when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. A demo showcasing the beginning of the game is now available for download from the eShop.</p>

            <p>
What music do you expect from a 4X game? As regards historical 4X games, I predict a mixture of triumphal philharmonics and noodly period skits, as though wandering between the main floor and the giftshop in some museum of empire. If it's a fantasy game, I think of choirs blaring wordlessly or singing doggerel Latin or Welsh. If it's a sci-fi game, I think of choirs and synth.</p>
<p>I haven't heard any choirs so far in Hard Void, though I may have encountered some synth. As regards the trailer and demo, it deals exclusively in heart-battering techno. It sounds like 3am in a club I wouldn't have been old enough to get into, when this kind of stuff was in vogue. I can picture the bouncer glaring at me. Gosh, the bouncer sure has funny-shaped pupils. Mates, I fear the bouncer may be Lovecraftian.

The trancefloor soundtrack is one thing that interests me about Hard Void. Another is the perspective during conflict. Battles see the view zooming from your fleets in the foreground to the enemy in the middle distance, following each salvo to target. It's stylised and a bit preposterous. It resists how today's 4X games generally present combat. It reminds me more of Infinite Space on the DS, and of horizontal shmups.
 
</p><p>
The presentation is otherwise familiar, with a zoomable starmap of planet and fleet icons. The menus are functional, with cramped abbreviations and some rough bits at the time of writing, like research options appearing behind other windows. It can seem bare, but there's surprising detail close-up - planets are dingy rolling surfaces with habitats stretched across them, and there are mottled 3D ship models with fancy effects such as warp bubbles. The spartan vibe elsewhere feels like a good fit for the dreary, mind-pulping music.

<p>

Lastly, there's the cosmic horror stuff. Intriguingly (and in a possible nod to Warhammer 40,000), this is tethered to the game's methods of faster-than-light travel. According to the backstory, several species on different worlds discover various FTL technologies simultaneously, ranging from the classic warp drive to "subspatial engines" and "wormhole generators". This precipitates a race for dominance of the galaxy. It also, however, risks getting the attention of the Old Ones.
 
</p><p>
There are techs you might wish not to research, for the mind cannot bear too much reality. During my brief stab at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2978460/HARD_VOID/">Steam demo</a>, I had the choice of whether to tell my people about certain cosmic encounters, or cover it all up to preserve morale. I didn't get much further than that, sadly, because the tutorial broke and I had to reload. There's also tantalising talk of multiple dimensions - going by screens, you'll be switching between them in parallel. 
</p>
<p>

If you have already succumbed to the siren call of this forbidden lore, rejoice, for Hard Void is out now in early access on Steam. According to developer jejoxdev, the game's key inspirations are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-orion">Master Of Orion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>. You can certainly see that lineage in the choice of alien races (inc little grey men and lizard people), the promise of procedural narrative events, and the robustness of the ship design options. Jejoxdev also describes themself as a physicist, which makes me even more curious about the FTL/Cthulhu mash-up here. More weird 4X games made by actual physicists, sez I.

<p>The festive season is officially upon us with the release of Fortnite’s annual Winterfest celebration, which brings a host of new rewards, all available for free, during the event.</p>



<p>While a lot of the hype has been surrounding the exciting collabs Fortnite has on the horizon this holiday season, players are being spoiled with a heap of free rewards, including two brand-new skins to provide a fresh look.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the details on every Fortnite Winterfest reward in 2025 and how to get your hands on them all.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-winter-2025-rewards">All Fortnite Winter 2025 Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 total free rewards available in Fortnite during the Winterfest 2025 event, including Outfits, Jam Tracks, and more.</strong></p>



<p>14 of the rewards are distributed by opening presents daily in the cabin, with the final two rewards, both Outfits, becoming available when specific thresholds have been met during the event.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you were holding out hope for free collab skins with the likes of Harry Potter, Hatsune Miku, and Sabrina Carpenter, you’ll be disappointed, as they’re available in the Item Shop and not via Winterfest rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the Winterfest 2025 free rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Cheeks</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Dummy</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Bow</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wrapped Axe</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Bat</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Warm &amp; Peely</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Just A Holiday in Battlewood</td><td data-align="center">Jam Track</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Gwinny</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Groove</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bard’s Gem</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Letter</td><td data-align="center">Glider</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Shadowstorm</td><td data-align="center">Contrail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fire-Born</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">No Sweat, Snowfish</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A Snowman!</td><td data-align="center">Wrap</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Gift</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-fortnite-2025-winterfest-rewards">How to Get Fortnite 2025 Winterfest Rewards</h2>



<p><strong>One Fortnite Winterfest reward</strong> <strong>can be claimed daily, with a refresh of 9 AM ET, starting at the beginning of the Winterfest event on December 18.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards can be selected in any order, so you can choose what you want to get first. However, you can’t jump straight to the new Outfits, as their distribution is slightly different.</p>



<p>The Glacial Dummy Outfit is unlocked after you open seven other presents, while the Cheeks Outfit is unlocked once 13 presents have been opened.</p>



<p>While you won’t specifically be shown what you’re about to unlock, the shape of the presents is a big giveaway, so use that to your advantage.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more/</link>
            <guid>1386862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Stardew Valley 1.7 update is still on the way, and while there’s still no approximate timeframe for the new content, the game’s developer has let the community in on certain features and aspects to expect.</p>



<p>Eric Barone’s—AKA ConcernedApe—solo creation of Stardew Valley needs to be studied. It’s unbelievable that one person made such a staggeringly big and timeless game. They could realistically walk away from the title at any point now. Instead, the game goes from strength to strength.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-collaboration-announced-with-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us collaboration with Stardew Valley</a> was one thing, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-7-update-coming-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.7 update</a> is huge.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Still more to come. Credit to ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2017 life-sim title is readying itself for the upcoming 1.7 update. ConcernedApe remains coy on a release date or launch window, but when asked if the dev could “Give any hints about the newest update that we could look forward to or a sneak peek?” Concerned Ape obliged:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There will be some more character/social stuff, it’s also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don’t want to reveal much yet.”<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It means we need to wait longer for more details on the 1.7 update, and the content is presumably a while away yet. It’s all the more impressive when you consider the developer is also working simultaneously on a new game—Haunted Chocolatier.</p>







<p>Speculation continues to run rife over whether this will be the final, major Stardew Valley update. Many were shocked when 1.7 was announced, and every subsequent update will raise the same question.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type.

			<p>A few hours ago, several insiders and content creators started sharing rumblings about what's next for Starfield. </p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios has been very quiet publicly when it comes to its new sci-fi intellectual property, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasing</a> a new story DLC, improvements to space gameplay and brand new systems. It's no big secret that despite the initial boast of being the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-is-bethesdas-biggest-launch-yet-with-6-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'biggest launch ever' for the studio</a> (with the crucial help of Game Pass subscribers trying it out), enthusiasm around Starfield dried out fairly quickly. One of the developers who worked on the game before leaving the studio, Bruce Nesmith, recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-dev-space-inherently-boring-planets-is-where-bethesda-failed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that space is inherently boring, and where Bethesda really failed to capture the interest of its usual fans is on the planets, which didn't offer enough variety in creatures or encounters to be interesting.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you agree with his assessment on why, the fact remains, and the first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shattered Space</a>, also failed to improve the game's overall reception. Now, though, it sounds like there might be interesting additions on the way.</p>



<p>YouTuber JuiceHead <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2001430295912882264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that he attended an event recently where Bethesda Game Studios showed what's next for Starfield, and that he will discuss it in due time (when the embargo expires). Another content creator, Luke Stephens, <a href="https://x.com/LukeStephens/status/2001427067540509080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he talked with other people, and he heard the following:</p>



<p><em>Things are being improved but from what I'm hearing this probably isn't a Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 scale update. BGS do have a number of improvements coming that are specifically aimed at the most common complaints like load screens (these have been data mined too), but you should not expect them to have magically changed what the game is.</em></p>



<p>However, WindowsCentral's Jez Corden later <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an article</a> stating that, based on the information he collected, it <strong>will be a Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 style update</strong>. At least, that's what some of the attendees are swearing, while others are a bit more conservative.</p>



<p>Getting into the meat of the actual improvements, Starfield's space flight should feel more seamless (presumably with the removal of the many loading screens), and other systems related to space travel and exploration are allegedly being refined, too, thanks to improvements made to the underlying Creation Engine, which will remain the studio's engine choice for future projects. Moreover, as previously rumored, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is launching on PlayStation 5 next year</a>; Corden adds that it will also be released for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is somewhat surprising since it is quite CPU-intensive, like most games released by Bethesda.</p>



<p>The Windows Central report <span>concludes by suggesting that these will be the final content updates for the game, with the studio already stretched thin between&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/" target="_blank">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, the new Fallout projects (presumably&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank">Fallout 3 and possibly</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remastered-reportedly-in-the-works-fallout-3-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> New Vegas remasters</a>), and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing support of Fallout 76</a>.</p>



<p>Thus, much of the fate of the Starfield IP will rest on the new updates and DLC. If it can reignite interest in the game like Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Liberty</a> did for CD Projekt RED's game, then Starfield might have a future. Otherwise, there's a non-trivial chance that Bethesda will focus on Elder Scrolls and Fallout for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <p>Rude cyborg vs. immortal robot strategy sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus II</a> is releasing in Spring 2026, publishers Kasedo Games have announced. For anyone keeping track of the 40K XCOM-alike, that'll sound like a delay, considering it had previously mumbled something about launching in 2025. But then, we’d reached the dying days of December and it still didn’t have a specific date. Can one delay something that wasn’t dated to begin with?</p>
<p>Yes, actually, since Kasedo’s <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/WARHAMMER-40000-MECHANICUS-II-ANNOUNCES-NEW-RELEASE-WINDOW-FOLLOWING-S#:~:text=The%20team%20is%20equally%20committed,and%20the%20studio's%20own%20ambitions.">press release</a> specifically mentions using the time to "further refine the experience in response to player requests following the Steam Next Fest demo" from this past October. There’s also a new trailer, complete with "SPRING 2026" rendered in confident steel, that rather finely details two of the playable faction leaders: posthuman battle-nan Scaevola of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and Omninekh the Necron Lord.</p>

<p>My god, that’s a lot of tech trees and skill unlocks. And the extra few months is apparently going to be dedicated to stuffing in even more features, including re-adding the Admech’s beep-boop binary chatter as a language option; this was replaced by disgusting human-speak in the demo, despite 'lingua-technis' having been their native tongue in the first Mechanicus.</p><p>"Movement systems are also being enhanced, with an optional setting to allow the Move action to auto-select when cycling between units, creating a smoother and more efficient tactical flow," the statement continues. Developers Bulwalk Studios will also work on "addressing performance concerns raised during the demo period" – I didn’t play it myself so can’t attest to any framerate wobbles, though a canter through the Achivum Redditorium does turn up multiple complaints of having to manually select the Move command. Have I got good news for those people, about 90 words ago.</p>
<p>I sat and watched a Bulwalk dev play Mechanicus II back at Gamescom 2024, and cumbersome moving aside, it looked alright, especially the asymmetry of the two factions. The titular machine cult are still about gathering Cognition, a resource they can then spend on special attacks or extending move distance, but the system’s been revamped so different units can produce Cognition in distinct ways, up to and including the humble Servitor allowing himself to be shot. The Necrons’s equivalent, Dominion, is accrued through more straightforward means (like, ironically, shooting Servitors), but stacks up attack bonuses over time, potentially turning them into a big old snowball of scowling roboskulls. I couldn’t pay too much attention, though, as I kept thinking about this wanton abuse of the original game’s OST:</p>

            <p>Stand down, great lawyer-machines of the courtly plains. Sony and Tencent's legal scuffle over alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon</a> "clone" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/light-of-motiram">Light of Motiram</a> has ended with a "confidential settlement". As part of that arrow-flinging cessation, Tencent appear to have packed Light of Motiram away and pulled it from PC stores.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, it would certainly seem, endeth a bout of copyright-based conflict which kicked off in July, when Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-suing-tencent-to-prevent-irreparable-harm-inflicted-by-horizon-knockoff-light-of-motiram">brought about legal action</a> accusing Tencent-published tribals fight machines game Light of Motiram of being a "slavish clone" of their Horizon series about tribals fight machines. Tencent disputed that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-accuse-sony-of-trying-to-fence-off-a-well-trodden-corner-of-popular-culture-with-their-horizon-copyright-lawsuit">filing a motion to dismiss the case</a>, to which sony brought out a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-fire-arrows-alleging-nonsense-and-deliberate-corporate-water-muddying-at-tencent-as-horizon-lawsuit-rumbles-on-2">big cannon with the word "nonsense"</a> written on it.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> filed this week and spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement">The Verge</a>, the two companies have asked the courts to dismiss the case following the reaching of a settlement. The details of the settlement have been withheld, as is often the case, meaning there's no info here as to who paid or agreed to what before the big handshake.</p>
<p>There is one aspect which we can see - Light of Motiram's disappeared from both Steam and the Epic Games store. You'll not find the listing for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630?utm_source=ofweb&amp;utm_campaign=rel&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_content=re&amp;utm_term=1129wi">here</a> or <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/light-of-motiram-094dff">here</a>, despite <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">the game's website</a> still pointing to those links. Meanwhile, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/">SteamDB</a> says the app's been retired.</p><p>Thus, it appears, will probably end the tale of Light of Motiram. Well, at least in the Horizon-esque guise it's had up to this point. The two great machine titans behind these games can now rest, their wrestling match having concluded in peace. Sure, a bunch of money and/or villages depending on whether you want to stick to the metaphor have likely been burned in sacrifice to the mighty beings who live on litigation mountain, but at least it hasn't dragged on for too long.</p>
<p>Hopefully it also won't result in any negative consequences for the developers on the ground, who I imagine have had to sit back and watch this costly fight with bated breath.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Freebies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve broken down all the major changes to Fortnite with the December 18 update, which marks the start of Winterfest 2025 and is the final patch of the year, into sections below.</p>



<h3 id="h-winterfest-2025-rewards">Winterfest 2025 Rewards</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s annual celebration around the festive season has begun, with free rewards available to claim as a result, including Skins, Emotes, and more.</p>



<p>A total of 14 rewards are available to claim, along with two skins once you have claimed seven and 13 rewards. One gift can be opened daily, with a refresh at 9 AM ET.</p>



<h3 id="h-shop-collabs">Shop Collabs</h3>



<p>A host of big collabs are available in the shop during Winterfest, including festive-themed skins for Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but the big addition is the Harry Potter franchise, with customizable skins for your favorite Hogwarts house.</p>



<p>There’s even more on the horizon, too, with Sidekicks coming for SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick Star, while Batman Beyond is also poised to appear.</p>



<h3 id="h-map-changes">Map Changes</h3>



<p>The main Battle Royale island has seen some changes with the update, with snow spreading around the northern section of the map.</p>



<p>Areas modified for Winterfest 2025 include Wonkeeland, Tiptop Terrace, Latte Landing, and Painted Palms, with fresh secrets to uncover as you fight for victory.</p>



<h3 id="h-bleach-collab">Bleach Collab</h3>



<p>Winterfest 2025 has a bunch of returning collabs, including new skins for the likes of Sabrina Carpenter and Hatsune Miku, but there’s also a brand-new collab landing in the Item Shop, along with in-game content.</p>



<p>Bleach is the latest major anime to receive a collab in Fortnite for 2025, following on from the likes of Kaiju No. 9, Cowboy Bebop, and One Punch Man.</p>



<p>Alongside items to purchase in the Item Shop, two new Mythic weapons will be available at an undetermined date: the Fully-Hollowfied Ichigo Mask and Dual Zangetsu.</p>



<h2 id="h-festive-weapons">Festive Weapons</h2>



<p>Two festive weapons have been added to rotation in the Winterfest 2025 update, with Blizzard Grenades and Snowball launchers available for players.</p>



<p>It’s not clear yet whether there is any specific method to obtaining the weapons, or whether they are random loot from chests and the ground.</p>

            <p>Sony and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> have ended their lawsuit over the "Horizon clone" Light of Motiram, following a confidential settlement.</p>
<p>Further, Light of Motiram has been delisted on all store pages, so is no longer available on either Steam or Epic. The amount of the settlement is unknown.</p>
<p>"All pending motions are withdrawn and this action is hereby dismissed with prejudice. All parties shall bear their own fees and costs," reads a statement from the court document (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/">The Game Post</a>).</p>

<p>With the dismissal with prejudice, the case is now closed and cannot be brought back to court.</p>
<p>While the store pages have been removed, the Light of Motriam website, Discord and social pages still exist, so it hasn't been entirely wiped from the internet. It suggests the game could still come back in some form, though presumably with major changes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-open-world-survival-game-looks-like-a-blatant-horizon-rip-off-with-added-palworld-elements">Tencent first revealed Light of Motiram</a> in November last year, which immediately drew comparison to Sony's first-party Horizon franchise.</p>
<p>Then, in July this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sues-tencent-over-slavish-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony sued Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-responds-to-sony-lawsuit-against-slavish-horizon-clone-stating-its-claims-of-originality-are-startling">Tencent retaliated by saying Sony's claims of originality were "startling"</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram">Sony shot back claiming the Chinese company's defence was "nonsense"</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-alleged-horizon-rip-off-is-ironically-back-in-the-news-as-company-agrees-to-halt-promotion-amid-sony-lawsuit">Tencent agreed to halt all promotion and public testing</a> of the game as the two companies prepared for a court battle. Now that will no longer be necessary, owing to this confidential settlement.</p>

            <guid>1386823</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been a little more than a year since Tencent and its Polaris Quest subsidiary <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> <strong>Light of Motiram</strong> to the world. This open world game was targeting a launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS. Ever since we laid our eyes on it, though, we couldn't help but label it as a <strong>Horizon Zero Dawn clone</strong>.</p>



<p>There were some differences in the gameplay mechanics, such as base building, which is absent (so far, at least) in Guerrilla's acclaimed series. However, the backdrop of a destroyed world, animal-inspired machines, and a red-haired female character made it just too much of a blatant rip-off.</p>



<p>Surely enough, in late July 2025, Sony (the parent company of Horizon Zero Dawn creator Guerrilla Games) <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Tencent</a> for copyright and trademark infringement, calling Light of Motiram a 'slavish clone' of its intellectual property. Just a few days later, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">began adjusting the game's description and images on Steam</a>, including removing screenshots featuring the aforementioned Aloy-inspired character.</p>



<p>In September, the Chinese corporation <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fought back in court</a>, filing a motion to dismiss with a series of counters, such as jurisdiction issues and, most interestingly, arguing that Guerrilla admitted its own game was originally discarded as an internal pitch because the developers felt it was too similar to another, Ninja Theory's Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, before returning to the pitch and going forward with it anyway. This was intended to demonstrate that Horizon was never truly original to begin with.</p>



<p>Predictably, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-calls-tencent-defence-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dismissed this rebuttal as nonsense</a> and moved forward with the lawsuit. Two weeks ago, the PlayStation company s<a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-will-not-promote-light-of-motiram-sony-horizon-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ucceeded in getting Tencent to stop promoting the game</a> ahead of new court dates set for January 2026. However, it seems like that won't be necessary.</p>



<p>A quick search on Steam will show that Light of Motiram can no longer be found on Valve's platform. SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3319630/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveals</a> that the app 'has been retired and is no longer available on the Steam store'. The last piece of info comes from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a>, which got a comment from Sony: the two companies reached a private resolution and won't share any further public comments on the topic, but they 'look forward to working together in the future'. </p>



<p>From the sound of it, then, <strong>Light of Motiram appears to have been canceled</strong>, with Tencent finally ceding to Sony's concerns without going into a prolonged legal battle it was likely to lose. </p>



<p>For all those players looking for an online version of Horizon, there's the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steel Frontiers MMORPG</a> in development by NCSOFT for PC and mobile (with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-would-like-to-bring-horizon-steel-frontiers-to-ps5-say-it-cant-make-that-call-on-its-own/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">possible PlayStation 5 version under discussion</a>). Guerrilla Games is also still <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-guerilla-has-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing its own online co-op game</a> set within the franchise.</p>

The point is to take that ore to the titular forge and use it to craft various items. You are able to get weapons and armor by crafting with the ore at these forge locations in Stonewake’s Cross and the Forgotten Kingdom.</p><p>Of course, the rarer the ore, the better chances you’ll get a high-quality or even exclusive item. You can then take the items you have crafted using your ore and sell them or even equip them to have better stats to do better against the various enemies in the world. This is why it is vital that you know where to find specific ore, so you are always improving your gear and gaining even more money.</p><p>There is so much to see and do in Roblox The Forge beyond the overwhelming number of available ores.

            <p>The Game Awards has broken its 2024 viewership record, bringing in roughly 171m livestream broadcasts earlier this month. This is an increase of 17m views compared to last year's show.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/">Via a report by Variety</a>, this 11 percent rise in viewers does not take into account those checking out the show on Amazon Prime Video, which offered a platform for the awards show for the first time this year. What views can be measured stem from YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram Live, as well as regional streaming services in China and India.</p>
<p><a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/thegameawards">According to Streamcharts</a>, Western platforms saw a 9 percent increase from last year's show, to a peak concurrent figure of 4.4 million live viewers. This record breaking figure is reflected on platform-specific milestones too, with YouTube and Twitch seeing significant leaps from last year's viewership statistics.</p>

<p>Co-streaming also saw an increase on Twitch, with 16,500 streamers on the platform experiencing the show alongside their fans. This was an astounding 50 percent increase from last year's figure, further cementing the show as an annual keystone within the games industry.</p><p>To compare, The Oscars (which still remains a television broadcast due to a deal with ABC) <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/oscars-moving-to-youtube#:~:text=The%202025%20broadcast%20hit%20around,were%20before%20the%202020%20pandemic.">only had 19.7 million viewers this year</a>. With that show looking to jump to YouTube in 2029 when their current broadcasting deal expires, for now at least the event, which has clearly inspired The Game Awards to an extent, seems to have been overshadowed in terms of pure eyeballs-on-screen statistics. Cultural influence is of course a whole other discussion altogether.</p>
<p>Why does The Game Awards see increasing views year-on-year? Well, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">all the reveal trailers announced at The Game Awards</a> which continue to draw eyes even from those generally uninterested in the awards themselves. For those more invested, talk around an Expedition 33 sweep was a real discussion-driver, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">as the French RPG took home a whopping nine awards in total from the Peacock Theatre</a>.</p>

			<p>Warner Bros. Games has <a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Hogwarts Legacy has now surpassed <strong>40 million units</strong> across all the platforms it's available on (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2). It is unclear whether they are counting the free redemptions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store's promotion</a> (which ends in a few hours, so hurry if you're interested in adding the game to your library). We've asked WB Games and will update this post if they respond.</p>



<p>Avalanche Software's open world action/adventure game set in the Wizarding World launched in February 2023 to very positive critical and fan <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a>, despite a call to boycott it due to Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling's (who had no direct involvement with the game) views on transgender people.</p>



<p>It didn't take long for Hogwarts Legacy to start breaking sales records:</p>



<ul>
<li>Just a couple of weeks after launch, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-works-magic-for-warner-bros-biggest-launch-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that it became the <strong>best-selling launch ever in the publisher's history</strong>;</li>



<li>By May 2023, it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-earned-over-1-billion-in-retail-sold-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> over 15 million units and earned <strong>more than one billion dollars</strong> at retail alone;</li>



<li>By January 2024, WB Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> Hogwarts Legacy had surpassed 22 million units and established itself as the <strong>best-selling game of 2023</strong> in a year full of triple-A releases;</li>



<li>Later that month, the publisher could <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-has-sold-24-million-units-new-features-and-ex-playstation-exclusive-content-coming-in-q3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirm</a> a new sales milestone, 24 million units, while also announcing new features coming with patches and also that previously exclusive PlayStation content would be available elsewhere, too;</li>



<li>By November 2024, Hogwarts Legacy had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sells-30-million-units-hogwarts-legacy-2-huge-priority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the threshold of 30 million units</a>, and the publisher predictably confirmed that a sequel was their biggest priority.</li>
</ul>



<p>Earlier in 2024, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier had <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that a Definitive Edition was in the works with the help of Rocksteady (Batman: Arkham trilogy, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League). The goal <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was to add between 10 and 15 hours of new content</a>, but eventually, the publisher worried that the amount of new stuff wouldn't be enough to justify their estimated asking price of $30 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled this edition</a>.</p>



<p>Still, Hogwarts Legacy 2 is absolutely coming, and based on rumors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's not going to be a game-as-a-service</a>, even though Warner Bros. execs previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made it very clear</a> that they were looking to transfer this level of success to an ongoing live service game. That's likely going to be a separate project.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that even with the outstanding sales performance of Avalanche Software's game, Warner Bros. Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to shut down several studios</a> (Monolith Productions, Player First Games, San Diego Studio) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wb-games-has-restructured-into-divisions-focused-franchises-harry-potter-game-of-thrones-mortal-kombat-and-the-dc-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restructure around its four key franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones). Ultimately, everything will be up to the winning company in the bidding war between <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-acquire-warner-bros-including-game-studios-82-7-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/paramount-bids-108-billion-to-grab-warner-bros-discovery-out-from-netflix-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paramount Skydance</a>, with the former already <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-wb-games-as-part-of-deal-relatively-minor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making it clear that WB Games is just a nice bonus</a>, as far as they're concerned, in the megadeal.</p>
