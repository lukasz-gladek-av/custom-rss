			<p>Keiichiro Toyama is a name that horror games fans know rather well, having directed and written the very first entry in the Silent Hill series, but that isn't the only game the Japanese developer created, as he was also the man behind Sony's Siren series. Moving away from horror games, Toyama-san created and directed the Gravity Rush series, which, surprisingly enough, had the same impact on the soon-to-be-released <a href="https://wccftech.com/slitterhead-gets-gameplay-trailer-pc-specs-and-november-8-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a> as the horror games the legendary game director created before it.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, we had the chance to talk with Toyama-san about his next game, the unique mechanics that set it apart from similar titles, and his feelings regarding the return of the Silent Hill series. You can find the full Q&amp;A session below. Enjoy!</p>
<p><em>The Q&amp;A session was conducted via an interpreter and has been edited for clarity.</em></p>
<p><strong>Where does the name Slitterhead come from?</strong></p>
<p>The project was, in many ways, going back to my roots, so I wanted to keep the SH initials while having a new name. As such, I worked with English-speaking staff to come up with the Slitterhead name.</p>
<p><strong>Possession mechanics seem to be central to the experience. How did they come about?</strong></p>
<p>The possession mechanics in Slitterhead are the modern reconstruction of one of the mechanics seen in Siren. In that game, there was a mechanic called sight jacking, which allows the player to borrow someone else's sight. In Slitterhead, we went further with this concept, allowing the player not just to borrow someone's sight but their entire bodies, letting them move around while controlling these NPCs. So the possession mechanics in the game are effectively an evolution of similar mechanics seen in Siren.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead has deeper combat mechanics than other horror games. Why did you go in this direction?</strong></p>
<p>I am aware of how much survival horror fans are passionate about the genre, but I wanted to offer something different from past games. In this regard, the Seinen manga genre has had a big influence on Slitterhead. The genre combines elements such as action, battle, horror, and dark themes well and is quite popular with young players. I felt the combination of these elements would be a better way to introduce the game to a young audience and people who play action games. It was also a combination of elements that I wanted to do for a while.</p>
<p><strong>In horror games, the player is usually powerless against everything they have to face, which contributes to the atmosphere a lot, but in Slitterhead, you can fight these horrors rather effectively. What has been done to preserve the "horror" feel while also offering these deeper combat mechanics?</strong></p>
<p>The horror elements are preserved in Slitterhead mostly by the narrative elements of the game, with a sense and fear of the unknown that is prevalent throughout the story that players will hopefully find and appreciate.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple characters with different skills. How does the game handle this so that it is not disorienting for players?</strong></p>
<p>We have been very precise in the development of different movesets and animations, making sure not to change the "rhythm" between different movesets. It was a lot of hard work.</p>
<p><strong>At the beginning of the game, you possess a dog. Are there other non-combat possessions?</strong></p>
<p>To be honest, I have focused mostly on the human aspect of the possession mechanics. I have found the idea of possessing the dog fun, and that won't be the only time you will see him, but I haven't focused on the aspect of possessing anything other than human NPCs.</p>
<p>That's not to say that Slitterhead won't offer any variety. Throughout the game, the player will be able to unlock new and rarer possessions, and all come with different skill sets and different moves. After the beginning of the game, players will be able to take two possession rarities to a mission, and I feel picking the best ones for the mission will be an entertaining part of the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Slitterhead features multiple difficulty settings. What's the difference between them?</strong></p>
<p>The difficulty settings influence the difficulty of combat. Higher difficulties not only increase the enemy's parameters compared to lower settings but also change how often they attack and use certain special moves. The highest difficulty, Nightmare, will be quite challenging and will require players to master all of the game's mechanics. I myself haven't completed the game at this setting. (<em>laughs</em>). Normal difficulty, on the other hand, will be more approachable. Its challenge level is far from being close to that of certain popular games where the player constantly dies.</p>
<p><strong>The game is also releasing on PlayStation 4. Why? And did launching on a previous-generation console limit the project in any way?</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to have as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and this is why we are releasing the game on PlayStation 4. At the same time, this helped us keep the PC system requirements low, so even those players with middle-range systems can easily enjoy the game. Being the first game from Bokeh Game Studio, we really want as many players as possible to play Slitterhead, and I feel we made the correct decision, in this regard.</p>
<p><strong>Silent Hill series composer Akira Yamaoka has created the Slitterhead soundtrack. How did this collaboration come about? How has his work improved the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Having worked together on the original Silent Hill, Yamaoka-san and I have discussed working together over the years, and eventually going indie with my new studio made it a lot easier for this collaboration to happen. His works basically carried the development in many ways: the songs and the audio he implemented in certain areas made the design even better, giving the level designers more freedom with their choices. It was a very good collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about Silent Hill, the series is finally coming back after some years with multiple games after a long hiatus. How do you feel about having created something so iconic and its return?</strong></p>
<p>In the beginning, Silent Hill was a small project compared to others in the works at the same time, and not many people, even at Konami, knew about it. A very young team worked on it, and when it was released, we were all surprised by how good it turned out to be. Konami was surprised as well by the reactions and the fan base that was created around it since they didn't think it would be so influential. Even though I only worked on the first game, I am happy to see it back. It was the first game I directed, and it has taught me many lessons in game development. And I'm thankful to see that the franchise continues to be popular nowadays.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for your time!</strong></p>

To accept it, talk to “The Well-Heeled Youth” which will also give you the Gold Airship Ticket. Then, go to the Ul’Dahn Airstrip and present the ticket to Elyenora. The game will then bring up a prompt asking if you want to go to the Gold Saucer. Select “Yes,” and after a short cutscene, you will be able to turn in the quest and arrive at the Gold Saucer with a notice that the Manderville Gold Saucer has been unlocked.</p><h2 id="h12036"><a id=""></a>What Can I Do In the Manderville Gold Saucer</h2><figure id="" data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-recommend-id="image://29b00de0e77cd54f6eb9871b38c8ae4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Manderville Gold Saucer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> As you might expect, <em>FFXIV’s</em> version of the Gold Saucer—titled the Manderville Gold Saucer—has a collection of minigames for you to play.

One MGP can be purchased for 10 Gil, though it can also be obtained by winning these minigames. And it’s a good job too, as prizes can cost up to one million MGP, and you are limited to only being able to purchase 500! </p><p>I’d advise you to talk to the AirShip Ticketer, who offers a quest as soon as you land, entitled “World of Wonders.” This will have you talk to multiple NPCs and introduce many of the features and games available in the Gold Saucer. Below is a walkthrough of how to complete the quest, as well as a brief introduction on the feature that is introduced. I’d also suggest you interact with all the crystals, to open the many fast travel locations as you work your way through this quest.</p><figure id="" data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-recommend-id="image://d36fc380574ad21a37a373572ee5a33c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Airship ticketer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Talking to the attendant at the main counter will introduce the general concept of MGP, and how to obtain them.

Winners are revealed on Saturdays at a specific time according to your server, and if your numbers are drawn, you will win! Note that you actually need to check your numbers at the Cactpot Cashier (right next to the ticket vendor), as the rewards are not given automatically.</p><p>You have a week to do this, and if you don’t pick them up in time, you forfeit your winnings. Even if none of your numbers match, you will receive a consolation and you also gain a bonus if you check in the first hour after numbers are called, so always check the winners, and try to do it as close to the designated time as possible.</p><p>There is also a Mini Cactpot Broker that can be played daily. You can buy a card with a grid on it, with all spaces covered except one. You can then choose an additional three squares to reveal and then pick any row, column or diagonal you want to bet on. You can see the payout for each sum of numbers, so the goal is to get the three numbers that will provide the largest payout. Talking to the Broker for the first time also rewards you with a MGP voucher, which can be used from your inventory for 100 MGP to get you started on your first card. You can buy up to three per day, so you should take advantage of this relatively easy way to generate MGP.</p><figure id="" data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-recommend-id="image://c88c2d13b1d4f2e7b5956016b7e65271" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="GATE Keeper." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The last spot before we return to our attendant is a GATE Keeper. GATEs are basically minigames which rotate every 20 minutes. They are generally pretty short and different from most content in <em>FFXIV</em>, and are fun diversions even if you aren’t grinding for MGP. They can be anything from a platforming obstacle course to a shooting gallery, and worth checking out. You also don’t need to talk to this specific Keeper to partake in the events, as there are several Keepers scattered around the Gold Saucer, and speaking to any of them will teleport you to the location of the next event. </p><p> After speaking to the GATE Keeper, you can speak to the attendant to turn in the quest. You will be rewarded with five Gold Saucer Tickets. These are different from the MGP vouchers! This means they can generally only be used for the smaller carnival minigames scattered around the park, which only cost about 1 MGP and don’t offer very high rewards. </p><h2 id="h12037"><a id=""></a>Is There Anything Else?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-recommend-id="image://9846cac2f99b55bbb0903d4830d6b356" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Passion for fashion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> While “World of Wonders” will show you a lot of the content the Gold Saucer has to offer, it doesn’t show you everything. There’s a NPC in the main area named Lewena who will offer you two quests that unlock additional games at the Gold Saucer. The first is a quest named “Passion for Fashion.” It will task you with talking to a character named the Masked Rose which unlocks Fashion Report. This challenge is available from Tuesdays to Fridays and requires you to equip a different piece of equipment in each slot that fits a given theme, and are then judged on your ensemble with a score from 1 to 100. If you receive a score higher than 80 you get MGP. </p><p> The other quest Lewenna offers is “Everything Little Thing She Does is Mahjong.” By talking to the Mahjong Tutor you can complete this quest and unlock Mahjong Duties, which allow you to play the famous game for MGP. They can be accessed from the Duty Menu. </p><figure id="" data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-recommend-id="image://569dc97edda1af6deabc5213c82fb585" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobo Racing" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In order to unlock the final two features of the Gold Saucer, you will need to talk to the Lift Operator, which will give you access to the Minion and Chocobo Squares. At the former, you can unlock and play “Lord of Verminion,” which pits your minions against others for MGP. At the Chocobo Square you can pick up a quest to unlock Chocobo Races. </p><p> To do so, talk to the Race Chocobo Registrar to unlock “So You want to Be a Jockey?” This quest will have you travel to Bent Branch Meadows (near Gridania) to speak to Katering. This completes the quest and you can choose a male or female Chocobo for racing as a reward. Talking to her again will accept the quest, “So You Think You Can Ride This Chocobo?” To turn it in, talk to the Chocobo Trainer to register your new bird, and then talk to the registrar to try out the training course. After you pass, you will have Chocobo races available in the Duty Finder. </p><figure id="" data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-recommend-id="image://10a7b6da9a90c0af8c8a35a3277d9128" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1052" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Finalfantasiest lady of all time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> There are a ton of things to do in the Gold Saucer, and it’s incredibly easy to lose track of time. Whether you are there specifically to buy one of the awesome prizes, or just spend time mastering Triple Triad, it’s worth it to check out one of the coolest locations in <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>and see what it has to offer. You may just find yourself sinking hours acquiring the area’s unique currency. After all, the Fenrir Mount is only one million MGP. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/when-it-costs-700-who-exactly-is-the-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Yesterday <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony finally announced the long-rumoured PS5 Pro</a> in a technical presentationn hosted by Mark Cerny. The console is a more advanced version of the PlayStation 5 that boosts its graphics capabilities, and even improves backwards compatibility with some PS4 games.</p>
<p>Yet the biggest catch of all is its £700 price tag. What's more, with this being a digital-only console, the £100 disc drive add-on is required for physical games, not to mention the additional £25 needed for the optional stand just to hold the console vertically. That's a total of £825 - without games, as well as the fancy TV necessary to really show off those extra pixels.</p>
<p>The reaction so far has been overwhelmingly negative, predominantly thanks to that audacious price. Indeed, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-700-ps5-pro-is-an-argument-against-pro-consoles-altogether">Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wrote</a>, the PS5 Pro is "an argument against 'Pro' consoles altogether". It certainly seems more in-line with the expectations of PC players than console players.</p>
<p>With all that in mind, then, what really are the benefits of this new console? Who is the target audience? And would we consider buying one ourselves?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss all things PS5 Pro in this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporter Victoria Kennedy, Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan, and managing editor Katharine Castle.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a> is getting a free update next month, which will include a new co-op horde mode known as Neighborhood Watch and New Game Plus.</p>
<p>"Taking place over the span of five fictional days, Neighborhood Watch sees a group of college kids - the Bobcats - defend their frat house from an approaching zombie horde," reads <a href="https://deadisland.com/patch-6">Neighborhood Watch's description</a>. "Initially, you and your friends complete a variety of missions, setting traps, and stockpiling weapons as you prepare your defences.</p>
<p>"Then, on the fifth and final day, the zombie onslaught begins! If your defences, skills, and teamwork are up to the task, you might just live to tell the tale." You can check out a trailer for Neighborhood Watch below.</p>

<p>In addition to this new horde mode, the forthcoming update will also include New Game Plus. This will allow players to head back to LA (or, Hell A, as the Dead Island 2 team call it) for another crack at the main story, but with an additional skill slot and an increased level cap.</p>
<p>In addition, there will also be some new skins, enemies, weapons and an increased difficulty level for players to hack and slash their way through.</p>
<p>This free update will be arriving on 22nd October, and will coincide with the release of Dead Island 2's <a href="https://deadisland.com/gb/ultimate-edition">Ultimate Edition.</a> This edition will include the base game, as well as both story expansions (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-roadmap-reveals-two-gore-ful-sounding-expansions">Haus and SoLA</a>) and a number of weapons and skin packs. It will also include New Game Plus and Neighborhood Watch on its release next month.</p>
<p>"If you've somehow yet to play an undead-themed action-RPG or you have an appropriately on-brand mindless hunger for the subgenre, Dead Island 2 might be worth your while," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-island-2-review-its-still-2011-in-los-angeles">Eurogamer's Dead Island 2 review</a> from last year. "It's certainly got the zombie disassembly part down pat."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>An early PlayStation 5 Pro comparison video shared online earlier today highlights the visual improvements the new console will bring to select existing titles.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a>, is based on the footage shown during yesterday's technical presentation, and, as such, it may not properly represent how these games will run on the actual hardware. Even so, the comparison makes it clear that some games will benefit more than others, such as Hogwarts Legacy, which will use the console's capabilities to offer better ray tracing with more solid performance, and Gran Turismo 7, which will also feature ray tracing during races. Other games don't seem to benefit as much, sporting only marginal improvements to image quality.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was officially revealed yesterday, following months of rumors and speculation. The biggest upgrade the new model launching in two months features over the base console is a more powerful GPU which offers <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">45% faster rendering</a> thanks to 67% more compute units and 28% faster memory. The console will also feature the AI-powered <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-spectral-super-resolution-to-work-across-the-full-library-without-patches-will-also-support-ps-vr2/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>, which will increase games' visual quality while offering smooth framerates. Enhancing the visual quality of Performance Mode was one of the main goals of the new system, as the vast majority of players preferred 60 FPS gameplay over higher resolution and visual quality over the course of the generation, as confirmed by Mark Cerny himself during the console's reveal.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th for the price of $699.99, £699.99, €799.99. Despite the high price, analysts expect the system to sell as <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">well as the PS4 Pro did.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241706/sony-ps5-pro-price-next-gen-consoles<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 Pro’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">announcement yesterday</a> wasn’t a surprise. What was a surprise was the price: at $699.99, it debuts as Sony’s most expensive console ever. It brought back memories of the PS3’s controversial price tag, a console that when adjusted for inflation is the same $779 price point of a PS5 Pro with the additional disc drive. It’s a very expensive PlayStation, and I fear it’s a test of what’s to come for next-gen console pricing.</p><p>For years, console gamers have been used to purchasing hardware at a significantly reduced price compared to what you could build yourself in the PC gaming space. Yes, you can find components that match the PS5 or Xbox Series X on paper, but it’s still difficult to hit the price points that consoles sell for, especially when they’re discounted during promotions. Besides, the easy plug-and-play model, simplified UI, and hassle-free warranty process are all big benefits over having to build or find a good prebuilt PC and then deal with Windows and driver updates. Consoles sell in their millions because they’re far more consumer-friendly than PCs.</p><p>It increasingly feels like that gap between console and PC is blurring, though. Microsoft and Sony both pushed this current generation in the direction of having the type of CPU, storage, and GPU power that you’d find inside a gaming PC. The PS5 and Xbox Series X / S have far more capable CPUs for gaming instead of underpowered laptop-like ones and improve the performance of your existing library of games just like a GPU upgrade would on the PC side. That’s why <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review">I called the Xbox Series X a next-gen PC</a> when I reviewed it in 2020.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro ships without a disc drive.﻿</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>The PS5 Pro demonstrates that trend even more clearly. Sony’s entire selling point is a $700 upgrade for existing and new games to hit better frame rates while maintaining visual quality. That’s been the selling point of GPUs for decades, and now Sony is about to test if console gamers are willing to upgrade their hardware in the same way PC gamers build entire new rigs.</p><p>The big difference this time is that Sony wants you to pay out for that upgrade in the same way that PC gamers have begrudgingly gotten used to GPU prices skyrocketing in recent years. Both Sony and Microsoft typically sell consoles at a loss initially to subsidize the hardware and grow the market for next-gen systems. These initial hardware losses are usually covered by digital game revenues and in-game purchases.</p><p>The PS5 Pro is all about digital sales, shipping without a disc drive. Sure, you can buy one separately ($79.99), but if you don’t bother, Sony will benefit from this digital sales push and the 30 percent cut it gets on most purchases. Microsoft and Sony are both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">pushing toward a discless future</a> for consoles, and it seems likely that next-gen systems won’t ship with disc drives as standard. Hopefully you’ll still be able to purchase one separately, though.</p><p>It also seems likely that next-gen consoles will be a lot more expensive than we’re used to. Component costs aren’t coming down, the console market isn’t growing, and Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer admitted earlier this year that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108670/xbox-epic-games-store-phil-spencer-interview">subsidizing hardware is now challenging</a> because the price of components isn’t dropping fast enough.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880635/microsoft-ps5-reveal-email-xbox-nadella-spencer">Microsoft document revealed</a> that the company had planned to subsidize the Xbox Series X and S to the tune of $1.5 billion in 2021 to hit its price targets of $499 and $299, respectively. “That’s our largest hardware subsidy ever” in Microsoft’s profit and loss for its gaming division, the document revealed. With Xbox Series S / X sales still lagging behind the PS5, it’s unlikely that Microsoft is going to gamble again on highly subsidized Xbox hardware for its next-gen consoles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PS5 Pro promises better visuals at higher frame rates.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sony</cite></p></div><p>Sony already appears to be at the point of not heavily subsidizing its PlayStation consoles. The lack of a disc drive helps drive console costs down for Sony on both the PS5 Slim and Pro models. The pricing of the PS5 Pro also looks like it’s designed to be profitable from day one, instead of months or years later. It took Sony nearly a year to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609150/sony-playstation-5-ps5-loss-profit">no longer sell the $499 PS5 at a loss</a>, and the company then hiked PS5 prices outside the US <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada">a year later</a> to cover inflation and component costs. In 2022, PS5 prices jumped by 10 percent in Europe, 12.5 percent in Japan, and by around 6 percent in the UK. Sony has hiked PS5 prices in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/27/24229420/ps5-prices-are-going-up-again-in-japan">Japan three times</a> since the console’s launch in 2020.</p><p>Crucially, Sony hasn’t ever increased the price of the PS5 in the US, the one market where it still faces competition from Xbox sales. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/why-microsofts-claim-that-it-has-20-market-share-in-europe-vs-playstations-80-was-accurate">admitted last year</a> that it has a 20 percent market share in Europe, compared to Sony’s 80 percent share. When there’s no competition in Europe, Sony can adjust prices by 10 percent or sell a new PS5 Pro for €799.99 (about $884).</p><p>Pricing is even worse in the UK for the PS5 Pro. The PS5 originally launched at £449 in the UK and $499 in the US — a currency gap given the weaker value of the British pound over the past decade. After the price hike to £479 in 2022, the UK is now facing £699 pricing for the PS5 Pro compared to the $699 launch price in the US. If you want to purchase a PS5 Pro and the separate disc drive in the UK, it works out to a steep $1,045. In the US, it’s as little as $818 with sales tax in many states for the same console and disc drive, nearly a $230 difference.</p><p>Sony faces little competition in Europe and the UK from Xbox console sales, and Microsoft’s plans for an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880111/microsoft-xbox-series-x-new-design-refresh">Xbox Series X redesign</a> have been put on hold. It seems to be skipping a mid-generation spec bump in favor of an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital white version of the Xbox Series X</a> and a 2TB limited-edition model. Neither of these offers the improved GPU that the PS5 Pro includes, and it leaves a gap for Sony to set the PS5 Pro pricing around the world accordingly.</p><p>While I’m hopeful that the price of next-gen consoles won’t push close to $999, I can’t help but think that a $699 price tag wouldn’t be all that surprising by the time next-gen hardware arrives. Maybe we’ll all need to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2005-07-06-sony-wants-you-to-earn-that-playstation-3.html">work more hours</a> to afford one. We’re heading into uncharted territory for console generations, and Sony’s PS5 Pro pricing is about to test the waters for the decisions that Sony and Microsoft are making right now for their next-gen hardware choices. Hold on to your disc drives and wallets, because consoles are about to get expensive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Gold Gold Adventure Gold is a game that relies on raw enthusiasm and moxie to power you through a blizzard of confusing references. It boldly describes itself as a "Cult-of-the-Lamb-lite, Rimworld-lite, Majesty-like mixed with Black &amp; White with a pinch of Against the Storm". Whoa there, pardner, save a few subgenres for the rest of us! I think that's half the New &amp; Trending keywords on Steam in one sentence. If you're mystified, best watch the announcement trailer - it paints a clearer picture, though it does involve a startling amount of cartoon decapitation and dismemberment.

Still mystified? I guess I'd better write the rest of this article, then. In this "reverse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> / city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> / pet game", you must (deep breath) construct a settlement around a dungeon to attract adventurers who'll earn you gold with which to buy food for your horrible god-beast pet. 
</p>
<p>
Adventurers come in all shapes and sizes, from undead to mothmen, all represented as pleasantly laconic and fatalistic-seeming 2D anime sprites. You'll lure them to your town with promises of "gold or glory", and assign them quests such as exploration, defending areas, or going after specific munsters. You can let them battle the menagerie by themselves, or intervene and help them secure items and skills. It sounds like you shouldn't let them get too powerful, for "each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution". 
</p>
<p>
When not enticing and managing adventurers, you'll tend to a growing fantasy-medieval economy based on farming or monster-slaying. The blurb cautions that heroes might try to steer your town's direction, should you let up your Sauron-like surveillance for but a single moment. "Your units have a life of their own - they might form parties, fund their own buildings, or give each other quests," it warns. "Watch your dark alleys closely!" I always do, game.
</p>
<p>
And then there's the matter of your pet god-beast, which must be fed and pampered to stop it running amok. "It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions," explains the blurb. "Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion upon your journey!" That "might" has a definite edge to it. I wonder if it'll be like in Black &amp; White, where you and your Creature could end up with opposing moral alignments. If necessary, you can kill two birds with one stone and feed misbehaving heroes to your god-beast.
</p>
<p>
Let me try for a different bundle of references and parallels: this is like you're actually <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stay-awhile-and-play-this-free-diablo-inspired-indie-as-the-mayor-of-tristram">running Sanctuary in Diablo</a>, managing those rapscallion dungeon-delvers while also catsitting one of the Prime Evils. The cute-but-grisly visuals remind me of the nastier magic girl animes, like Madoka Magica. I'm quite interested, in short. There’s no release date yet, but you can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3133650/Gold_Gold_Adventure_Gold/">Steam</a>.

With FromSoftware now making the fight a little easier again, some players are already touting their “pre-nerf” Radahn-slaying bona fides.</p><p>Update 1.14 includes a slew of other changes as well, including PVP balance adjustments like decreased damage to Backhand Blades, Pata weapon, and dual-wielded spears. Scattershot Throw is also weaker against other players. Meanwhile on the PVE front, Moon-and-Fire stance and Devonia’s Vortex were buffed, and heavy attack speed for various weapons was increased.</p><p>You can find the complete list of 1.14 patch notes below:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><h2 id="h6145"><a id=""></a><strong>Final Boss balance adjustments</strong></h2><p>The following adjustments have been made to the final boss of “<strong>SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE</strong>”</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Changed the action pattern when the battle starts.</li><li>Adjusted some attack moves.</li><li>Decreased the damage of some attacks.</li><li>Decreased stamina damage of some attacks.</li><li>Decreased the attack range of some non-weapon-based attacks.</li><li>Improved the visibility of some attack effects.</li></ul><h2 id="h6146"><a id=""></a><strong>PvP-exclusive balance adjustments</strong></h2><h3 id="h6147"><a id=""></a><strong>Equipment</strong></h3><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Decreased the damage of Backhand Blades against other players.

<p>IShowSpeed, the divisive, aggressive streamer best known for his over-the-top antics and controversial performances, has just broken his peak viewer count record. He’s on something of a world tour of late, and his most recent stop has been in Thailand, during which he has been spending hours going wild in front of a camera.</p>



<p>It was revealed that he hit a peak count of 610,000 users, which is a fair distance past his previous record of 548,000 users. He secured the previous record while attending 2023’s Ballon D’or ceremony.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-a-wall">Into a Wall</h2>



<p>On September 9, IShowSpeed appeared on stream in Thailand climbing into the driver’s seat of a ‘Tuk Tuk’. Moments after assuming control of the vehicle, he ploughed into a wall, with the claim being that he had no idea how to drive a manual vehicle (with a clutch).</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It made for great watching, but many believed it was nothing more than a bit, which gels nicely with IShowSpeed’s traditional operating model.</p>



<p>Previously, he has leapt over speeding cars, lit fireworks in his bedroom, and ‘accidentally’ exposed himself on stream.</p>



<p>In a relatively short period, IShowSpeed, whose real name is <strong>Darren Jason Watkins Jr</strong>., has soared up the streamer charts. He has gone from being a content creator broadcasting the occasional game of Fortnite to a superstar streamer appearing on-screen during live WWE events and meeting superstar athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>



<p>What’s your opinion of IShowSpeed? Are you a fan or does he get on your nerves?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-shield-mini-room-television<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past couple of months, my husband and I have gotten really, really into the early 2000s FX show <em>The Shield</em>. Watching makes me long for the halcyon days of “peak TV,” and makes me mourn a way of making television that seems to be going extinct.</p><p><em>The Shield</em> is a perfect television show, and it could have only existed at the time that it did. Part of that is because the show itself is a reaction to the environment in which it was created. Creator Shawn Ryan was inspired by the LAPD “Rampart” scandal of the late 90s—<em>The Shield</em> was almost named after it. While the scandal was complex, spanning for years, the gist was that the LAPD was letting teams of cops basically ignore the law they were supposed to be upholding. It was a level of corruption that was as shocking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_scandal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as the Wikipedia page about the scandal is long</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After <em>The Sopranos</em> proved a critical and financial success for HBO in 1999, the fledgling FX network was in the market for a Tony Soprano-esque anti-hero. Enter Vic Mackey, played by Michael Chiklis, a corrupt cop working with an LAPD strike team of equally corrupt cops.&nbsp;</p><p>Mackey is a fascinating character to follow because, despite how often he flagrantly commits crimes, he is convinced he does everything for the greater good. If <em>he</em> doesn’t monitor and take a cut from the local drug dealers, how can he be sure they're not selling to kids? If <em>he</em> doesn’t have an on-again off-again affair with a local sex worker, how can he be sure she’ll actually get clean? If <em>he</em> doesn’t plant evidence on a suspect he is 100% sure committed a crime, how can he be sure they’ll end up behind bars?Often, the tension is built by wanting to know how the fuck Mackey is going to wriggle out of the consequences of his actions. You almost root for him despite yourself.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Shield - A Different Kind of Cop Scene (S1 E1) | Rotten Tomatoes TV" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yID-laN-uqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Alongside Mackey and his strike team are detectives Claudette Wyms and Holland "Dutch" Wagenbach, played by C.C.H. Pounder and Jay Karnes, respectively. While Claudette and Dutch abhor Mackey’s methods, the image of “good” policing they provide is also disgusting. They lie to and manipulate suspects in custody, hold people in interrogation rooms without charging them, deny them access to lawyers to coerce confessions, even lie about what evidence they have or have not found. It’s lucky, through the magic of television, that we know these characters are all guilty of their crimes.</p><p>While Claudette tries her best to do her job in a corrupt system, Dutch is just a smug piece of shit in an entertainingly different way than Mackey. Dutch is a criminal profiler; he’s obsessed with catching serial killers and is often indifferent to their victims. He does put killers behind bars, but it’s the moments when he and Mackey find camaraderie that are most interesting to me. They’re both fans of gallows humor, especially gallows humor about the dead people whose cases they’re trying to solve. After a few episodes of <em>The Shield</em>, the show makes it clear that even “good” cops are bad cops, that the kinds of people who choose police work are often too vain and violent to actually protect anyone.</p><p>But what really strikes me as interesting about <em>The Shield</em> are the mechanical aspects of the show. First and foremost, you can see and feel how much the show benefits from having 13 to 15 episodes a season. It allows for room for characters like Julien, who wants to be a good cop but struggles with his sexuality—which makes him a target for both hate crimes and blackmail. Every episode has an A-plot and B-plot, sometimes even a C-plot, allowing several different characters to get at least a little screen time every episode, and for those characters to develop and evolve as the show moves forward. Members of Mackey’s strike team get filled out as actual characters instead of just caricatures. Shane Vendrell, played by Walton Goggins in his first breakout role, gets more interesting as he’s given space to be around, as both Goggins and the writer’s room get a feel for what kind of a person Shane is.&nbsp;</p><p>These days, it feels like shows with the same tone and mission as <em>The Shield</em> run for 8 to 10 episodes—and if you’re not an instant hit, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-cancelled-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t count on ever getting another season</a>. If <em>The Shield</em> could only count on 10 episodes, I don’t think it would be able to support full narrative arcs for all the characters, which is often the complaint I have about eight episode television shows. No matter how hard you try, something is going to feel rushed.</p><figure><figcaption>The Shield, FX</figcaption></figure><p>Creator Shawn Ryan has had the opportunity through his career to work in a <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/shield-writers-room-reunion-at-901814/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaborative environment</a> to create his television shows, a kind of environment that is rapidly disappearing. Before <em>The Shield</em>, Ryan worked on <em>Nash Bridges</em> and <em>Angel</em>, where he worked in full writers' rooms. Joss Whedon, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/joss-whedon-allegations.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sex pest and showrunner for <em>Angel</em></a>, often made it clear how important the environment of a writers' room was to the success of his shows; his former collaborators, like Jane Espenson and Drew Goddard, have gone on to become extremely successful Hollywood writers and showrunners. During the Writer’s Strike of 2023, one of the things writers often talked about was the practice of “mini rooms,” instead of full writers' rooms. Mini rooms are popular because they cut down on costs—instead of hiring a bunch of writers to work throughout the season, a studio will hire a handful of writers to break out an entire season in a few weeks. <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/writers-guild-contract-negotiation-mini-room-1235568173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to writers who spoke to Variety</a>, even if the show is picked up, the writers in the mini room often don’t continue on with the show. Newer writers, who need credited work to get more jobs, are especially impacted here.&nbsp;</p><p>You can feel this when you watch TV today, especially streaming TV with short episode runs. Everything feels rushed, and sometimes characters, plot points, and tone feel inconsistent from episode to episode.&nbsp;</p><p>Studios are also more reactive than they were when<em> The Shield</em> was new. In a conversation with <em>TheWrap</em>, a writer said that they were <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/wga-strike-mini-rooms-frustration-roundtable-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told to change gears on a script they were working on because of Twitter trends</a>. It is hard to imagine <em>any</em> network picking up <em>The Shield</em> as it exists now, if only because of the abuse the cast and crew would face for daring to make a show about cops being corrupt. I mean, spoilers for a twenty year old television show, but this is how the pilot episode ends. Even on a “prestige” network like Max, it’s hard to imagine this making it to air:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Shield - Bawitdaba" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/069OoA63I84?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Ryan did get pushback from FX while <em>The Shield</em> was on the air, but also enough room to push back against criticisms from executives. In particular, FX wanted Ryan to drop Walton Goggins, but Ryan wanted to prove to the network that Goggins was a capable actor. Shane Vendrell is now considered the breakout role of Goggins’s career.</p><p>“Little did I know, after that pilot, the executives wanted to fire me,” Goggins said in the <a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-shield-oral-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Entertainment Weekly<em> </em>oral history of <em>The Shield</em></a>. “Shawn didn't tell me until the end of season 1 during a DVD commentary recording, and I said, ‘How?! I had two lines!’ He said to them, ‘I know what this guy's capable of, let me prove it,’ and he focused the second episode on Shane. I'm glad he didn't tell me because I may have f---ed that up.”</p><p>Going to <em>The Shield </em>after an eight episode television show feels like taking a sip of cold, clear water after a drought. There is television as good as <em>The Shield</em> still on the air—Ryan Murphy’s <em>9-1-1</em> is a delight—but I’m afraid that the economics of television are too fraught for more talent to emerge. I used to dream of working in a writers' room like the one <em>The Shield</em> had, where you could take real world politics and create something shocking and enlightening. I don’t know if that kind of room still exists, and I mourn its loss with each episode of <em>The Shield</em> that I watch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/ps5-pro-price-performance-and-what-it-means-for-next-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>So, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> has been revealed, and brought with it a lot of cutlery-based exclamations from gamers over the price tag. £700 for a beefed up PS5… and that’s without a disc drive? Needless to say, the overwhelming reaction has been pretty negative. But will it really matter to Sony’s bottom line? And what does it say about the next generation of consoles?</p>
<p>The main hurdle that the PS5 Pro has, compared to the PS4 Pro, is that it’s not selling a new technology. In 2016 Sony could tie in with the rise of 4K TVs and, making use of the early upscaling technique of checkerboarding, could make a compelling case that the PS4 Pro would give you 4K or close to it. The end results were a good bit below that, often topping out at 1440p, but this was also the advent of graphics modes to let you choose to run games at standard resolution and with higher frame rates –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/09/08/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-on-ps4-pro-has-three-graphics-options/">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> being an early example of this –&nbsp;and shore up performance in games that struggled on base PS4.</p>
<p>And it’s performance mode that has come to dominate gaming habits in the last few years, as Mark Cerny pointes out early in his presentation. Gamers just want 60FPS, coming up against developers who want and need to push graphical fidelity as far as possible, and also to hit a particular release date that’s been handed down to them. There’s plenty of games that launch with only 30FPS modes, before a 60FPS mode and other optimised options are patched in down the line.</p>



<p>That’s not even mentioning the slightly blurry elephant in the room: upscaling. The use of DLSS, FSR and XeSS has skyrocketed in the last few years, various techniques that try to fill in the blanks using previous frames as reference points, to varying degrees of quality. They allow games to run at lower actual resolutions while outputting 4K, being used as a necessary crutch alongside dynamic resolutions to keep frame rates steady, even at 30FPS. Without dedicated hardware support in PS5 or Xbox Series, both have had to rely on AMD’s FSR, when DLSS has much higher quality. Sony’s answer here is their own custom PSSR solution.</p>

<p>Per Digital Foundry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-ps5-series-x-s-tech-review">Alan Wake 2 at launch</a> ran at 1270p to upscale to 4K in quality mode, but drops that to 847p to upscale to 1440p in performance mode. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-alan-wake-2-on-playstation-5-remedy-raises-the-bar-for-visual-accomplishment-once-again">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was a similar compromise</a>, ranging from 1296p to 1800p in quality, or 864p to 1260p in performance.</p>

<p>So here’s the thing: even if PS5 Pro is able to combine quality and performance modes, we’re still well short of native 4K in both these games. Clarity will be improved, but that’s difficult to show in a heavily compressed YouTube video, even if you actually zoom in on images and don’t just crop them funny.</p>
<p>Developers will still be free to use console resources as they see fit, as well. Sony might want to get rid of graphics options, but in reality this is simply shifting the goal posts. You can bet good money that there will still be 30FPS modes in new and updated games, but they might now be a native 4K instead of 1440p-ish. <em>Or</em> developers will get to use the enhanced ray tracing capabilities, which will add a burden to the CPU which hasn’t been meaningfully improved, keeping us back at 30FPS again.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects is how this can actually affect backward compatibility, with Sony saying that PS4 games could be enhanced using PSSR. Early generation games that were never made PS4 Pro compatible could suddenly get a free 4K upscale boost, getting a similar result to Microsoft’s code injection from Xbox backward compatibility, but in a very different way. The only caveat here is that this will be for “select” PS4 games.</p>
<p>But is that worth £700? That’s pricing that feels very much like a halo product, designed to appeal to the comparative few. It’s sure to sell out on day one, and I’d bet there’s at least 10 million people in the world who would consider and be able to afford this, but at the same time I can see it pushing many gamers to think about getting or upgrading a gaming PC instead. With more and more console exclusives coming to PC – whether at the same time for Xbox games, or a little down the road for PlayStation Studios games – that could be rather appealing.</p>
<p>Looking beyond the PS5 Pro and to the next generation, the $700 / £700 price tag is a pretty clear indication that we’re going to see another price hike for the PS6 and next Xbox. The PS5 and Xbox Series X both targeted $500 at launch in 2020, already a big $100 jump over the previous generation launch price, but where many would have expected that price to follow historical trends and gradually slide downward, it’s gone the opposite direction with the price actually increasing around the world in 2022. Even with release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/11/the-ps5-slim-launch-hides-some-sneaky-price-increases/">PS5 Slim</a>, typically the point at which economies of scale and lowering component cost could enable a lower price, didn’t bring the price down. Heck, there were actually price increases for the digital edition in the US and Japan, and Japan has had yet another price hike since then.</p>
<p>Despite this, the PS5 has continued to sell at roughly the same pace as the PS4, and in a tougher economic climate.</p>
<p>Of course, this has also come at a time where general consumer electronics are going up and up in price. The iPhone 5S started at $650 in 2013, and the iPhone 7 was sticking to that price in 2016, but by 2020, the iPhone 12 started at $800 and iPhone 12 Pro at $1000, and that’s without talking about the plus size models and gouging storage options. There’s plenty of people willing to get the biggest and the best version of a phone.</p>

<p>Perhaps a better point of comparison is GPU costs. In 2013, the GeForce GTX 770 (the third tier GPU behind the GTX 780 and Titans of the day) was $399, now that third tier is the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, which debuted at $799 –&nbsp;and that only after Nvidia stepped back from backlash to the 4070 Ti being branded as a 4080 and costing $100 more.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s very different pressures for a new console generation than for an optional mid-gen bump and glory project. For the next generation, both Microsoft and Sony will have to weigh up the actual cost of manufacture against the need to build their audience as quickly as possible to make the generation profitable quickly, meaning they will probably start off by selling at a loss. However, with the rate of progress on die shrinks slowing as we approach 1nm, and so the ability to reduce costs also slowing, brace yourselves for at least a $600 starting price. Without a disc drive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ray-tracing-4k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Much like its predecessor, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom looks incredible with some choice mods, including those introducing ray tracing.</p>
<p>A new video put together by Digital Dreams shows the latest main entry in the series by Nintendo running on PC via emulation with some mods, including the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/MaxLastBreath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UltraCam mod</a>, which introduces a variety of visual improvements and the Beyond All Limits Raytracing ReShade preset. While in some scenarios, the game looks a little too bright, there's no denying the visual improvements these mods bring to the game, making it look and run much better than it does on native hardware.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Zelda TotK - Ultra CAM Mod beyond all limits RAYTRACING  - Ultra graphic gameplay 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6Z8Zuo-7N4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even in its vanilla state, however, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is an excellent game that no fan of the series should skip. While very similar to its predecessor, Tears of the Kingdom is a richer and more rewarding game, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom sticks closely to the blueprint established by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it’s a richer, more rewarding game in most ways that count, offering a more intricate world, versatile suite of abilities, epic story, and satisfying dungeons. The familiarity of this Hyrule and a handful of frustrating sections keep Tears of the Kingdom from feeling quite as surprising and magical as its predecessor, but make no mistake, the wait has been worth it. While it probably behooves Nintendo to carve out an entirely new Legend next, Link’s latest should fill most fans’ heart meters nicely in the meantime.</em></p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is now available on Nintendo Switch.</p>

One user <a href="https://x.com/kizuati/status/1833868706394366069" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> that this decision "was likely with how things went down during Year 1", while <a href="https://x.com/ForeverKnifes/status/1833870588349153367" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another says</a> that Mio's departure is "unfortunate" but "a massive W" nonetheless.</p>
<p>Mio's exit from his role as director comes as&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>continues to flag in terms of player count and user reviews. A quick look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamDB</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>currently has just under 600 players online with a 771-player 24-hour peak, while&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">24-hour peak</a> is much higher at just under 15,000.</p>
<p>All told, it's been a rough ride for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>. The game launched in September last year to middling reviews, and although it enjoyed tens of thousands of concurrent players at launch, those numbers quickly dwindled as players fled, seemingly in order to return to&nbsp;<em>Payday 2</em>.</p>
<p>In February this year, Starbreeze <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance">admitted</a> that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>had performed at "significantly lower levels" than it wanted, and former CEO&nbsp;Tobias Sjögren <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down">stepped down in March</a>, partly due, it seems, to the game's poor performance.</p>

<p>In response to&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s woes, Starbreeze announced an ambitious initiative called Medic Bag, which involves overhauling many of the game's key systems. Last month, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-roadmap">a roadmap was released</a> showing off some of what's coming in the next few months as part of that initiative.</p>

<p>In 2019, Satisfactory was released as an early-access game by Coffee Stain Studios. It pulled in some pretty solid reviews on account of it being quite a unique title, but recently, it was teleported to another level entirely. On September 10, Satisfactory graduated to a fully released game, and shortly after, the player count <strong>skyrocketed</strong>.</p>



<p>Within a few hours of the 1.0 version of Satisfactory being released, more than 100,000 concurrent players were recorded enjoying the game on Steam. That put it in leagues with the likes of Rust and Deadlock, and it pushed it above games like Apex Legends and Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>

<h2 id="h-more-than-satisfactory">More Than Satisfactory</h2>



<p>Satisfactory offers players a unique premise. They’re charged with exploring diverse open-world environments, scavenging up resources and putting them to use in a construction capacity. They’ll need to mine and process materials to build fully automated factory systems, and along the way, they’ll have to manage power systems and deal with alien attacks.</p>



<p>Before hitting the 1.0 release window, Satisfactory had only peaked at around 34,000 concurrent players, which helps to represent the success of the full release. </p>



<p>To ‘qualify’ as a 1.0 version, Satisfactory underwent a staggering number of changes. From run-of-the-mill quality-of-life improvements to bringing the entire game up to spec on the latest version of Unreal, Satisfactory’s full list of changes for the 1.0 update is <strong>hefty</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/506456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Twitch</a>, the game is approaching a new all-time high. It peaked in January 2024 at 70,861 concurrent viewers, but at the time of publishing, it was sitting at around 66,000.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first game to see great success after hitting that 1.0 window. Most recently, 7 Days to Die and Sons of the Forest graduated, moving out of early access and becoming listed as a full game. </p>
