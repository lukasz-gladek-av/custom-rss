		<p>Strange Scaffold has announced Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown, a game that they describe as a turn-based beat ’em up coming to PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown - ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWicTR3TuJU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>TMNT Tactical Takedown puts you in control of each of the four turtles as they take the fight to the Foot Clan in turn-based tactical battles. Each level drops your turtle into a small space with a bunch of enemies, charging you with dispatching all the foes as quickly as possible using their specific movesets to control the space and movement.</p>
<p>There’s some obvious parallels to Fights in Tight Spaces, and before that mini turn-based tactical Into the Breach as well, but those comparisons are hardly a bad thing. It just proves that this concept can work really, really well.</p>
<p>The game comes from Strange Scaffold, the developer behind I Am Your Beast, El Paso, Elsewhere, and more.</p>

<p>Studio founder Xalavier Nelson Jr. said, “Building a truly powerful licensed game requires a deep respect for the source material, love for the fans, and a willingness to challenge tentpoles of the universe to create something that both surprises and delights.</p>
<p>Bringing that kind of experience to life requires an equally powerful relationship – so I will be forever grateful to Doug Rosen and the team at Paramount for their collaboration, and putting their trust in our team to make an original take on the world that soars. I get to make a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game where the very first lines of dialogue establish that Shredder and Splinter are dead. Who else can say that?”</p>
<p>We’re in a rich period for TMNT fans and gamers, with the recent resurgence of the beat ’em up genre seeing the great new release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Shredder’s Revenge</a> and retro revival <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/30/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-the-cowabunga-collection-review/">Cowabunga Collection</a>, as well as new genre spin-offs with the roguelike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/">Splintered Fate</a>. Just avoid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/23/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-arcade-wrath-of-the-mutants-review/">Wrath of the Mutants</a> – that one’s not a very good game…</p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2-focused event is being planned for May, suggesting, together with industry chatter, that the console could be released this June.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the latest episode of their podcast</a>, well-known insider NateDrake provided an update on the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal timing and potential release date. Commenting on the rumored June release window for the system that's been making the rounds in the past few days, the insider mentioned that as of late September, early October, there's been a lot of industry chatter that placed the Nintendo Switch 2 release window between late May to June.&nbsp;There's still some uncertainty regarding this, but partners and publishers have been considering it as the release window for the system for the time being.</p>
<p>While NateDrake could not confirm if the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed releasing in the late May-June release window, the insider did reveal that an event focused on the system is currently being planned for May. The nature of the event is not clear, but it could be similar to the January 2017 event where Nintendo invited the media for some hands-on time with the original Switch. If the Japanese company was following a similar timeframe, the timing of the event suggests that the Nintendo Switch 2 could indeed be released in June, which would be a great time to launch the system with the hands-on opportunities that could be offered during summer events like the Summer Game Fest and PAX East to generate more buzz on the system.</p>

<p>There's little doubt that partners are getting ready for the Nintendo Switch 2 launch, as images and listings for the new<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-pictures/"> Joy-Con controller</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-case-possibly-leaked-through-alibaba/">accessories</a> have started appearing online. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to finally see what Nintendo has been working on for reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">quite a long time.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pro-valorant-teams-made-44m-from-digital-goods-in-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games continues to tout the growth of its VALORANT esports scene, now having completed two seasons of its international partnership league. Like it does with League of Legends, Riot has completely run VALORANT esports all by itself since the game launched in 2020.</p>



<p>Prior to the start of the 2025 VALORANT Champions Tour season, Riot has announced the end-of-year results for its 2024 campaign, revealing yet another massive chunk of change brought in by player spending.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-comes-the-money">Here comes the money</h2>



<p>According to Riot, the company shared $44.3 million from digital goods with the partnered teams competing in VCT 2024, up from <a href="https://valorantesports.com/en-US/news/vct-2023-eoy-letter-to-the-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$33 million in 2023</a>. With 44 teams competing across the four leagues last year, that averages out to just about $1 million per team. Since Riot takes 50 percent of the revenue from digital goods, that means that players spent roughly $88.6 million in total on VCT-themed digital goods.</p>



<p>The digital goods in question refer to two primary items: VCT partner team capsules and the Champions bundle. At the start of the year, Riot introduced VCT partner team capsules, which both teams and fans were highly anticipating. Each team had a bundle with a team-specific Classic pistol skin, a player card designed by the team itself, a logo gun buddy (charm), and a logo spray. New capsules are expected to be released near the start of the 2025 season.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The other main draw for digital goods is the yearly Champions bundle, which includes unique weapon skins and accessories celebrating the VALORANT world championship. This year, for the first time, all partnered teams received a share of Champions bundle revenue, not just the 16 teams that qualified for the event.</p>



<p>Between digital goods, stipends, and prize pool winnings, Riot claims to have given out $78.4 million across the 44 partnered teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there a specific VALORANT team bundle you want to buy next year? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studio%E2%80%99s-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online.1053915/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/it-takes-two-developer-hazelight-studios-next-game-split-fiction-leaks-online/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The next title developed by Hazelight Studios has leaked online from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-la-date-de-sortie-de-split-fiction-le-nouveau-jeu-video-a-venir-des-studios-hazelight-59733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, who has said that the next game is called Split Fiction and is due out on March 6, 2025, on PC and console. Of course, this is just a leak for now, so we don't know whether it is true or not, and you'll have to take it with a pinch of salt. It's said that a reveal trailer for the game is supposed to be released this month and that the game will be announced at The Game Awards, which will be taking place next week.</p>
<p>Hazelight Studios has Josef Fares at the helm, the designer of A Way Out, Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, and It Takes Two. All of these games are published under EA's Originals banner. Split Fiction has the potential to be great, as all three of those games have won awards, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/returnal-it-takes-two-2022-bafta-games-awards-nominations/">It Takes Two</a> winning the most out of the three and being nominated for many more. With that in mind, it's a fair assumption to feel that Split Fiction will equally be full of promise.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is apparently another co-op adventure game being made by Hazelight, which, considering the games that both Hazelight and Josef Fares have worked on, it makes total sense that this is the direction they would go with, especially with the wide success of It Takes Two.</p>
<p>It is known that Hazelight Studios has been working on a new game, as both the Hazelight Studios and Josef Fares social media accounts posted about the upcoming title, confirming that a game was in development. Josef Fares even goes on to post, "Here is a tease. It is a BRAND NEW IP called S**** ******N. Can't wait to show it soon." Considering the number of letters censored and what it begins and starts with, it seems that billbil-kun is right on the money about the title of the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have more details than that, and you'll have to wait and see if the upcoming title Split Fiction is announced by Hazelight Studios at The Game Awards, which is only a week away.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-and-krafton-announce-payday-pubg-crossover.1053906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starbreeze and Krafton have announced a&nbsp;<em>PUBG Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, with the latter set to infiltrate the world of the former through what sounds like a new gameplay experience within&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-partners-with-krafton-to-expand-payday-into-pubg-battlegrounds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement on Starbreeze's website</a>, the studio says the crossover is about increasing "the visibility and reach of the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>franchise", which Starbreeze aims to do by "bringing the heisting experience to a broader audience through&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>".</p>

<p>It's a goal that Starbreeze rather desperately needs to chase right now, since&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>'s in a bit of a tight spot. Recently, <em>Payday 3</em> saw <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-3-game-director-steps-down" rel="nofollow">its director step down</a> in the run-up to its first anniversary, and the game's poor performance also led to Starbreeze's CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">quitting back in March</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=n-GvAGi8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-payday-crossover-zipline.jpg?itok=qXEtFWam 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the explosive, high-octane world of&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement, the collaboration will involve "about a quarter of Starbreeze's development organization during a year" under what Starbreeze calls a "work-for-hire agreement".</p>

<p>It sounds, then, like Starbreeze will be creating the&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>content that will make its way into&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>. The two studios say they're "currently collaborating on the project's integration roadmap", and we'll get more updates later down the line.</p>

<p>It's been a rocky road for&nbsp;<em>Payday 3</em>, with Starbreeze admitting back in February that the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-payday-3-performance" rel="nofollow">performing at "significantly lower levels"</a> than it wanted.</p>

                <p>According to a new report, Ubisoft's family founders are trying to find funding to keep the company in good financial standing while simultaneously attempting to keep control of the firm's future.</p><p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> reports that the Guillemot family--which owns the largest stake in Ubisoft--is talking to Tencent and other financial partners to try to find a way to fund a "management-led buyout."</p><p>CEO Yves Guillemot and his family members are keen to retain control of Ubisoft amid any such deal, and this has apparently been a sticking point in financing discussions. The report said Tencent is asking for a "greater say on future board decisions" in exchange for putting more money into Ubisoft. The report also said Tencent may not invest any further amount of money into Ubisoft.</p><p>The report went on to say Tencent wants to make a deal to help prevent any other firm from coming in to make a hostile takeover bid for Ubisoft. In 2017, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vivendi-will-reportedly-pursue-a-ubisoft-takeover-/1100-6449572/" data-ref-id="1100-6449572">Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover of Ubisoft</a>. The French gaming giant successfully fought this off after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-safe-following-takeover-concerns-vivend/1100-6457541/" data-ref-id="1100-6457541">striking deals with Tencent and a Canadian pension plan.</a></p><p>Tencent currently holds nearly 10% of Ubisoft stock. The Guillemot family owns 15%.</p><p>"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders," Ubisoft said in a statement to Reuters. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the company is also reviewing all its strategic options."</p><p>Earlier this week, Guillemot released a memo to staff that alluded to ongoing business talks about the company's future. In announcing XDefiant's shutdown and the closure of multiple studios resulting in hundreds of layoffs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-still-dedicated-to-live-service-after-its-call-of-duty-competitor-came-up-short/1100-6528215/" data-ref-id="1100-6528215">Guillemot said</a>, "I am working tirelessly with my team to identify the best solutions so we can maintain control of our destiny."</p><p>This latest development follows on from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-considering-a-major-change-to-its-structure/1100-6526909/" data-ref-id="1100-6526909">a story in October</a> that claimed Ubisoft and Tencent were talking about multiple options, including a total buyout. At the time, Ubisoft acknowledged that discussions were underway as the company looked to find a deal that would appease shareholders. That report said it was early days for any such talks, and this new report doesn't mention anything being close to a done deal.</p><p>Minority shareholder and hedge fund AJ Investments published an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-urges-company-to-make-drastic-change-amid-sinking-stock/1100-6526392/" data-ref-id="1100-6526392">open letter</a> in September asking Ubisoft to go private and change its strategy.</p><p>In September, Ubisoft's shares sunk to their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/" data-ref-id="1100-6526262">lowest since 2015</a>, falling by 12.6% after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">Star Wars Outlaws released</a> to lower-than-expected sales.

                <p>The world of The Witcher is full of monsters, madmen, and mages, but when Geralt isn't on the trail of any of those, the man knows how to wind down with a game of Gwent. The two-player card game has the players as generals pitting their armies against each other. There's been a Gwent mobile app and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1284410/GWENT_The_Witcher_Card_Game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free-to-play version on Steam</a>, but now a physical reproduction of the game is on its way.</p><p>Hachette Boardgames UK and new publisher No Loading Games--which is focused on bringing licensed brands to tabletop gaming--are collaborating on the release. The set will come with over 400 cards and a playmat to give players that authentic Witcher 3 experience. There will be variant rulesets from casual play to tournament rules.</p><p>"Gwent is the biggest 'game within a game' in media history," said the marketing manager for Hachette Boardgames UK, Rob Trounce (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-card-game-gwent-finally-getting-a-physical-release" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>). "After a 10-year wait, we are proud to be working alongside No Loading Games to bring this beloved game to tabletops in a stunning package--whether it's a souvenir for fans of Geralt and his adventures, or a game for competitive card game enthusiasts, Gwent will be one of the hottest games of 2025."</p><p>The rules are simple enough, but the path to victory has several routes, all depending on your deck, which has its own set of advantages. There are four decks to choose from: Monsters, Nilfgaardian Empire, Northern Realms, and Scoia'tael. A fifth deck--Skellige--was added with The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine expansion. There are also neutral cards that, while not a deck in itself, can be used with any of the main decks to boost their abilities.</p><p>Matches are won by two out of three rounds, which are tallied by red gems in the game. Losing a round loses you one of the points, and if you lose both, you lose the match. A draw makes both players lose a point unless you are the Nilfgaardian Empire, whose ability is to win matches that end in draws.</p><p>The entire Gwent game set is priced at around $40 and will arrive in late 2025.</p><p>While Witcher fans won't have to wait too long for Gwent, they'll have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-devs-tease-some-of-what-cd-projekt-red-is-planning/1100-6528173/" data-ref-id="1100-6528173">bit longer for The Witcher 4</a>. Though the game has reached full-scale production, we're still looking at two years before the release.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft is continuing its talks with Chinese giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> over a possible buyout deal that would take the Assassin's Creed maker  private, a new report states.
</p>
<p>
The move - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-and-tencent-considering-buyout-taking-the-company-private-report">first mooted last month</a> - would see Ubisoft take back control of its company from shareholders. Today, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/">Reuters</a> reported that Ubisoft is seeking a deal which would see its French founders, the Guillemot family, retain control.
</p>
<p>
However, the same report states that Tencent - Ubisoft's second-largest shareholder with ownership of nearly 10 percent of the company - is keen for a greater role and input on future board decisions.

<p>
Talks remain ongoing between the two companies on how to move forward. Ubisoft stock spiked 14 percent today as a result of the report.
</p>
<p>
"We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders" a spokesperson for Ubisoft told Eurogamer today. "In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options."
</p>
<p>The buyout talks come after a particularly rocky year for Ubisoft, which has suffered at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suffers-third-round-of-job-losses-this-year">least three rounds of layoffs</a>, staff walkouts, and disappointing sales of key titles. </p>
<p>Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">delayed its biggest upcoming launch Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> until 14th February 2025, after seeing "softer than expected" sales for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the company announced the closure of several studios, with the loss of 277 employees, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-shutting-studios-laying-off-277-employees-as-it-pulls-plug-on-live-service-shooter-xdefiant">pulls the plug on live-service shooter XDefiant</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> that the Guillemot family and Tencent were planning a buyout of Ubisoft, Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ubisoft-shareholders-talks-over-possible-buyout-terms-sources-say-2024-12-06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> that the company's shareholders are still discussing buyout terms. One of the key issues is that the Guillemot family wants to maintain control over Ubisoft following the buyout.</p>
<p>Chinese giant Tencent is already the second-largest shareholder. However, despite earlier rumors, Reuters says they haven't decided yet whether to increase their stake and, therefore, join the buyout proposal. Tencent would like to exert greater control on board decisions (such as the distribution of cash flow) if it has to finance the deal, but the Guillemots haven't agreed to that yet. At the same time, Tencent also seeks to prevent any takeover of the company from third parties. As such, their strategy is reportedly to wait and see if the Guillemot family will sign on the proposal.</p>
<p>An Ubisoft spokesperson has released the following statement to accompany Reuters' article:</p>
<p><em>We remain committed to making decisions in the best interests of all of our stakeholders. In this context, as we have already indicated, the Company is also reviewing all its strategic options.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like the Guillemots will have to give up on their long-standing goal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-confirms-avatar-mario-rabbids-and-skull-bones-for-fy-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keeping Ubisoft independent</a>. As you may recall, it's not the first time they had trouble with that, as Vivendi attempted a hostile takeover a few years ago. They were ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-and-vivendi-the-cutain-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsuccessful</a>, and Ubisoft enjoyed a brief reprieve.</p>
<p>However, it would not last. First came the accusations of sexual misconduct, which brought their own issues for the company to face. More recently, even game launches were not as successful as planned due to commercially underwhelming games like Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Skull and Bones, XDefiant (which will shut down in a few months, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> yesterday), and Star Wars Outlaws. Ubisoft was even forced to <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a> Assassin's Creed Shadows, losing millions of dollars to try and prevent the same fate from befalling its premiere franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release, sales of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>have reached the two million mark across all platforms. That number includes both physical shipments and digital sales.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether that number meets, exceeds, or falls short of Square Enix's sales expectations. However, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">recently stated</a> that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth&nbsp;</em>fell short of its projections, so it'll no doubt be looking for some successes to reassure shareholders.</p>

It's a remake of the classic 1988 RPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>&nbsp;with a new coat of paint courtesy of Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark</a> HD-2D style.</p>

<p>The new remake (for it isn't the first remake of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3</em>) makes a number of changes, including the addition of difficulty options, voice acting at certain points in the game, and changes to the story.</p>

<p>Specifically, the narrative has been altered in order to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>fit in better with the HD-2D remakes of the first two games, which are set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>also contains a number of quality-of-life improvements, including increased movement speed, a minimap to help you explore the overworld, and more.</p>

<p>The battle system has also received a makeover; while it retains the basic essence of the original game's combat, you now view the action from a zoomed-out perspective, allowing you to see your characters as they fight.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

Following a screening of the documentary at BAFTA in Piccadilly, London, IGN spoke with GSC Game World CEO Ievgen Grygorovych and creative director Maria Grygorovych about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-gsc-game-world-explains-for-the-first-time-what-went-wrong-with-a-life-20-and-why-it-was-removed-from-the-games-description-on-steam">what went wrong with A-Life 2.0</a>, but also more generally about the game’s development and launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the key questions GSC has faced is whether it could have delayed Stalker 2 further in order to iron out its bugs before launch. But both Ievgen and Maria said this would have been impossible, given the crunch the team had already endured in the months leading up to November.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(It’s worth bearing in mind that English is not Ievgen or Maria’s first language.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Game development, it's hard,” Maria said. “Players can compare us with a lot of companies. A lot of companies have much more budgets for development. So for us it was even harder because we are an independent company, so we don't have some, I dunno, big daddy to help us every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's a problem that we are not so perfectly finished like we really wanted to do before release, but for us we can't do better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen insisted GSC Game World did everything it could to get Stalker 2 in a decent spot for launch considering the impact the war had and continues to have on the developers. “We did everything possible considering everything that’s happening,” he said. “Considering how much time we have, considering what is our resources, considering, look, we have so much people, but what part of the daytime - part of our people don't have electricity at all and they can’t work.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/06/20241202-202049-1733223547947-1733493295077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Ievgen and Maria Grygorovych, far right, discuss the making of Stalker 2 at BAFTA 195 Piccadilly. Photo by IGN.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Ievgen and Maria admitted it’s difficult for GSC to make excuses with its customers, customers who at the end of the day have spent their money on a product they expect to work properly irrespective of the circumstances in which it was made. But they hoped the documentary would help create a degree of empathy for the staff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can't tell our players that every day, half of our team don't have electricity at all week after week,” Maria said. “And some of our people can't sleep at night, half of our people, because of drones, because of missiles. And it happens every day. And how can people even survive when they can't sleep? Can't work because of electricity. For example now, a lot of our people have problems with warming their apartments, because it’s very cold. Now Russia is beating [targeting] the place [energy infrastructure] who heat apartments, like houses. But it’s the game industry. We can't talk about it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can’t say to a player, look, it’s hard to make the game,” Ievgen added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the bugs, Ievgen is proud of Stalker 2, which he compared to building a “huge ship” it hauled over the Atlantic. Maria, too, sounds happy with the foundation GSC produced: “You hope that people can feel like the game is there… It's not so perfect that we wanted, but it's a game with soul.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it seems players have responded, too. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-already-sold-1-million-copies-with-many-more-playing-on-xbox-game-pass">Stalker 2 sold one million copies in less than two days</a>, and currently enjoys a ‘very positive’ user review rating on Steam (84% of the 64,872 user reviews are positive).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Ievgen isn’t satisfied. Indeed, he wants Stalker 2 to eventually achieve a 90% user review rating: “For a creative person, we want to get an achievement, like we did a game that 90% of people loved, not 85, not 83, not 86. We want 90. ‘But 89 is also good!’ No! 89 starts from eight and you want to start from nine. I spent six years. It's maybe like a child's thing that you want to achieve it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ievgen then admitted that he expected a much worse user review rating on Steam than Stalker 2 ended up getting given the bugs the team knew players might run into at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I expected to have much less success than we had from the audience,” Ievgen said. “We were afraid of that… we know that the game released in a state that we would like to make it better. And you release the game, there is always some bugs. We know maybe half of them. We know that we would like to have more time, but it's our limitation. It was impossible to make more than we were making.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “We as a developer, we see much more problems in the game than the players usually face. So many players didn't face 99% of the bugs inside our game. And we know much more problems. And we were like, ‘what if players face this problem and we haven't fixed it yet?’ And because we saw much more, we were much more stressed. It was impossible to say how many people would face this problem, or how many people would face problems we haven't faced yet and we don't know about. It's a very stressful moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So I was afraid that it [Stalker 2] may get it [the reception from players]] worse than it was, but still we want it better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why not delay Stalker 2 yet again? Ievgen said the team simply had nothing left in the tank, equating the development to running a marathon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We were working maybe 16 hours a day for several months,” he said. “You are running a marathon and there are 10 kilometers left until the end, and you are so tired, and you say, ‘look, you have to run an additional 40 kilometers.’ And you say that I can't but okay, and you are running and running and running and running, and you understand that the time is going out and still some kilometers left, but you are not there. Not because you were not doing your best, you were trying to do your best and you can do it, but you just need more time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But everyone has limitations, so it's impossible to pause the time, to stop it and to make it better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To help you survive in the Zone, we've got a list of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Stalker 2 Tips and Tricks</a>, plus a guide on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_to_Do_First_in_Stalker_2">Things to Do First in Stalker 2</a> to help you through the early game, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stalker-2/Things_Stalker_2_Doesn%27t_Tell_You">Things Stalker 2 Doesn't Tell You</a> - everything we wish we knew before we started playing.

                <p>According to PlayStation veteran Chris Deering, Sony was anxious about the original Xbox and that concern prompted the company to sign an exclusivity deal with Take-Two for Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>"We were worried when we saw Xbox coming," Deering recalled at a recent EGX event in London, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/stories-from-30-years-of-playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>. "We knew exclusivity was the name of the game in a lot of fields."</p><p>With that concern in mind, Deering said he approached third-party publishers and developers to ask if they would be interested in taking a "special deal" for timed exclusivity for any of their upcoming games. Deering and company didn't realize GTA would become such a massive franchise, but that bet seemed to pay off, as GTA III took the series into a new direction with a 3D open-world approach.</p><p>"One of the deals we made was with Take-Two for the next three Grand Theft Auto games. At the time, it wasn't clear that Grand Theft Auto III was going to be as huge as it was, because it used to be a top down game," Deering said. "It was very lucky for us. And actually lucky for them, because they got a discount on the royalty they paid. Those deals aren't uncommon in industries with platforms. Including today with things like social media."</p><p>The original Xbox would go on to launch in November 2001, but GTA III did not show up on Xbox until November 2003. The timed-exclusivity deals extended Vice City and San Andreas.</p><p>While the exclusivity deals ended there--GTA 4 and GTA 5 launched on PlayStation and Xbox at the same time--Sony did continue to work with Rockstar on special deals. For example, GTA 5 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2014-grand-theft-auto-v-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one-pc/1100-6420294/" data-ref-id="1100-6420294">announced for PS4 at Sony's E3 briefing in 2014</a>. There is no word on if Rockstar has any special relationship with Sony or Microsoft for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, however.</p><p>As for Deering, he left Sony in 2005. He also made headlines recently when he said recent video game industry layoffs were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-sony-exec-claims-that-industry-layoffs-arent-because-of-corporate-greed/1100-6526384/" data-ref-id="1100-6526384">not due to corporate greed alone</a>, but are instead part of general macroeconomic conditions. Deering was roundly criticized for saying people who have been laid off can just "go to the beach for a year."</p>

<p>Version 1.4, also known as "A Storm of Falling Stars", will officially arrive across all platforms on December 18th. Its biggest new feature is an overhaul to the way Main Story stages work; the story's TV mode will be "replaced with story stages", allowing you to jump straight into battles.</p>

<p>You can expect redesigned versions of Main Story stages from the Prologue through Chapter 3, and future story chapters will also work on this new system. You can also now play as all contracted Agents in the city, as well as walking through New Eridu with your Agents in the new Quality Time Mode.</p>

<p>Your first new character is the Frost Anomaly Agent Hoshimi Miyabi, who can deal huge damage with "swift movements and precise slashes". She's joined by Electric Agent Asaba Harumasa, who wields both a bow and a blade.</p>

<p>New combat modes will also be introduced in this update, including a major Hollow Zero update and the new Deadly Assault periodic operation. If you feel like testing your strategy skills, you can also check out the new Bangboo tower defense game in the Reverb Arena.</p>




<p>Version 1.4 of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>will also bring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november" rel="nofollow">PS5 Pro enhancements</a> for the game, including "enhanced performance and ray-tracing technology" to make HoYoverse's latest action RPG look and feel even snazzier.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.4 launches on December 18th. The game is available to play right now for free on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p>

You can then go north again into The Beanstalk Marshes to fish before finally going down into Teapot Falls. </p><p>After exhausting all of the pools in each of these locations, you should be able to go from Teapot Falls back into The Wild Woods to find that some pools are replenishing, allowing you to begin the process back over.</p><p>Getting a stack of Sea Monster Tooth may take a while, but it’s necessary for crafting some of the coolest items from <em>The Storybook Vale</em>, so keep at it!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has not been spared from the discourse about “dying” that surrounds multiplayer and live service games in recent years. Counter-Strike as a series has been around for decades, and the state of the game has been a constant discussion point since.</p>



<p>But is there any truth to the arguments that CS2 is dying?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-why-are-players-saying-that-cs2-is-dying">Why are players saying that CS2 is dying?</h2>



<p>There are a number of issues that the wider Counter-Strikes 2 player base has with the state of the game.</p>



<p>One of these issues has been Valve Anti-Cheat, the anti-cheat program that’s supposed to keep cheaters and hackers at bay. Many players claim that VAC hardly keeps cheaters out, and that they are constantly running into cheaters on a frequent basis.</p>



<p>Other issues plaguing the game include client performance, a lack of new content (seasonal operations), more frequent crashes, subtick issues, and various bugs.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-counter-strike-2-dying">Is Counter-Strike 2 dying?</h2>



<p>Despite the issues facing Counter-Strike 2 currently, the game is not dying. While the player numbers for CS2 have always fluctuated, there’s been no consistent dropoff. The <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peak player and average player numbers</a> as of December 2024 are lower now than they were in April or May, but higher than they were in January or February.</p>



<figure><figcaption>CS2 player peaks and averages, per SteamDB.</figcaption></figure>



<p>These numbers will typically spike after a large update, whether that be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a change to the map pool</a> or a return of the Major pass. While these larger updates feel more sparse when compared to other popular multiplayer titles, players are still logging back in to play. Valve is also still (slowly) releasing updates regarding some of the major issues.</p>



<p>CS2 is still the most played game on Steam at any given time, and likely will remain that way for a long time.</p>



<p>Thoughts on CS2 as whole? Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Grand Theft Auto</strong> is arguably the most legendary franchise in gaming, proving time and again why it’s so overwhelmingly popular. It has produced some of the most instantly recognisable protagonists in the business – and even the franchise’s side characters are just as memorable. With Grand Theft Auto 6 on the horizon, we thought it’d be appropriate to rank the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/grand-theft-auto/">Grand Theft Auto</a> protagonists, figuring out once and for all which main character in the GTA series is the best.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-protagonists-ranked">Grand Theft Auto Protagonists Ranked</h2>



<p><em>It’s driven mostly by opinion – if you have your own ranking for the Grand Theft Auto characters, feel free to drop a comment saying who you’d put where in this list!</em></p>



<h4 id="h-10-victor-vance-vice-city-stories">10. Victor Vance (Vice City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vic Vance first appeared as a minor character in Vice City and had his own journey documented later on in Vice City Stories, which was a prequel of sorts. He becomes embroiled in the seedy, criminal underbelly of Vice City to support his family, and while his game boasted a good story, it wasn’t overwhelmingly impactful – hence the rating.</p>



<h4 id="h-9-johnny-klebitz-the-lost-and-damned">9. Johnny Klebitz (The Lost and Damned)</h4>



<p>Back when Grand Theft Auto actually had story-based expansions, players were introduced to Johnny Klebitz. As a part of the Grand Theft Auto IV saga, Johnny took centre stage in The Lost and Damned, a gritty expansion based around an outlaw motorcycle club that was strewn with themes of brotherhood, loyalty, and the constant threat of brutal death. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-grand-theft-auto-cross-platform/">Is Grand Theft Auto Cross-Platform?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-8-tommy-vercetti-vice-city">8. Tommy Vercetti (Vice City)</h4>



<p>Tommy Vercetti is an iconic PlayStation 2-era character, emerging from the very heart of Vice City as one the most ruthless and headstrong characters in the GTA series. As a former hitman for the Mafia, Vercetti has the tools needed to survive in the trade, and there are hopes he’ll resurface in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h4 id="h-7-claude-gta-iii">7. Claude (GTA III)</h4>



<figure><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gta-5/"></a></figure>







<p>Claude was a silent protagonist who ushered in a new generation of gaming with the introduction of Grand Theft Auto III, the first 3D game in the series. It changed the paradigm for open-world adventures, and despite Claude never uttering a word, he’d become known as one of the most impactful Grand Theft Auto protagonists ever.</p>



<h4 id="h-6-franklin-clinton-gta-v">6. Franklin Clinton (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Franklin Clinton was always more of a follower than a leader – first with Lemar Davis and then with Michael De Santa – but he had remarkable talents that made him shine in Grand Theft Auto V. His struggles ultimately turned themselves around, and in a relatively short period of time, Franklin Clinton became a legend of the streets, making millions, living in Vinewood Hills, and pulling off immense heists.</p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-gta-5-still-so-popular/">Why Is GTA 5 Still So Popular?</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-5-trevor-philips-gta-v">5. Trevor Philips (GTA V)</h4>



<p>Trevor Philips was as unhinged as they came, but he was one of the most entertaining Grand Theft Auto protagonists to ever grace our screens. His anger management issues made for some hilarious situations, and despite his insanely hot head, he was an overwhelmingly talented marksman with a cold and calculating mind for business, and that’s what made him such a strong GTA protagonist.</p>



<h4 id="h-4-tony-cipriani-liberty-city-stories">4. Tony Cipriani (Liberty City Stories)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>Tony Cipriani is one of the few GTA characters to bridge that gap between more than one game, appearing in both Grand Theft Auto III as a main character and in Liberty City Stories as the protagonist. He was a driving force in the Leone Crime Family that was based in Liberty City, and as both a fiercely loyal individual and a talented combatant, he made his mark on the franchise and proved that someone can perfect the balance between being a <strong>family man </strong>and a <strong>made man</strong>.</p>



<h4 id="h-3-michael-de-santa-gta-v">3. Michael De Santa (GTA V)</h4>



<p>In many ways, Michael De Santa was the driving force behind the Grand Theft Auto V story – he was the catalyst and the spark that triggered events and snowballed them into the grand adventure that hundreds of millions of players have enjoyed. He’s a skilled criminal, even in his later years, and he’s unbelievably talented with any form of weaponry. He’s also a master thief, a charismatic individual, and what’s more, he recognises the need to help youngsters develop themselves into something greater than what they are. </p>



<h6><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-source-code-partially-leaks/">Learn About The GTA 5 Source Code Leaks</a></strong></h6>



<h4 id="h-2-carl-cj-johnson-san-andreas">2. Carl ‘CJ’ Johnson (San Andreas)</h4>



<p>Carl Johnson was introduced to the world in 2004’s GTA San Andreas, and he would ultimately go on to become one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists of all time. He’s a die-hard family man and a ruthless fighter with a heart of gold, and he wants what’s best for those closest to him. He’s multi-talented, oozes charisma, and his journey across San Andreas turns him from a back-street gangbanger to a legendary icon of the series.</p>



<h4 id="h-1-niko-bellic-gta-iv">1. Niko Bellic (GTA IV)</h4>



<figure></figure>







<p>In Grand Theft Auto IV (2008) players were introduced to a darker, more serious tone – and it was a total break away from what we’d come to know and love from the series thus far. However, it was a smash hit, and it put Niko Bellic on the GTA map. </p>



<p>As the man who sits atop the list of the best Grand Theft Auto protagonists, Niko has earned his spot for many reasons. Firstly, he’s a stalwart protector of his family and friends, which makes him honourable. He does what he does with the best of intentions in mind, and somehow, he manages to be likeable even when he’s going on a rampage to protect those he loves.</p>



<p>He’s a mysterious, storied character with a background that players simply desire to learn more about, and his journey through Liberty City is monumental. He goes from being an immigrant fresh off the deck of a cargo boat to being a respected, revered criminal presence in the city. </p>



<p>That’s why he’s the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist in the series.</p>

                <p>The newest Call of Duty weapons have been revealed online, and we are running out of ways to describe how ridiculous and over-the-top the game's guns have become. As announced previously, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are getting numerous new weapons in Season 1 Reloaded, and these include a gun that turns into a bong and a melee weapon that morphs into a rave with a cat as the DJ. Seriously.</p><p>Call of Duty has, for many years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-best-stoner-dlc-yet-turns-you-into-a-pot-smoking-lizard/1100-6528200/" data-ref-id="1100-6528200">enjoyed and embraced pot-smoking</a>, and the new Dank Days skin bundle that turns you into a pot-smoking lizard continues that trend. The gun even lets you spark up and use your gun as a bong, as smoke clouds emerge. The "Toxic Pawsitivity Mastercraft," meanwhile, transforms the baseball bat melee weapon into a rave, with a little cat acting as the DJ. Check out the videos below to see these in action, and expect these store bundles to come to Black Ops 6 and Warzone soon.</p><p>These videos emerged from data-miners. When a new Call of Duty season launches, like Season 1 Reloaded did on December 5, people quickly dig through the files to find what's coming next, and that includes these two wacky bundles.</p><p>Season 1 Reloaded brings a lot more to Call of Duty than bongs and raves. The update introduces new maps, modes, weapons, events, and all manner of holiday season changes.</p><p>For more on what's coming to Black Ops 6/Warzone Season 1 Reloaded this December, check out the gallery below.</p>
