			<p>It seems like Turtle Rock Studios may be working on Back 4 Blood 2. The rumor comes from MP1st, which spotted a project titled Gobi 2 under the resume of actor Jesse Hutch (who previously performed motion capture for JD Fenix in Gears of War 4). Gobi was the codename for the first Back 4 Blood, apparently named after the studio's mascot pet, a bearded dragon that has now passed away. A website for Back 4 Blood 2 was also registered last year.</p>
<p>Developer Turtle Rock <a href="https://wccftech.com/back-4-blood-no-new-content-turtle-rock-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> it would move from the first installment in February 2023. Although its post-launch support only lasted a little over a year, the game seems to have <a href="https://wccftech.com/gotham-knights-and-back-4-blood-may-have-achieved-wb-games-sales-goals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">achieved</a> the sales goals set by publisher Warner Bros. Games, making the likelihood of a sequel fairly high.</p>
<p>A spiritual successor to Turtle Rock's Left 4 Dead, Back 4 Blood launched on October 12, 2021. The game earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech; here's the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/back-4-blood-dont-alert-horde/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a> summary from Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Back 4 Blood isn't Left 4 Dead, and it doesn't even try to be it, doing away with the classics' straightforward campaign in favor of a more modern experience that rewards progression and offers plenty of replayability. The excellent map and mission design, the huge variety of builds made possible by the card system, and satisfying gameplay make the game by Turtle Rock Studios the one to get for those who have a team of friends ready to take on hordes of undead, but those who are looking to play the game solo would do better to look elsewhere, as Back 4 Blood doesn't offer much for those not too keen on teamwork.</em></p>

"Few games sing for you like this. Few systems compliment and combine so elegantly and relentlessly, with such small and simple moments of care for everything in it, from the little blipping noises for reloading and picking up health (straight out of Grand Theft Auto - Rollerdrome's full of ultimate video game sounds) to the booming pistols of Lara Croft. And no game has ever been so cool."</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a>, on the other hand, secured a recommended, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/conan-exiles-review-a-handsomely-sculpted-survival-game">Eurogamer's review</a> saying: "If Ark and Rust are the flaccid alpha males of survival gaming, Conan is the cocksure challenger angling for an advantage".</p>
<p>In case you missed it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cheeky-tweet-hints-at-the-next-big-franchise-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Spyro Reignited Trilogy hit Xbox Game Pass last week</a>.

            <p>
BioWare had the look of its excellent RPG Dragon Age: The Veilguard nailed a decade ago, when early work first began right after Dragon Age Inquisition's launch. 
</p>
<p>
Artwork shared by BioWare veteran Matt Rhodes reveals a very familiar-looking Minrathous, capital of Tevinter and the location for The Veilguard's opening mission, created 10 years before The Veilguard finally arrived. 
</p>
<p>
It's fascinating to see this, as well as other early production art from Rhodes, and consider how much of what became The Veilguard was nailed down already - even before the launch of Inquisition's final expansion, Trespasser. Simultaneously, it's also a little unbelievable that fans still had so long to wait to finally play it!
</p>
<p>
"The first real piece of concept art I made for this project," Rhodes wrote, sharing artwork of Minrathous on social media. "We knew we were going to Tevinter, so this was the first attempt to flesh that out."

<p>
As described by Rhodes, the image shows: "a powerful magister being carried on a palanquin by her elven slaves, and scrappy adventurers trying to evade mage patrols and survive in an urban labyrinth".
</p>
<p>
Rhodes has been at BioWare for 20 years and served as art director on the Dragon Age franchise for the past six. 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Rhodes showcased other Veilguard artwork created in 2014. There's some fascinating similarities to the final game here, including several images of Solas - and even one where he appears to be undertaking his ritual from Veilguard's opening.

The Veilguard finally launched last month, after a lengthy development which saw the project rebooted several times. At one point, the game would have included multiplayer elements. Ultimately, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-says-next-dragon-age-will-now-be-single-player-only-due-to-anthems-fortunes-reversing-eas-original-plans">these were dropped</a> - and the result is a single-player BioWare RPG that stands amongst the developer's best.
</p>
<p>
"A fantasy role-playing game of astonishing spectacle," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>. "This is the best Dragon Age, and perhaps BioWare, has ever been."
</p>
<p>
It took a little while for me to find my groove, but the more of Dragon Age I play, the more I find myself enamoured with its vast world and wonderful characters. If you're playing, Eurogamer has a lengthy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard walkthrough, tips and tricks</a> to help with your playthrough - as well as a guide to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-how-to-get-the-best-ending-good">best Dragon Age: The Veilguard endings</a> when the time comes for you to finally step up and (hopefully) save the day.

For embattled publisher Ubisoft, it is a reliable earner <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisofts-founding-guillemot-family-and-tencent-reportedly-considering-taking-the-company-private-amid-high-profile-flops-and-share-price-collapse">at a time when new releases such as Star Wars: Outlaws and Call of Duty competitor XDefiant have struggled</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The addition of crossplay means players will be able to play with friends from other platforms seamlessly, with console players able to join the PC player pool. Squads including a PC player will be automatically moved to the PC-matchmaking pool. However, PC players will not have the option to join the console matchmaking pool. Console players who play Ranked playlists with crossplay active will maintain a PC rank that is separate from their console rank, Ubisoft explained.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The anticheat updates include improved cheater detection to ensure fairness, Ubisoft said. With the arrival of PC and console crossplay, players with a Mousetrap Penalty will be forced into the PC matchmaking pool for 90 days. If crossplay is turned off, these players will be unable to join matchmaking until the option is turned back on. Additionally, matches with a detected cheater will be automatically canceled with no impact on MMR. “These changes reflect Rainbow Six Siege’s ongoing commitment to player protection,” Ubisoft added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Related, Ubisoft has overhauled the Reputation Center to provide a clearer overview of how different actions affect player standing and thresholds for receiving warnings or penalties. Account-related information such as rank, reputation, and match replays will be concentrated in the new Career hub, with account stats coming soon, Ubisoft clarified.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Blackbeard now has an upgraded Adaptable Shield gadget, and the Siege Cup beta is available to all players above Clearance Level 50. Siege Cup is Siege’s most competitive playlist, where five-player squads compete in skill-based ladder tournaments for Competitive Coins that can be used to unlock exclusive skin collections every two weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, Season 4 makes changes to Ballistic Shields and balancing updates for Attacking Operators Ying and Sens. The number of bullets needed to suppress Shield Operators have been reduced to add value to suppressive fire and improve Shield Operator counterplay. This allows suppression to occur sooner and last for a longer duration, Ubisoft explained. Operators will not take damage from melee attacks while shielded, but guard break intensity from melee attacks will remain the same. Ying’s rush has been changed "to encourage more precise gameplay" in addition to Sens’ R.O.U. Projectors update "that allows for more flexible and creative play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/18/nacon-rig-600-pro-hs-wicked-cushions-special-edition-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nacon’s RIG line of headsets remain one of my favourite picks in the gaming audio landscape, and this year’s 600 Pro HS improved on all of their previous entries, particularly at its very competitive pricepoint. While it was already a great option, Nacon haven’t finished tinkering with it, and that means that they’ve just released a brand-new collab with plush ear-ware specialists Wicked Cushions. The result? A headset that’s even more comfortable, while rocking one of the most eye-catching paint jobs out there.</p>
<p><iframe title="LIMITED EDITION ACID CAMO RIG 600 PRO HS ft. Wicked Cushions | DUAL WIRELESS HEADSET" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iz-H2DcvxBE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wicked Cushions business is making upgraded ear cushions for your headsets and headphones and making them more eye-catching in the process. That’s immediately evident in this collaboration, with the neon green highlights of the Acid Camo paint job extending onto the external edges of the ear cushions. It looks stunning, and if you’ve got a favourite headset it’s probably well worth taking a look at their website to see how their other designs could improve your worn-out and impeccably dull black ear cushions.</p>


<p>The external edges of the cushions are fashioned from leatherette, meaning that the 600 Pro HS’s already strong passive noise cancellation ramps up a notch, helping to form a very effective seal around your ears. Once you’ve got something pumping through them – I found the new Linkin Park album especially effective – you won’t be able to hear anything from the outside world. Perfect for immersion, and for appreciating whatever audio you’re into. The pads are also thicker, and the memory foam is firmer than in the original set, so they envelop your ear rather than sagging into it, though our original review pair may have taken something of a battering in the past ten months. Whatever the case, the new ear cushions take the 600 Pro HS’s comfort levels to a newfound level, placing them at the top of the sub-£100 bracket.</p>
<p>Swapping out the earpads in this way is certainly an unusual move for Nacon – maybe they’ve been eying Sony’s recent mid-generation upgrade of the PS5 Pro? – but when the results are as good as this it’s very hard to argue. They’ve taken one of my favourite headsets of the year and made them better, and that’s about as good as things get.</p>


<p><em>Our original 600 Pro HS Review continues below:</em></p>
<p>You can recognise a RIG headset from a mile off thanks to the one unchanging element of their lineup. The industrial design mimics a piece of steel girder wrapping around your head, and while that might sound a bit much, I’ve grown to love the style over the years. It’s not for everyone, but Nacon has done their best to make the range look sleek and modern. One thing the 600 Pro HS has in common with a steel girder is that it’s incredibly strong, with the plastic headband putting up with a barrage of twisting and stretching.</p>
<p>The only thing that does happen is that the earpieces pop out. That’s due to the RIG sizing system, which allows you to place the earpieces into one of three sockets depending on how much space you need, rather than having a sliding headband like many other manufacturers do. The big positive to this is that no matter what, you’re always able to get a consistent fit, and even if the earpiece does pop out while you’ve flung it in a drawer, they slot right back into place.</p>
<p>The RIG 600 Pro HS’ USB-C dongle works with the PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PC and Mac – an Xbox version is also available – while its Bluetooth will connect to anything pumping out a signal. I had no problems pairing it to my Honor Magic V3, and it handily connects to calls when you’re playing if you have it set to Dual mode. There’s a physical call control button on the left earpiece, and this also lets you play and pause your music when you’re not taking a call, so if you want to play Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora while battering your ears with Sleep Token, you can.</p>
<p>The dongle itself is nice and small, and it’s perfect for use with the Switch or the Steam Deck while on the go. There’s a USB-A adaptor included in the box too, which helps if that solitary USB-C socket on your PS5 is already taken up by something else. I experienced no connection drops at any point, and Nacon’s technology on this front has proven to be spot-on in recent years.</p>

<p>The RIG 600 Pro HS uses a mobile phone app to tailor its functions, and once you’ve installed it – versions are available for both iOS and Android – you can dive into setting your headset’s EQ, microphone gain, mic monitoring and a few other secondary functions. The included EQ settings are limited, but there is a custom option, and if you opt for Expert Mode there’s a 10-point frequency scale to tinker with. It’s a great addition, and thanks to the Dual setting you can play and alter your EQ at the same time.</p>
<p>You will need the app as the on-board controls are fairly limited. Situated on the left earpiece there’s a power button, Bluetooth toggle, a cheap-feeling volume wheel and the aforementioned call control button. It would have been nice to have some form of on-board EQ control, but the ease of use and connection with the app makes up for this.<br>
Tailoring your EQ will mean you’re able to get the best out of the Nacon 600 Pro HS, and the 40mm drivers are as good as those in Nacon’s other recent RIG headsets. When playing Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora the ambient sounds of the alien landscape sounded clear and enticing, while explosions had plenty of bottom end rumble, particularly after I’d played with the 600 Pro’s EQ settings.</p>
<p>Utilising the 3D audio of the PlayStation 5, the 600 Pro HS was more than capable of delivering a convincing 3D landscape, with plenty of depth to the soundstage despite being a closed-back headset. The direction of gunfire in Avatar was also easy to discern, as was the arrival of my Ikran mount as it flew overhead.</p>
<p>Thanks to that adaptable EQ I found that listening to music with the 600 Pro HS was similarly enjoyable, taking the booming down-tuned guitars of Sleep Token and convincingly translating all of that depth and aggression. Vessel’s vocals retained their precision and clarity through the mid-range and there was plenty of detail to the top-end too, meaning that you can merrily take the 600 Pro on a trip – if you can get over the looks.</p>

<p>The Nacon 600 Pro HS sub-£100/€100/$100 price tag is only really visible in the cheaper plastics of the earpieces, and the workmanlike foldaway mic. That plastic does have the advantage of keeping the 600 Pro’s weight down, and this is a headset that you can comfortably wear for hours at a time without any fatigue. That’s helped again by the gorgeous comfort of the Wicked Cushions earpads.</p>
<p>At this pricepoint one of the main competitors to the 600 Pro HS is Sony’s own Pulse 3D headset, but you lose out on the Bluetooth connectivity which is a huge compromise. The 600 Pro HS will also keep you gaming for much longer, with its 18 hours of battery life handily beating out the Pulse 3D’s 12. The Nacon headset is also much more comfortable for long gaming sessions.</p>

            <p>Joining the rare but always brilliant category of “games that sound like someone scratched the high concept into their arm at pub closing time with the sharp corner of a Frazzles packet” is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/Assassinvisible">Assassinvisible</a> - a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> game about an invisible assassin that’s so invisible the player doesn’t know where they are. True, games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375750/Invisigun_Reloaded/">Invisigun</a> have experimented with this interesting concept before, but in Assassinvisible it's framed by another - the whole game exists as doodles in a bored student’s notebook. Here’s the Tres-tray:</p>

<p>This one’s going to be very quote-y, because I’m still trying to wrap my head around it myself. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2207460/Assassinvisible/">Steam page</a> describes Assassinvisible thusly: “A cute bite-sized puzzle and stealth game that takes place in the margins of a bored pupil's notebook. You're an invisible assassin, sneak your way past the guards to reach your target and erase it!”</p>
<p>The idea, as far as I can tell, is that you’ll track your own movements through the hand-drawn puzzles one square at a time, trying to reach your target and take them out. Through the framing, you’ll also learn more about the student drawing you. Here are the features, which themselves feature the word ‘complexifying’:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Hand-drawn levels (that the kid made, certainly not us) with ever complexifying, unique and interesting situations -absolutely no filler.</li>
<li>An original gameplay where the character is invisible for the enemies, but also for the players!</li>
<li>A touching story told through a pupil's notebook.</li>
<li>Your ultimate revenge for all those years spent being bored (and having fun) in class.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>It’s from French studio Zaatar Café, and it’s out on the 13th of December. Until then, the studio have a few smaller releases on Itch.io you can <a href="https://zaatarcafe.itch.io/">find here</a>. My favourite of these is ‘the elusive portal snake’, which Zaatar Café didn’t design, but recreated from memory after a previous mash up of Portal and Snake they played on Itch got deleted. Storied!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As per a recent update to their FAQ page, The Game Awards have confirmed that DLCs, new game seasons for live service games, and other such releases are eligible for their game of the year award.</p>
<p>The FAQ itself - which appears to have been accessible over the weekend but now links to a ‘coming soon’ page - says the following. Thanks <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/the-game-awards-will-now-consider-dlc-and-remasters-for-all-its-award-categories/">Neowin</a> for quoting it in its entirety:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p><strong>Are DLCs, expansion packs and remakes/ remasters eligible?</strong></p>
<p>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p>For this year, this means that releases like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">The Silent Hill 2</a> remake or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> would be eligible for the GOTY category. A win for either would mean the first time The Game Awards’ GOTY went to anything other than a full release. Previously, things like well loved expansions have factored into, for example, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> winning ‘Best Ongoing Game’ last year, no doubt in part to its excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">Phantom Liberty</a> DLC.<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-4-remake"> Resident Evil 4</a>’s remake was also nominated in the GOTY category last year.</p>

<p>Whether you feel this is an understandable decision given the quality of some expansions, or change that only further benefits a few obvious favourites at the expense of more interesting titles, I’ll leave that up to you.

Plus, Alice Bell (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-dont-have-to-be-polite-about-the-game-awards-or-pretend-it-actually-cares">already summed up the Games Awards better than anybody</a>, imo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/18/flexispot-e7-pro-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Standing desks have become increasingly commonplace in not just offices, but also households as the number of people working from home becomes more widely accepted. Helping this along over the past few years, standing desks have become more robust, easier to set up, and thankfully, more affordable, with the FlexiSpot E7 range being an ideal choice for those wanting a more dynamic, adaptable home workspace.</p>
<p><iframe title="Next-Generation Height Adjustable Desk E7 PRO" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/30fykTUEPmo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The reasons for upgrading to a standing desk are pretty apparent. Spending the majority of your nine to five grind ensconced in even the fanciest of office chairs can begin to feel uncomfortable, especially if you’re prone to worrying about bad posture and the general unhealthiness of being sat in the same spot for hours on end. Using a standing desk like the FlexiSpot E7 Pro won’t immediately help you get in better shape, though I found that having the option to alternate between sitting and standing helps to boost productivity while also encouraging healthier habits like regular stretching and being more active during screen breaks.</p>


<p>Working in this way can definitely take some getting used to, and there will be those of you who simply can’t put a finger to keyboard without having your bottom firmly planted on a chair. While primarily marketed as a standing desk, the adjustable height of the FlexiSpot E7 alone makes it a tempting upgrade for those wanting to better utilise their home office space, especially if they share a desk with someone who prefers a higher or lower work surface. As someone who is 6’4” (we’re all relatively massive here at TSA) one of my biggest frustrations when buying desks in the past is making sure my legs can tuck comfortably underneath, which has often resulted in the need to buy various furniture pads and risers. The FlexiSpot E7 Pro has been a silver bullet in this respect, allowing me to adjust its height to the exact centimetre required, also meaning I no longer have to worry about dimensions when shopping for desk chairs.</p>


<p>The desk arrives well packaged – every component was neatly nested in quality foam inserts, protected by layers of reinforced cardboard, the desktop and frame supplied into two separate boxes. The assembly instructions were far from exhaustive with 12 steps to follow and, all in all, it took just over an hour to go from cutting into the first box to having a state-of-the-art standing desk ready to go.</p>
<p>That’s not to say the building process was seamless. Although the components were clearly marked (it’s always nice to have screws and bolts in individually lettered bags) the assembly required a drill and some handy guesswork. For instance, the underside of the desktop was covered in small holes that would typically, when assembling furniture, denote where to place screws. Most of these aren’t used at all during the assembly, and are presumably meant for upgrades such as drawers or different sets of legs. There were also some holes that didn’t quite line up with the metal frame and others that needed drilling, which kind of goes against the whole flatpack/quick assembly ethos even if it wasn’t too technical a hurdle to overcome. With some tight fastening, the finished desk is incredibly sturdy with no wiggle room and a hefty weight that will require two people to flip once fully assembled. Or one very impatient person wanting a quick dose of searing back pain.</p>

<p>For those who may have slightly uneven surfaces in their home, the four attachable feet can help mitigate any potential lean or wobble. However, for a newly carpeted floor, I chose to skip this step and found the desk surprisingly easy to move and reposition despite its weight.</p>
<p>With three frame colours (white, black, and grey) and a diverse selection of desktop finishes and sizes to choose from (the largest being 2000mm by 800mm), the FlexiSpot E7 can be customised to fit any setting. Supported by super stable, 3-stage adjustable legs, it has an impressive weight capacity of 160 kilos which is more than enough to handle any work or gaming setup, while the concealed cable tray allowing you to efficiently tidy the accompanying jungle of wires and adapters.</p>
<p>In terms of height range, the E7 Pro can more than double in size from 635mm to a max of 1285mm. You can adjust the height seamlessly by using the keypad included, attached to the underside of the desktop, which also has a USB power slot ideal for charging your phone or other devices. When in motion, the desk glides quietly up and down with a satisfying smoothness that will have you regularly playing around with the keypad upon first use. What’s particularly good it that there are four programmable buttons to save preferred height settings, making it easy to switch between the ideal standing and seated heights for two people, as well as a handy child lock toggle.</p>

<p>The FlexiSpot E7 Pro isn’t inherently designed for gaming, though the same can be said of the office desk or television cabinet that you’re using to play PC and console games. The colour options available (particularly black on black) slot into the “gamer” aesthetic touted by other desk ranges targeting this demographic, and the adjustable height means that the E7 can be used in combination with any gaming chair without worrying about your legs getting pinned beneath the desktop or having your arms reaching for the keyboard and mouse at an uncomfortable angle.</p>
<p>As someone whose work day demands long stints of being handcuffed to a computer, the degree of adjustability is a godsend and, as previously mentioned, being able to shift between standing has led to untapped bursts of productivity. The desk won’t turn you into Joe Wicks overnight, though it definitely helps encourage healthier habits while working and gaming that are bound to have an ongoing impact on posture – FlexiSpot even sells a treadmill upgrade for those serious about burning a few calories.</p>

			<p>Valve's Half-Life 2 has just reached its 20th anniversary (we muse on its significance and that of other games released in that incredible month <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>). To celebrate the achievement, the developer is giving away free copies of the title (along with Episodes One and Two) until later today. You can get the game and its expansions by visiting the respective page on Steam, which can be done via the link <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Valve has also uploaded a 20th anniversary documentary, which reveals many interesting tidbits about the game's making. Perhaps even more interesting, though, is Gabe Newell's explanation of why Half-Life 2 Episode Three was never released.</p>
<p><em>You can't get lazy and say, oh, we're moving the story forward. That's copping out of your obligation to gamers. Of course they love the story. They love many aspects of it, but saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... You know, we could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why doing Half-Life 2 Episode Three was pushing anything forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I think that Half-Life represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven't been involved previously, and I think that there are no shortages of those opportunities facing us as an industry.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Half-Life 2: 20th Anniversary Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YCjNT9qGjh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, Valve pushed out a minor title update for Half-Life 2. The patch mainly focuses on quality improvements, along with subtle graphical changes. Here's the complete changelog:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed pops, holes in the world, fading-out and disappearing objects across the game.</em></li>
<li><em>Rebalanced the lighting across Half-Life 2 to account for playing with HDR on or off, using the original release as reference.</em></li>
<li><em>Cleaner, smoother horizon lines thanks to new radial fog!</em></li>
<li><em>Added higher-resolution lightmaps across the game!</em></li>
<li><em>Removed green glow from the G-Man model’s eyes in the opening of the game, and restored the reflective glint as seen in the original release.</em></li>
<li><em>Fixed missing grass sprites and blacked-out models throughout the game!</em></li>
</ul>
<h3><em>Updated Graphics Settings</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Choose either the original launch day blood and fire effects, or those created for the episodes, when playing the Half-Life 2 base game!</em></li>
<li><em>Play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode!</em></li>
<li><em>Get smoother lightmap shadows at Very High shader detail, thanks to new bicubic lightmap filtering!</em></li>
</ul>
<section id="deck">
<h3><em>Gamepad, Input, and Steam Deck Updates</em></h3>
<ul>
<li><em>Gamepad controls have been updated to match the Half-Life 1 anniversary update.</em></li>
<li><em>Aim Assistance has gotten an overhaul making it feel better to use, and there are more configuration options available. Aim Assistance can be enabled separately for gamepad or mouse/keyboard input. The amount of assistance can be tuned up and down, and it’s no longer tied to a skill setting. Want to play on Hard with high aim assist, or Easy with it off? Knock yourself out.</em></li>
<li><em>The Steam Deck main menu has been updated with all of today’s additions including the Episodes, Workshop, and new input configuration. The Steam Deck version of the main menu will also appear when you play Half-Life 2 on a PC running Big Picture Mode.</em></li>

The first episode, aptly titled “Hidden Hand,” shows the murderous origins of the Bene Gesserit, and their plans to arrange the right unions of families to keep the sisterhood in power. At the time, House Corrino are the ruling family of the Imperium after defeating the thinking machines feared to one day enslave mankind. Through silent communications and duplicitous advisory to  Emperor Javicco Corrino (played with an unflappable stoicism by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span>’s Mark Strong) from his Truthsayer and confidant Kasha (Jihae), we see how the hidden hand of the Bene Gesserit moves the pieces on the chess board how it wishes, to deadly results.</p><p>Every event in the <em>Dune </em>films takes place during wartime. Walking like a regular person on Arrakis dunes can get you devoured by a sandworm in moments, and a simple counter-suggestion to the terrifyingly hairless Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen (Austin Butler) can get your throat slit quicker than you can finish their sentence. Brutality has always been used in the films as a way to never let the audience forget the life-or-death stakes at play. <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>takes that to a level we’ve never seen in the films.</p><h2 id="h304642"><a id=""></a>Desmond Hart and Pruwet Richese establish the stakes in <em>Dune: Prophecy</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-recommend-id="image://ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-recommend-id="image://ac9ae3fa98d0894ece07bda064ee8840" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Travis Fimmel staring menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Poor little Pruwet. All he wanted to do was play with his absolutely adorable, potentially homicidal  AI-controlled lizard. As the nine-year-old Richese heir, he’s used as a pawn in the strategic union between his family and the imperial House Corrino. Emperor Corrino needs the Richese’s fleet of ships to protect his spice operation on Arrakis from the Fremen, and the duplicitous Duke Ferdinand Richese (Brendan Cowell) wants influential proximity to the Great Houses, so a marriage is arranged between pre-teen Pruwet and fully grown Princess Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) to unite the families, with the surreptitious help of the Bene Gesserit.</p><p>Unfortunately for Pruwet, he becomes a sacrifice in an invisible war that soldier Desmond Hart implies is being waged against the Bene Gesserit’s manipulative influence over everyone’s actions. Just as death can come quick and sudden in the films, Pruwet goes from hanging on every word of Hart’s tales of war to writhing in pain as we see his skin begin to burn. Yes, for what seems to be the first time onscreen in Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em> universe, a child is murdered...and we see it happen.</p><p>This isn’t, strictly speaking, the first time children have been killed in this series, as it’s safe to assume a number of them died when Feyd-Rautha bombed Sietch Tabr, which was inhabited by hundreds of Fremen. However, we never see any of the children’s deaths, nor has any one child been the focus of a killing on screen. In the films, children were seen but rarely ever heard. In <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, even children can be taken out if it means winning the war. </p><h2 id="h304643"><a id=""></a>Why did Desmond Hart kill Pruwet Richese?</h2><figure id="" data-id="9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-recommend-id="image://9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-recommend-id="image://9c7884db1a9a19c9e5278df69e3ae6fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To oversimplify the reasoning for this shocking killing, Pruwet was killed by Hart because of his AI-controlled lizard toy. Expanding beyond that isolated incident, Pruwet was murdered because Hart had suspicions that an attack on his regimen and the theft of the Corrino family’s spice shipment were carried out in order to inspire their emperor to bring in the Richese’s fleet for protection, thusly bringing the family closer to the Great Houses through marriage. When Hart shared his report of the attack on the spice operation, which he suspiciously was not made aware of by Kasha, he remarked that equipment used in the attack was from the outside world. That toy, and the convenient marriage proposal from the Richese, was enough for Hart to believe they were behind the attack. </p><p>This is also why we see Kasha suffer the same burning fate as Pruwet. Hart has a feeling that the Bene Gesserit are manipulating powerful people like the Corrino emperor for their own ulterior motives. Pruwet’s death effectively dissolves the partnership between the families, removing them from inside of the Corrino family where they can do untold harm. </p><p>We still don’t know the true ramifications of Hart’s actions, or how he was able to kill both of these people in the same manner while only being next to one of them. But, if the series premiere is willing to cross a moral line the movies never explicitly touched, we can expect to find out, in graphic detail, just how violent this war can get. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Gaming has had many great periods over its fifty-four years of history (Computer Space, the first commercial game, was developed in 1970 and released the following year), and fans often have hot debates about the best year for new game releases. Today, however, I wanted to place the spotlight on what I consider to be, without a shred of doubt, the best month ever for gaming: November 2004.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, eight seminal games were released in twenty-eight days, breaking people's wallets but also forever marking the spot (and, in some cases, outright changing it) in the history of this entertainment medium. In this article, I'll explain why they were (and in many ways still are) so important while also remembering my feelings about them at the time. The list is strictly ordered based on their respective release dates.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/gta-sa-logo-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - October 26, 2004</h2>
<p>Rockstar's fifth main entry in the GTA series technically launched a few days before November, but it still fits the twenty-eight-day timeframe between it and the final game on this list. Moreover, I could never leave it out over something so trivial. While the previous installments in the franchise were already highly popular, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas reached an entirely new dimension when it dropped into the gaming market. The game outsold Vice City by 45% in its first week, selling 4.5 million units.</p>
<p>It would become the best-selling game in a crowded year, thanks to universal critical acclaim (95/100 on Metacritic) and some good old-fashioned mainstream controversy due to the infamous Hot Coffee minigame. The acclaim and sales were well-earned, as San Andreas improved over Vice City in every area: gameplay, visuals, world size, features, etc., setting a new standard for open-world titles.</p>
<p>As for my take at the time, I wasn't the biggest GTA fan back then, so it wasn't my most anticipated title. Perhaps it's because the previous title featured highly repetitive missions and merely passable plots, but San Andreas was the game that leveled up both areas, allowing Rockstar to sit on the open world games throne for a long time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1494924-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Counter-Strike: Source - November 1, 2004</h2>
<p>The only remake on this list, Counter-Strike: Source brought the popular competitive first-person shooter game to modern technology. It was the first game to launch on the market with Valve's new Source engine, and the studio (which was helped by Turtle Rock Studios on this project) used it as a sort of Trojan horse for Half-Life 2, bundling it with all copies of that game before it was eventually released as a standalone product.</p>
<p>The visual upgrade was massive and certainly enticed many new users to check out the series, not to mention the praise from reviewers, who awarded the game an 88/100 score on average. While some hardcore players maintained that the original Counter-Strike had deeper gameplay, CS:S eventually won over the wider community, as evidenced by the 96% positive user reviews on Steam. It helped Counter-Strike stay relevant for another eight years before the launch of Global Offensive in 2012.</p>
<p>Personally, I was always way more of a fan of Rainbow Six, but Counter-Strike's tight-knit community impressed me even then. That they managed to not only maintain but even expand such a high level of commitment from fans after all these years is commendable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/halo-2-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Halo 2 - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>With Halo: Combat Evolved, Bungie forever changed the landscape for first-person shooters in console gaming. At that time, the consensus was that PC was the platform to go to when it came to FPS titles. Halo erased that stereotype and became the biggest Xbox exclusive, creating an enormous amount of hype for its sequel. Microsoft pushed for this to be more than just another game launch, treating it like the biggest blockbuster movies. Its trailer aired in theaters, and there was even an alternative reality game called I Love Bees that attracted a lot of attention to the release.</p>
<p>The goal was largely achieved, as the game grossed $125 million on its opening day, more than Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, cementing gaming's new status as the biggest entertainment medium in the world. Overall, Halo 2 was tied with GTA: San Andreas regarding the 95/100 review score, while GTA ultimately outsold it thanks to its availability on PlayStation 2.</p>
<p>In this case, I was absolutely part of the large user base that followed this launch very closely. I loved the predecessor and thoroughly enjoyed the sequel despite the controversial campaign choices. When it comes to gameplay and multiplayer features, Halo 2 might just be the best the series has ever been to this day.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/SI_GCN_MetroidPrime2Echoes-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - November 15, 2004</h2>
<p>On the same day, Nintendo launched the sequel to 2002's Metroid, a first-person adventure game with shooter elements. Developed like the original by Texas-based company Retro Studios, it garnered widespread praise for its visuals, level design, and longevity (the game required more than 20 hours to complete), averaging a 92/100 score on Metacritic. It was also the first installment in the series to add multiplayer support, although it wasn't exactly its strongest feature.</p>
<p>Nintendo even tried to mimic Halo 2's viral marketing with some fake websites. However, the game's commercial success was nowhere near the likes of Halo 2 due to the underwhelming sales of Nintendo's GameCube platform. It took many years for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes to become a million-seller, although that is no fault of the game itself, which to this day is considered to be one of the best entries in a revered franchise.</p>
<p>While I owned a GameCube, I had sold it already by that point. As such, I did not play Metroid Prime 2 at launch, though I wished I had after seeing all the glowing reviews and impressions online. Despite the not-so-strong sales, this sequel ensured the IP would continue to be one of the most anticipated by Nintendo fans.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/half-life-2-art-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Half-Life 2 - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>The following day, Valve released Half-Life 2. It had been six years since the original game had reinvented the single player first-person shooter genre, and the hype was already at dangerously high levels. On top of that, as said before, Valve bundled Counter-Strike Source with the game, ensuring people would get Half-Life 2 despite the then-controversial requirement to install it through Steam, their new digital store.</p>
<p>That alone would probably be enough to make it worth remembering, given the huge impact Steam would have on the gaming landscape. But Half-Life 2 was far more than that. Like GTA: San Andreas for open world games, HL2 showed gaming that shooters could be much more immersive and story-driven without sacrificing any gameplay depth. Reviewers clearly agreed, rating it 96/100 on average, the highest score for a game released in 2004.</p>
<p>When I played it on my PC, I couldn't believe its visuals. Back then, the newly released Source engine was the most advanced piece of technology available, and it also came with the built-in Havok physics engine to deliver far higher levels of interactivity with the environments than gamers were used to. The combination of the two left me in awe, to say the least, although I did have a personal issue while playing: motion sickness. I've never had a problem playing first-person games, but something in Half-Life 2 always left me vaguely nauseous after around twenty minutes. A pity, as it's clearly one of the best shooters ever made. Now, I can't wait to see the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-gets-stunning-new-video-to-celebrate-the-games-20th-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Remix project</a> be released and try once again to step in the shoes of Gordon Freeman.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/8bbb356c33d8a97cd6ec70793c81aa29d55680f38e93688d61d69fe3fa831719-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines - November 16, 2004</h2>
<p>Half-Life 2 wasn't the only Source game to launch that day. Independent developer Troika Games, founded by some of the former creators of Fallout, also launched Vampire: The Masquerade -Bloodlines on November 16. However, being the first third-party developer to use Source came at a cost. The studio understandably had no experience with it and encountered several problems during development. As a result, the game was very buggy, which impacted its reception. Releasing in the middle of the busiest gaming month ever didn't help sales, which were a mere 80K units at launch.</p>
<p>Troika was later forced to close down, but the game garnered a lot of well-deserved respect and admiration over time for its excellent writing and atmosphere. For a long time, Bloodlines was synonymous with great choices and writing among RPG fans, becoming a respected IP despite the lack of big sales. This explains why a sequel is currently in the final stages of production. Bloodlines 2 will be a different game by a different developer, but at least there's another RTX Remix project for those who'd like to replay this classic RPG with modern graphics.</p>
<p>As an avid fan of roleplaying games, I absolutely loved Bloodlines and can still remember some of its most memorable moments, such as the creepy Ocean House Hotel mission. If you haven't played it yet and you are into the World of Darkness setting, it's still worth checking it out on the next Steam sale.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/MetalGearSolid3SnakeEaterMasterCollectionVersion-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater - November 17, 2004</h2>
<p>Another day, another masterpiece. While Xbox had Halo 2 and Nintendo had Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Sony could count on Konami's latest game in the revered MGS series. Once again designed and written by legendary creator Hideo Kojima, Snake Eater serves as a prequel to the entire franchise, featuring Naked Snake (also known as Big Boss) on a peculiar mission in the jungle. The game featured extensive new features, such as closed-quarter combat (CQC), camouflage, an injury system, and even some protosurvival elements that required players to eat regularly lest they suffer penalties to the stamina meter. With a Metacritic score of 91/100 and solid sales (2.6 million units by December 2004), the success was guaranteed.</p>
<p>To understand how iconic Metal Gear Solid 3 really is, just take a look at Konami's remake approach. They've picked Silent Hill 2 for their horror series and MGS3 for their action/adventure/stealth franchise because they are the most universally beloved installments in the respective franchises.</p>
<p>The great news is that if you haven't played the original, Konami has almost <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished</a> remaking it. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater should launch early next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, allowing an entirely new generation of fans to check out this masterpiece. This includes myself, as I did not own a PlayStation 2 anymore at that time.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/World-of-Warcraft-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft - November 23, 2004</h2>
<p>Another hugely anticipated game was Blizzard's MMORPG set in the Warcraft universe. Fans had come to love the fantasy IP through three strategy games, but it was with World of Warcraft that Blizzard's franchise really exploded into critical mass. WoW was not the first MMORPG, but its innovations in accessibility (chiefly the reduced friction upon the player character's death), its vast and gorgeously styled game world, not to mention the well-designed classes, ushered in a new era for the genre. Following a highly positive critical reception of 93/100, the game continued attracting players for several years. The previous record for active subscribers was EverQuest's 500K accounts; World of Warcraft reached 12 million subscribers in 2010.</p>
<p>Rival companies spawned countless clones, but none ever came close to achieving the same level of success in the genre. World of Warcraft is, of course, the only game on the list that is still being <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-iii-reforged-2-0-and-warcraft-i-ii-remastered-out-now-world-of-warcraft-to-get-housing-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated</a>, although the original gameplay style was so successful that Blizzard created the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-classic-cataclysm-season-of-discovery-qa-we-want-to-explore-some-of-the-unfinished-bits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WoW Classic</a> mode.</p>
<p>For me, World of Warcraft was simply a home for so many years. I started playing in December 2004 during the European Closed Beta Test and remember being absolutely mesmerized by this huge online world despite not even being a big fan of the RTS games. MMORPGs turned out to be my favorite genre after all, and I spent countless hours between 2004 and 2011 in Azeroth, enjoying World of Warcraft's content and finding new friends in various guilds, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/best-beginner-supports-to-play-in-league-of-legends-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're getting stuck into League of Legends and often find yourself in the Support position, there are a variety of ways you can help out your lane partner. Whether you want to <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/champions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">be someone</a> who has a lot of crowd control, healing, or shielding, there is a lot of variety available for the Support. Some are a lot easier than others, and this guide will tell you all about the easiest supports to pick up if you're just getting started in League of Legends.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-league-of-legends-adcs-for-beginners-in-2024/">other guide on the best ADCs to play in League of Legends</a>.</p>
<h2>Best Beginner Supports in League of Legends</h2>
<p>There are a ton of champions you can play as a support, with some of them being off-meta and not being listed as a support as their primary role. However, those champions tend to be a bit more complicated. If you're getting into the game and are planning on laning with a friend, being a Support is a great way to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Soraka</strong> is an excellent support and has been a mainstay in the game since her introduction to the title when it was first released. She has the capability to damage, silence, and heal, giving her plenty of versatility. You can use your ability to heal an ally, which will siphon your health. However, your damaging ability will heal you as long as you hit the enemy champion. Soraka's ultimate is one of the best support ultimate, as it can heal every living ally. This is great to utilize in team fights or if you're in an aggressive lane and need to clutch heal you or your ADC.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sona</strong> is another fantastic support you can use, as she has a lot of utility, as she can heal, stun, damage and speed up allies. Sona is relatively easy to learn, as her abilities don't require any aiming except for her ultimate, which has a wide range. The only downside to Sona for beginners is trying to keep an eye on her mana usage and making sure to utilize her passive correctly.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Yuumi</strong> is quite possibly one of the easiest champions that you can play in League of Legends. The premise of Yuumi is to attach yourself to your laning partner so that you can heal them. However, during this time, you won't be able to deal any damage to the enemies. Despite that, you are completely invulnerable until the champion you're attached to dies, which is when you become separated and can heal and damage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Blitzcrank</strong> takes a little bit more finesse but is still relatively easy to get to grips with as a beginner. Blitzcrank is a different kind of support in League of Legends, as he doesn't have any capability to heal or shield his allies. However, he has great crowd control, which can help set up some great kills. Depending on how you build Blitzcrank, you may even see yourself netting some of the kills, especially with your Ultimate.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>These are some of the best supports to start with in League of Legends if you're brand-new to the game. There are plenty more to try out, which you can do in bot games if you are worried about annoying your teammates.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Starbreeze To Invest ‘Significantly Less’ in Payday 3’s Second Year of Content]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/starbreeze-to-invest-%E2%80%98significantly-less%E2%80%99-in-payday-3%E2%80%99s-second-year-of-content.1038033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent financial update, Starbreeze’s leadership team revealed that it will shrink the team working on Payday 3 going into the game’s second year of content, and invest ‘significantly less’ overall. However, the company has assured players and shareholders that this won’t impact the value delivered to gamers worldwide.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-less-is-more">Less is More</h2>



<p>Starbreeze revealed in a recent financial report that Payday 2’s sales contributions were still a whopping 50% of the value of Payday 3’s contributions. That’s a representative example of the staying power of the second game, while the third game has long struggled with player retention.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the interim CEO of Starbreeze, Mats Juhl, said that the company is ‘leveraging the strength of its franchises’ to continue succeeding going into 2025:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This time last year we had just launched PAYDAY 3 – a milestone for us as a studio, and a commercial success, but also a launch marred by a series of technical issues. Since then, we have worked tirelessly to improve the game and expand the amount of content and features. </p>



<p>By the end of the quarter, we had launched four major DLCs as well as a large amount of updates to both functionality and content for all of our players. At the end of October, one of our biggest updates since launch was launched, with a brand new user interface, server browser, VoIP and much more.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He mentioned midway through his statement that…</p>



<blockquote>
<p>… ahead of year two, we are confident in being able to continue delivering amounts of value to our players with a significantly lower level of investment.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was highlighted that the sentiment around Payday 3 is improving across all channels, which is true. The game has recovered somewhat from the terrible launch it underwent, even if the player base has dwindled considerably since release.</p>



<p>Starbeeze will continue to deliver content for Payday 3 going into 2025, but perhaps at a slower cadence. The team is hard at work on Project Baxter, and Juhl revealed that the company is on an expansion initiative, fleshing out roles to support the development of the new game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot Games Suggests More League Shows Will Follow in Arcane’s Footsteps]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-suggests-more-league-shows-will-follow-in-arcane%E2%80%99s-footsteps.1038015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-arcane-more-league-shows/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Arcane set a record as the most expensive animated television series ever, coming in at a whopping $250 million for just two seasons. It has been a roaring success, though – and fans are lapping up the content, especially now that the League of Legends World Championship has wrapped up.</p>



<p>Admittedly, Arcane is a masterclass in animation, and it’s picking up some seriously high praise from fans worldwide. In a recent post on Twitter, one of Riot Games’ co-founders, Marc Merrill, revealed that Riot Games isn’t done with these animated shows, despite the third season of Arcane being cancelled.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-want-more">We Want More</h2>



<p>In a simple post on Twitter, Marc Merrill revealed that ‘there are lots of other stories to tell’. He was responding to a question asking why there won’t be more seasons of Arcane.</p>



<p>Mere weeks ago, Merrill was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arcane-most-expensive-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defending the budget</a> that Riot Games blew through in the production of Arcane’s first and second seasons:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>League of Legends has been running for more than a decade and remains one of the most storied and lore-heavy games in existence. It has a thriving community backing it up, and millions of people are more than willing to soak up whatever multimedia offerings Riot Games can produce.</p>



<p>Perhaps a budget adjustment will take place, though. With Riot Games spending $250 million to produce 18 episodes of a show, many have questioned the sustainability of the company’s coffers. If that’s trimmed up, maybe we’ll get something with more meat on the bones – who knows?</p>



<p>Do you want to see more animated shows coming out of the League of Legends camp? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>"The Game Awards aims to recognise the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release," the website now says. "Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination.</p>
<p>"Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration."</p>
<p>This now means that remakes like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> could be in contention, as well as DLC like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. Elden Ring won the TGA Game of the Year award in 2022.</p>
<p>It also means games with seasonal content like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>, Destiny, and other live-service games are also eligible, even if the base game itself released several years ago.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-sweeps-the-game-awards">Baldur's Gate 3 secured the top award</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> snapping up several awards, too. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-2023-has-broken-its-own-viewership-record-with-118m-livestreams">The Game Awards 2023 broke its own viewership record</a>, clocking up around 118 million livestreams.</p>
<p>With 103m global livestreams in 2022, that's a 15 per cent year-on-year increase for the show.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
