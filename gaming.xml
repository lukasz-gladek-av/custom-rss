<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Summer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/46cf203a669d5/animal-crossing-new-horizons-summer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>A brand new survey of 180,000 players aged 15-69 years old in Japan has been conducted by GEM Partners, and there are some interesting stats on gender and age splits across multiple Nintendo franchises.</p>
<p>Posted by <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/18/01178/00010/">Nikkei</a> (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lugwlbfams2u">Nintendo Patents Watch</a> and <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/21/japan-large-survey-shows-nintendo-games-gender-split-and-average-ages/">MyNintendoNews</a>), the huge survey reveals that, compared to other game IPs, Nintendo's have more female fans,.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> comes in at 75% female, with an average age of 35 years old, while the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirbys_return_to_dream_land_deluxe">Kirby</a> series fanbase is sat at 55% female amongst those surveyed, with players at an average age of 30.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5gpnumr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpG4hedNmz8" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>A few more balanced series' come in the form of, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda</a>, both rocking a 60:40 ratio (in favour of male). This is all quite the turnaround when compared with the surveys' result for "Games In General", which shows a 75:25 spilt in favour of males aged 30 and over.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario</a> holds a 70:30 split, with player age average sitting at 32, while a more recent series in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> sits at a 65:35 split, with the average player range being below 30.</p>
<p>The average age for two of the big Japanese RPG titans that started life on Nintendo consoles, <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> and <strong>Dragon Quest</strong>, sits at 42, which is tied with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disney_tsum_tsum_festival">Disney Tsum Tsum</a> as having the oldest average player base among the games surveyed.</p>
<p>Other interesting tidbits include the fact that the survey found the vast majority of gamers were young mobile players, whilst Nintendo's IPs, in relation to other consoles, attract the most young players (obvious), but also the most over 30s (not as obvious!).</p>
<p>The survey makes for fascinating reading, and while many of the results are predictable, there's plenty of little factoids that you might not have guess before! Of course, this only covers Japanese players, and it's only a slice of the market, but it's a good insight.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vrr-support-closest-to-official-ps5-pro-patch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-getting-vrr-support-on-consoles-is-%E2%80%9Cthe-closest-we%E2%80%99ll-get%E2%80%9D-to-an-official-ps5-pro-patch-tech-experts-say.1248963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 just got another major update recently, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-patch-2-3-amd-fsr-4-frame-generation/">Patch 2.3 going live this past week</a>, and among the new features added was one that caught the eye of the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-df-weekly-cyberpunk-2077s-vrr-upgrade-sees-some-impressive-boosts-for-ps5-pro">Digital Foundry</a>. Cyberpunk 2077 now supports VRR on consoles, including PS5 Pro, and while CD Projekt RED has yet to put out an official PS5 Pro patch, the results of adding VRR support are about "<em>the closest we'll get</em>" according to DF.</p>



<p>The last time CD Projekt RED spoke on an official PS5 Pro update for Cyberpunk 2077, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-getting-a-ps5-pro-patch-anytime-soon/">claimed that there were "<em>no plans</em>"</a> to develop one, but then again, CD Projekt RED has also stated that it was done updating Cyberpunk 2077. Only to later release a new update for Cyberpunk 2077. So take that previous statement with a grain of salt for now, since it could just be that the studio is working up to it with updates like last week's adding VRR support.</p>



<p>As for what VRR support does for PS5 Pro owners today, Digital Foundry's testing found that unlocking the framerate can get players on PS5 Pro playing the game at 80 FPS+ on the Performance graphics mode. As Digital Foundry's John Linneman put it in today's DF Direct Weekly video, "<em>It's significantly better overall..averaging around 80 to 90 FPS, you can feel that. That is a significant upgrade.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #223: Cyberpunk 2077 VRR Tested, Space Marine RT Upgraded, New SNES Doom Wows" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m05yE_-X7uY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Base-PS5 players have much less to be excited about, since DF found that playing with the new VRR modes on a base PS5 still has you hovering around 60 FPS, which is where the regular performance mode already stood. The same goes for the quality mode, which keeps players at the same previous marker of 30 FPS. PS5 Pro players get their framerate bumped up to 40 FPS when playing on the quality mode with ray tracing on.</p>



<p>Digital Foundry points out that there's still room for CD Projekt RED to improve Cyberpunk's performance on the PS5 Pro in both the performance and quality modes, such as improvements to ray-tracing, and to the framerate for other areas of Cyberpunk that, even with VRR on, still barely manage to hit 60 FPS on a PS5 Pro. </p>



<p>Still, if you shelled out the cash for a PS5 Pro, seeing a 20 FPS bump compared to the base PS5 on games like Cyberpunk 2077 is realistically the kind of improvement you paid for. It's good to see PS5 Pro players reaping the benefits of their upgrade, and hopefully, CD Projekt RED will one day release a proper, official PS5 Pro patch that improves elements of performance and graphical fidelity in the game across the board.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vile-exhumed-review-dirty-computer.1248960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is an operating system sim in the mold of games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hypnospace-outlaw" rel="nofollow">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Simulacra</em>, and it asks a simple question: What kind of secrets could the innocuous facade of a distinctly '90s-inspired Windows 2.0-style interface be hiding?</p>

<p>Structurally, solo developer Cara Cadaver's game has you trawling through the primitive menus and basic graphics of an old PC, searching for the truth behind the disappearance of adult film actress Candy Corpse.</p>

<p>Just like the OS itself, though,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is hiding a lot from you at the outset, and things are not as simple as that setup implies. If you want to find out what might have happened to Candy, you're going to have to put your digital detective hat on, and happily, it's worth doing so, even if you'll be left wanting more at the end.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Is a Very Convincing '90s PC Sim</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=VNaMJplg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-calculator.jpg?itok=0QO1fPgO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Agh! My eyes! The numbers!</figcaption></figure><p>There's a refreshing lack of adornment to&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. As soon as you boot it up, you'll be faced with a simple login screen that asks you to enter a 4-digit PIN. There's no fluff, no introductory cutscene explaining who the key players in this story are, and no tutorials to be found either.</p>

<p>That works to its credit; since&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't mess around, you're free to "enjoy" its unsettling, eerily quiet atmosphere right from the get-go. The silence of the operating system is almost oppressive, broken only by the sound of clicking as you navigate clunky menus and positively atavistic-looking websites.</p>

<p>I never felt like Cadaver's game jumped the shark, either. Its PC simulation remained convincing until the very end, helped along by the eldritch glow of the CRT monitor filter overlaying the "action," so to speak.</p>

<p>If you don't have any nostalgia for old-school operating systems, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>might not be able to weave its strange magic for you, but I thoroughly enjoyed the matter-of-fact, no-nonsense style in which this ancient PC coughed up its secrets.</p>

<h2>You'll Find a Timely Story in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=mStteqII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-forum.jpg?itok=Sh7u5tPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story doesn't pull its punches.</figcaption></figure><p>Those secrets are worth discovering, too. While&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is nominally the story of Candy Corpse and her disappearance, there's more to discover inside this particular computer's memory, not least to whom it belongs and why you're digging through it.</p>

<p>Unlike the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Simulacra&nbsp;</em>or its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/simulacra-2" rel="nofollow">slightly disappointing sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>doesn't resort to cheap jump scares, nor does it descend into the valley of daft pseudo-supernatural horror.</p>

<p>The scares are much closer to home, and while I don't want to spoil anything, the Steam page does make clear mention of "themes of sexual content, violence, and abusive and harmful language," so you know what kind of realm we're in here.</p>

<p>Since you're free to explore the operating system in whatever order you choose,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s story will likely unfold in a non-linear fashion, and discovering what happened to Candy is just one part of filling in the wider picture.</p>

<p>Great horror is grounded in the real, and that's certainly the case with&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. If its story ever threatens to feel silly or outré, the fact that many of its themes still disappointingly resonate in the real world only add to the threat.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s Operating System Is Filled With Secrets</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=3LoXQWs9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-password.jpg?itok=-iFvlUpR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Good luck working this one out.</figcaption></figure><p>Discovering the narrative feels chilling thanks to the plethora of secrets contained within&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s operating system. Some applications will give up their secrets readily, while others require passwords or authentication to access.</p>

<p>You're left to discover many of these keys by yourself, although hints are frequently available. Making discoveries therefore feels like pulling off great detective work, evoking the quiet satisfaction of getting an old, irascible computer to do what you want in the process.</p>

<p>Some of those secrets can feel a little too esoteric for their own good, however. I never managed to work out what lurked behind the innocuous-seeming perfume website, for instance, and there are a couple of other head-scratchers that defeated me as well.</p>

<p>Still, if you're the type to pore over games hunting for every scrap of information, then&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>should give you a good couple of hours of entertainment. Unfortunately, however, that's all it's going to give you.</p>

<h2>Frankly, There's Just Not Enough of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=Jy1QxqQ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-ffvr.jpg?itok=ybKZ1h8m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wanted to spend more time in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>'s meticulously constructed operating system.</figcaption></figure><p>If I have a core criticism of&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>, it's that there's just not enough of it. Just when things are starting to move along and adrenaline is starting to build, it's over. The ending is a pretty abrupt one, too, although it feels appropriate given what you're likely to have learned beforehand.</p>

<p>Discovering the story of Candy by digging through old websites and deducing passwords is a hugely enjoyable (if that's the right word) experience, so the fact that there's just so little of it is heartbreaking for me.</p>

<p>Cadaver has made it clear&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>is designed to be played in a single sitting, and there's no save function, nor does it allow you to continue playing after the credits. I sort of understand why from a narrative perspective, but I'd have loved the chance to continue spending time with this throwback machine.</p>

<p>Still, I will always prefer a game that leaves before its time to something that massively outstays its welcome. In being so shockingly brief,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>avoids the pitfalls of puzzle games that keep going long after their best ideas are spent.</p>

<h2><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=K0T8_eCC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vile-exhumed-review-vns.jpg?itok=VCMzvbqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>has plenty of "delights" to offer retro puzzle connoisseurs.</figcaption></figure><p>Cara Cadaver has crafted a very neat little puzzler in&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed</em>. On one level, it's a great simulation of a time before user-friendliness and "idiot-proof" operating system design, and on another, it's an unsettling tale of violence and abuse that may well stay with you (it certainly has with me).</p>

<p>I'd love to see what Cadaver can craft in a larger, more open-ended sandbox environment, but if you're looking for a (very) tightly-plotted experience that doesn't stick around after it's not welcome,&nbsp;<em>Vile: Exhumed&nbsp;</em>will provide.</p>

        <p>"Nothing is eternal", says Yves Guillemot</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot has responded to a shareholder question about the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> campaign - and in a very newsworthy corporate question and answer session, revealed that a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint">Ghost Recon</a> game's in the works.</p>
<p>To quickly recap, Stop Killing Games aim to stop publishers rendering online games unplayable after the cessation of official support. They were inspired to take action by Ubisoft themselves 'sunsetting' online racer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>.</p>
<p>Ubisoft's response to their campaign comes around the time the group's petition to the EU to take action against the mass extinction of online games <a href="https://x.com/StopKilingGames/status/1947064216298406179">hits 1.4 million signatures</a>. Despite some doubts about potential signature spoofing, the petition's recently attracted support from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/european-parliament-vice-president-throws-his-support-behind-stop-killing-games-campaign">EU politicians</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-proposals-would-make-online-only-games-prohibitively-expensive-to-create-argue-eu-lobby-group">industry trade bodies</a>, so it's no surprise Guillemot's fielding questions about it from moneyfolk.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Regarding the petition, we operate in a market," the CEO began (via <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-ceo-ghost-recon-assassins-creed-shadows-valorant-annual-report">Game File</a>), immediately whipping out what I assume's the corporate version of the phrase '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHhbdXCzt_A&amp;t=1s">we're living in a society</a>'. He went on to say that players are "forewarned that eventually the game may be discontinued", and framed the studio putting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> on sale for €1/$1 back in 2024 as an attempt to let players of the first game hop across to one that wasn't about to be deep-sixed.</p>
<p>"You provide a service, but nothing is written in stone and at some point the service may be discontinued," Guillemot continued, "Nothing is eternal. And we are doing our best to make sure that things go well for all players and buyers, because obviously support for all games cannot last forever. But that’s an issue that we’re working on. That’s something that the industry at large is working on, to minimize impact on players."</p>
<p>The exec closed out his point by saying that the likes of software and tools made to make live-service games "become obsolete" or no longer available in time, outlining that this is why studios can opt to put out new versions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games have been clear they're not asking for all online games to be "eternal", but rather to "implement an end-of-life plan to modify or patch the game so that it can run on customer systems with no further support from the company being necessary".</p>
<p>Moving away from Stop Killing Games, in the same shareholder ask-a-thon Guillemot and Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet casually alluded to a new Ghost Recon being in development. The CEO mentioned "capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon", while Duguet touched on investment from Tencent being used for "future development of other major brand names", citing Ghost Recon as an example.</p>
<p>Confirming the execs' chatter about the ghost reconning their attic, an Ubisoft spokesperson has told Game File that the publishers "look forward to sharing more when the time is right". Nice. Here's hoping it doesn't come with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-launching-ghost-recon-breakpoint-nfts-later-this-week">NFT trousers</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-ceo-responds-to-stop-killing-games-and-casually-mentions-a-new-ghost-recon-games-coming]]></content:encoded>

So while it will be the old guard of mutants who show up for 2027's <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, after that they’re off. Instead, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/marvel-x-men-recasting-secret-wars-1236465269/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/marvel-x-men-recasting-secret-wars-1236465269/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to <em>Variety</em></a></span>, the 2028-or-later <em>X-Men</em> movie to be directed by Jake Schreier (who also directed <em>Thunderbolts*</em>) will feature an all-new cast playing the iconic comic book heroes. And that might stretch even further, to new actors playing long-established superheroes in the MCU mythos, too. I say: thank you, <em>thank you</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-recommend-id="image://c4c20463ad643f7ad9a651dc651a5fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS footage from the latest Captain America." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>OK, bear with me. Phases 4, 5 and 6 of the MCU have been called The Multiverse Saga, and have involved multiple versions of reality crashing into one another. This has taken place across Disney+ TV series like <em>Loki</em>, and movies like <em>Spider-Man: No Way Home</em> and <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, and has led to the brief appearances of a whole bunch of actors who played X-Men characters in the previous Fox-created franchise of movies that ran from 2000 to 2019.</p><p> In 2017, Disney bought Fox, which allowed decades of licensing conflicts to go away, freeing up familiar mutants to show up in MCU movies, but it’s all been so incredibly piecemeal that it’s been tough to follow. This, we’re told, is all building up to the end of Phase 6, a pair of <em>Avengers</em> movies—<em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em>—that will finally close the multiverse saga and let us all move on.</p><p>See, so much of the trouble with the current era of the MCU is that even trying to write out what’s happening is a nightmare of overlapping movies, TV series and references to entire other franchises from the past. No wonder audiences are tiring of the films, given the amount of background research you need to do to have the faintest idea what’s going on. </p><p>Yes, it’s absolutely led to the fantastic fun of films like the aforementioned <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Doctor Strange </em>outings, but it’s the consequences of these movies that are such a headache. The thrill of characters from multiple universes and franchises meeting up on screen is great while you’re sat in your seat, but needing to remember who was in which and why for next time isn’t what going to the movie theater should be about. Thankfully, there’s only two years of it left.</p><figure id="" data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-recommend-id="image://117d4d03b2067abd25ed0ab502f16716" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="BTS pic from Deadpool &amp; Wolverine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After that, in what has yet to be called Phase 7, Feige is promising that the MCU will match the move made by the comics in 2015's papery version of Secret Wars, and collapse all these bloody timelines into one. In this process, we’ll say goodbye to the likes of Kelsey Grammer, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Rebecca Romijn and James Marsden, who will presumably be cast off into the ether, and we’ll get a completely new, fresh team of X-Men actors.</p><p>“We’re utilizing [<em>Secret Wars</em>] not just to round out the stories we’ve been telling post-<em>Endgame</em>,” Feige said at a press briefing this weekend, “[but] it very, very much sets us up for the future.” <em>Endgame</em>, the final movie in Phase 3, was about endings, he said, adding, “<em>Secret Wars</em> is about beginnings.”</p><p>When asked if this is a reboot, Feige was very careful to distance himself from the concept. “Reboot is a scary word,” he told reporters. “Reboot can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. Reset, singular timeline—were thinking along those lines.”</p><p>Feige will want to avoid the notion of “reboot” because it would suggest scrapping all that’s come before and starting fresh, which isn’t the plan. It seems it’s more about, as he says, a reset: letting things calm back down before introducing the superheroic world to mutants. This, he notes, should give the movies a chance to also dramatically lower the age of their casts.</p><p>Remember, the MCU began in 2008, a frightening 17 years ago, meaning what were once fresh-faced actors are now very much middle-aged. In order not to age out, the movies will quickly need a younger audience, and since <em>X-Men</em> stories lend themselves to teenage and 20-something characters discovering their powers, this is a great chance to hire some of the most audience-attracting younger actors working today, who would have been very young indeed when the first <em>Iron Man</em> was released.</p><p>According to Feige, this recasting isn’t going to stop at the <em>X-Men</em>. He even suggested—while referencing James Bond as evidence that it’s possible—that characters like Tony Stark and Steve Rogers could be recast. And, as weird and unlikely as that might sound, if the movies are to continue on for generations, it’s unavoidable.</p><figure id="" data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-recommend-id="image://56c2db963dd9788d74f26f86cc2ae082" data-format="jpg" data-width="895" data-height="504" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Marvel comic heroes attacking Godzilla." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, Marvel comics have a squillion heroes that the MCU has never gone near. The issue is, few have  broad enough recognition to hold up a movie, and as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/superman-james-gunn-opening-weekend-box-office-1851786190">James Gunn is about to discover in the DCU</a></span>, you have to do a hell of a lot of work to convince an audience to show up for a superhero they’ve never seen on a t-shirt. On the other hand, if you stick to the big names, you can’t have your core characters played by men in their 50s and 60s. Robert Downey Jr. just turned 60. Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) is 57. Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye) is 54. Even the babies like Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth are now in their 40s. And yes, of course I’d love to see the MCU’s equivalent of <em>The Watchmen</em>, but the reality is that if you want to keep banking on these most popular heroes, you’ll have to recast the roles.</p><p>This could suggest some <em>really</em> dramatic implications for the climax of <em>Secret Wars</em>. It’s obvious to assume that this “reset” would bring us back to what we already know, the Earth-616 where we started before it all got out of control. But what if that’s not the plan? What if the timeline that survives is a completely fresh one, perhaps the one in which this month’s <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is set? Or an entirely new Earth, which has never seen a Robert Downey Jr. Iron Man or Chris Hemsworth Thor?</p><p>I’d take it. While that’s a lot closer to a “reboot,” and those can be exhausting too (we all have to do the mental gymnastics of already knowing everything while the characters know nothing), it’d be so great not having to try to remember 20 years of backstory, including which character cameoed in which episode of a TV series five years earlier in order to understand why that woman wants to kill that guy in this movie...Yeah, I’ll take a reset.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-mcu-x-men-movies-multiverse-phase-6-avengers-1851786617]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Today is clearly the day Atari and Namco have sealed their reunion with pursed lips and probing tongues. Following the announcement of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pac-man-dig-dug-and-other-retro-favourites-get-the-interactive-museum-treatment-in-atari-50s-new-namco-dlc">new Namco-themed expansion for the excellent Atari 50 interactive museum thing</a>, the pair (along with third wheel Plaion) have cuddled up to unveil an <em>extremely</em> yellow Pac-Man edition of the Atari 2600+.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ataris-bringing-its-classic-2600-console-back-as-a-100-modern-day-faithful-recreation">original Atari 2600+ launched in 2023</a>, when it was described as a "modern day faithful recreation" of Atari's classic 70s/80s console. As for the new 2600+ Pac-Man Edition - released to celebrate the character's 45th birthday - it's pretty much the same thing, featuring mod cons like HDMI output, USB power, and multiple screen resolutions. However, the Atari 2600's timeless, woody hued design has been abandoned in favour of "signature pac-Man yellow".
</p>
<p>
And you know what? It's pretty tasteful in its own garish way. While the body of the machine is about as (Pac-Man) yellow as yellow can be, the spherical chomper and his old ghost pals make an apparently illuminated appearance on the front panel, while the black of the upper panel is broken up with a matching yellow cartridge slot and knobs.

<p>
"The Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition is more than just a console," manufacturer Plaion writes in the machine's announcement, "it's a tribute to the moment home gaming truly began. By reimagining the iconic hardware in Pac-Man's unmistakable style, we're celebrating the legacy of two cultural giants who helped define a generation of play."
</p>
<p>
If that burst of enthusiasm has you sold, you can pre-order the Atari 2600+ Pac-Man Edition starting 23rd July, and it'll cost you £129.99. For that, you get the machine itself, one CX-40 wireless joystick (also yellow), and a Pac-Man Double Feature cartridge, which includes Pac-Man's home console debut - Pac-man 2600, which released in 1982 - and Pac-Man 7800, a "brand new, arcade-style version of the classic".
</p>
<p>
And if you're after more than one Pac-Man CX40+ wireless joystick, you're in luck; they're also being sold separately for £29.99 each. But don't think you're limited to yellow. Plaion is also releasing Blue (Inky ghost), Red (Blinky ghost), Pink (Pinky ghost) and Orange (Clyde variants), and you can pre-order those from 23rd July too.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>When we reviewed the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> for Switch 2 just a little while back, we came away as impressed as ever with IO Interactive's incredible world-building and gameplay. However, we were also a little bit disappointed with the game's performance at launch.</p>
<p>For a title we really love on other platforms, it was unfortunate to have to mark it down to a relatively disappointing 7/10 as a result of some fairly constant choppiness in both docked and handheld modes. And so we are delighted to discover that those boffins over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ6Mkwkvyxs">Digital Foundry</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hitman-world-of-assassination-seems-to-have-an-undocumented-performance-mode">cheers, Eurogamer</a>) seem to have found an unannounced 'performance mode' of sorts that we can all benefit from. Hooray for boffins!</p>
<p>According to DF's Richard Leadbetter, he received an email which notified him that a player had gone into the console system settings to have a muck about due to the fluctuating framerate:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I went into the system settings and changed the TV output res from 4K to 720p, went back into the game and found it vastly improves performance. The Hawkes Bay Mission ran at... a very solid and stable frame-rate."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter then proceeded to put this to the test, capturing various scenes from the game's whistle-stop tour of the globe at 4K, 1080p and 720p. Choosing areas that push the GPU and CPU, and give us lots of crowd density, the results, he comments, are very interesting.</p>
<p>In the game's Whittleton Creek level, as an example, a setting of 4K output manages an average framerate of 46.88fps - which then rises to 59.95fps at 720p. A 62.5% improvement!</p>
<p>At 1080p, things get more interesting still:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...the game actually seems to be rendering at a slightly higher resolution, with pixel counts suggesting 1152p to 1188p. Meanwhile, with Switch 2 set to 4K, performance drops but pixel counts are still in the same 1152p/1188p window. The performance drop may be down to upscaling to a higher resolution with an approximate cost of around 2.4ms compared to what we assume is the same content without any upscaling."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leadbetter continues, unsure whether Hitman is using DLSS to upscale, "as there are rounded edges where we'd expect to see aliasing." DF has reached out to IO interactive for confirmation.</p>
<p>The team has also checked out the game's super cool Berlin level, reporting that things jump up by some 61% when knocked down to 720p, whilst 1080p is 9% faster.</p>

<p>Moving on to CPU-intensive crowded areas, and as expected the frame rate jumps aren't quite so sensational once you factor in a ton of NPCs. However, you are looking at a jump, according to DF, from around 35fps in the Paris fashion show stage, to in and around the 45fps mark, which is still rather tasty.</p>
<p>So, whilst this isn't an actual performance mode, hence why it hasn't been mentioned officially by the devs, you <em>can</em> pick up some nice frame boosts <em>if</em> you're willing to drop your resolution down a little. More interestingly, the disparity in these numbers should, says Leadbetter, enable DF to get a better handle on the computational costs of Nintendo's DLSS implementation on the new console going forward. Something that's been a bit of a mystery up until this point!</p>
<p>IO Interactive has also recently announced that it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/hitman-developer-is-working-on-switch-2-performance-issues-right-now">working hard on Switch 2 performance issues</a>, so hopefully we won't have to sacrifice picture clarity for too long.</p>
<p><em>Have you been playing Hitman: World of Assassination? Tempted to drop the resolution down for some extra frames? Let us know!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft Massive announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> will receive a major update on December 5, its third anniversary. The date has also been chosen because it is exactly two weeks before the theatrical release of Avatar: Fire and Ash, the third movie in the franchise. </p>



<p>The update's main highlight is the addition of a full-fledged third-person camera. As you might recall, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was first-person only, which certainly turned at least a few gamers away for various reasons (motion sickness being one of the most obvious). </p>



<p>With third-person mode, players will be able to experience Pandora from a whole new perspective at the push of a button. Whether they're exploring, fighting, or simply taking in the view, the third-person mode brings a new sense of scale, freedom, and immersion. Ubisoft Massive reworked the animations, controls, audio, and camera systems to make the experience seamless and intuitive.</p>



<p>The upcoming update will also add another highly requested feature, New Game+, which allows players to replay the story while keeping their inventory and skills. They will face tougher enemies and unlock a brand-new skill tree and more powerful gear. It's a fresh challenge for seasoned players looking to delve deeper into the world of Pandora.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Omar Bouali, Creative Director at Massive, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>We’ve always envisioned Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora as a living world that evolves with our players. This update is a celebration of our community’s passion and we’re thankful to our players for their support—it means the world to our team.</em></p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is also having a limited-time sale on various platforms. For example, on Steam, you can get any version of the game at 70% off through July 31. The Gold and Ultimate Edition provide access to the two story DLC packs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sky Breaker</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Secrets of the Spires</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-to-add-new-game-plus-and-more-in-december.1248921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced a new update for&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, and the studio has promised to add two of the features most requested by the game's community.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/AvatarFrontiers/status/1947325865982914631" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a>, the update, which is due to arrive on December 5th, will add a New Game Plus mode to the first-person shooter, so you'll be able to tackle its story again with all of your equipment and skills intact.</p>

<p>New Game Plus will, however, also bring tougher enemies and a higher level of overall challenge, so you'll need to take advantage of the stronger gear and new skill tree offered by the mode in order to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=MGTm52Cw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-new-game-plus-mech.jpg?itok=6VlH0YTK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>is getting a big new update in December.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the New Game Plus mode, you're also getting a third-person view option, allowing you to see your character as you explore the lush environments of Pandora. Honestly, I'm surprised there was no third-person view mode to start with, but better late than never, I guess.</p>

<p>According to Massive Entertainment, various gameplay systems in <i>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</i>have been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-update-brings-third-person-and-new-game-plus-modes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reworked</a> in order to ensure a "seamless and intuitive" experience while playing in third-person, so it shouldn't just feel like a tacked-on extra.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why it's going to take so long for the update to arrive, it's probably because Ubisoft wants to time the release as close to the launch of the upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Avatar&nbsp;</em>movie as possible.</p>

<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Frontiers of Pandora&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-gets-gameplay-debut-and-december-7-release-date" rel="nofollow">released on December 7th back in 2023</a>, so while this update won't land exactly on the game's second anniversary, it'll be close enough to be considered a celebration anyway.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While those attempts to censor through manufactured controversy failed, Collective Shout may be having more success directly targeting payment processing companies which have been cracking down on pornography across the the broader web on creator platforms like OnlyFans. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/fansly-ban-furries-new-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fansly banned any sexualized “anthropomorphic content”</a></span> in an apparent bid to censor bestiality on the platform, despite that being condemned within the furry community as well. Instead of nuanced moderation, some platforms appear to be making more drastic shifts to appease payment companies.</p><p>That’s the concern around the recent purge of sex games on Steam. In addition to bans on games that use crypto currencies or feature “sexually explicit images of real people,” Valve added the much more ambiguous restriction against “Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</p><p>The new guideline coincided with Vavle removing games from Steam with titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR.</em> But others with genre tags that still mentioned things like incest were left untouched, spreading confusion about where exactly Valve was drawing the line. It was also unclear why Valve was only taking action now despite this type of porn-slop, including some truly vile sounding games, have routinely crept onto the storefront. Instead of Valve banning a sexual assault sim called <em>No Mercy</em> earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-mercy-sexual-assault-incest-sim-steam-removed-uk-pc-1851775725">it was voluntarily withdrawn</a></span> from Steam by its creators.</p><figure id="" data-id="70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-recommend-id="image://70e31955596f463b5ce3ab176f0a5ea1" data-format="png" data-width="1533" data-height="818" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows an explicit game bundle on Steam.

Does it review games for infringing content first? Does it ban things based on how they look or sound and then wait for the creators to appeal later? And is it working off of clear guidelines from payment companies? It’s that type of moderation mess that risks censoring various game-based works of art simply because someone in a position of power might go “ick,” or, even worse, they saw someone making noise about it on social media and didn’t want to get caught up in the drama.</p><p>That’s certainly the approach that the owners of <em>Vice</em>, which originally broke the story on Collective Shout’s relationship to the changes, appears to have taken. Savage Ventures, which invested in Vice after it went bankrupt, was accused by Valens of being behind the removal of two of her articles about the topic. “Vice’s owner Savage Ventures has requested the removal of my Collective Shout articles,” she posted on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bluesky over the weekend</a></span>. “This is due to concerns about the controversial subject matter—not journalistic complaints.”</p><p>In the meantime, Collective Shout cofounder Melinda Tankard Reist <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MelTankardReist/status/1946147654616104963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is calling</a></span> those critical of Valve’s decision “porn sick brain rotted pedo gamer fetishists.” While the organization’s initial letter accused Steam of hosting hundreds of games that would “breach Australian classification laws,” Collective Shout has so far declined to name any specific examples. “Most of the content found within the games, including the graphics and the developers descriptions, are too distressing for us to make public,” it wrote. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-sex-censorship-hentai-gta-5-collective-shout-1851786636]]></content:encoded>

That's a 28% reduction if you're looking for market price, but still over $28 more than the standard $50 MSRP.</p><div catalogid="cc0b3227-d28a-42b7-bd75-cd5e876cb02f" id="225543"><div id="225543" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokemon TCG Scarlet &amp; Violet Black Bolt Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like with recent restocks for Destined Rivals, the main retailers listing Black Bolt &amp; White Flare ETBs at above retail are Walmart and Amazon. <a href="https://zdcs.link/985d5q?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Walmart</u></a> continues to list both at around $99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJg4gD?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Amazon still lists the White Flare ETB</u></a> for roughly $105, but Black Bolt's price cut is an unexpected bargain in contrast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, this is still way above what these would normally be priced at. The best-priced among big stores listing Black Bolt &amp; White Flare at their actual value is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QP8r8Z?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Best Buy</u></a>, at $49.99 for each ETB, but both are sold out at the time of writing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the same case for the<a href="https://zdcs.link/aXWMWm?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u> Pokemon Center</u></a>, which was listed both for a slightly more expensive $59.00.  Whichever retailer you buy from, though, each Black Bolt &amp; White Flare ETB contains:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Nine respective booster packs</li><li>Full-art promo card — Thundurus with Black Bolt, Tornadus with White Flare<ul data-cy="list"><li>The Pokémon Center version also comes with an extra full-art promo with the website’s logo</li></ul></li><li>65 sleeves for your cards</li><li>45 Energy Cards</li><li>A player’s expansion guide</li><li>Damage counter dice, coin flip-die, and condition markers</li><li>Collectable box with dividers</li><li>Pokémon Trading Card Game Live code card</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The assumed reason for these inflated prices is to both scare off scalpers and bots, since these automatically reduce reseller profit margins, whilst still making the money from those who are still willing to pay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon UK had implemented its own fairer way of controlling the stock shortage of Pokémon cards by implementing the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-etbs-are-back-in-stock-at-amazon-uk-for-prime-day-but-theres-a-catch"><u>invite-only system</u></a>, allowing any with an invitation to buy ETBs at their RRP value. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, the US equivalent doesn’t seem to want to follow suit. Still, Amazon and Walmart have technically followed the market value of Pokémon card products like these, even if they are still going a fair amount higher. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On dedicated selling platform TCG Player, for instance, the market price for the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDEDJ?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Black Bolt ETB</u></a> is around $91 whilst <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxExG?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>White Flare’s</u></a> is almost $92 at the time of writing. eBay also have listings that are a little bit cheaper, showing <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7E4w?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Black Bolt ETBs going for at least $86</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpE7M?object_uuid=6138f8ba-6961-4be0-a5fc-c0108b2b4a4d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>White Flare for $85</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even going by the most expensive cards from the Japanese version of the set, Black Bolt and White Flare have plenty of valuable potential pulls to make the higher investment worth it, but we know it’s still a major sting knowing you’re paying well above what you should be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whichever way, though, paying around 50% mark-up at minimum for an ETB appears to just be the name of the game in the Pokemon TCG market these days. If you want to get any of these new cards at the best price available, grab this Amazon deal whilst you can before you have to pay at least $10 more from an eBay seller. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

                <p>Out of nowhere, developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots shadow-released the extreme sports game Descenders Next today, July 21, and it's included with Xbox Game Pass.

No More Robots says the game aims to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need, slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</p><p>After the original Descenders reached 35 million players, Descenders Next builds upon that foundation but extends the series to sports beyond just downhill biking.</p><p>Descenders Next features online multiplayer, large biomes to explore, and progression-based unlockable content. "The parks in particular provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next's playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you'll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you'll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest," reads a line from the game's description.</p><p>The music in Descenders Next was done by Monstercat.

            <p>Rematch developer Sloclap admits some of the studio's fans were "disappointed" by the game's reveal, because they were expecting more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>.</p>
<p>Sloclap released its football game Rematch earlier this year, to plenty of praise. However, it wasn't what many expected the studio to come up with following its previous release, the kung-fu roguelike, Sifu.</p>

<p>"Some Sifu fans were disappointed when the game was revealed and we're sorry to say that," Sloclap creative director Pierre Tarno admitted to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/sports/rematch-dev-is-sorry-that-players-wanted-more-sifu-but-for-the-moment-it-was-better-to-let-it-rest/">GamesRadar+</a>, before adding <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">marketing could have perhaps been a bit better on Rematch's reveal</a>.</p>
<p>"Because the reveal trailer had a cold open, like 'from the team behind Sifu', they were like 'alright, Sifu 2 incoming'," Tarno continued. "I'm sorry about that misunderstanding because I think we should have probably, early on, let the Sifu community know that we were about to announce a title and that it would not be Sifu 2, and they shouldn't be expecting it, just so they didn't have this disappointment."</p>
<p>The developer added Sifu was never intended to become the studio's identity, and it was time for something new. "We did a year and a half of post-launch support for Sifu," he said. "We felt that we'd really provided and kind of given everything we had on Sifu." But, at least for the time being, "it was better to let [Sifu] rest". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifus-last-ever-content-update-is-coming-in-september">Sifu ultimately got its last content update in September</a> 2023.</p>
<p>Continuing, Tarno said some players often expect "studios to be doing the exact same genre over and over again", but that is not the way Sloclap approaches things.</p>
<p>"We have a huge opportunity to pursue the creative projects that we are passionate about, and not many developers have that chance. It's really very rare for developers to be able to do that," Tarno elaborated. "And then I think players and also media realised that although it was not exactly the same, [the games are] both third-person action games. Both grounded, credible, still epic, with bodies and movement, it's physicality."</p>
<p>Tarno said "there is a lineage between the titles", from Sloclap's Absolver to Sifu to Rematch. "Our experience making the two previous games is what allowed us to make this one," the developer closed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it. In fact I love it despite the fact that a large portion of the player base is the absolute worst kind of person: a ball hog."</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to Tarno about the introduction of crossplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">which remains the "top priority" for Rematch and Sloclap</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-developer-sorry-to-disappointed-fans-wanting-more-sifu-but-it-had-given-everything-we-had-already]]></content:encoded>

		<p>No More Robots and RageSquid have announced that Descenders Next is out… now! The sequel to the downhill biking of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/descenders">Descenders</a> is available right now for PC and Xbox, and on<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">&nbsp;Game Pass</a> for both systems.</p>
<p><iframe title="Descenders Next is OUT NOW!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fE11hzKkErQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Where the original game was all about bikes, Descenders Next focuses in on snowboarding and mountainboarding. You’ll start by drifting through the white stuff, before getting onto the brown stuff, mastering snowboards first before having wheels attached to that plank of wood and relearning how this will handle.</p>
<p>Descenders Next already boasts as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer, multiple huge biomes, and tons of tricks and grinds to learn how to pull off. There’s still a blend of procedural generation and hand-crafted levels, but these now chain from one into the other, and the goal can be a to race to the finish line, pull of tricks and perfect landings, or go on scavenger hunts to explore the whole mountain.</p>
<p>Rounding out the experience is a drum and bass soundtrack from Monstercat.</p>

<p>Descenders was a huge hit for No More Robots and RageSquid, first launching for PC and Xbox One in 2019, before spreading to PS4 and Switch in 2020. With outright sales alongside stints in subscription services, there’s been over 35 million players of this game, and they’ll no doubt be hoping to capture that lightning in a bottle for a second time.</p>
<p>Originally announced last August, the team planned to roll from a demo back in February of this year to have their early access launch in April, but chose to postpone this after seeing tens of thousands of players try out the game and gathering a ton of valuable feedback and info. A few months on, and Descenders Next will hopefully be much better prepared to handle everything that players want from the game.</p>

			<p>Developer RageSquid and publisher No More Robots have shadowdropped Descenders Next on Steam in Early Access, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and it's available through Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Announced in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2375530/view/4362384060822219438?l=english">August 2024</a>, Descenders Next is RageSquid's follow-up to Descenders, which launched in early access a little more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/most-anticipated-sports-racing-2019/">seven years ago</a>, and reached more than 35 million players across consoles and PC. Descenders Next moves the series beyond extreme mountainbiking, with snowboarding and mountainboarding as the next frontier for players to conquer. </p>

<p>RageSquid boasts that Descenders Next "<em>already features as much content as the original Descenders, with full online multiplayer action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore."</em> If you're not playing it on Xbox Game Pass, then you can grab Descenders Next for $29.99 / £24.99 / 28.99 euros on Steam and Xbox. </p>

<p>The studio also says that the game will feature "<em>a more natural experience</em>," with procedurally-generated "<em>off-piste</em>" mountains that will be tied together by parks made by the development team, rather than having procedurally generated tracks or hand-crafted ones, as was the case in Descenders.</p>



<p>RageSquid is also determined to make Descenders Next the last word in extreme sports games, "<em>slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time."</em> What those sports will be and when they'll be added remains to be seen.</p>



<p>No More Robots and RageSquid did not provide an update as to when Descenders Next will arrive on PlayStation or Nintendo consoles, though <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/descenders-next-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-and-pc">when it was announced last August</a>, the studio did say that it was "<em>likely</em>" to arrive on Nintendo Switch 2, and that it would be coming to PlayStation "<em>at a later date</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-of-the-colossus-director-fumito-ueda-is-convinced-%E2%80%9Cthe-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over%E2%80%9D.1248855/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game mechanics are the things players are usually talking about when they talk about the gameplay in a video game. Finding fluidity to the mechanics, even introducing new ones, can make a game stand out among the hundreds of games released each year. However, for iconic game director Fumito Ueda, the director behind games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-movie-still-on-the-way-though-financing-isnt-secured-yet/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, Ico, and The Last Guardian, game mechanics, or new ones, at least, are part of a bygone era of video games.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-age-of-game-mechanics-is-over-claims-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-ueda/">VGC</a>, in an interview with Japanese publication <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">DefamicoGamer</a>, Ueda made the comment while talking about Katamari creator Keita Takahashi's latest game, To a T. "<em>I don’t remember exactly why I replied with a ‘like’ at the time, but I was probably thinking, ‘the era of game mechanics is over. I wonder if we are no longer in the era where we need to provide new devices or new game mechanics every single game."</em> Per VGC, Takahashi claims that Ueda has been spreading this particular gospel for years, specifically since Thatgamecompany's Journey released in 2012.</p>



<p>Ueda added, "<em>Even if the mechanics are not new, you can focus on the feel and art. Whether you like it or not, it’s better to sharpen the existing mechanics."</em> </p>



<p>What qualifies as a 'new' game mechanic is ultimately going to be subjective for players and game developers, but it's difficult not to see Ueda's point when you consider how difficult it can be to introduce something truly new to modern players. Art style, game feel, game narrative, and how fluidly all those elements are woven together are what can make games feel new, even if nothing about the individual parts is new. </p>



<p>Lies of P, for example, is a game that borrows plenty from other games. Customizing weapons isn't a new game mechanic, but how its weapon customization weaves into the rest of the game, in terms of its art, combat, and narrative, all help make the way Lies of P does weapon customization feel new for players.</p>



<p>Perhaps the most significant element of this insight into Ueda's view of modern video games and game making is the fact that we know he's working on a new project. Announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/">The Game Awards</a> last year with an intriguing trailer, this unnamed project already felt like a callback to Shadow of the Colossus, and it'll be interesting to see where else those similarities lie, and how Ueda chooses to sharpen game mechanics in his next game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have revealed the release date for upcoming extreme sports game&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, and, well, it turns out the game isn't so "upcoming" anymore.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out now for PC and Xbox, and it's also on Game Pass. That's right; the game has been shadowdropped, and you can check it out right now at no extra cost if you're a Game Pass subscriber.</p>

<p>If you're not, the game will set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent. It's in Early Access right now, which means you're getting just two sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. Additional sports will, however, be added over time;&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s goal is to become "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>

Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed back when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc" rel="nofollow">was announced last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s first two sports will handle differently from one another as well, so you won't just be getting carbon copies of the same activity at launch (i.e. now).</p>

<p>No More Robots and RageSquid say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>was to "deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed [as the original <em>Descenders</em>], but expand beyond mountain biking". As such, the studios emphasized a philosophy of "perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports" for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>.</p>

<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>already has the same amount of content that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>does, and it'll offer a "more natural experience" than the original game's mixture of procedurally-generated stages and hand-crafted levels thanks to its "procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas".</p>




<p><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is out right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/descenders-next-game-preview/9N66JJQFX3RX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (including Xbox One), and if you're a Game Pass member, you can play it right now at no additional cost as well, although you will need to be on the Ultimate or PC tiers to check it out.</p>

            <p>
I recently took on a garden allotment tenancy for what I now consider the tellingly low rent of £60 a year. Arming myself with some shiny new shears, I visited my little slice of heaven and found it to be a resentful thicket of Guinness cans, sacks of worrying discarded clothing, nettles sturdier than barbed wire, and insects of a kind I have never seen before and never care to again. 
</p>
<p>
At one point I got my foot stuck in a long-abandoned bucket and, while running around in a panic, put my other foot through a red ant nest. It was a lot like playing the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cleanfall">Cleanfall</a>, except that I can't build an airship out of flying jellyfish and flamethrowers and blast this stupid allotment into submission. Mind you, Cleanfall is evidence that an airship made of flying jellyfish and flame throwers will only get you so far.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I wrote up the release of the demo last year, summarising the game SEOishly as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spelunky">Spelunky</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> with a touch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/carrion">Carrion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>". I have now played <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2769780/view/543361383085903981?l=english">another, updated demo</a>, following the announcement that Cleanfall will enter early access on 8th August, and my summary has narrowed to "side-scrolling Scavenger's Reign".</p>
<p>In Cleanfall, you are a robot who is trying to tunnel to the core of a planet full of wriggly things. Some of the wriggly things are docile, at least before they're provoked. In the opening jungle layer, for example, there are frogs that belch and bobble about in search of edible greenery. How cute! You can even stand on them without pissing them off. But then comes night, and with night comes a sea of glowing red eyes, pouring into the layout from all sides. 
</p>

</a>
</p>

<p>
The thing about the red-eyed nightfiends is that at least you know they're hostile. A lot of the organisms in Cleanfall are hard to categorise without risking a confrontation. I've spent a lot of the demo listening to unseen critter calls with a furrowed brow, trying to work out whether "squibleeyahckckckc" means "stay the hell away from my nest" or "where my edible greenery at". The consumable items can be similarly mysterious. What does a "nanite egg" do? Oh, it instantly decomposes the entire cave I'm standing in. I should have kept that one in reserve, probably.
</p>
<p>
The one surety is that you need covering fire, because threats come from all directions. Usefully, the chasms teem with vending machines where you can trade lumps of ore and dead insect for turrets, which secure themselves springily to the terrain when placed. Each night, you hole up somewhere behind a bunch of these automated guns, hoping like hell you've placed enough.
</p>
<p>
Even better, you seek refuge in the skies. See that veiny purple dirigible that idly spits out twirling explosive seedlings? Attach a platform here and some Gatlings there and a rocket thruster here and presto, you have yourself a flying fortress.</p>
<p>The first time I built a flying fortress in Cleanfall, I fell clean out of it. The fortress carried on blasting at creatures on the upper levels, deluging me in crafting materials as I sought a way back up. It made for an efficient farming operation, I guess, but that was before sundown. As the shadows drew close, I consulted my inventory. Hmm, I don't think this "fart bulb" is going to help me much, or at least, not for long enough. I sure could go for a nanite egg right now.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>
Things I haven't mentioned: the newly updated demo has overhauled UI elements and jetpacks for certain character classes. You get three lives, with the ability to ghost around a bit before you respawn: once you've used them all up, you're transported back to the surface by a phantom train. The surface is home to a tall man with a very long nose and a top hat, who professes to be your friend. I'm sure he's nothing to worry about.
</p>
<p>
Cleanfall is scruffy and unwilling and volatile, all the key components of a good video game in the year of our Lord 2025. I get the sense that, unlike my mutinous and possibly haunted allotment, this one will be a keeper. Let me know if you have any thoughts on the demo and also, if you have any advice about humane ant relocation strategies.

We asked ourselves: Where do we go from <em>Descenders</em>? How do we deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed, but expand beyond mountain biking? From there, the idea of perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports was born.</p><p>With <em>Descenders Next</em>, players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding <a title="Genres > Action [2,880 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport feels and handles differently, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of Next.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>Descenders Next</em> already features as much content as the original <em>Descenders</em>, with full online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [555 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore. Players will earn rep as they scale the mountain, and use that to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles and more to customize their rider.</p><p>Last time around, <em>Descenders</em> provided both procedurally-generated tracks, as well as a selection of hand-crafted parks. With <em>Descenders Next</em> we’ve brought it all together with a more natural experience, as players will tackle procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks and vistas.</p><p>The parks in particular provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next’s playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you’ll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you’ll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest.</p><p>Top it all off with an absolutely banging soundtrack from Monstercat, and you’ve got even more reasons to spend hours on the slopes, chilling out to the latest in drum and bass hits.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Descenders Next is OUT NOW!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fE11hzKkErQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/descenders-next-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc-now-available]]></content:encoded>
