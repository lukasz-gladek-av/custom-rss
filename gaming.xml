            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Last month, Microsoft raised the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate by a whopping 50% and overhauled the face of the subscription service. It was a drastic event that led to rampant backlash hitting social media platforms worldwide, with many subscribers downgrading their tier or cancelling their subscription altogether.</p>



<p>In a new post, it has been claimed that some, such as Call of Duty’s developers, see the price hike as a positive for the studios making the games that are added to the Game Pass service when they launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-short-term-loss-long-term-gain">Short-Term Loss, Long-Term Gain</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, GhostofHope, a Call of Duty leaker, revealed that they’d spoken to a string of Call of Duty developers who had nice things to say about the Game Pass Ultimate price boost.</p>



<p>Last month, the price of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/">Game Pass Ultimate swelled</a> from $19.99 a month to $29.99 a month.</p>



<p>GhostofHope <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1984636078729355503" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote on X</a> (formerly Twitter):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I spoke to several Call of Duty developers who say that the recent price increase for Game Pass from $19.99 to $29.99 is a positive for the Call of Duty studios. </p>



<p>Financially, this will be a win for them as individuals because it will lead to more revenue which means they are more in control of their future and what they can achieve. </p>



<p>There is also a lot more financial upside with bonuses and such if they are successful now. The news of a price increase also means they need to rely on making games that sell more units to achieve these bonuses. </p>



<p>The vibe in Activision with regards to Black Ops 7 is pretty positive at the moment. A few months ago, the executive team was not happy and now they are feeling better.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In July, the founder of Arkane Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arkane-studios-founder-game-pass-unsustainable/">went on the record</a>, labelling Game Pass ‘unsustainable and damaging’ and stressing that it doesn’t co-exist with other models.</p>



<p>It was also revealed in recent Xbox news that Microsoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-revenue-q1-2026-drop-113m-year-over-year/">console hardware sales</a> dropped by 29% in Q1 FY26, putting further stock in the company diving deeper into publishing, the cloud, and the flagship subscription service.</p>



<p>Do you think the price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was a good thing, or have you canceled your subscription? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>
How do you follow on from making a game that essentially popularised a whole new genre? I can only imagine that question is one Brendan Greene, aka Player Unknown, i.e. the creator of PUBG, has asked himself a few times. The answer to that question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a>, a game that has been in the works for a little while now, and at long last has an early access release date.
</p>
<p>
That date isn't too far off either: it's November 20th! And with that release date came a new trailer showing off some new features you can expect in the early access release. While the main mode of the game sees you travelling across a randomly generated wilderness towards a weather tower, there will be an option for a Free Roam mode which lets you walk about the place at a much more leisurely pace. In this mode, the only thing that can kill you is fall damage, so as long as you mind your feet you'll be all good.
</p>

<p>
The early access release will come with a bunch of customisation features too. These can get really minute too, like the amount of cabins that are spawned, how strong the airflow is, that sort of thing. You can also control the weather, allowing for blizzards, acid rain, thunderstorms, and you can control whether it's always daytime or nighttime if you like.
</p><p>
Those of you that like to get creative might be interested in the game's map editor. This one doesn't look massively involved from the trailer, but there might be more going on behind the scenes. Or, if you like playing the maps the game itself generates, you can also share the seeds of those maps with others so they can give them a go.
</p>
<p>
If you're curious about what the game is like in action, Edwin went <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playerunknowns-prologue-go-wayback-is-an-enchanting-exploration-sim-tossed-on-a-sea-of-metaverse-imagineering">hands-on with it earlier this year</a>, and even spoke to Greene about it.

			<p>The Fortnite X The Simpsons crossover is now live, bringing the game to Chapter 6, Season 5. Battle Royale players will find themselves dropping into Springfield Island, which according to the developers will provide a fast-paced experience that returns the game to basics. As usual with a new season, each week will introduce new Simpsons-themed gameplay additions and, of course, cosmetics to purchase in the shop. </p>



<p>Each week, the map updates will be previewed through original animated shorts The Simpsons shorts, which have been co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games. The first one is already live; you can find it inside Fortnite (go to the Quests tab and then Animated Shorts), via the game's social channels, and on Disney+. Here's the full schedule of The Simpsons shorts:</p>



<p>● November 1 - “Apocalypse D’Oh"<br>● November 10 - “Sugar High”<br>● November 17 - “Multiplidiocy”<br>● November 24 - “The Incredible Bulk”</p>



<p>The Springfield Battle Pass includes Outfits as premium rewards, including Homer, Marge, Flanders, Blinky Fishstick, and a Springfielder Peely. Since it's the weekend, you can also check out the Delulu mode, where new Simpsons-themed weapons can be found. Just be prepared for potential betrayals.</p>



<p>In Fortnite Battle Royale, prepare for a host of tournaments in Springfield, including the Victory Cups, where you earn cash for each Victory Royale you achieve once you reach Round 2.</p>



<p>The new season also sees the debut of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-sidekicks-cute-pets-follow-around-can-only-be-customized-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, with Peels available for purchase in the shop. More Sidekicks will be added starting on Friday, November 7.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>By the way, The Simpsons have also invaded Rocket League, Epic's other big online game. From today through November 17, Rocket League players can complete challenges to unlock in-game rewards straight from Springfield. Keep your eyes on the ball with the Blinky Topper, hide after a loss with the Homer's Hedges Player Banner, get to work with the Waste Wheels, and more. There is also an unlimited challenge that awards 20,000 XP each time.</p>

            <p>
Things aren't sounding so hot over at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developer Rockstar right now. Yesterday, a report came out from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings">Bloomberg</a> (paywalled) that a number of employees have been allegedly fired, with the UK's IWGB Game Workers Union claiming it was an act of union busting. Two-Two, Rockstar's parent company, have denied this allegation.
</p>
<p>
According to the report, alongside a post from the IWGB Game Workers Union's Bluesky account, the roles of more than 30 staffers were "terminated" across both UK and Canadian offices Thursday this week. Bloomberg notes that all of the employees were apparently a part of a private Discord group chat revolving around trade unions, with members of this group either a part of the IWGB or were currently attempting to organise at Rockstar.

</span></p><p>
Alex Marshall, president of IWGB, offered this statement: "Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."
</p><p>
Take-Two spokesman Alan Lewis claims the firings were for "gross misconduct," and for no other reason" and that "we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach." It does not appear any specifics over what said gross misconduct might have been shared.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar are no strangers to workplace controversies, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-employees-decry-crunch-controversy">including those involving crunch</a>, though word on that front has been quieter in recent years.
</p>
<p>
As you'll already be aware, the studio is currently working on GTA 6, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">currently slated for release in 2026</a>.

Ayaneo briefly teased that it was working on a phone back in August during the event where it unveiled the dual-screen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/761296/ayaneo-pocket-ds-dual-screen-handheld-android-13">Pocket DS</a>.

They tend to be phones first and foremost, but with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24023549/asus-rog-phone-8-pro-ai-price-release-date-specs-features-gaming-smartphone">high-end chips and cooling</a> to help them handle demanding games. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23041008/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-review-price-features">Physical controls</a> are usually reserved for accessories, but maybe the Ayaneo phone will buck that trend. Of course, we don’t even know if the Ayaneo phone will be coming to the US or not, so don’t get too excited just yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/812084/ayaneo-phone-confirmed-in-a-teaser-featuring-retro-remake-branding]]></content:encoded>

<p>SpongeBob SquarePants may be heading to Fortnite, if notable leakers’ claims are correct. Furthermore, the collaboration is coming sooner than we’d expect.</p>



<p>If you grew up in the 2000s, you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spongebob-squarepants-titans-of-the-tide-launches-november-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SpongeBob SquarePants</a> quite well. The hit Nickelodeon show has been airing for 26 years and still going. Entertaining both kids and adults, the legacy of the animated cartoon is enormous. So, naturally, it’s high time (or tide, in SpongeBob’s case, for the series to come to Fortnite. While a collaboration has happened between the two with UEFN, it seems like it could be much bigger in Season 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-spongebob-squarepants-decals-leaked-for-fortnite-hinting-at-possible-collab">SpongeBob SquarePants Decals Leaked for Fortnite, Hinting at Possible Collab</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The rumor of SpongeBob SquarePants being in Fortnite was first said by <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1984659306851991621" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a>, a known leaker in the gaming community. Other insiders like SamLeakss reported the same, stating that the franchise would <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1984669485534466115" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">be added with Season 7</a>, launching November 27th, 2025. However, the most concrete evidence comes from <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1984658819226476786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1984658819226476786%7Ctwgr%5Ef357053515844a5306205f97171b8abb11aeca93%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D155457action%3Dedit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who had an art asset of a smushed Plankton. As some commenters have noticed, it looks like a wheel for the racing game, possibly hinting at what the collab may be for. It also helps that SamLeakss mentions that an SUV would be part of the addition, seemingly confirming it’s part of Rocket Racing.</p>



<p>Just today, The Simpsons were added to Fortnite, transforming the map to Springfield. Seeing how the game has grown into a big commercial success with collabs left and right is crazy. With recent ones being The Black Phone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-festival-season-10-gorillaz-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gorillaz</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-features-largest-ever-collabs-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a>, every series under the sun seemingly wants in with Epic Games’ mulitplayer shooter. Whether SpongeBob appears on the battlefield or as cosmetics is unknown, but fans can expect the porous fellow to appear real soon.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SpongBob x Fortnite collab? What do you hope it looks like? Skins? Cosmetic items? Sidekicks?

            <p>A new rating on the American Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) suggests <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is finally on its way to Xbox.</p>
<p>While we knew the horror game had only secured console exclusivity with Sony for a year, there's been no word from Konami on when - or even if - the remake would finally be available on Xbox Series X/S. Until now, that is.</p>

<p>While we still don't have official confirmation by either developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> or publisher Konami, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40337/silent-hill-2/">ESRB website</a> clearly states it is coming to Microsoft's platform, making it a matter of when, not if, we'll get a release date.</p>
<p>The ESRB, unsurprisingly, has rated the game M for Mature 17+ due to blood and gore, sexual themes, strong language, and violence.</p>
<p>The summary of the gameplay also includes shockingly huge story spoilers, too, so I'd only suggest visiting the site if you already know some of the game's major twists and revelations.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves." It's sold about 2.5 million copies, taking sales for the 20+ year old franchise to 10 million.</p><p>As for the additional DLC chapter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-actor-confirms-weve-not-recorded-anything-for-born-from-a-wish-dlc">Born From a Wish</a>, which was briefly a Xbox-exclusive when it released for the original game? The voice actor behind Remake's Maria recently confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content, suggesting there are no plans to release it.</p>
<p>Is it possible that she recorded dialogue or mocap for the additional content while the game was in full production? Sure. Maybe. Could she be bound by an NDA and unable to confirm or deny anything? That's plausible, too. But the expression on her face and the multiple "sorrys" feel more like a gentle letdown than a teasing affirmation.</p>

            <p>
Sure looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is off to an alright start, 'ey? Success doesn't mean there's any rest for the wicked, i.e. a live service game, however. Just yesterday, only a day after launching, developer Embark Studios revealed their Arc Raiders <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">roadmap</a> for the rest of 2025. It's light on details, but does offer a good outline for what you can expect at the very least.
</p>
<p>
In terms of ongoing additions and tweaks, Embark are working on new map conditions, feats, trials, and cosmetics, alongside some general quality of life improvements and mysteriously, "more…" for the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. November, the month we suddenly find ourselves in, looks to be quite packed with additions. There's a whole new map, Stella Montis, which will bring the game to five total. Some "special themed community events" will be held this month (and in December) too.
</p>
<p>
A couple of new Arc machines will be introduced this month, called Matriarch and Shredder respectively. I imagine it's safe to assume that that second one will be looking quite sharp. On top of that, there'll be more quests, weapons, and gadgets to pick up too.
</p>
<p>
Then in December, a snowfall map condition will be added in - no prize for you or me for making an assumption that this one does what it says on the tin. There's also something called the Flickering Flames Event, as well as just a feature titled "Expedition Departure Window." You'll also be able to make your way through a new Raider Deck, and try your hand at even more quests.
</p>
<p>
That's the long and short of it, there is of course a promise for "more" which presumably will come in the new year. You'll need to wait a while longer to find out whatever that might be.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> has been accused of union-busting after terminating the contracts of 30-40 staff, all of whom were purportedly involved in union activities. Rockstar claims they were fired for gross misconduct.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings">Bloomberg</a>, the developers - employed in multiple disciplines and offices across Canada and the UK - had been part of a private union chat group on Discord and were allegedly either already in the union, or planning to organise at the company.</p>
<p>Take-Two spokesperson Alan Lewis told Bloomberg the developers were fired for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason", adding "[Take-Two] fully support[s] Rockstar's ambitions and approach".</p>
<p>"Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry," said president of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), Alex Marshall.</p>
<p>"This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry."</p>
<p>Rockstar has not commented publicly on the firings or accusations of union busting.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> boss Strauss Zelnick returned to the subject of AI, this time suggesting the controversial technology could never create anything like GTA 6 because <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-couldnt-be-made-by-ai-suggests-take-two-boss-there-is-no-creativity-that-can-exist-by-definition-in-any-ai-model">"no creativity... can exist by definition in any AI model."</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Even more psychological manipulation awaits in Poppy Playtime Chapter 5. If you’re eager to be reunited with Huggy Wuggy, we’ve got the latest release date details and when it could be expected.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 apparently wasn’t enough for Poppy Playtime fans, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/poppy-playtime-chapter-5-teaser-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5</a> is on the way. The lovingly-named Huggy Wuggy and his minions are waiting to massacre you once again, and no doubt you’re here because you’re excited at the prospect, instead of running away—you have ZERO survival instincts, people!</p>



<p>That said, if you’re eager to enter a new area of the factory, let’s get into it.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It’ll happen, so be ready. Credit to Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mob Entertainment hasn’t revealed Poppy Playtime Chapter 5’s full release date yet, but Steam shows that we shouldn’t expect the new DLC until 2026 at the very earliest.</strong></p>



<p>If you head to Steam, you’ll see quite clearly: “<strong>Planned Release Date:&nbsp;2026</strong>,” under the usual launch details section.</p>



<p>A Halloween announcement for Chapter 5 understandably had the Poppy Playtime community excited. Was the new release a shadow drop? Was it an announcement to say that it was coming during Holiday 2025? Unfortunately not.</p>



<p>We’ve done the research, checked the game’s Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 – Teaser Trailer, and searched on the main website to no avail. Interestingly, all the top comments on the Chapter 5 teaser trailer are from fans and creators asking for the developer to <strong>take their time with the game</strong>.</p>



<p>Chapter 4 debuted with some technical issues and bugs at launch, which marred the game for many. If Mob Entertainment does this, we might not see Chapter 5 until well into 2026, maybe even closer to next Halloween.</p>



<p>You can check out the full Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 teaser trailer right here if you’ve not seen it.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-i-stole-from-nintendo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/feature-the-art-i-stole-from-nintendo.1341205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f8697cacf056a"><a title="Karen McKenna SMRPG" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f8697cacf056a/karen-mckenna-smrpg.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Karen McKenna</em></figcaption></figure><p>It began with a Zelda T-shirt.</p>
<p>I was wearing my <em>“It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.”</em> shirt while running a quick errand at the bank. The teller spotted it. He was at least 20 years younger than me, but his “Nice shirt!” comment kicked off a lengthy conversation about our shared Nintendo fandom.</p>
<p>Before long, he pulled out a tablet and showed me <a href="https://grantgm.com/">his digital fan art</a>. It was awesome: detailed, dynamic sketches of Mario, Pokémon, and (my favourite) Metroid characters. His passion was apparent.</p>
<p>I told him I was thrilled by his drawings, because I know how much that work means. You see, years ago, I had a job at Nintendo that involved seeing hundreds of pieces of original Nintendo fan art. And I took some home.</p>
<p>This is the story of that collection, and how a handful of drawings, once marked for the landfill, became some of the most meaningful pieces of my gaming collection.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5c6e10cdfd6c9"><a title="Super Mario Characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5c6e10cdfd6c9/super-mario-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://grantgm.com/">Grant GM</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Player’s Pulse and a Pile of Precious Paper</strong></h2>
<p>This will definitely date me, but I interned at Nintendo during the second half of 1996. Before long, I was given complete control of Player’s Pulse, the letters to the editor section. I chose fan letters, wrote responses, and, most importantly, picked the envelope art that was displayed on those pages.</p>
<p>Mind you, this was nearly three decades ago, so the letters and the artwork were on real, physical paper, sent via snail mail. This was before the days of email and file shares.</p>
<p>I absolutely loved sifting through the envelope art because it was pure fandom: earnest, expressive, and often beautiful.</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn that it was Nintendo's practice to destroy all artwork after it had been screened and scanned for the magazine! That meant dozens, maybe hundreds, of amateur art pieces in the trash bin each month.</p>
<p>It felt criminal to toss that effort, so I kept all the artwork that came across my desk during my short internship.</p>
<p>Here are five pieces of art that define the long journey of that collection:</p>
<h2><strong>Naomi Chiba’s Envelopes</strong></h2>
<p>Years after I left Nintendo Power, I read a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-power-helped-a-shy-fan-show-her-art-to-the-wor-1786871046">Kotaku article</a> about <strong>Naomi Chiba</strong>, easily the most prolific Player’s Pulse artist ever. While reading, I remembered that I had three of her original envelopes in my collection!</p>
<figure data-uuid="097d8e4038545"><a title="Two published and one unpublished art piece by Naomi Chiba" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/097d8e4038545/two-published-and-one-unpublished-art-piece-by-naomi-chiba.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard / Naomi Chiba</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With help from the author, I connected with Naomi and arranged to return her artwork.</p>
<p>Doing so was surprisingly emotional. I hesitated when it came time to seal the envelope, but then it occurred to me that she might be the first person to ever get back the artwork that they had sent to Nintendo Power.</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me: this coloured paper meant something.</p>
<h2><strong>Quid pro Quo with Seth</strong></h2>
<p>The success with Naomi led me to find more artists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/hatlandous/">Seth Hatland</a> came next. He was so grateful to get his <strong>Mega Man X</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> drawings back that he insisted on trading them for a brand-new piece of art as a thank you. “I’ve gotten slightly better,” he said.</p>
<p>What an understatement!</p>
<p>He sent me an incredible piece of Link that has hung proudly in my office ever since.</p>

<h2><strong>The Big Trade</strong></h2>
<p>After returning art to several more creators, I was connected with Stephan Reese (aka <a href="https://x.com/ArtofNP">ArtofNP</a>) and his non-profit <a href="https://www.interactiveartcollection.org/">Interactive Art Collection</a>. They specialise in original Nintendo Power artwork, although he hadn’t seen much in the way of envelope art - probably because Nintendo had destroyed it all.</p>
<p>I ultimately agreed to add most of my remaining collection to his museum.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2682f716b2d85"><a title="Envelope art from Nintendo Power" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2682f716b2d85/envelope-art-from-nintendo-power.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In return, Stephan sent me an original, professional piece made for the promotional brochure of the Nintendo Super System arcade, circa 1992. I love it almost as much as the amateur stuff, plus I’m happy to know that the rest of the fan art is in a better place than a binder on my shelf.</p>
<figure data-uuid="00245d417ff8f"><a title="Original art for the Nintendo Super System arcade brochure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/00245d417ff8f/original-art-for-the-nintendo-super-system-arcade-brochure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>(I'm the "ex-Nintendo employee" mentioned in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/the-art-of-nintendo-power-exhibit-a-guided-tour">Nintendo Life post</a> about Stephan’s exhibit a couple of years ago.)</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:155542 @ 1762026451 -->
<h2><strong>The One I Kept</strong></h2>
<p>After all that wheeling and dealing, I was left with one volume's worth of envelopes, which hangs in my game room. Here’s Volume 92 in all its glory:</p>
<figure data-uuid="c6f322714c9cb"><a title="Framed fan-art from Nintendo Power Volume 92" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c6f322714c9cb/framed-fan-art-from-nintendo-power-volume-92.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Family Fan Art</strong></h2>
<p>The most recent additions to my art collection are courtesy of my own kids. Is there anything better than a child’s imagination and fandom put to paper?</p>
<p>My oldest is studying art at Utah State University, but her early work continues to remind me that fan art isn't just a fun hobby; sometimes it’s a training ground.</p>

<hr>
<p>When I look at my art collection, I don’t see discarded mail. I see a bond between the creatives at a massive entertainment company and their fans.</p>
<p>My new bank teller friend, with his portfolio of beautiful, detailed digital sketches, is part of a timeless, vital tradition. He's doing what fans, including my own daughter, have done for decades: translating their hobby into a personal act of creation.</p>
<p>I may have initially 'stolen' art from Nintendo, but in the end, that art taught me a lesson: the true heart of a gaming community isn't some corporate office. It's the enduring, incredible passion of its talented fans.</p>

                <p>The day has finally arrived--after months and months of leaks and rumors, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">Fortnite's Simpsons season launches today</a>. Just not quite yet, because Fortnite is offline for maintenance following the "Welcome, Our Alien Overlords" event, during which players were treated to a Simpsons short film that explained how they ended up being a part of the Fortnite omniverse.</p><p>As is standard operating procedure for Epic, Fortnite goes offline when it's time for a major update. While this usually happens during the middle of the night on a weekday, this season launch is a special event, and as such, it'll kick off on a Saturday evening. That's why it's offline for maintenance now--Epic wants the launch of Fortnite x Simpsons to arrive during primetime on a Saturday night.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_GXjh_Xi2I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/j_GXjh_Xi2I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>When is Fortnite Simpsons season expected to launch?</h2><p>Epic is planning to bring Fortnite back online for The Simpsons season at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET, though that time is an estimate and not set in stone. In reality, Fortnite maintenance rarely ends on schedule, as it's simply done when it's done--which actually often means sooner than expected. Fortnite maintenance usually lasts between four and seven hours, and the planned start time here splits the difference exactly at 5.5 hours of downtime. So don't be surprised if the season starts a little before or a little after that time.</p><p>When the season does start, everything will be different. This Fortnite x Simpsons event is introducing an entirely new cel-shaded map based on Springfield from the series, and it'll have a Simpsons-themed battle pass and revamped loot pool. This may just be Fortnite's most thorough collaboration ever.

<p>Don’t Scream Together brings back the terrifying horror of the original and amplifies the fear by allowing you to have multiple friends join you. We’re seeing if Don’t Scream Together has a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S future.</p>



<p>If you’ve somehow not heard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-scream-is-taking-the-horror-world-by-storm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Scream</a>, it’s probably better for your sanity. The 2023 indie sensation quickly went viral with its retro-looking graphics, palpable tension, and the game’s simple premise: DON’T SCREAM. 2024 saw the game’s full 1.0 launch, and it’s been such a hit that developer Digital Cybercherries is working on Don’t Scream Together—and it would be better on PS5 and Xbox.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-ps5-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To PS5 Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’d run too. Credit to Digital Cybercherries</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It can’t be ruled out for the future, but for now, Don’t Scream Together won’t be launching on PS5 consoles</strong>.</p>



<p>So far, developer Digital Cybercherries has made it quite clear that the new multiplayer version of Don’t Scream is targeting a Steam release, meaning it’s only on PC at launch.</p>



<p>On the game’s official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1128949867457302530/1156475689789304842/1431060015195881482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a> server, a community post outlines this quite clearly:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re incredibly proud to announce DON’T SCREAM TOGETHER, an improved and expanded version of DON’T SCREAM will be <strong>launching on Steam soon!</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s no mention of consoles, and it’s not even addressed anywhere in the news or info threads.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-don-t-scream-together-come-to-xbox-series-x-s-consoles">Will Don’t Scream Together Come To Xbox Series X|S Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>We also have to say that Don’t Scream Together isn’t scheduled for any Xbox consoles right now: The Xbox Series X|S or even the Xbox One, to extend the reach a bit more.</strong></p>



<p>This answer is much the same as our PS5 verdict. It seems like Digital Cybercherries is firmly fixed on getting Don’t Scream Together right on PC before even contemplating a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S console release.</p>



<p>But keep reading, because interested Don’t Scream onlookers might like what we have to say next! </p>



<h2 id="h-is-don-t-scream-coming-to-ps5-or-xbox-consoles">Is Don’t Scream Coming to PS5 or Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>A Don’t Scream developer has hinted that the original single-player experience “may find itself on other platforms in the future.”</strong></p>



<p>It’s not all doom and gloom then. While we’ll have to wait for Don’t Scream Together on console, a console port for 2024’s full Don’t Scream debut could be on the cards.</p>



<p>When asked about Don’t Scream Together crossplay, developer [DCC] Dec (on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2692990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>) said this:</p>



<blockquote></blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p>“Crossplay is not in the works currently for this title. The classic DON’T SCREAM singleplayer experience may find itself on other platforms in the future though.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s up to you if you take this as a win. If you’re looking for a console port of Don’t Scream, you should at least be getting a taste of the OG game that set the Don’t Scream Together wheels in motion.</p>



<p>We’ll have more on its console port later when the news is announced. Are you picking up Don’t Scream Together at lunch? Or are you hungry for horror on PlayStation and Xbox consoles?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, a claim surfaced that Activision’s studios were preparing to announce an earlier release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. That was more or less refuted by Treyarch, the lead development studio piecing the game together, but now a new claim has hit the airwaves.</p>



<p>In a recent post on social media, famed dataminer ‘PlayStation Game Size’ dug up information about the install sizes, pre-load dates, and <strong>release times </strong>for Black Ops 7 on <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. While a disclaimer highlighted that things can change, the data found suggests that the Black Ops 6 campaign and Zombies platform will go live on November 10, rather than November 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-black-ops-7-s-campaign-coming-early">Is Black Ops 7’s Campaign Coming Early?</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Black Ops 7’s campaign (and the Zombies offering) is almost certainly <strong>not </strong>being released earlier than intended. This is something that would have been telegraphed by Treyarch to drive up pre-orders, and that hasn’t been the case.</p>



<p>In the comments under <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367269372145836">their post</a>, PlayStation Game Size suggested that the ‘current release time’ listed in the files could be a PSN error:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Current Release time</p><p>Maybe PSN Error!</p></div>— PlayStation Game Size (@PlaystationSize) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlaystationSize/status/1984367615729618976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Activision’s studios rarely detach the campaign portion of a new Call of Duty game from the multiplayer platform, but it’s not unheard of. In a way, it’s a good thing, as it allows fans to complete the campaign without worrying about falling behind with everyone else flooding the multiplayer platform.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That’s not the case this year, as Activision hasn’t arranged a way for players to access the campaign early, regardless of what the data seems to suggest.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’d like to play the Black Ops 7 campaign early – or Zombies!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We’re living in a wonderful period for puzzle games. Seemingly everyone, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">from<em> The New York Times</em> to Linkedin</a>, has fun puzzles to play, so every morning I have plenty of options to accompany my first coffee of the day. Lately, though, much of my daily puzzle time has come from an unlikely source: the Playdate.</p><p>Panic’s little yellow handheld is best known for being home to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/705348/playdate-season-2-review">oddball indie games you can’t find anywhere else</a>, many of which utilize a crank to play. But it has also amassed a library of excellent puzzle games that are playable in quick bursts. It makes it easy to stick a Playdate in your pocket and grab it when you need to kill a few minutes; this is particularly useful if you’re someone, like me, who is actively trying to avoid reaching for your phone in those moments. Here are a few of my recent favorites.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025390/playdate-handheld-portable-gaming-console-review">the Playdate itself</a>, <a href="https://play.date/games/lexgrid/"><em>Lexgrid</em></a> feels like something from an alternate universe. It’s sort of like a word search crossed with a crossword puzzle. In each level you’re tasked with finding a series of words in a grid of letters. The twist is you are given a clue as to what the word is you need to find, instead of the word itself. Complicating things even further is that the clues can mean different things; as you progress, you’ll uncover different symbols, each of which has a particular meaning. One might require you to find the opposite of the clue word, another will have you seeking out a synonym. They’re kind of like modifiers for words.</p><p>The symbols get more complex and strange the further you go, but the really tricky part is that you get no actual instructions. Instead, you have to figure it all out on your own. This is both the best and worst part of <em>Lexgrid</em>; it feels incredible when you solve a particularly obscure puzzle, but there were plenty of times I found myself struggling. Thankfully, the game generally gives you multiple puzzles to solve at once, so you can bounce around whenever you’re stuck.</p><p><a href="https://play.date/games/togglebot/"><em>Togglebot</em></a>, meanwhile, reminds me of an even more lo-fi take on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/5/18526921/boxboy-boxgirl-review-nintendo-switch-puzzle-game">Nintendo’s <em>Boxboy</em> series</a>. You play as a little guy in a black-and-white world, and your job entirely is to flip some switches to get to the next level, where you flip some more switches. Those levels are bite-sized and limited to a single screen, but are still (almost always) very satisfying to solve.</p><p>You have a very limited array of options at your disposal; really, all you can do is push some boxes and switches around, and change color by entering into weird portals. These are important because you can only walk on squares when you are the opposite color. This simplicity in terms of both moves and mobility means the levels require a great deal of spatial awareness to solve, and for me at least, quite a bit of experimentation. Luckily there’s a rewind button that encourages you to try things out with no repercussions.</p><p>I also love <a href="https://play.date/games/what-time-is-it/"><em>What Time Is It?</em></a> Few games have such a perfectly descriptive title. It’s like a puzzle book where each page is a single image, and from that you have to determine the time of day. It could be a string of numbers, or a bunch of playing cards, or maybe even just a single word. And from there you have to work out what time it is. There is a hint system, but for the most part it’s just you staring at an image and trying to determine what it’s telling you. Inputting the time means turning the Playdate’s crank to adjust a watch, which is a fun twist, and the 50 included puzzles can be solved in any order you want. Which is good, because some of these are <em>tough</em>. But again, that makes your eventual victory all the more gratifying.</p><p>There are plenty of other examples if you browse <a href="https://itch.io/games/tag-playdate">Itch.io</a> or <a href="https://play.date/games/">the Catalog shop</a>. All to say that if you own a Playdate, you can very easily turn it into the place to get your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle fix</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/811497/playdate-puzzle-game-reviews-lexgrid-togglebot-what-time-is-it]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty games are notorious for intruding on your storage space. Black Ops 7 is the biggest and latest CoD title to make its mark on the series, and its early preload details and file size guidelines might be known already.</p>



<p>There have been so many conversations about Black Ops 7 that it’s hard to keep up. The topics of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skill-based-matchmaking-sbmm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skill-Based Matchmaking</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One Roadmap</a> are just two of many. But its potential file size and preload details are another we have to talk about, and while information is limited right now, it might be good news! </p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-preload-date-amp-file-sizes-could-have-you-smiling">Black Ops 7 Preload Date &amp; File Sizes Could Have You Smiling</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pointing us in the right direction, are you Activision? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Game Size</a>, you can start preloading Black Ops 7 from November 9 at 10 AM PT—making this a full five days before the game’s full November launch.</p>



<p>The page does say that multiple details here are subject to change, so bear this in mind, but PlayStation Game Size is usually very accurate when it comes to these details. </p>



<p>If so, here’s a quick look at when you can expect to preload Black Ops 7 in your region.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Black Ops 7 Preload Times</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">6 PM—November 9</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Standard Time (AST)</td><td data-align="center">5 AM—November 10</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Also, while it’s only the PlayStation 4 file sizes that have been noted for now, there’s every chance this could translate to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>



<p>Here’s a look at the latest details on the game’s file sizes:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Campaign</strong>: 11.9 GB</li>



<li><strong>Multiplayer</strong>: 11.6 GB</li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong>: 320 MB</li>
</ul>



<p>This would be very generous and useful, especially if you have Warzone installed as well. We’ll keep you updated on any changes to the preload or file sizes.</p>

<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 is often hailed as one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a timeless classic (or a modern classic, at least) that allowed players to explore an expansive, emotional, and immersive story at the end of the Old West, a time when outlaws were being… Well, <em>outlawed</em>.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser admitted that Red Dead Redemption 2 almost fell flat and ‘wasn’t coming together’ because it was so over budget and behind schedule that everyone started doubting the project.</p>



<h2 id="h-red-dead-almost-died">Red Dead Almost Died</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with Lex Fridman (a three-hour interview!), Dan Houser opened up about all things Rockstar Games and beyond, addressing his tenure with the legendary studio and what happened to him after he resigned from the firm in 2020.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>One segment led to Houser and Fridman talking about Red Dead Redemption 2, the 2018 open-world epic that blew everyone’s hair back with intense realism, granular detail, and an incredible story and cast.</p>



<p>Even though the end product was a phenomenal game that won awards and remains a top-selling title today, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the cowboy caper. Dan Houser revealed to Fridman that Red Dead Redemption 2 <strong>was almost </strong>in trouble:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think with Red Dead 2, we were behind schedule. We were over budget so much I didn’t want to think about it.</p>



<p>And you’re making a game about a cowboy dying of TB, and the game’s not coming together. Turns out a lot of people doubt you at that moment, you know, it’s not that fun. I think that was a lot of pressure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Houser took a moment to praise his old team, stressing that what they did to deliver Red Dead Redemption 2 was nothing short of mythical. Even today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the most talked-about and widely appreciated games.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think that the West and all of the themes around the West really lend themselves to that. And then the gunplay was fantastic, and the horses were incredible. So I think you had this combination of technical know-how, a very, very strong team, and really strong material.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TGP</a> for the quotes)</em></p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been in the news recently as fans await an overhaul that brings it up to spec on current-gen consoles, including an update to allow to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-60-fps-update-arthur-morgan/">game to run at 60 FPS</a>.</p>

<p>Fans for years clung to the faint hope of Agent still being released by Rockstar Games. The Cold War shooter was set to expand on the company’s already stellar portfolio, but development stalled, and the game was officially canceled after 11 years.</p>



<p>It’s rare to hear either <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar Games</a> co-founder speak so candidly about the gaming empire they created. In a three-hour chat, one co-founder—Dan Houser—explained about the history of Rockstar, and the subject of Agent came up.</p>



<h2 id="h-agent-was-canceled-by-rockstar-games-because-it-wouldn-t-work">Agent Was Canceled By Rockstar Games Because It ‘Wouldn’t Work’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Deep and honest. Credit to Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484</figcaption></figure>



<p>Dan Houser sat down with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@lexfridman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lex Fridman</a> and opened up on a wide variety of Rockstar-related topics and answered some of the most burning questions we’ve all had for years.</p>



<p>Arguably, the one that got away for Rockstar Games was Agent. First teased in 2007, Agent was set in the 1970s—during the Cold War—and you were to play a spy, getting embroiled in the deep-seated political world tensions at the time.</p>



<p>It was formally announced in 2009, but that’s about all we got for the next 10 years. Houser explained in the Fridman interview why Agent never panned out:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We worked a lot on multiple iterations of an open-world spy game, and it never came together. Agent had about five different iterations. I don’t think it works, I concluded. I keep thinking about it sometimes, I lie in bed thinking about it, and I’ve concluded: What makes them really good as film stories makes them not work as video games, or I need to think through how to do it a different way as a video game.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Interestingly, Houser explained that the public perception of the game’s 70s Cold War setting was only one version of Agent.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That was one of the versions. There was another that was set in current [times]…we had so many different versions of this game, we worked on it with so many different teams.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>After further explanation, Houser concluded with an interesting statement: “I question if you can make a good, open-world spy game.” </p>



<p>You can check out the video below, and it automatically plays from the moment Dan opens up on Agent.</p>

<iframe title="Dan Houser: GTA, Red Dead Redemption, Rockstar, Absurd &amp; Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast #484" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o3gbXDjNWyI?start=6998&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It does bring up a good point. The closest thing in recent memory is a game that’s not even out yet—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/007-first-light-theme-song-lana-del-rey-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">007 First Light</a>. IO Interactive’s spy thriller isn’t an open-world game, but it does feature semi-open sections. This could play into Houser’s point even more, that there’s an obvious disconnect between an open-world game and the serious, race-against-time narrative a spy thriller usually tells.</p>



<p>Do you think Dan Houser is right? Was Rockstar’s goal for Agent too ambitious? Is it too late for Rockstar or Houser’s new company (Absurd Ventures) to give it another go?

<p>ARC Raiders isn’t safe from cheaters or hackers, and most games aren’t. There’s a chance you could have some of your inventory stolen or taken through nefarious or illegal means at any point. If this happens, Embark Studios has your back with lost items in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>Finding and losing items is part of the extraction shooter formula. You win some, you lose some—that’s how it goes. But there’s an ick when you lose hard-earned goods to cheaters. It can happen, and people are more than happy to extort your efforts for their own gain. </p>



<p>However, if it does happen in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-review-refreshing-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, you should automatically get your stuff back.</p>

<figure><figcaption>The chicken, well, Embark, has spoken. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>As shown by <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Radar</a> (via u/Jfourmes), if you’re targeted by a hacker, your items will be returned.</p>



<p>“Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you! They’re now available for you to claim and take with you on your next journey Topside. We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages. Thank you for being part of this mission! Together, we’re building ARC Raiders into a fair and fun experience for everyone,” says the official in-game message.</p>



<p>We did some digging into the original <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> post, and it seems the original user didn’t report the cheater or submit a report; it was an automatic message from the devs informing them of what had happened.</p>



<p>It’s also unclear what constitutes “unfair play.” Still, we imagine anything pertaining to cheating, hacking, or items being stolen that shouldn’t ordinarily be allowed to be taken falls under this umbrella.</p>



<figure></figure>

You can let everyone know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Sidekicks Customization Explained—All Permanent & Non-Permanent Choices]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekicks-customization-explained/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sidekicks are finally coming to Fortnite after months of speculation, giving players pets to accompany them across all game modes, but there are some specific customization choices that are permanent.</p>



<p>The first Sidekick is coming in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons Battle Pass</a>, with additional Sidekicks being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added to the Item Shop from November 7</a>, and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-sidekick-leak-shows-prices-will-be-the-same-as-collab-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked prices indicate they will cost around the same as a Collab Skin</a>.</p>



<p>With a high price and restrictions to some customizations, Sidekicks have caused a stir in the community, and we have all the details on the customization rules.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-permanent">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Permanent?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big additions. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Each Fortnite Sidekick has a one-time customization changes to their appearance that are applied before you can equip the item.</strong></p>



<p>These are the major customization choices with each Sidekick, impacting the base colours, any color accents, or major features, like the style of ears, body size, and similar. The final permanent choice is the name for a Sidekick.</p>



<p>Once locked in, these choices are permanent and cannot be adjusted. However, you can purchase the same Sidekick again and make a fresh style, though this, of course, incurs the cost of splashing out on the same item.</p>



<p>This is a big difference to The Mandalorian Warrior outfit, for example, which allows for constant cosmetic changes and the ability to save different appearances in your loadout. </p>



<p>Understandably, there has been some backlash to the permanence of some of the big customization choices for Sidekicks, and it remains to be seen whether Epic Games change their approach, or add a purchaseable item that allows you to edit a Sidekick again. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-fortnite-sidekick-customizations-are-repeatable">What Fortnite Sidekick Customizations Are Repeatable?</h2>



<p><strong>Not all customization choices for your Sidekick in Fortnite are permanent, with additional accessories and some cosmetics being freely available to change.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer for Fortnite Sidekicks</a>, a screen showing editable Styles offers a tease of what will be freely interchangeable with Sidekicks, with the example being clothing for a dog. In the video, two styles are shown, each with a different color and look.</p>



<p>Based on this, it’s expected that style choices for accessories like clothing, collars, and similar attire will all be able to be changed as many times as you want. What isn’t clear, however, is how you will gain access to these items, and whether there will be a deep supply of them.</p>



<p>As the amount of Sidekicks in Fortnite grows though, expect more customization options for attire to be added.</p>

		<p>It’s pinch, punch, first of the month time, and since it’s November, I hope you managed to survive last night with only treats and no tricks. Thankfully my supply of sweets was just enough to survive the glut of kids of all ages knocking on our door, so I didn’t have to break into my <em>actual</em> stash of sweets to appease the last kids in the final crowd that knocked.</p>
<p>But now that we’re free from this terror, what’s on the agenda for this weekend? Perhaps some ARC Raiders? Maybe avoiding the Battlefield battle royale? Perhaps some Football Managering?</p>

<p>Fortnite fanatics with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership had the blow of price increases to the service softened with the announcement Fortnite Crew was being added as a perk, and we’ve got all the details of when that comes into effect.</p>



<p>Price rises for Xbox Game Pass subscriptions caused a stir last month, rising <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-raising-game-pass-ultimate-price-by-50-and-changing-tier-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as much as 50% in some cases</a>, though it was also announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-battle-passes-will-now-be-included-in-xbox-game-pass-ultimate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Crew would be included</a> in some memberships.</p>



<p>The wait for that perk to come into effect continues, however, and if you’re wondering exactly when Fortnite Crew is added to a subscription, particularly with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-the-simpsons-battle-price-all-rewards-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Simpsons-themed Battle Pass</a> landing, we can tell you the exact release date for the bonus perk.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-fortnite-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">When Is Fortnite Coming to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New bonus. Image via Microsoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew will be included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate memberships from November 18, 2025, Epic Games has confirmed.</strong></p>



<p>Announced as part of the pricing structure changes to the Game Pass service in October, Fortnite Crew is being added as an additional perk for subscribers to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>



<p>The inclusion was not immediate, however, and players are still waiting for this bonus to be unlocked—but it’s on the horizon, with the perk adding to memberships from November 18, as stated by an <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/billing-and-payment-c-202300000001723/fortnite-crew-availability-with-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-a202300000020476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games blog post</a>.</p>



<p>No additional cost will be added to the monthly Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription price, though the previously announced price rises are in effect, but the bonus will soften the blow for Fortnite players.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-included-in-fortnite-crew">What’s Included in Fortnite Crew?</h2>



<p><strong>Fortnite Crew membership includes full access to all the Battle Passes added in Fortnite across all modes, with a total of four passes in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The main Battle Pass, OG Battle Pass, Festival Pass, and LEGO Pass are all included in the membership, along with the Rocket Pass Premium in Rocket League.</p>



<p>Additional bonuses include 1,000 V-Bucks every month, available to spend on cosmetics in the Item Shop, and an exclusive monthly Crew Pack that provides a new Outfit alongside a matching accessory—a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote.</p>

<p>Chapter 6 in Fortnite is rapidly approaching a conclusion but, before the big jump into Chapter 7, a mini-season themed around The Simpsons is taking center stage, with a new Battle Pass to enjoy.</p>



<p>Kicking off with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-simpsons-live-event-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live event on November 1</a>, The Simpsons takeover of Fortnite will see a smaller map brought onto the scene, representing Springfield, with lobby sizes in battle royale reduced from 100 to 80 as a result.</p>



<p>There’s also the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-announces-return-of-companions-with-new-sidekicks-arriving-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduction of Sidekicks</a>, Fortnite’s new pets feature, and the Battle Pass is stacked full of Simpsons goodies.</p>

<p><strong>The Simpsons Battle Pass in Fortnite costs 1,000 V-Bucks to unlock, though it’s also available as part of a Fortnite Crew subscription.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a cheaper price than usual Battle Passes in Fortnite, due to the shorter duration of the season and fewer rewards, but there’s still plenty to sink your teeth into. 1,000 V-Bucks are purchasable for a base price of $8.99, though you may be able to find cheaper codes and better value for money if you purchase a larger amount.</p>



<p>Remember, Fortnite Crew will also be included with an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription starting from November 18, so don’t splash out twice if you have a membership!</p>

<h2 id="h-is-the-fortnite-x-the-simpsons-battle-pass-worth-it">Is The Fortnite x The Simpsons Battle Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>For fans of The Simpsons, the Fortnite Battle Pass is certainly one of the best in a long while and highlights just how great Epic Games’ creativity is.</strong></p>



<p>With appearances of fan-favorite characters Ned Flanders, Marge Simpson, and Homer Simpson, alongside an abundance of fun easter eggs and references with Emotes, Pickaxes, and Back Blings, The Simpsons Battle Pass is worth every dollar.</p>



<p>On top of that, the Battle Pass includes a return of 900 V-Bucks, plus potentially more when the bonus rewards are revealed later this month, so you’ll pretty much get your money back in V-Bucks that can be spent on other Simpsons items in the shop.</p>
