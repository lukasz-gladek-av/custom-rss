		<p>EA has released a new deep dive for EA Sports FC 26, with the video expanding on what we saw in the announcement trailer which was the changes to the gameplay. That includes the competitive and authentic gameplay styles, which leads into how things will proceed on the pitch. You can check out the full details in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Every aspect of gameplay has been addressed for FC 26 including dribbling, pace, passing,<br>
tackling, shooting, goalkeeping, and physicality. There have also been things removed from this entry including agile dribbling, and timed finishing. Some of the updates that EA mentions are specifically for current generation consoles and not the previous generation. One of those updates is dynamic dribbling with animations refined to take into account player height, the distance between the ball and player when they are dribbling. The jog speed of dribbling has also been increased. Movement has been overhauled so players are more agile and do not feel as heavy as in previous games. Within this there are other acceleration types including explosive, controlled and lengthy. For explosive and lengthy player attributes are key, and are broken down as follows:</p>
<p>● Explosive<br>
○ Agility minimum 65<br>
○ (Agility – Strength) &gt;= 10<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 80<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height maximum 182cm (~6’0”)<br>
■ Female height maximum 162cm (~5’4”)</p>
<p>● Lengthy<br>
○ Strength minimum 65<br>
○ (Strength – Agility) &gt;= 4<br>
○ Acceleration minimum 40<br>
○ Height has been separated between male and female players<br>
■ Male height minimum 183 cm (~6’1”)<br>
■ Female height minimum 164cm (~5’5”)</p>

<p>Controlled is for those players that do not meet the above criteria. Goalkeepers have also been reworked so they are more responsive, position themselves better, and are better to play as. One key element for goalkeepers is the use of machine learning in Reinforcement Learning goalkeeper positioning. EA states, <em>“This new system uses machine learning to help AI-controlled goalkeepers make more realistic decisions about where to position themselves in the box. By analyzing countless scenarios, the AI can now better cut down angles and react to different types of attacks while adjusting their position more intelligently. It’s important to note that RL Positioning is only active in certain situations, and is only used to position the Goalkeeper. The system is not active when making a save or </em><br>
<em>performing a catch.”</em></p>
<p>Passing is going to be more fluid as the animations have been improved so players can pass in wider angles, and first touch animations will be improved to. Through passes have been overhauled too, with the receivers better selected for ground and through passes. Lob passes will see the ball go into areas where there are fewer obstructions as well. With shooting, angles have been refined too so there are wider angles to fire from. Attacking and defensive movement has been addressed in FC 26 so player positioning is more fluid, with players more likely to remain onside too. When defending players will man mark when attacks are occurring near the goal.</p>
<p>There are a lot of changes coming to EA Sports FC 26, which has been needed after FC 25 failed to bring any significant changes following FC 24. EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-gameplay-deep-dive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-promises-to-deliver-on-players%E2%80%99-demands-to-%E2%80%9Cmake-gameplay-better%E2%80%9D-in-ea-sports-fc-26.1250139/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-release-date-gameplay-reveal/">full gameplay reveal</a> for EA Sports FC 26 last week, EA followed it up with a gameplay deep-dive today.</p>



<p>Today's gameplay deep-dive starts out confident, as EA proclaims that its focus this year has been to respond to a request, or more accurately, a demand from players, to "<em>make gameplay better</em>." The entire gameplay experience is getting an overhaul, and EA promises that this year's gameplay is "<em>responsive, rewarding, and powered by your feedback</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0GE8YCIQF2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One of the biggest changes, is that there are now two gameplay presets for players to choose from, Competitive and Authentic mode. Competitive is the preset that'll be attached to the online game modes like Football Ultimate Team and Clubs, and focus more on responsive player movement and player control for a more competitive game feel.</p>



<p>Authentic mode is what you'll be preset to for offline game modes, like manager mode and player career, and lean more towards a realistic gameplay experience. Within these two new presets are also a refinement of gameplay fundamentals like tackling, pace, passing, saves, player physicality, shooting, agility - essentially, every element of gameplay has been touched up, or changed in a significant way.</p>



<p>"<em>Responsiveness, consistency, and control</em>" are the three pillars on which the Competitive gameplay preset is built, while Authentic gameplay is the simulation-style gameplay. While offline and online modes will have their presets, you'll still be able to swap between Competitive and Authentic to suit your preferred gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Regarding the gameplay fundamental changes, EA went through common complaints that players have, and went through what they changed in EA Sports FC 26 to fix the issues players are having. Some examples boiled down to gameplay producer Paul Parsons, who was narrating the video, reading off a complaint before claiming "<em>we made it better</em>" this time around, but it at least represents EA is trying to fix certain pain points with the game that players have been nudging EA to fix for years.</p>



<p>We'll see if EA is actually delivering on these big promises when EA Sports FC 26 arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC, on September 26, 2025.</p>

What seemed like a straightforward experiment <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidturners.tcgs.co/post/3lukqyijn3c2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidturners.tcgs.co/post/3lukqyijn3c2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went off the rails</a></span>. The bottle of spray paint he purchased wasn’t quite the warm, egg yolk yellow of the retro Nintendo cartridges. Then, he had to slice open the plastic to get the actual cartridge part with the game installed on it out. Then, he spray painted the plastic just to have it blow away under the force. </p><p>The final result was a messy but unmistakably yellow copy of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. It was a crude attempt, but one that almost inspired me to break my own cardinal rule of never mimicking stuff you see on TikTok. Then the Kong paw curled around Gardner’s knew creation: It wouldn’t fit in his Switch 2. At least not at first. </p><p>I guess he jammed it in or something, because he returned yesterday with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung/video/7529281718205910286?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gardnerhartung/video/7529281718205910286?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new video</a></span> showing him trying and failing to remove <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>from his Switch 2. “The internet was clowning on me cause I decided to paint my Donkey Kong yellow and now it is absolutely stuck,” he said. Metal pliers seemed like the answer, but all they did was scratch up the new paint job and break off a piece of the plastic. “Again I’m chilling because I’ve been playing the game for a while but again I’d love your suggestions” he implored his viewers.</p><p>Instead of offering help, the internet continued to Monday morning quarterback the situation. “Shoulda 3d printed a new yellow shell or something for the cart instead,” one person wrote. Another chided Gardner for failing to sand the plastic before applying the paint for a smooth and better adhering coat. The most helpful responses were just people telling him to send it into Nintendo for an official repair. But the prognosis could be grim. </p><p>“The crazy thing is that the switch 2 cartridge reader isn’t a removable it’s a part of the motherboard,” one user noted. “So you can’t even get a new one to take it out at a repair shop.” Even if Gardner never gets to play another physical game in his Switch 2 ever again, he’ll at least have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@joshstatix/video/7529723624954072350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joshstatix/video/7529723624954072350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his own personal DK rap tribute</a></span> from fellow TikToker Joshstatix: “Ruined the cartridge, brought his console to shame, he’s sprayin’ paint like it’s an art class flex but now the game won’t boot it’s just an error text.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-yellow-spray-paint-cart-1851786727]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The indie game Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 billed itself as a sequel to a fictitious franchise. Now Strange Scaffold has teamed up with newcomer Pedalboard Games to produce a sequel, kind of, which is positioned as a remastered version of the first game in the series, which never actually existed until now. It's coming in September.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830150/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_1_ReRaptored/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored</a>, you'll play as Jack Briar, an ATF agent dispatched to the Louisiana bayou to investigate strange dinosaur happenings. The game looks very similar to the original CRDM3 that released in April, albeit with new protagonist. The original game was a story-based match-3 metroidvania, which meant you would explore different story avenues and play match-3 battles to progress. This looks similar, as Jack Briar will earn new traits by exploring and use those to unlock paths. CRDM3 was also a cheeky commentary on game development itself, so we can probably expect that to continue.</p><p>Strange Scaffold produced the first game, but new studio Pedalboard Games is developing ReRaptored. This marks the beginning of Strange Scaffold's "Project Share" program, which allows new studios to access the original code and riff on their concepts. Strange Scaffold's Xalavier Nelson Jr. explained the philosophy behind the move on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lukkwvqj4k2r" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>.</p><p>"Video games is the only medium outside of music that can take the exact same component pieces and by modifying them and switching around their context, end up creating a new, valid, exciting artistic expression," he said. "And you can see this in the modding world, but not in traditional commercial video game development."</p><p>So Strange Scaffold sent the tools to Pedalboard Games under the care of original co-lead Colin McInerney, letting that team quickly iterate on the project and make a new game out of it.</p><p>"We don't intend to do a Project Share very often at Strange Scaffold, but we hope that by doing it at all and being so open about it that it empowers and encourages other developers to investigate ways to, in radical methods that aren't incentivized by capitalism, share resources with each other, and survive, and get games in players' hands more quickly, and at a higher quality than would otherwise be possible, in a way that's more sustainable, for all of our sakes."</p><p>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116510/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, and Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 1: ReRaptored is coming September 23.</p>

		<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate is no longer going to be released on September 5th, Reef Entertainment and Bitmap Bureau have announced. Instead, the new release date will be October 31st due to a couple of reasons. The main reason is that there has been a delay in manufacturing the physical copies of Terminator 2D: No Fate, and the second is that the extended window allows for additional development of the game.</p>

<p>In a statement, Reef Entertainment wrote, <em>“Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025. Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game. We apologise, and thank you for bearing with us. This delay will also give the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself and we would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of Terminator 2D: NO FATE together. As such, this delay will apply to both physical and digital versions of the game.</em></p>
<p><em>From the moment we announced Terminator 2D: NO FATE, the response has been absolutely amazing and truly humbling.So, to all of you, thank you so much for your support. We know that this news is disappointing and we appreciate your understanding. We are dedicated to delivering the best release possible for Terminator 2D: NO FATE, and we look forward to sharing more of the game with you soon.”</em></p>

<p>Terminator 2D: No Fate will be available for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC.</p>

<p>The very fabric of puzzling</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Thunderful Publishing and Sad Owl Games have announced that their acclaimed 2023 puzzler, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a></strong>, will be coming to Switch consoles this winter, although they haven't gone as far as to give us a specific release date.</p>
<p>You can check out the game's trailer above for a little taste of its exquisite flavours, and we can tell you that this one really is quite the get for Switch fans. It's currently sitting pretty on a whopping Metacritic score of 86, and is an effort that's wowed across the board with its clever approach to puzzling and the twisting of its players' realities.</p>

<p>Here's some further details about the game from the official press blurb:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a BAFTA and UKIE Video Game Awards 2024 winner, <em><strong>Viewfinder</strong></em> immerses players in a mind-bending first-person puzzle adventure that brings pictures to life by placing them into the world. Players will embark on an unforgettable story that digs deeper into the ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change and overcoming loss. Viewfinder is currently available on PC and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Key gameplay features include:</p>
<p><strong>Reshape Reality</strong> – Players can bring photographs, paintings, sketches, screenshots and postcards to life while reshaping the world and uncovering what the founders left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Exploration is Learning</strong> – Players will learn the secrets of the world, the reason why it exists and the freedom to create by exploring multiple hub worlds that are all cohesive and encompass similar, but complex, differences.</p>
<p><strong>Endless Experiences</strong> – Viewfinder’s narrative is player driven, featuring an approachable experience for players who just want to solve puzzles, and a rich well thought off world for those who want to learn more</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wildgate, the PvP shooter that goes between ship-to-ship battle and boots-on-the-ground first-person shooting from Dreamhaven, a team made up of former Blizzard developers is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>



<p>The studio debuted a new trailer for the game alongside the launch, which shows off more gameplay and the Sea of Thieves-like gameplay with a sci-fi setting that Wildgate features.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Wildgate | Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lDcX7Kf_gTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The launch also came with a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3504780/view/530978642895831122?l=english">development blog</a> with patch notes and changes to the game based on feedback from players who had checked it out in open beta format, ahead of the full launch. </p>



<p>The patch notes include changes to player cards, and the introduction of new methods of progression, including an Infamy System, Streaks, and Milestones. It also includes the announcement of a new game mode, changes to ship balancing like updates to the health, design, and interactions between ships. There were also weapon, equipment, and loot updates, as well as balances to the combat overall, like adjusting the respawn time to 16 seconds for dying outside your ship and 12 seconds for dying on your ship.</p>



<p>Then there were also user interface changes, quality of life updates, and of course, several bug fixes to help make the launch run smoothly.</p>



<p>"<em>The response to Wildgate's open beta was incredible,</em>" said co-founder of Dreamhaven and chief executive officer Mike Morhaime, in a<a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2025/07/22/wildgate-the-crew-based-space-shooter-from-dreamhaven-and-moonshot-games-available-now/"> press release</a>. "<em>It was truly inspiring to see so many players teaming up, jumping in, and having fun. Wildgate represents what Dreamhaven believes games can be: rich, imaginative, and deeply engaging. We're just beginning to open the gate to a galaxy full of wonder, strategy, and discovery, and we hope the game resonates with players of all kinds</em>."</p>



<p>When<a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-first-look-and-hands-on-a-sci-fi-sea-of-thieves-by-former-blizzard-devs/"> Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo checked out Wildgate</a> earlier this year in March, he wrote "<em>The game definitely shows a lot of promise. I do feel there's more that could be done to improve PvE encounters, perhaps with bosses and the like. It would be especially useful if PvE-only modes were eventually to be added. Still, the game already has a solid core that could entice a lot of players to quickly jump in with their friends and have fun</em>."</p>



<p>Now that the game is out for everyone, hopefully it's able to live up to that promise.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/supermassive-games">Supermassive Games</a>, best known for developing the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/until-dawn">Until Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-pictures">The Dark Pictures</a> Anthology, have announced they've begun the consultation process for a round of redundancies that'll affect "up to 36" staff. As part of this, sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Directive 8020 has had its release delayed to early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Supermassive have confirmed that the development of puzzler <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a> hasn't been affected by these job cuts, with that game still being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-little-nightmares-3-is-out-this-october-reanimal-still-looks-much-better">on track to come out October 10th</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement posted to social media, the studio blamed these layoffs on a need to "better align" with the games industry being "a challenging and ever-evolving environment", whatever that means.</p>
<p>"This decision was not taken lightly, and we know this will be an incredibly difficult time for everyone. Our absolute priority will be to offer full support to all those affected," Supermassive wrote, "We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026. The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans."</p> <div>

<p>This latest round at layoffs follow the studio reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-announce-layoffs-with-150-jobs-reportedly-at-risk">laying off around 90 workers in February 2024</a>, citing similar reasoning to that which they've employed here in a social post that looked pretty similar too.</p>
<p>Directive 8020, a standalone entry in The Dark Pictures Anthology, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dark-pictures-anthology-directive-8020s-teaser-trailer-has-leaked">first leaked back in 2022</a>. Supermassive pencilled in a 2025 release for it as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassives-next-dark-pictures-horror-game-directive-2080-is-out-2025-and-looks-like-alien-meets-the-thing">a proper announcement last summer</a>, which showed off a game the very much looked like it'd be putting the phrase 'in space, no one can hear you scream' to the test. It's all about a colony ship called Cassiopeia crash landing on a planet and its crew then having further bad times as they're hunted down by an alien organism in true Xenomorphy fashion.</p>
<p>"Earth is dying and humanity is running out of time," reads the first line of Directive 8020's blurb, which I wish didn't vaguely feel like it unintentionally reflects the mood in the games industry right now.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/until-dawn-devs-supermassive-lay-off-up-to-36-workers-delay-interstellar-horror-directive-8020]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">After weeks of dry restocks, Target has the Nintendo Switch 2 available again (for now). Both the standard console and the Mario Kart World Bundle are back up for order (while supplies last), giving anyone who missed out at launch a rare shot to pick one up at retail price. Target’s listings aren’t behind a waitlist like Amazon’s invitation system either. Over in the world of Pokémon, the Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box has dropped to $102.94 on Amazon, undercutting TCGPlayer’s listing by over $10. That’s a solid deal in the middle of Pokémania 2025, especially for sealed collectors or someone who needs that Illustration Rare Team Rocket’s Wobbuffet promo.</p><div catalogid="e3df206f-2b99-4347-afac-38395c81c6ca" id="225564"><div id="225564" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Students and Teachers Can Save 57% Off the Adobe Creative Cloud Pro Bundle</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>The Creative Cloud Pro bundle includes 20+ apps, including Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, Premiere Pro, and more for just $29.99 per month (normally $69.99).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out today's best offers, collectors can lock in a preorder for the Tamashii Nations Cyclops S.H.Figuarts figure at $100, complete with multiple optic blast effects and poseable parts straight from the GAMERVERSE. Small Soldiers fans can relive ‘90s chaos with the new 4K Steelbook edition for $25.99, while Firefly diehards get a definitive version of Serenity in its 20th Anniversary 4K Steelbook for $29.96, loaded with extras. And if you're tired of throwing money at canned air, the RELIDOL 100000RPM Electric Air Duster is just $27.99 today, offering powerful cordless cleaning that pays for itself fast.</p></div><p id="destined-rivals-elite-trainer-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box">Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225515"><div id="225515" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Destined Rivals Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now down to $102.94, beating TCG Players' price of $114.99 plus postage.

Not only is the Black Bolt ETB vastly undercutting the secondary market, Paradox Rift ETB is even cheaper (And an overlooked set in my opinion, stock up now). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's other great deals on ex boxes too, which are also near MSRP and around the same or just under listings on TCG Player. The sealed market is becoming more competitive, so it's more important than ever to give eBay a quick check before hitting buy.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Nintendo Switch 2 Stock Updates</h2></p><div catalogid="e7c6732a-ef4d-47d3-8a5e-d382139346bf" id="225579"><div id="225579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Switch 2 - Mario Kart World Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In a shocking move, Target is selling both Nintendo Switch 2 SKUs without preorders, waiting lists or raffles, so snap them up quickly.

It includes my favorite one,  Hyrule Historia, that fills in more than a few gaps in the LoZ lore, although the timeline has already been slightly retconned. It also includes full and expanded official guides for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">KRK Kreate Powered Studio Monitors</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can personally guarantee a set of powered studio monitors will sound better than almost any sound system with or without a subwoofer. The new line of KRK Kreate studio monitors aren't just for recording music (Although they'd do an amazing job), they're a versatile sound option for content creation, editing, gaming, watching TV and movies and more. Buyers can even teather to them via Bluetooth for no fuss connections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I've been using the 8-inch speaker models for a couple of weeks now, and they destory my soundbar and subwoofer combo that cost's nearly double the price of these. There's precision adjustments knobs on the back, which I keep mostly in neutral with volume up by half for a crisp flat sound with the right amount of bass. Although that can be cranked up when needed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally I use an audio splitter so my Krate 8s can handle my Nano QuadCortex guitar amp moddler, my TV audio and gaming PC audio for the best experience. For me, going from a 3-inch to 8-inch speaker option is night and day. The clarity difference and range is top-tier, not to mention the jack, XLR and aux outputs available on each monitor that fits in perfectly in everyone's setup. You're getting top-of-the-range brand quality without the "gaming" brand tax, it's a win-win.</p><p id="apple-airpods-pro-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Apple AirPods Pro 2">Apple AirPods Pro 2</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225530"><div id="225530" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Apple AirPods Pro 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">AirPods Pro 2 are one of those earbuds I keep noticing for their mix of sound quality and thoughtful features. At $199, they offer a strong balance of value and performance. The active noise cancellation blocks out a lot of background noise while adaptive audio automatically adjusts based on your surroundings. You get four sizes of silicone tips for a customizable fit, and once those are set they stay comfortable even through longer listening sessions. The personalized spatial audio and hearing aid features add extra depth, giving them more flexibility than just a standard pair of wireless earbuds.</p></div><p id="iniu-portable-charger-10000mah-45w"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W">INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h2></p><div catalogid="04ac607f-8252-4021-86e9-9a8593559093" id="225531"><div id="225531" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>INIU Portable Charger 10000mAh 45W</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is ideal for carrying around when you've forgot to stick your phone on charge overnight, 45W is more than enough power to charge anything whilst using it, from phones to Nintendo Switch 2.

The cuts follow an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-developer-supermassive-games-plans-to-lay-off-around-90-workers">earlier round of redundancies in March 2024</a>, when the developer said it would shed around 90 workers in a similarly-worded statement.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Supermassive previously stated it had around 350 employees as of 2023, meaning it has laid off around a third of the studio over the past 18 months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We remain focused on our upcoming projects and have made the decision to move the launch of Directive 8020 to the first half of 2026," Supermassive said. "The response to the game so far has been fantastic, and this additional time will help us deliver the very best experience for our fans. We're deeply grateful for the patience and support of our community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A standalone entry in Supermassive's Dark Pictures Anthology, Directive 8020 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/supermassive-6-more-dark-pictures-anthology-games-planned">one of a list of apparently-upcoming entries in the series</a> spotted back in early 2022. The game was then <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-and-the-quarry-developers-next-game-is-a-sci-fi-horror">made official later that year</a>, in a trailer included at the end of The Dark Pictures: The Devil In Me. Three years on, however, and fans are still waiting to play it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A statement from Supermassive Games. <a href="https://t.co/Vom1CSGYGs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Vom1CSGYGs</a></p>— Supermassive Games (@SuperMGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperMGames/status/1947650822768132211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Dark Pictures Anthology kicked off in 2019 with spooky boat mystery Man of Medan, before 2020 historical horror Little Hope, and then 2021's Iraq-set House of Ashes. Next up was the murder hotel-inspired The Devil in Me in 2022, before then the virtual reality spin-off Switchback VR a year later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, progress on further entries in the series appears to have slowed, with Directive 8020 now set to arrive at least three years after the franchise's previous entry, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/directive-8020-might-give-the-dark-pictures-saga-a-massive-upgrade">positioned as a more standalone title</a>. Supermassive has said it has used the extra time to improve the franchise's gameplay, though links to previous games — such as via the mysterious recurring character of the Curator — sound like they'll be played down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Supermassive will continue working on its delayed Little Nightmares 3, currently set to launch on October 10. Development on this project is unaffected by today's layoffs, the studio has confirmed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Rest For The Wicked Is Brutal And Ambitious, But A Little Confused | Early Access Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>In a social media post, Mahler clarified his statement further, explaining that Moon Studios is looking to eventually "ship on all platforms," and on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/no-rest-for-the-wicked-may-be-skipping-xbox-due-to-market-conditions-update-dev-reply-added-to-op.1686511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NeoGAF forum</a>, he mentioned that optimization for PS5 was easier in comparison to Xbox Series X|S. For a small developer like Moon Studios, this simply made more economic sense for the studio to focus on that platform, Mahler explained.</p><p>"We'll first support the platform that has the most users purely out of resource reasons," Mahler wrote. "We're a comparatively small indie studio, so doing a console port at the quality level we want is not a small task. Porting to Xbox means porting to Xbox Series X and Series S, and that'll take more time to optimize compared to porting to PS5 and PS5 Pro. So we're most likely going to do PS5 [and ] PS5 Pro first and launch there in order to make fans happy and supply other ports later. So there's nothing to see here; it's just common sense with us having to make the right moves given the resources we have while making sure we give players what they want as fast as possible."</p><p>Moon Studios wouldn't be the first developer to bring its game to PS5 first and Xbox Series X|S later, and data released last year suggested that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-has-outsold-xbox-series-x-s-2-to-1-newly-revealed-sales-data-suggests/1100-6520964/" data-ref-id="1100-6520964">PS5 may have outsold the Xbox Series X|S</a> by roughly a 2:1 margin. That divide may have increased further since then, as Sony recently confirmed that it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/over-4-years-later-ps5-has-more-monthly-users-than-ps4/1100-6532430/" data-ref-id="1100-6532430">49 million monthly users on PS5</a> as of April 30, 2024.</p><p>Microsoft remains cagey with exact figures related to its Xbox Series X|S console, and over the last couple of months, it has adopted a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">this is an Xbox</a>" multiplatform strategy that has seen more of its formerly exclusive games released on PS5. It has also teamed up with Asus to make an<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245"> Xbox-branded handheld gaming PC</a>.</p>

This limited-time event is only playable during certain times, but if you happen to catch it and play through a full set of rounds, you can earn some very valuable loot.</p><p>The Sieve is a three-person cooperative activity based in and around the Caldera, the main hub area on Kepler. It is only active for thirty minutes and then has a 1 hour and 44 minute cooldown, meaning that you'll need to be patient or lucky to hop in at the right time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920" data-ratio="0.56260575296108" data-width="2364" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4535920"></a><figcaption>When it goes live, you can boot into the activity from this icon on the Kepler map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4535920-85fe9d76-a754-417d-943e-e2402e8b9501_1_102_o.jpeg"></figure><p>If you do launch into it, you'll be matchmade with a Fireteam to take on a series of tasks oriented narratively around the Drifter's mining rig. You'll need to place beacons for Drifter to mine dark matter from around the Caldera, and your Fireteam will need to fend off waves of enemies, including difficult sabotage Minotaurs that can shut down the mining operation for an extended period of time.</p><p>If you successfully complete the mining activity, you are granted rewards and are given the opportunity to start another activity. These are usually oriented around bosses, but the type and strength of the boss varies randomly. After killing the boss, you'll get some more rewards and can start another mining rig defense run.</p><p>Fireteams can go through this back-and-forth cadence for several iterations. Occasionally, you'll get a special one-off event of banking motes (like Gambit) which appears to grant even more valuable rewards. I've reached this point once and didn't get any Exotics, but reports from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1m3dy1b/the_sieve_drops_exotics_you_dont_own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Destiny community</a> suggest that you can get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-destiny-2-edge-of-fate-expansions-new-exotic-armor-does/1100-6532685/" data-ref-id="1100-6532685">the new Exotic armor piece for each class</a> from The Sieve--rather than the "normal" path of acquiring the armor by grinding through the Legendary campaign.</p><p>In addition to being a fun and extremely chaotic change of pace from the normal Destiny gameplay loop, The Sieve is also a required step on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-the-destiny-2-graviton-spike-exotic-hand-cannon/1100-6533185/" data-ref-id="1100-6533185">the Exotic questline to acquire Graviton Spike</a>. After doing the exploration steps throughout Kepler, you'll need to finish a round of The Sieve to finally nab the cool Arc-Void hand cannon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-closed-beta-september-vi</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/2xko-closed-beta-coming-in-september-new-champion-vi-revealed.1250055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced that its&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year, and a new champion has been announced for the roster as well.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/game-updates/2xko-closedbeta-announcement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the game's official website, <i>2XKO</i>'s closed beta begins on September 9th, and Riot says that once the beta is online, its "goal is to keep the game online, outside of any necessary maintenance". That means there won't be any downtime; once you're in, you're in.</p>

<p>However, this does also mean that&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s closed beta will only be available for PC, so if you're hoping to check the game out on consoles, you'll have to wait a while, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ny8DU7MY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-closed-beta-vi-illaoi.jpg?itok=Ijwjn5Pd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is getting a closed beta later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The silver lining here, however, is that&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>will support cross-progression, so if you get started in the closed beta on PC, you'll still be able to transfer whatever progress you make to your preferred version when it launches.</p>

<p>To get a chance to check out the closed beta, you can <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/beta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up here</a>. If you participated in either of&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s Alpha Lab tests, then you're already signed up for the closed beta and you can just wait for your confirmation email.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the closed beta, Riot also revealed a new champion for the game's roster in the form of the Piltover enforcer Vi. Given that she fights with a massive pair of gauntlets, she's pretty much a no-brainer for&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>.</p>

<p>Vi's trailer reveals her to be a powerful and fearsome combatant, and her design looks like it's somewhere in between the original&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>look and the newer&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>aesthetic. You can check out her trailer here.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>is, it's a&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>&nbsp;fighting game that features champions from the MOBA's roster duking it out in two-on-two combat.</p>

<p>Originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" rel="nofollow">designated&nbsp;<em>Project L</em></a>, the game was subsequently renamed to&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">in February last year</a>. It doesn't have a release date yet, but its PC closed beta begins on September 9th, and it's also set to land on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S when it launches in full.</p>

            <p>If I'm interpreting the press materials for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gossamer-matrix">Gossamer Matrix</a> correctly, this is an FPS in which you might accidentally stuff a chocolate bar into your AK47 while trying to reload. The result will not be a fusillade of chocodrops. Instead, you will be gunned down like the miserable office slob you absolutely are. So keep your workspace tidy, chief.</p>
<p>I'm looking at my desk as I type these words. It contains: a piece of paper with "gel" written on it, purpose unknown; a stolen Cafe Nero mug, never cleaned; Vikram Chandra's memoir Geek Sublime; and a bag of raisins. I do not own a gun, because this is the UK and one of the UK's few advantages is that the vast majority of people don't own guns, but if I did own a six-shooter and were lured into a gunfight right now, I guarantee I'd be stuffing raisins into the chamber while choking to death on my own bullets.</p><!--more-->

<p>Which is hopefully the kind of doofiness that will make Gossamer Matrix fun. In this, gloriously non-widescreen and Haribo-coloured arcade shooter from catmilk, you are a security guard tasked with rescuing your company's board members from the invading forces of Mallow Corp. To do this you must wrangle with a "physics-based interaction scheme" that obliges you to load guns by dragging bullets onto them and yanking at their bits. All the while managing a screenful of other stuff that has minimal ballistic potential.</p>
<p>It's hard to get a clear sense of things in the absence of a demo, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2002840/Gossamer_Matrix/">the Steam page</a> fills in the picture somewhat. "Things can quickly get overwhelming if you don't take the time to keep your workspace clean," it notes. "Empty magazines, candy wrappers, and dirty syringes will crowd your vision and obstruct your pockets if not disposed of properly, and being distracted on the clock is not a luxury you can afford."</p>
<p>This looks and sounds like a hoot and a holler. I now consider games with dedicated reloading buttons desperately quaint. If you're wondering where you've come across this before, it turns out Alice0 (RPS in peace) listed it as one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-101-most-anticipated-games-of-2023">most anticipated games of 2023</a>. That was before I started at RPS, mind you, a period popularly known as the "Bozo's Interval", so I feel no shame about posting the game again.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-acid-bright-office-shooter-gossamer-matrix-you-have-to-reload-while-managing-a-deskful-of-junk]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> reimagines the <em>Pac-Man </em>franchise in the darkest and weirdest way you could possibly expect, but it manages to be a hell of a good time nonetheless. Whether you’re someone who loves anything starring the little yellow pellet-muncher, or just want a challenging Metroidvania to sink your teeth into, this one should be right up your alley. You’ve got quite a journey ahead, but the first few hours can be a lot to take in, so here are four tips to help you acclimate to <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196646,196215" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h420432"><a id=""></a>Take it slow and steady</h2><p><em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> is a surprisingly tough Metroidvania with a lot of traversal between checkpoints, so surviving the powerful foes and dangerous environments takes patience and precision. Take your time and consider your next move when approaching groups of enemies or hazardous obstacles. You can even move your camera around to survey the vicinity when needed. </p><figure id="" data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-recommend-id="image://5cf321d3a581ffc4e6a57a45c07a0322" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And make sure you explore each area thoroughly, too, as there are tons of well-hidden secrets to find. You’ll sometimes even find that the environment is hiding secret pathways that are only revealed when you come in contact with it. Sneaky!</p><h2 id="h420433"><a id=""></a>Always be chompin’</h2><p>One of <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>’s most unique mechanics is Devour. By pressing in on the right stick, you can pick up and eat enemies after you kill them. Doing so will fill up your GAIA meter (more on that below) and reward you with materials you can trade for useful perks (stylized as PERKs in the game). So, yeah, you’ll want to be doing this <em>constantly</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-recommend-id="image://609dc41de7b12481e9be1454950694d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dead enemies will disappear if you don’t Devour them quickly, so make sure you’re consistently jamming that right stick to grab ‘em up and toss ‘em down your gullet. Luckily, you can pick up multiple dead enemies at once, making things slightly less tedious when dealing with groups. </p><h2 id="h420434"><a id=""></a>Save GAIA for bosses to make quick work of them</h2><p>As you eat enemies and fill up your GAIA meter, you can eventually transform into GAIA, allowing you to dish out huge damage while taking none yourself. You’ll occasionally need to use this to traverse through otherwise impassable environmental spots, but otherwise, I’d really recommend you save it for bosses. At least early in the game, transforming into GAIA trivializes foes that might otherwise take a while to kill. I mean, I obliterated this stupid bear boss in the picture below so quickly I didn’t really even see its moveset. </p><figure id="" data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-recommend-id="image://e8d99f15ec8f3358ab4179b9cae4be2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And as I mentioned above, <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> often has quite a bit of ground to cover to reach checkpoints. So, if you don’t want to have to make the long trek back to a boss, it’s probably best to use everything at your disposal to get past it. That being said, if you feel GAIA makes things too easy, go at it the swordfighter way. It’s your game — play it however you want.</p><h2 id="h420435"><a id=""></a>For the&nbsp;love of god, manually control PUCK</h2><p>You’ll spend a lot of time riding D-Lines as PUCK in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em>. These segments function like on-rails Pac-Man levels, and they often require a significant amount of twitchy movement to overcome. As such, you’ll want to be sure you’re being as precise as possible and really thinking through how to handle D-Line movement.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-recommend-id="image://ed6cf6c0d4d591d98a383fa739617371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By default, PUCK will automatically move in whichever direction you’ve recently faced it. You can brake by using the right trigger on your controller, but due to the constant hazards in your way during D-Line rides, I’d really recommend switching to manual control. By pressing the left bumper on your controller, you can take full control over when and how PUCK moves. It’s so much better.</p><hr><p>Now that you know to do, get PUCKin’ in <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/shadow-labyrinth-tips-pluck-manual-eat-gaia-1851786714]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Obsidian has expressed a strong interest for game preservation to Eurogamer while talking about whether Grounded 2 will usurp and replace Grounded 1 when it arrives in early access at the end of July.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview, executive producer Marcus Morgan told me: "We actually have this strong passion to ensure our games can stand the test of time and keep updating through history." He pointed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ten-years-after-its-launch-pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode">the surprise patch Obsidian released for 10-year-old isometric role-playing game Pillars of Eternity</a>, earlier this year, as proof. "There's a strong desire on our side to make sure that our games are preserved," he said.</p>
<p>"Now, are we going to be doing content and these story expansions to Grounded 1?" he added. "No, that's the continuation of Grounded 2. But even as recently as April we released our [update] 1.4.7 to Grounded 1, so there's a maintenance and a desire that that game will always exist. So we'll keep that up; it's not going anywhere if people still want to play Grounded 1 as well.</p>
<p>"But we are, in terms of where we're moving the story, where we're expanding things: if you want more Grounded, we'll be more into Grounded 2 versus Grounded 1. We're pushing things forward with Grounded 2."</p>

<p>Morgan's comments reference a bigger problem games face where if their servers are taken offline, they effectively cease to exist. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-beleaguered-multiplayer-shooter-anthem-shutting-down-next-year">EA recently announced it would switch the Anthem servers off</a>, for example, and when that happens, no one will be able to play the game. Anthem will, for all intents and purposes, disappear.</p>
<p>It's become such a problem that an anti-closure movement has sprung up in response, called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stop-killing-games-proposals-for-game-preservation-prohibitively-expensive-major-publishers-insist">Stop Killing Games</a>, and its petition has amassed hundreds of thousands, potentially more than a million, signatures of support. It seeks to ensure publishers leave their games in a playable state after official support is pulled.</p>
<p>Grounded theoretically falls into the at-risk category by being multiplayer, it being built on the idea of co-operative survival in a back garden world, as an inch-high teenager. But there's a crucial difference that potentially future-proofs it.</p>

<p>Morgan explained: "One of the things that we did in terms of how we structured Grounded is multiplayer is done through peer-to-peer, which in first blush, feels antiquated versus dedicated servers. But we were able to blend that with shared worlds, and what that does is it allows you, effectively, a cloud save that you can share with your friends. So it gives that experience of being able to have a more dedicated server vibe, but it doesn't have that same requirement of actually having servers.</p>
<p>"And this is no commentary on the Stop Killing Games stuff or anything like that," he added. "More to say it does establish [Grounded 1] so it can exist into the future a lot easier than if you're on the other side, where you are more of a server-based game."</p>
<p>Grounded 2 releases in early access on 29th July. The sequel introduces mounts and moves the action from a backyard world into a larger space called Brookhollow Park, introducing new biomes, deeper systems and gameplay with it. I'm currently playing the sequel but can't say anything more until the day it comes out. Pop back then.</p>
