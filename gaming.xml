			<p>Arco is about consequences. In it’s unique setting of the Mesoamerican frontier at the turn of the century, small choices can cause huge aftershocks. Some of that manifests in the story-telling, as you follow a dour journey of revenge, regret, and colonisation’s cruel effects on a native population. In other ways, those consequences manifest through combat, exploration, and seemingly simple conversations with other NPCs. All those elements come together to create not only a mechanically sound and well designed game experience, but an evocative one that challenged not only my tactics prowess, but my moral compass too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Arco Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oft1Mwob7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arco is a western revenge story, but told from the perspective of the native peoples who so rarely get the spotlight in traditional spaghetti westerns and cowboy fantasies. Over five acts, you play as different characters with roots in various native tribes spread across the the land. You initially control a young Iyo boy named Tecolotl, who’s part of a family making their pilgrimage to The Sacred Tree to leave offerings. As the family makes their journey and goes about their usual habits of running errands and dealing with wildlife, though, mysterious people with ill intentions begin to appear near The Sacred Tree. As the tension these Newcomers bring simmers and boils before coming to a head, the story changes focus to a new character, but that undercurrent of a growing invasive threat remains throughout the duration of the game.</p>


<p>As act two opens, your perspective shifts to that of Tizo, a grizzled wanderer seeking out an old friend for some work. That one innocent job quickly escalates into a blood-soaked investigation into Newcomers who have been razing and looting native tribes all over – and Tizo takes up the task to deal with them permanently. Other protagonists follow in the next couple of acts, each with their own origins and goals. Each story that Arco tells is equally poetic and well-written, but each one establishes very different kinds of characters going on very different journeys. This makes it all the more rewarding when all of those journeys come together in the final act, and the way these various story threads link and feed into each other is so satisfying to see.</p>


<p>Across each of these acts in <em>Arco, </em>you’ll be digging into a blend of point-and-click exploration, dialogue-choice interactions, and incredibly unique real-time turn-based combat encounters. Each screen you explore in <em>Arco </em>is beautifully rendered in rich minimalist pixel-art, but those pixels can hide unexpected encounters and secret items depending on where you click. Some of these encounters will involve interacting with other characters, and the choices you make in these moments can have a lot of results – from losing HP after failing to de-escalate a confrontation to unlocking a hidden fight after getting a little too nosy about an overturned cart full of food. In some cases, having additional characters in your crew can even contribute to how well you do in these moments – in Act Two, I had a well-traveled hunter in my party who immediately recognized the tribe that some mysterious figures approaching us belonged to, and sternly instructed me not to wave to them, saving us from an unnecessary culture-offense and difficult battle.</p>
<p>Often, though, battles are inevitable. And frequently, they are incredibly difficult. Fights in <em>Arco </em>are a blend of fast-paced bullet-dodging and tactical decision making that will never give you an easy way out. Your goal in combat is to use your time while the action is frozen to predict where enemy attacks will land, position yourself to avoid them, and dish out attacks of your own based on where you think the enemies will be once the next turn plays out. Once your decisions are locked in, time resumes for a few moments as every character moves and attacks and you get to see how accurate your predictions were. It’s kind of a bite-sized strategy game where positioning is your ultimate resource and your biggest threat – some stages have hazards or traps, and ghosts will frequently come at you while you’re making mid-turn choices to deal damage to you if you take too long.</p>

<p>Almost every battle in <em>Arco </em>will have your brain firing on all cylinders to not only get through it alive, but with enough HP and resources remaining to ensure you’re capable of surviving the <em>next </em>battle that’s just around the corner. Resource management is just as much of a struggle as the battles themselves, and the scarcity of health and supplies really smartly feeds into the storytelling of a Mesoamerican people struggling to survive on the changing landscape of their once-familiar frontier. Arco so smartly blends all of these parts together, and the struggles of a difficult combat encounter or a punishing dialogue decision feel intertwined with the narrative struggles of your protagonists. It’s a strategically sad game, and punishing in all the right ways.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch.999261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will be updated post-launch with a cooperative multiplayer mode. The rumor <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Tom Henderson</a>, who has proven to be very reliable regarding Ubisoft games. According to Henderson, the mode is currently codenamed LEAGUE and was in development even before the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent delay</a>.</p>
<p>The insider did not provide any further details on the mode, although he underlined that this won't be the online cooperative multiplayer experience coming to the franchise. <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Invictus</a>, which is supposed to be a dedicated multiplayer game, is due to launch next year as well. However, early leaks point to Invictus being a completely different experience from your regular Assassin's Creed game. According to <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1837577668365373935" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaker xJ0nathan</a>, players will compete in multiple rounds and modes, including a team deathmatch, a free-for-all, and a speed game where they have to get to glowing points scattered around the map. As they go through the rounds, players can select different powers to create a build. The gameplay is said to be arcade-style, featuring elements like a bubble shield similar to Super Smash Bros and a distant camera. Maps will be based on areas from previous Assassin's Creed games, and the only known playable characters so far are Ezio and Cesare Borgia.</p>
<p>As for Assassin's Creed Shadows, as mentioned above, the game was delayed from November 15, 2024 to February 18, 2025 in order to improve its polish and avoid the same fate of Star Wars Outlaws. According to Henderson, Ubisoft is also attempting to improve several cultural and historical concerns that were raised by fans, mainly surrounding the figure of Yasuke (who is, however, not going to be removed), but also some architectural details. Needless to say, a lot of Ubisoft's future hinges on the success of Assassin's Creed Shadows, especially after several less-than-successful game launches.</p>

            <p>Where's your asthma inhaler? Is it in your hand? Good, because you need it to stay alive in this horror game about getting stalked through metro stations by a tall creep that nobody else on the platform can perceive. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crowded-followed">Crowded Followed</a> is basically a playable <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/">It Follows</a>, the 2014 horror movie and overt metaphor for sexually transmitted disease. Only this time the slow but unstoppable entity is following you because you picked up a mysterious briefcase from a dying man in an alleyway. I thought I told you to stop accepting random bloodsoaked objects from strange men? Quit it! Anyway, there's a demo for it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948790/CROWDED_FOLLOWED/">on Steam</a> if you like.</p>

<p>As you can see, that big lady is not stopping. The game sees players pushing past people who step in the way, scraping around for small change (to buy a ticket to get through a subway barrier), and slurping on that inhaler to keep a stamina meter up. Looks like the goal is definitely to channel the anxiety of a crowded space.  </p>
<p>It's coming out on October 24th, just in time for spooksday, and is being made by Night Dial, a Belfast-based horror developer (as you can maybe tell by the accent of dying alleyway man in the trailer). It features a scene that has you fast-walking your way through a riot in the streets, making this the second game release in one month that features the armoured police Land Rovers of Northern Ireland (the other being bicycle courier comedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parcel-corps">Parcel Corps</a>). </p><p>There's also a bit where you push through a crowded nightclub to escape your paranormal pursuer, and if you look up and listen to the DJ, you'll realise it's Irish chiptune musician Chipzel, the artist who did the music for reflex-testing rhythm game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/super-hexagon">Super Hexagon</a> and dice-rolling roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dicey-dungeons">Dicey Dungeons</a>. This is a lot of Northern Ireland packed into one small space. Please, I need to get through. Excuse me, excuse me. Beep beep.</p>
<p>The game normally has two full stops in its name - Crowded. Followed. - but as with skateboarding sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a>, I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skate-heelflips-into-my-calendar-with-an-early-access-release-some-time-in-2025">refuse to adopt such punctuation</a> in game titles. It makes it hard to write sensible headlines. Please, we have trouble enough as it is with all the colons.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this isn't the only recent short-form horror game set in an unsettling subterranean train station. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> is set in Shinjuku station in Tokyo, and is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-exit-8-perfectly-captures-the-surreal-horror-of-navigating-a-busy-tube-station">alternately wacky and frightening</a>. And upcoming PS1-style horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> is set partially in London's tube. In real life, Ireland doesn't have a subway - it barely has functioning overground rail. But as a Norn Irelander who has survived the underground transport networks of London and Montreal, I can confirm that Montreal's is marginally scarier, mostly because of all the wet floors in winter. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It might not have been sitting in pride of place on your esports calendar, but the HCS World Championship tournament kicks off tomorrow in Seattle, Washington. This monumental esports event boasts a $1 million prize pool and will offer a grand stage upon which the most capable competitors in Halo history will compete for the trophy.</p>



<p>Last year, it was FaZe Clan that stood victorious in Seattle, having beaten OpTic Gaming in a dominant grand final fixture. The team went on to then win the London Major in June, but the squad <strong>is not </strong>the favourite to win the HCS World Championship.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-back-to-back">Back to Back to Back</h2>



<p>As the Halo World Championship rolls in, high expectations are surfacing for Spacestation Gaming. Earlier this year, the squad made history with back-to-back Major wins, securing the top spot in both Atlanta and Salt Lake City. It has been a stunning year for the team, and the belief is that SSG is the number-one contender for the championship.</p>



<p>But that’s if OpTic Gaming doesn’t have something to say.</p>



<p>The OpTic squad, fronted by the legendary esports pro player, FormaL, has been one of the hungriest teams in Halo history since the HCS started back up in 2021. Here’s a summary of the squad’s most recent wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>HCS NA Super ($45,000)</li>



<li>Orlando Major 2022 ($140,000)</li>



<li>Halo World Championship 2022 ($400,000)</li>



<li>Charlotte Kickoff Major 2023 ($100,000)</li>



<li>Fort Worth Major 2023 ($100,000)</li>



<li><em>Halo World Championship 2023 – 2nd Place Honorable Mention ($220,000)</em></li>
</ul>



<p>It has been a trialling year for the OpTic team, though. Since the 2024 season kicked off, the squad has picked up <strong>five </strong>second-place finishes, falling to SSG <strong>twice </strong>in the Major circuit. It’s not for a lack of trying, though.</p>



<p>The Halo World Championship 2024 tournament promises to be an exciting event that’ll unravel over just three days in Seattle, Washington. From October 4 to October 6, these teams will compete through a Pool Play round before breaking into the Championship Bracket, with a best-of-seven grand final awaiting the potential victors.</p>



<p>This is the biggest event in the Halo esports calendar – are you looking forward to it? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-1007-update-raunchy/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade%E2%80%99s-1-007-update-has-made-the-game-even-raunchier.999228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-1007-update-raunchy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Fans have started uploading comparison clips that showcase the changes made in Stellar Blade’s 1.007 update. The latest patch to hit the platform has made the game ‘sexier’, with ShiftUp focusing on physics that make outfits more revealing, as well as fine-tweaking how Eve’s breasts move with certain actions.</p>



<p>It has been dubbed the most important update for a game to ever be delivered, and it’s all in anticipation of photomode being added to the post-apocalyptic, action-fuelled romp.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-turning-it-up-to-11">Turning It Up To 11</h2>



<p>Stellar Blade never needed any help in the lasciviousness department – the slew of hyper-revealing outfits and the protagonist built around the body of a real-world Korean model ticked that box just fine. However, several months after the game hit the market, ShiftUp has taken things one step further.</p>



<p>In the below clip, you can see how certain changes have impacted Eve. With the addition of wind physics, certain outfits are ‘blown out of the way’ to get a closer glimpse at her behind, and when she leans into the camera, her arms boost her bosom to immeasurable levels:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Best Update Ever! Before &amp; After Comparison | Stellar Blade 1.007 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9H0yVKKS_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>One fan labelled Eve ‘the most beautiful video game character ever’, and many have stressed that this update, however superficial, is enough to bring them back to the game almost six months after it was released. </p>



<p>Other changes and additions have been made in the recent update, though. For instance, players can now place pins on the map and restock their inventory in a much more intuitive way, and prompts have been added to stop players from spending all their money at once – which I did on numerous occasions.</p>



<p>Soon, Stellar Blade is getting a crossover event with Nier: Automata, which is sure to turn these elements up to <strong>12</strong>. That’s a level that shouldn’t exist. Let’s wait and see what happens.</p>



<p><em>Stellar Blade’s 1.007 update is available now exclusively on PlayStation 5.</em></p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans, rejoice – Valve has finally pushed out an update after several weeks of dead silence. Now, Counter-Strike 2 fans, despair! The update is centred around a battle pass system that doesn’t add much substance to the game and has already drawn negative sentiments from the CS2 community.</p>



<p>‘The Armory’ adds more than 100 items, a slew of weapon skins, brand-new gun charms, and a hot new case, but everything is ‘locked’ behind a battle pass structure that requires some serious grinding.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-armory-in-cs2">What is The Armory in CS2?</h2>



<p>The Armory is a repository of new content in Counter-Strike 2, released by Valve in a major update published on October 3. The content in said repository is only accessible through the ‘Armory Pass’ system, which will require players to spend $16 on a pass. You can go above and beyond and purchase up to <strong>five </strong>Armory Passes, progressing through them all at once to maximise your gains.</p>



<p>When you’ve got an Armory Pass (or five), you’ll earn Armory Credits, which can be used to purchase the exclusive items in The Armory.</p>



<p>Items are expected to rotate in The Armory, and some items, such as the Heat Treated Desert Eagle that many fans have their hearts set on, are limited-time redemptions, so you’ll need to grind fast and hard to secure them. Unfortunately, it’s not a walk in the park, as many fans have criticised how long it’ll take to earn the credits needed to get anything ‘good’.</p>



<p>On Reddit, someone tested the pass and stressed that <strong>one </strong>Armory Pass earns around a ‘quarter of a credit’ for a 10-minute deathmatch, and it costs four credits for a collection skin.</p>



<p>There are more concerns, though.</p>



<p>The new Gun Charm system is pretty neat and it allows users to attach dangling charms wherever they want on the side of their weapon, but it costs $0.99 to<strong> remove </strong>the charms or switch them for something else.</p>



<p>There’s a substantial amount of content in The Armory update, but it’s mostly cosmetic. Outside of weapon charms shaped like sausages and FOMO skins that are locked behind a grind-wall, Valve has added new stickers, tweaked animations, and adjusted some quality-of-life aspects, addressing open concerns raised by the community.</p>



<p>The Armory update is available now in Counter-Strike 2. Do you think it’s a massive win for the community? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Red Barrels, the developer behind the psychological horror games Outlast and Outlast 2, has suffered what appears to be a major data breach, impacting the studio’s development work and employees.</p>



<p>The studio confirmed the cyber attack in a statement online on Wednesday.</p>



<p>“The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event, involving access to some of its data,” the studio said. “As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information contained therein.”</p>



<p>They continued: “A group of leading external cybersecurity experts has been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident. We also notified stakeholders potentially affected by the event and the relevant authorities.”</p>



<p>Red Barrels says that the investigation into the matter has been completed and the event is “contained”. Unfortunately, though, the company’s development plans have been negatively affected.</p>



<p>“The hit on our production timeline has been significant,” they said. “We will do our best to follow our roadmap but unfortunately, some things will have to be delayed. We’ll share a more detailed update on that as soon as we can.</p>



<p>“We take this event and the security of information within our care very seriously. Faced with a constantly evolving cyber threat, the studio will continue to implement appropriate measures guided by best practices to ensure a secure environment for our employees, partners and players.”</p>



<p>While Red Barrels didn’t detail what was hit in the data breach, Insider Gaming has learned about some of the data compromised. Based on the files sent, the perpetrators of the crime seem to have gotten access to various game source codes, game builds, human resource information, and even company credit card information. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming won’t publish the information sent from the breach, but it has been passed on to the proper authorities. As of writing, Red Barrels has made their social media accounts <a href="https://x.com/TheRedBarrels" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">protected</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite is officially bringing back Trio Cash Cups. The announcement comes as no surprise after the game had officially announced next year’s competitive mode would be trios. Here is everything you need to know about Trio Cash Cups in Fortnite, including the schedule and prizing.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-trio-cash-cup-schedule">Fortnite Trio Cash Cup Schedule</h2>



<p>Trio Cash Cups are set to begin relatively soon, happening every week with a decently sized prize pool. However, there are multiple regions around the world that will have Trio Cash Cups, making the schedule a bit confusing at times. The competition will begin on October 4, 2024, and stay that way for quite a while.</p>



<p>All Trio Cash Cups are set to take place on Fridays and Saturdays in all regions, with the first week’s Finals happening on Sunday.</p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-trio-cash-cup-prizing">Fortnite Trio Cash Cup Prizing</h2>



<p>The prizing varies across regions for the Trio Cash Cups in Forntite, with the top 25 in each region winning money. Here is the official prizing for each region.</p>

Set in a version of Tokyo that has been decimated by countless demons, this stylish adventure lets you explore the metropolitan wasteland and explore a dramatic tale of revenge. While you've got the power to stand against the Qadistu and their dark designs, you can improve your odds by recruiting demons to your side. It's kind of like Pokemon, but with more apocalyptic overtones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-rayasianboy-n-word-kai-cenat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rayasianboy/video/2263792530?filter=clips&amp;range=30d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent broadcast</a>, Rayasianboy, a Taiwanese Twitch streamer who’s close with current Twitch king Kai Cenat and who has over one million followers himself, <a href="https://x.com/nojumper/status/1840901909965914471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">divulged his greatest fear</a>: “Imagine saying the N-word, and your whole career's gone, bro. … Being a streamer, this is the hard part, bro. If you're not Black, bro, this is the hardest part of all time.”&nbsp;</p><p>In fairness to Rayasianboy, he was discussing this issue in the context of spending ample time around Cenat’s AMP crew, whose members are Black and who regularly use the N-word (not that that gives him a pass). He wasn’t just saying this in a vacuum. But in the past, non-Black streamers <a href="https://kotaku.com/top-twitch-streamer-ninja-rapped-a-slur-leading-to-a-f-1824157259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Tyler “Ninja” Blevins</a> have recovered from ill-advised slur slippages, and as it turns out, so has Rayasianboy.</p><p>A cursory Google search turns up numerous clips of Ray saying or seeming to say the N-word, both alongside friends like Cenat and in isolation. Some are pretty undeniable, like <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaicenat/clip/TiredCourteousAardvarkHumbleLife-9caOIT238eYkh-7H" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this moment from a few months ago</a> where Cenat said “bitch ass [N-word]” and then Ray immediately parroted it back, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P2a-OHY2PbU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another from 2023</a> in which he and Cenat sang a song together that contained the N-word. Others are less clear, like when Ray, whose first language is not English, didn’t even seem to recognize that he’d <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ktJbI9Nxpp0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pronounced parts of the word</a> during Cenat’s reverse-engineering of the Stanford Prison Experiment in 2023. In all these instances, Cenat laughed it off. Ray’s N-word usage has become enough of a meme among fans that they’ve <a href="https://m.twitch.tv/rayasianboy/clip/MagnificentSourNostrilOMGScoots-889zYIDfXa1TE-lC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused him of saying the word</a> even when he appears to be speaking his native language and using a phrase that just sounds similar to the N-word.</p><p>During the recent broadcast in which he voiced his concerns about the N-word, Ray jokingly almost said a word that sounded like the N-word before denying that he ever says it off stream and accusing viewers in chat of using it. Moments later, Ray <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxbNxnlrGqw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied to a video</a> in which Duke Dennis, an AMP member, called him “Ray-men Noodle” by coming up with racially-motivated jabs of his own including “Duke Fried Chicken,” “Duke Kool-Aid,” and “Watermelon Dennis.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, Ray’s career seems to be doing fine. Hope that clears things up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Starfield’s first major expansion was released in recent days, but it has been a less-than-stellar delivery that has left many fans with a sour taste in their mouths. Collectively, we’ve waited more than a year for the first expansion to be released by Bethesda Game Studios, but now that it’s here, fans have been quick to criticise it.</p>



<p>From low reviews to diehard fans voicing their disappointment on social media, and from a failure to gain traction on streaming platforms to a complete lack of hype for what comes next, Shattered Space has failed to soar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shattered-space-didn-t-turn-things-around">Shattered Space Didn’t Turn Things Around</h2>



<p>It was a few weeks ago that I put a question to the community: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-shattered-space-save/">‘Will Shattered Space save Starfield?’</a></p>



<p>I’d say the answer is up there in black and white now that we’ve had a couple of days to sit with the expansion.</p>



<p>On social media, fans have been seriously critical of the first major Starfield expansion, which at best offers a few meagre hours of entertainment plagued by the same issues that garnered mixed reviews for the base game over a year ago. Even prolific personalities and top-shelf creators have found plenty of problems with Shattered Space.</p>



<p>For instance:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>It took me 5 hours to finish Starfield Shattered Space's main story.</p><p>One of the most baffling story dlc's Bethesda has ever done. No where near the quality of Far Harbor. Feels more like cut content from the base game, a lengthy side quest. Very disappointed. <a href="https://t.co/BGBAkOv3SU">pic.twitter.com/BGBAkOv3SU</a></p></div>— Michael (@LegacyKillaHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/LegacyKillaHD/status/1841261735816081622?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Or how about a take from MrMattyPlays:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'll have my review out tomorrow, but to put it bluntly: </p><p>Starfield: Shattered Space is not good. At all.</p><p>The exploration is still (somehow) extremely lacking, the main story is ridiculously short, it ran like crap on Series X performance mode, there isn't any new companions,…</p></div>— MrMattyPlays (@G27Status) <a href="https://twitter.com/G27Status/status/1841383054381600863?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Also on Twitter, user Luke Stephens wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Finished Shattered Space, accidentally, in an afternoon. I thought there’d be a lot more, but the main story is VERY short. Simply, it’s more Starfield. The writing is painfully dry, the characters act like they don’t want to be here, and the lack of optimization is painful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the biggest issues is that users are comparing Shattered Space to expansions released for Fallout 4 and Skyrim. It’s not even a fair contest at that point – some expansions, such as Skyrim’s Dragonborn DLC or Fallout 4’s Nuka-World, offered a huge amount of gameplay and plenty to explore, but Shattered Space doesn’t come close.</p>



<p>In the light of these impressive expansions, Shattered Space couldn’t ever put up a fair fight.</p>



<p>Another issue is that it took so long to deliver Shattered Space. It’s tough to see what took so long to piece this together, especially as updates for Starfield have been relatively few and far between over the last year. It took Bethesda Game Studios almost a year to add <strong>a rover </strong>to the game.</p>



<p>To throw another figure into the mix, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2721670/Starfield__Shattered_Space/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shattered Space’s Steam reviews</a> are currently sitting at 58% negative, with many users complaining that it’s too expensive for what you’re getting.</p>



<h2 id="h-even-the-playing-star-field">Even The Playing (Star)Field</h2>



<p>To give a little credit to Shattered Space, it’s not <strong>all </strong>bad. On <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/starfield-shattered-space/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Metacritic</a>, some positive reviews have been secured by the expansion. For example, XboxEra gave the expansion a score of 9/10, stressing that the DLC is an ‘adventure you do not want to miss.’ Elsewhere, GAMINGbible gave the expansion an 8/10.</p>



<p>It kind of goes downhill from there, though – aside from some glowing community reviews from genuine players.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Looking at the numbers, Starfield didn’t exactly move mountains when Shattered Space was released. For instance, on streaming platforms, there wasn’t much growth at all. The game went from a peak viewer count of around 12,000 to just 38,000 on Twitch, and by today, that number has almost reset to where it was a week ago. </p>



<p>It’s a <strong>bit </strong>of an unfair comparison, but Elden Ring’s first expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, was released a few months back. That took peaks from around 30,000 – 40,000 to more than 400,000 users. When Destiny 2’s The Final Shape expansion dropped in June, the viewer count went from floating around 10,000 to 250,000 in a matter of hours.</p>



<p>Given the numbers that Starfield secured at launch, both in terms of sales and viewership, it comes as a dramatic surprise that Shattered Space has performed so badly one year later.</p>



<p>Starfield was a flash in the pan. It was dropped by many players mere weeks after it had been released, and even the ‘unique endgame mechanic’ failed to impress gamers. </p>



<p>From bizarre and boring NPCs to unforgettable factions, and rinse-and-repeat environments to a slew of bugs and performance issues, Starfield might have blasted off well in those first few days, but it broke up short of punching through the stratosphere, and that’s such a shame.</p>

Apparently, other people they showed it to also thought it was “really cool” and some suggested it could be used for “networking” or to “make funny videos.” However, thankfully, someone also mentioned to them how incredibly dangerous this tech could be in the wrong hands. “Some dude could just find some girl’s home address on the train and just follow them home,” said Nguyen.</p><p>As pointed out by <em>404 Media</em>, this kind of smart-glasses-facial-scanning tech has been around for a few years now. But Google and Facebook, two companies who were working on it, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/technology/google-facebook-facial-recognition.html?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/09/technology/google-facebook-facial-recognition.html?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eventually decided to not release their software</a></span>. </p><p>But you don’t need big tech resources and money to build your own <em>Watch Dogs</em> super glasses that can instantly dox anyone you meet on the street.

That info is then used to scrape the web for phone numbers, other photos, family information, and addresses. </p><p> “We would show people photos of them from kindergarten, and they had never even seen the photo before,” said Ardayfio. “Most people were surprised by how much data they have online.” One time, they were able to show a stranger their mom’s phone number after simply scanning their face. </p><p> “I think people could definitely take [the idea of I-XRAY] and run with it,” Ardayfio said. “If people do run with this idea, I think that’s really bad.

            <p>
Crow Country, the acclaimed PS1-inspired survival horror adventure from Snipperclips developer SFB Games, is bringing its retro scares to PS4 and Switch on 16th October.
</p>
<p>
Crow Country - which launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S in May - catapults players back to 1990 and the titular theme park of Edward Crow, a man who disappeared in mysterious circumstances two years prior. "Don’t be deceived by the whimsical surroundings," teases SFB, "something is awfully wrong in Crow Country."
</p>
<p>
Discovering what that something might be is precisely the task at hand as players, in the role of Special Agent Mara Forest, explore the theme park and investigate its long-abandoned rides, solving puzzles and riddles, chatting with the park's strange inhabitants, and battling the strikingly monstrous creatures roaming its confines.

<p>
And for those who'd rather focus on the mystery of Crow Country's story and its engaging puzzling, rather than dealing with the stress of its (slightly rubbish) combat, there's also a comparatively more tranquil Exploration Mode.
</p>
<p>
"Stuffed with silly jokes, relatable one-liners, and a self-aware irreverence that's surprisingly refreshing," Eurogamer's Vikki Blake wrote in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crow-country-review">four star review</a> back in May, "Crow Country doesn't take itself too seriously. Yes, it packs in many of the tropes and conventions so associated with old-school horror, but it's not afraid to poke a little fun at them from time to time, too. Mara is at once both befuddling and beguiling, and a perfect companion as, together, you try to piece this puzzling mystery together."
</p>
<p>
And if a cheerful slab of clever retro-inspired horror sounds like just the ticket as spooky season gets underway, Crow Country will be available for Switch and PS4 on October 16th.

                <p>The Lego Nintendo Entertainment System set is a lot of fun to build and looks great as a retro display piece, but it's also quite pricey.

Plus, even at full price, the NES and CRT TV model set is often sold out.

For the past two years, the Lego NES has remained at its $270 price--when it's available to purchase at all.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-are-available-digitally<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Recently, Games Workshop announced a new edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000-kill-team" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em></a>. This update to the skirmish-based spin-off game will begin proper with the release of the <em>Hivestorm</em> starter box. But for fans who already have their main team, Games Workshop has released updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules for free on their app.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/xfV8vUOg/download-the-kill-team-app-and-faction-rules-today/">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop went into detail about the updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules. It opens with them putting the game into perspective. There are 33 playable factions in this smaller scale <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> spin-off game, available through boxed sets and issues of White Dwarf.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-app-image.jpg?itok=fZS-HFNs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-kill-team-faction-rules-app-image.jpg?itok=FPqfvMWM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Since a new edition means these factions are getting a rebalance. Every one from the Novitiates to the Blades of Khaine to the Hunter Clade have gotten buffs and nerfs. Even the new <em>HIvestorm</em> factions, the Tempestous Aquilons and Vespid Stingwings, are included.</p>
<p>In addition, the updated <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> faction rules.are available through a newly launched <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em>. The app is available on iOS and Android platforms. It supports English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will allow players to download <em>Kill Team</em> Lite rules,updated faction rules, and print and share reference information straight from the app.</p>
<p>The app will also contain universal equipment rules. It contains the latest tactical information about ladders, barricades, grenades, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> app isn't a total replacement for the core rulebook or new faction books. If you want the full experience, you will need to pick up the new books or the new <em>Hivestorm</em> boxed set.</p>
<p>According to our official review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>HIvestorm</em></a> boxed set, the newest edition of <em>Warhammer 40,000 Kill Team</em> does a good job streamlining the rules. This includes simplifying movement and defense, as well as implementing a new Counteract action. It even includes a new solo/coop mode called Joint Ops.</p>

And interestingly, Xbox wants to hear from all devs, even those not working on Xbox games. </p><p>“If you are making video games, we’re interested in hearing from you,” said Dr. Deborah Hendersen, a principal user researcher for Xbox. “If you aren’t on Xbox, we’d love to know why.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-co-op-mode-is-in-development.999033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-assassins-creed-shadows-co-op-mode/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently has a co-op mode in development, which is scheduled to release post-launch.</p>



<p>The new co-op game mode, codenamed LEAGUE, is under development at Ubisoft but doesn’t have a set release date due to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s recent postponement</a>, which is affecting the entire Assassin’s Creed pipeline. However, sources tell me that LEAGUE was in development long before the postponement and that this wasn’t an addition because of the delay. </p>



<p>While specific details on what the game mode actually entails are slim, presumably, the co-op mode will see Naoe and Yasuke fight side-by-side, using their different combat abilities to take out enemies. </p>



<p>That isn’t the only multiplayer Assassin’s Creed experience to hit players’ hands within the next 18 months, either. It’s understood that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-invictus-will-be-a-fall-guys-like-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Invictus</a>, a fully-fledged multiplayer experience, will come in 2025. </p>



<p>Other Assassin’s Creed games in development include an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake under the code name Obsidian and Codename Hexe, which has been described as “the darkest Assassin’s Creed to date”.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, Insider Gaming reported on behind-the-scenes details on what happened with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows delay</a>.</p>

There are numerous pictures of him posing next to classic arcade games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/history-of-awesome-arcade-1982-history">Donkey Kong, Missile Command, and Space Invaders</a>, and he's been involved in various video game-related projects over the years, including directing the film adaptation of Ready Player One.</p><p>But while many adults lose their passion for gaming as the grow older, Spielberg is apparently still at it. There's just one thing: he doesn't like controllers.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/02/spielberg-arcade-1727894756903.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Steven Spielberg with the Maneater arcade game in 1975. Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"He loves story games and I'm always trying to get him to play Uncharted because it's Indiana Jones and I'm like, 'Hey, you'd appreciate this.' But he's like, 'I can't do controllers. I can only do keyboard and mouse,'" said his son Max Spielberg, himself a game developer, in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoDqKVExzkU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with MinnMax</a>.</p><p>His aversion is apparently strong enough that when Spielberg's son showed off his game, a co-op roguelite published by Dreamhaven, he had to be the one demo it because his father wouldn't pick up the controller. Hey, at least Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves has mouse and keyboard support on Steam, right?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's always a Call of Duty. He loves Call of Duty. He plays the story campaign</p></div><p>In any event, Max says that gaming is a big point of bonding between the two. "He loves gaming. He's the one who got me into it. He plays games. He's a big PC gamer. So that's kind of our bonding point as well. He's like, 'Hey, what's good? What Call of Duty should I be playing? Send me a list of the top five shooters and I'll get them downloaded, then we can play them together when you come over to the house."</p><p>He adds, "It's always a Call of Duty. He loves Call of Duty. He plays the story campaign."</p><p>Elsewhere in the interview, Max shares some more stories about Steven Spielberg's connections with the games industry, including the time he received a Wii Sports demo from Nintendo's Shigeru Miyamoto. Steven Spielberg, for his part, is hard at work on his next movie, which is said to be about UFOs and is due to release in 2026.</p><p><em>Photo by Marc Piasecki/WireImage</em></p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

			<p>Red Barrels has recently confirmed that they were the victim of a cybersecurity incident. Red Barrels are known for making the notorious Outlast games, with their most recent game being the multiplayer title, The Outlast Trials. Red Barrels has confirmed that no player data has been compromised in the cybersecurity incident, but there will be significant delays in production, as the incident targeted the development team. It appears that<a href="https://x.com/AlvieriD/status/1841558903836049813" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Nitrogen Ransomware</a> committed the attack.</p>
<p>"The Red Barrels team regrets to announce that its internal IT systems were recently impacted by a cybersecurity event involving access to some of its data." While they weren't working on developing a new game publicly, they have stated that the development has affected their content plans for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outlast-trials-announces-brand-new-killer-and-map/">The Outlast Trials</a>.</p>
<p>"As soon as the event was detected, measures were deployed to secure the systems and the information confirmed therein. A group of leading external cybersecurity experts have been mandated to conduct an in-depth investigation into the incident.

<p>Authorities and cybersecurity have already investigated the incident, and the statement reassures players that they have not been impacted in any way by the event.

On Wednesday, Krafton — the publisher behind <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> — <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/">announced that it acquired</a> the license for <em>Palworld</em> and will optimize it for mobile gaming, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/459122/palworld-mobile-pubg-studios">as reported earlier by <em>Polygon</em></a>.</p><p>According to a translated version of the post, Krafton says it aims to “faithfully reinterpret” <em>Palworld</em>’s “main fun elements to fit the mobile environment.” Krafton also created a mobile version of <em>PUBG</em> in 2018, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17128526/pubg-mobile-hands-on-review-vs-xbox-fortnite">as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out at the time</a>, it turned out better than expected.</p><p>Dubbed “<em>Pokémon</em> with guns,” <em>Palworld</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047087/palworld-early-access-steam-xbox-gamepass">became an instant hit</a> following its release on PC and Xbox in January, selling millions of copies as players explored and caught creatures throughout the sprawling Palpagos Islands. But last month, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248602/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-pocketpair-patent-infringement-lawsuit">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company sued Pocketpair</a> over accusations it violated multiple patent rights.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248957/pocketpair-pokemon-patent-infrigement-lawsuit">Pocketpair replied</a>, saying it’s “unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon.” <em>Palworld</em> has since arrived on the PlayStation 5, but its release is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253687/palworld-ps5-japan-release-date-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit">delayed indefinitely in Japan</a>. Aside from <em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo also appears to have set its sights on Switch emulators, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github">Ryujinx becoming the latest one to shut down</a>.</p></div></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259284/oura-ring-samsung-galaxy-ring-ultrahuman-ring-air-ringconn-circular-ring-evie-ring-review-wearables"><h2>We tested six smart rings, and there’s a clear winner</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/2/24260262/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-doxxing-privacy"><h2>College students used Meta’s smart glasses to dox people in real time</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24258431/sonos-app-controversy-patrick-spence-plan"><h2>Sonos has a plan to earn back your trust, and here it is</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259598/fasetto-dolby-atmos-audio-cu-speakers-power-lines"><h2>These boxes will send Dolby Atmos through your home’s power lines</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259408/bose-bluetooth-wireless-speaker-soundlink-home"><h2>Bose’s new SoundLink Home is one of its best-looking wireless speakers</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Things can go from bad to dead in just a few turns. Unless you take a step back and try to see the larger picture, it can feel like an overly simplistic and needlessly punishing experience. My first, brief sessions with <em>Shogun Showdown</em> spread over a few different nights felt like homework and I am increasingly feeling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaMno8d0Tzw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too old for that shit</a></span>. But I stuck with it and eventually wrapped my head around its elegant mechanics. When <em>Shogun Showdown</em> finally clicks into place it’s excellent.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,195891,196131" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1f3y46t/my_game_shogun_showdown_is_releasing_next_week/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1f3y46t/my_game_shogun_showdown_is_releasing_next_week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">came out of Early Access</a></span> and arrived on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC last month from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://roboatino.itch.io/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://roboatino.itch.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small indie dev Roboatino</a></span> and it’s an incredibly clever mashup of genre bests like<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-is-a-roguelike-card-game-and-im-hooked-1822608254&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-is-a-roguelike-card-game-and-im-hooked-1822608254"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/into-the-breach-the-kotaku-review-1823365331"><em>Into the Breach</em></a></span><em> </em>(I’ve played 4-5 hours on Nintendo’s handheld where it’s snappy and vibrant). Your goal is to defeat the evil shogun, but to do that you need to overcome a series of increasingly difficult stages where turn-based combat plays out across a tiny side-scrolling 2D battlefield of less than a dozen spaces. Enemies come at you in waves, and once you’ve completed each of the fights you move onto the next node on the world map.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b4e0c732328026d57d160a0ff4aa2c33" data-recommend-id="image://b4e0c732328026d57d160a0ff4aa2c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roboatino</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4e0c732328026d57d160a0ff4aa2c33" data-recommend-id="image://b4e0c732328026d57d160a0ff4aa2c33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The action hinges on unique abilities, items, and cards you accrue over the course of the journey. Simple sword cards let you deal damage to whatever’s in front of you. A bow will let you hit a target at long range. More sophisticated cards include lightning bolts that only hit the last enemy in the row or forward dashes that let you move behind enemy lines. A small apothecary of healing potions, magic shields, and other consumables give you additional options to strategize around. After successful battles and at rest stop shops you can buy more stuff or upgrade the things you already have. </p><p>But the real thing that makes <em>Shogun Showdown </em>feel so unique and fun is the way it forces you to manage space and plan ahead by telegraphing what’s coming. The starting Wanderer class (additional classes with different starting cards and perks are unlocked the more you play) can move past an opponent once every four turns. When an enemy is preparing to attack you can scoot past them and dodge the move entirely before killing them behind. Towards the end of a run, a combo of forward dashes, back steps, and other maneuvers that double as attacks let you control the battlefield like a master swordsman, at once deadly and untouchable.</p><figure id="" data-id="6f4180c78a611bab6acb4f47d1fe1743" data-recommend-id="image://6f4180c78a611bab6acb4f47d1fe1743" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roboatino</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6f4180c78a611bab6acb4f47d1fe1743" data-recommend-id="image://6f4180c78a611bab6acb4f47d1fe1743" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pixel art sprites prepare for battle in Japan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Where games like<em> Slay the Spire</em> have you trying to craft builds that maximize damage output and<em> Into the Breach</em> rewards you for intricate planning, <em>Shogun Showdown</em> blends these incentives in a way that feels streamlined yet still varied and challenging. I also enjoy the lack of RNG. Your attacks never miss and you don’t have to worry about drawing the wrong card at the worst time. The result is a satisfying mix of player empowerment and mechanical limitations. There’s nothing better than stacking the perfect set of moves together and then watching the dominoes fall and clear the battlefield in a single turn. </p><p>I’ve only beaten the game once so far, and I immediately wanted to go back and explore new classes and deck strategies. Beyond that I can’t speak to the long-term replayability when it comes to the roguelike nature of unlocks, hidden secrets, or potential extra challenges. The bones of <em>Shogun Showdown </em>are great though, made all the easier to recommend thanks to the slick pixel art animations and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.oscardmg.com/bio&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.oscardmg.com/bio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rock-infused, chiptune-y soundtrack</a></span>. And for now there’s plenty more cards I want to discover and experiment with. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
