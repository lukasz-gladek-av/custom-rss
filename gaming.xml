            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>With the Switch 2, Nintendo seems to be closing the release date gap with some of its third-party games. It’s a problem that plagued previous Nintendo consoles, which often received games years after other platforms, if at all.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/716586/nintendo-partner-direct-july-2025-news-trailers">today’s Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> may have lacked the splash of anticipated third-party games like <em>Hades 2</em> or FromSoftware’s <em>The Duskbloods</em>, what was on display offered some interesting insight.</p><p>Showcases like this one offer Nintendo’s second- and third-party development and publishing partners the chance to show off what they’ve got on the way. In the original Switch days, multiplatform games like <em>Control</em> would get Switch release dates months or even years after their initial launch, if they came to the Switch at all. And even then, the game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538173/control-cloud-version-nintendo-switch-release-remedy-entertainment">might sometimes be the cloud version</a>, requiring it to be streamed on the console, and these were generally hated for their inconsistent graphics and performance issues.</p><p>With this Direct, it seems like Nintendo is working to bring third-party games to the Switch 2 faster and, hopefully, with gameplay experiences similar to the other consoles. During this Direct, we got a look at <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a new game from <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake studio Bloober Team. <em>Cronos</em> looks like the kind of game that would have struggled on the original Switch, but it’s releasing across all three consoles and PC on September 5th.</p><p><em>Madden NFL 2026</em> is also launching across the Big 3 at the same time — August 14th — a feat of note considering the last time a Madden title was on a Nintendo console was <em>Madden NFL 13 </em>more than a decade ago.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24230628/star-wars-outlaws-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a> has been out since August of last year. Its arrival on the Switch 2 in September represents Ubisoft’s most graphically and technically complex game on the platform since the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fproducts%2Fassassins-creed-anniversary-edition-mega-bundle-switch%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Assassin’s Creed Anniversary Edition Mega Bundle</em></a>. (And the most recent game in that collection was released more than 10 years ago.) <em>Borderlands 4</em>, while not launching exactly day and date, will come out on the Switch 2 a mere three weeks after its PC/Xbox/PlayStation launch.</p><p>Even the third-party games that weren’t shown today still represent exciting new prospects for the Switch 2. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">During the Switch 2 Direct in April</a>, <em>Elden Ring</em> was shown as one of the games coming to the new console. With the way the original Switch struggled with more complex games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23420732/bayonetta-3-review-nintendo-switch">even ones designed with that console in mind</a>, a big-ass, pretty-ass, particle-y effect-ass game like <em>Elden Ring</em> running on it was unthinkable. But <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-among-slate-of-three-bandai-namco-games-coming"><em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em></a>, along with <em>The Duskbloods</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641335/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-announcement">a totally original FromSoftware<em> multiplayer</em> joint</a>, are both coming to the Switch 2.<em> Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, a game with the same kind of, if not higher, technical complexity as <em>Elden Ring</em>, is on the way too.</p><p>Nintendo’s always been the kind of company to do what it wants rather than chase market trends, and that strategy has served the company very well. The original Switch wasn’t at the bleeding technical edge and, because of the high quality of its games, it didn’t have to be. The Switch 2, similarly, isn’t pushing the same kind of power as Xbox and PlayStation, but the console has evolved just enough that it can support some of the still-popular recent games of its competitors.</p><p>And even if not everything new will come to the Switch 2, the console still has a robust back catalog to bring forward. During today’s Direct we saw that Sega’s Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is bringing the <em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> series to the Switch 2.</p><p>We don’t know how any of these games will perform when they’re finally released on the Switch 2. We’ll have to wait and see if the console fulfills the promise of bigger and better games running on improved hardware. We also don’t know if the trend will continue beyond the initial excitement of a new console’s launch window. But if <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-is-a-switch-2-stunner/">the</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/604269/switch-2-cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition-best-title">critical</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">acclaim</a> of the Switch 2 edition of<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> is anything to go by, the ports won’t just be coming faster; they’ll be good, too.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/716859/nintendo-partner-direct-july-cronos-star-wars]]></content:encoded>

When the topic of the <em>Black Flag </em>remaster came up, Ryan explained that he didn’t realize the previous interaction was being recorded, and now that it’s put him in hot water with Ubisoft, he’s keeping his mouth shut on the matter.</p><p>“The thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this and I was being very free and open and I didn’t know that they were actually recording me on their phone,” Ryan said. “Then the company threatened to sue me. So I say nothing.”</p><p>Ryan points to the camera during this back and forth, so it seems like he’s well aware of it this time. I guess that’s one way to get the word out for people to stop asking about something you aren’t supposed to be talking about. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p>While Ryan hasn’t returned to <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>or video games since <em>Black Flag</em>, he’s spent much of the decade since playing John Constantine in several DC Comics projects, both in live-action shows like <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and in animated shows and movies.

Instead, they can be revived by other players. One way to do this is to play as a medic, run over to the wounded soldier with some defibrillator paddles, and give them a quick charge. This will instantly bring them back to life. And that’s fine, I guess. But the more enjoyable and exciting way to bring people back is to grab them by their bulletproof vest and drag them to safety. </p><p>On PC, the platform we played on, you simply walk over to the downed player and hold E. Doing so grabs them and slowly fills up a meter that, once filled, signals the player’s revived. While you are holding them, you can move backwards and drag them away from where they fell. You don’t have to do this, but it’s often a smart move, as they were likely in a dangerous spot when they were downed. For example, during one match, my squad was taken down by snipers. I made my way to the closest downed player and dragged them into a nearby building. A moment later, they were up on their feet, and I felt like a big hero from a war movie. </p><figure id="" data-id="0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-recommend-id="image://0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-format="png" data-width="1915" data-height="1059" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>A player drags a downed squadmate to safety in footage released by EA.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-recommend-id="image://0380fe66f678e31f6c329c9f5628dc9c" data-format="png" data-width="1915" data-height="1059" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="First-person gameplay screenshot of a player on a war-torn city street dragging a downed teammate to safety." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I ended up dragging a lot of comrades around <em>Battlefield 6</em>, saving them from danger, bringing them back into the battle, and having a great time in the process. Afterward, when I talked to others who had played during the event, they often would bring up the dragging mechanic and rave about it. Even folks who weren’t as enthused with <em>BF6 </em>as I was were still big fans of heroically grabbing and pulling people to safety.</p><p>Part of what makes this feature so awesome is how easy it is. It’s one button. It’s something anyone can do, but it feels <em>so </em>cool. And it also helps out a teammate, which makes you feel even better. Getting dragged is also nice. You feel so special. </p><p>“Wow, this person really cares about me!” I would think to myself each time a random player dragged me behind some wall and out of gunfire. In reality, they just wanted to feel cool and get some extra XP. But, whatever, everyone is happy in the end. Now that’s a great way to make people work together in an online game. Take note, other shooters: This is an idea worth copying. <br></p><p>I can’t wait to drag more of my buddies and squadmates when <em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on console and PC on October 10. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385]]></content:encoded>

The developers never mentioned battle royale or Firestorm by name, but the suggestion is quite obvious. In any event, whatever this is, fans will get to try it first in the Battlefield Labs testing program. </p><p>EA's hosts at the event alluded to the mode being called Firestorm, but stopped short of confirming this.</p><p>Firestorm for Battlefield V was part of that game and was only playable to people who owned a copy. It remains to be seen if the next iteration of the mode, if real, would be a standalone download or only available with a purchase of Battlefield 6.</p><p>At the time of its release in 2018, many remarked that Firestorm felt like a half-baked idea that EA implemented to try to capitalize on the growing popularity of battle royale modes at the time.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-chaos-and-destruction-with-limp-bizkit-too/1100-6533607/" data-ref-id="1100-6533607">Battlefield 6 launches on October 10</a>, and it won't cost $80.

<p>The move is not entirely unprecedented, seeing as how we're now almost five years into the current generation of consoles, and both Xbox and PlayStation have signaled that they're in production on <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMyaSj4eeOAxXTmIkEHRt2IosQFnoECBgQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw2gh2IQUYeTUf17Tm5VRJR5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successors to Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiuiPuy4eeOAxUTm4kEHVq-KPcQFnoECCEQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw17N4v-2zjvyqY8UUvtpRGV" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5</a>.</p><p>Additionally, when preorder and wishlist pages first went live around the reveal of the game's campaign, many spotted the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/battlefield-6/9p2ff14jzll3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">absence of dedicated</a> <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009568" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pages</a> for the older generation of systems.</p><p>Typically, developers leave behind previous generation of consoles to better support the newer hardware allowing the team to push the title's tech further than it would if it were hamstrung supporting multiple systems of varying power. Some developers have already struggled to get games running on different systems within the same generation, like Larian Studios did when porting Baldur's Gate 3 to both Xbox Series X and its weaker counterpart, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819">Series S</a>.</p><p>Battlefield 6 marks the series' return to the modern age after Battlefield 2042's foray into the near future, as well as more typical formula complete with the franchise's iconic classes and a single-player mode. Battlefield 6 will be releasing on October 10 and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">series of open betas</a> will take place in August.</p>

		<p>EA has just given us the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer reveal, confirming that the game will launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 10th October, as well as beta tests that will take place in August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>That’s right, Battlefield 6 is coming out in October, but you’ll be able to play before then with two beta weekends. The first is coming next week, in fact, with a beta running from 7th August, with codes available from Twitch drops from people streaming today or pre-ordering the game. This will morph into an open beta test on 9th August and run through the 10th.</p>
<p>A second Battlefield 6 open beta weekend will take place from 14th-17th August.</p>
<p>Classes are back alongside signature weapons and abilities that fit into the archetypes of games before and 2042</p>

<p>There will be 9 maps at launch including an Operation Firestorm remake, Gibraltar, Egypt<br>
Tajikistan and Brooklyn.</p>
<p>Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough game mode are joined by the likes of TDM, Squad DM, Domination and KOTH.</p>
<p>More maps and modes will arrive in seasonal content, while BF Portal returns as editing tools and modifiers for gameplay.</p>
<p>Officially unveiled last week, Battlefield 6 is a huge production for EA, with the Battlefield Studios comprised of Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios, all with different roles to play in its creation. Criterion and Motive have focused on the single player campaign, which will see NATO attacked and going on the counter-offensive against the private military group known as Pax Armata. This announcement trailer brought us plenty of cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>A lot of this was echoed in the multiplayer reveal, which takes players to some rather familiar looking streets for The Division players, over the river from the main city, fighting in the shadow of Brooklyn Bridge. The war extends from the US through to the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets.</p>
<p>We’re going hands on with the game shortly, so keep your eyes peeled for our Battlefield 6 preview very, very soon.</p>

<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157651/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>As I sat down to write this review, I typed ‘What is the lifespan of a housefly?’ into my search bar. It’s not a question I ever really pondered prior to my playthrough of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/time_flies">Time Flies</a>. Somehow, this minimalist indie puzzler got me curious enough to wonder. I can’t say there’s ever been a piece of media that’s ever piqued my general interest in a pest in quite the same way.</p>
<p>That’s because Time Flies’ protagonist <em>is</em> a fly, and <em>they made him cool.</em> That’s not how I thought I’d be anchoring this review, but it’s the truth. Much like how the goose in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/untitled_goose_game">Untitled Goose Game</a> wins hearts by being a chaotic menace, the fly is an existentialist rebel worthy of an Albert Camus novella about, say, the absurd search for meaning in a life measured in seconds.</p>
<p>That’s essentially what Time Flies is all about. Developed by Michael Frei and Raphaël Munoz and published by Panic (of Untitled Goose Game fame), the game puts you in control of a tiny housefly with a bucket list of cheeky to-dos to complete. The catch is that, depending on where you live, you’ll only have around a minute and a half or less to tick them all to progress.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157652/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Using data from the World Health Organisation’s life expectancy figures, your in-game lifespan (measured in seconds) is tied to the average life expectancy of the country you're in. In my case, Singapore’s 83.9 years afford me 83.9 seconds of playtime, after which your little fly drops dead and you begin anew. You’re free to set any country as your location ahead of each ‘run’.</p>
<p>There are no button inputs; only the control stick is used to manoeuvre around with buttery smooth flight physics. Exploration is the name of the game. You’re given a vaguely phrased list of objectives like ‘Get Rich’, ‘Start a Revolution’, ‘Go With The Flow’, etc., and it’s up to you to experiment with the world around you through trial-and-error.</p>
<p>For example, if your goal is to ‘Learn an Instrument,’ you could try buzzing around the strings of a guitar. Tasks are never too cryptic and often play out in ironic or unexpected ways with a deadpan delivery that lends the game a distinctive comedic tone. Times Flies never tells you what to do, opting to let you poke around and figure things out on your own.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/accessibility-report/4221/embed @ 1753988409 -->
<p>Despite the small size of each of the game’s four areas, there’s plenty to discover. The camera zooms in when you’re near certain objects, which is usually your cue that there’s something to interact with. Time pauses during these moments to let you prod, which more often than not leads to the quiet satisfaction of ticking something off your bucket list.</p>
<p>Unlocking a new level requires you to tick off all area-specific objectives within a single life, which is easier said than done. Fortunately, you’re able to buy yourself some additional time when there’s a clock nearby. You literally turn back the clock to gain precious seconds needed to complete your tasks, which adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay.</p>
<p>There’s also a larger achievement list to chip away at as you play, along with 12 hidden puzzle pieces scattered throughout the game. These collectibles are impressively well-hidden, requiring careful observation to sniff out and precise timing to access. Hunting for the last puzzle piece kept me invested and finding it made me feel mighty clever.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157649/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s visual aesthetic won’t be for everyone, but it absolutely lends personality. Settings are imperfectly hand-drawn yet slyly expressive, rendered in black and white with no gradients or shading. It’s unpolished in a deliberate way, landing somewhere between doodles on the margins of a student’s philosophy notebook and early Macintosh aesthetics.</p>
<p>Time Flies similarly uses sound design sparingly but effectively. Throughout the game, two sounds persist: the steady ticking down of the clock and the soft buzz of your wings. Ambient details like dripping water, the crackle of old jazz records, flickering TV channels, and even a tunable radio add charm and ambience to the world.</p>
<p>If Time Flies has a weakness, it’s one the game fully owns: it’s short. The game can be completed within two hours or so, and once you’ve finished it and collected all its secrets, there’s little incentive to return. The developers clearly anticipate criticism of the game’s length and, at one point, even break the fourth wall to gently rib themselves.</p>
<figure><a title="Time Flies Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157650/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Its creators know exactly what kind of game they’ve made, and they lean into it fully and stay committed to the bit. Time Flies feels like the lovechild of Untitled Goose Game and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/minit">Minit</a>, blending checklist-based mischief with clever time constraints. But where the goose is gleefully anarchic, the fly revels in the shortness of life and is committed to enjoying the ride.</p>
<p>Just a warning, the game does depict nudity and drug/alcohol use, so it’s not one for the kids. Times Flies runs flawlessly on both the Switch and Switch 2 with no discernible difference in performance apart from slightly speedier load times on Nintendo’s newest console. Oh, and if you were wondering, houseflies live between 15 to 30 days. Now you know.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Time Flies is a clever puzzle-exploration game and a playful meditation on life’s brevity. Its gameplay mechanics don’t evolve dramatically from one level to the next, but that never felt like a hindrance. It’s a tight, focused experience that delivers its core ideas with confidence but doesn’t necessarily push beyond them. That said, Time Flies never feels like a concept stretched too thin, and it bows out before overstaying its welcome.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Electronic Arts has confirmed the previous Battlefield 6 leaks for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-release-date-indirectly-confirmed-official-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-october10-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pricing</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10 with no early access options.</p>



<p>On PC, the pricing is:</p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: $69.99 / €69.99 / GBP 59.99
<ul>
<li>Phantom Edition: $99.99 / €99.99 / GBP 89.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>On consoles, it is slightly higher for Europeans and British players:</p>



<ul>
<li>$69.99 / €79.99 / GBP 69.99
<ul>
<li>$99.99 / €109.99/ GBP 99.99</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The Open Beta details are slightly different from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak</a>, though. There will be two beta weekends:</p>



<ul>
<li>Saturday, August 9 - Sunday, August 10</li>



<li>Thursday, August 14 - Sunday, August 17</li>
</ul>



<p>The press release also reveals plenty of details on Battlefield 6. The premise is that in 2027, a high-profile assassination throws the world into chaos. Around the same time, 'major European countries' leave NATO, while the United States and its remaining NATO allies are left to deal with a massive private military corporation called PAX ARMATA.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-6-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>In the single player campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-is-inspired-by-civil-war-film-and-lioness-tv-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by Motive</a>, players step into the boots of Dagger 1-3, a squad of Marine Raiders fighting private military companies around the world to stop a global collapse. The developers promise 'jaw-dropping set pieces' and 'explosive action on an unparalleled scale'.</p>



<p>The game's combat system is described as 'kinesthetic', enhancing gunplay and character movement. It offers new tactical options, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drag and Revive - Lets you drag a teammate away from danger while reviving them</li>



<li>Peek and Lean - Lets you peek around corners to spy on the enemies while remaining unexposed to their fire</li>



<li>Combat rolls - A new maneuvering ability to limit fall damage and increase the chance to avoid getting hit</li>



<li>Mounting weapons - When behind cover, players can mount weapons to decrease recoil</li>



<li>Hitch ride - This feature expands how many players can be on vehicles beyond just seats</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers also promise that Battlefield 6 will offer 'reliable recoil patterns' and 'well-defined weapon ranges'. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-8-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The class system returns. That was practically a guarantee - even Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought it back eventually</a>, although it was too little and too late. The classes are the same four fans have loved throughout the entire franchise: Assault, Engineer, Recon, and Support.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Assault class, unsurprisingly, uses assault rifles and has a faster transition from sprint to firing and switching to and from the weapons. It also takes less damage and a lower movement speed penalty from a fall. Its signature gadget is an Adrenaline Injector that clears flash and stun effects (and offers resistance against them), boosts sprint speed, reduces damage taken from explosives, and makes the sound of enemy footsteps clearer. Its active ability reveals audible nearby foes, and kills prolong this effect. Assault players can choose from two training options: a Grenadier (quicker reload on grenade launchers, extra grenades, and more resistance against flash effects) or a Frontliner (improved health regeneration, extra adrenaline injector charge, and reduced penalty to shooting on the move).</li>



<li>The Engineer uses submachine guns, has better hip-fire control, and takes reduced damage from explosives. Its gadget is the Repair Tool, which 'fixes friendly assets and armor' but can also damage enemy assets. Its active ability overloads the Repair Tool to improve its efficiency. The Engineer's training options are the Anti-Armor (who focuses on damaging enemy vehicles with faster loads, extra rockets, and its rockets diminish repair efficiency) and the Combat Engineer (who automatically regenerates the health of vehicles they occupy, can use the Repair Tool longer, and automatically spots mines).</li>



<li>The Recon uses sniper rifles, with faster rechambering between shots, decreased scope sway, and improved breath control. It can automatically spot enemies when aiming through an optic sight. Its gadget is the Motion Sensor that tracks any enemy movement in its range. Its active ability calls an UAV to passively spot enemies in a marked position. The Recon's training options are: Sniper (improved auto-spot speed, range, duration, and the sniper shots temporarily prevent healing and headshots make targets unrevivable) and Pathfinder (undetectable by equipment except when sprinting, they also highlight foes for the rest of the squad and can perform quieter takedowns).</li>



<li>Lastly, the Support fights with light machine guns and does not suffer any sprint speed penalty with this weapon. They can drag and revive squadmates faster and also carry a Supply Bag, which heals allies and resupplies both weapon and gadget ammunition. Their active ability is a supply area of effect around them that also temporarily increases their revive speed. The Support's Training Options are: Combat Medic (they function as a health dispensary for squadmates and regenerate health when reviving them) and Fire Support (they have improved weapon control from mounted weapons and can provide ammo to teammates).</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Battlefield 6 also brings tactical destruction back. Players can not only use rockets or tanks to blow things off, as even a sledgehammer or some C4 can take down a wall. The developers say that projectiles now leave a realistic impact based on the round and the wall's material, while explosives blow down walls based on their damage potential.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/BF6-Screen-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The game will launch with nine maps: Siege of Cairo, Empire State, Iberian Offensive, Liberation Peak, Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, Kundara Valley, and the remake of Battlefield 3's Operation Firestorm. Multiplayer modes include classics like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush, not to mention shooter staples like Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, Domination, and King of the Hill. The developers also added a brand new mode called Escalation where two teams fight to capture strategic control points.</p>



<p>Portal also returns with a robust toolset that has been improved with a spatial editor powered by Godot. A server browser will be a 'highlighted Community option' that is often available in Featured playlists. Furthermore, Portal-made experiences created in Verified Mode will allow for full progression in Battlefield 6. Lastly, the developers reassured fans that the ambitious post-launch support will deliver more maps, modes, weapons, and features on a regular basis. </p>

			<p>Hangar 13 has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1941540/view/523098355357712525?l=english">announced</a> the PC specs for <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/mafia-the-old-country-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-return-of-the-gangster-franchise/">Mafia: The Old Country,</a> and unfortunately for anyone with a PC on the lower end of the hardware spectrum, you won't be playing this game at launch if you don't upgrade your hardware or buy a console.</p>



<p>Starting with the features PC players can enjoy if they have the hardware for it, Mafia: The Old Country will feature an uncapped framerate during gameplay, though the framerate will be capped to 30 FPS during cutscenes. Unreal Temporal Super Resolution, AMD FidelityFX<em>™</em> Super Resolution 4, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Sampling 4, and Intel Xe Super Sampling 2 will all be supported at launch, including V-Sync and frame generation for those with the hardware for the features. It'll also have HDR and ultrawide monitor support at launch.</p>



<p>And you'll seemingly need all the upscaling help you can get, as it's an extremely demanding game that seems to require more from your CPU than GPU, given the fact that even the minimum CPU requirements ask that you have an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X or Intel Core i7-9700K in your machine to play the game at 1920x1080p, with graphical settings at 'Medium.' As for the minimum GPU requirement, you'll either need an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT or NVIDIA RTX 2070 to have a smooth experience.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Mafia: The Old Country PC Specs. Image credit: Hangar 13</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you dared to play the game at the 'High' graphical preset at 2560x1440p, then you'd better have an AMD Ryzen 7 5800X or Intel Core i7-12700K CPU ready to go, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT or NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti GPU.</p>



<p>Finally, playing the game with the graphical settings on 'Epic,' aiming for a 4K resolution, you'll need an AMD Ryzen 7 9700X or Intel Core i7-14700K CPU, paired with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 or NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti.</p>



<p>With all that said, even those with lower-spec hardware might be able to squeeze out some semblance of a good experience by tweaking the graphical settings to fit their build. Here are all the settings you can tweak at launch: </p>



<ul>
<li>Display Selection: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>Screen Mode: Windowed, Borderless Fullscreen</li>



<li>Window Resolution: (varies by setup)</li>



<li>V-Sync: Off, On (supports VRR via G-Sync / FreeSync)</li>



<li>Gameplay Frame Rate (FPS): 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 144, Unlimited</li>



<li>Quality Preset: Low, Medium, High, Epic, Custom</li>



<li>Anti-Aliasing &amp; Upscaling: Unreal TSR, NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, Intel XeSS</li>



<li>Upscaling Mode: Performance - High, Performance, Balanced, Quality, Quality - High, Native</li>



<li>Sharpness:&nbsp; 0.1 - 1.0 (in increments of .1)</li>



<li>Frame Generation: Off, On (on supported hardware)</li>



<li>Global Illumination: High, Epic</li>



<li>Shadows: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Reflections: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>View Distance: Near, Medium, Far, Epic</li>



<li>Textures: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Foliage: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Effects: Low, Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Post Processing: Medium, High, Epic</li>



<li>Motion Blur: Off, On</li>
</ul>



<p>Hopefully, when Mafia: The Old Country launches next week on August 8, 2025, it won't arrive with a slew of other technical issues that impair it from running well on the builds that it should run on without issue. We'll see how things go when it hits PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Preview - Good Company]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-multiplayer-preview-good-company.1258872/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s only been a handful of days since EA raised the curtain on <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and already it’s become abundantly clear: <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>

<p>And EA is here to celebrate it with all the exaggerated pomp and circumstance that comes with a homecoming such as this. It’s a return to form in many ways, building upon what worked before, but also trying new things that will help define <em>Battlefield</em>’s identity.</p>

<p>It’s also a chance for a fresh start, and a commitment to fans that branches out from the legacy multiplayer experience using the key pillars of classes, gunplay, vehicles, and destruction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=sknvJ_hA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers.jpg?itok=9n46A7n7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With that in mind, EA and the developers at Battlefield Studios set fit to put on a dazzling, hard-edge show, inviting us out to see <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s multiplayer mode in action in a studio setting. From the jump it’s just as loud and bombastic as ever, with many facets that are setting the stage for one of this year’s big first-person shooters when it launches on October 10.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> is framed by the role of a soldier who finds themself in the midst of a war between NATO and a paramilitary organization known as PAX ARMATA. These fights take place in real-world locations and set the stage for various modes including Conquest, Breakthrough, Squad Deathmatch, and Domination.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=d1J31W6L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-city.jpg?itok=KPULzFKd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Core gameplay is important, but especially so when it comes to games that lean on multiplayer for their longevity. <em>Battlefield 6</em> aims to take the stage with one key focus: squads. And with squads comes classes, each with a specific role to play and the capacity to adapt to real-time situations.</p>

<p>These classes include Engineer, which can expertly take down enemy vehicles and boost allies', and can take reduced damage from explosives. The Engineer takes control of submachine guns and has improved hip-fire control.</p>

<p>Then there’s the Recon class, whose role focuses on intelligence and counterintelligence whilst being able to infiltrate and scout at a high degree. As the name suggests, they make use of sniper rifles and can stabilize aim for a longer period of time.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-single-soldier.jpg?itok=DO3p6aC4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-single-soldier.jpg?itok=NBh_hUx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Support is the medic of the squad, offering up support by providing ammo, healing, and revival during combat. They use light machine guns and a supply bag that can heal allies when tossed out onto the field.</p>

<p>At the forefront of the group is the Assault class. They’re the frontline fighter, the leader meant to take the team to the enemy. They wield assault rifles, and can sprint and shift to weapons with a faster transition than is normal.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-squad.jpg?itok=nF2qmU3K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-squad.jpg?itok=p_ppWb2P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of these four classes are inserted into <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s main combat system, known as the Kinesthetic Combat System. This system is designed to give the player more control, heightening mobility and tactical options in a fight, while also evolving the <em>Battlefield</em> series with all-new features.</p>

<p>For example, players can drag and revive a member of their team, ensuring both are away from danger. Players can get creative and mount weapons, which allows for steadier aim and a decrease in gun recoil. Cover can be further exploited through peeking around corners without being exposed, and you can even roll during combat to limit fall damage and increase the chance of dodging some bullets.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-vehicle.jpg?itok=s5r7Pdaq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-vehicle.jpg?itok=UvDS3Gmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Vehicles in <em>Battlefield 6</em> have been expanded as well, with the ability to hitch a ride and hang on to the back even if all available seats are taken.</p>

<p>The combat system is unique in that it works to give players reliable recoil patterns that will allow players to learn and adjust accordingly. This is something the team really focused on, and getting that feedback ahead of time really helped shaped the state of the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers-and-helicopters.jpg?itok=JR7jv-uM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldiers-and-helicopters.jpg?itok=3fhdf3za 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And it wouldn’t be <em>Battlefield</em> without a big focus on destruction. <em>Battlefield 6</em> offers even bigger transformations to the environment, adding authentic damage that can be wielded to the player’s advantage. There’s some pretty creative solutions here too such as firing on a floor to take out enemies from above.</p>

<p>All of this extends to <em>Battlefield 6</em>’s nine maps, including a remake of <em>Battlefield 3</em>’s Operation Firestorm. Newcomers include Siege of Cairo, Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Liberation Peak. Several maps that we didn’t see firsthand include Saints Quarter, Manhattan Bridge, New Sobek City, and Kundara Valley.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-nighttime-fight.jpg?itok=VMvmMffr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-nighttime-fight.jpg?itok=Mjlar03R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Within the maps themselves, players can expect to spend most of their time in Combat Zones, or special configurations in the map that focus on quality of gameplay that can switch up depending on the mode. More specifically this means that while the maps remain similar, elements within them can change such as how something becomes destroyed or the location of specific objects.</p>

<p>These modes can be broken down rather simply. There’s Conquest, which involves a lot of vehicles like tanks and helicopters, and it’s up to players to control specific locations on the map. When a team’s resources hit zero, they lose the game.</p>

<p>Breakthrough divides the map into sections that players will have to fight for one at a time. These battles will continue until all sections are captured or respawns are depleted.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-tank.jpg?itok=NQrjdFL- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-tank.jpg?itok=iEJCdEED 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Rush involves defusing and arming explosive systems, and the match will end when all communications systems are destroyed or players run out of respawns. There’s also the classic Team Deathmatch, Squad Deathmatch, King of the Hill, Escalation, and Domination modes available.</p>

<p>The Portal feature returns to <em>Battlefield 6</em> with new tools including a spatial editor. Players will now have the ability to craft their own spaces and their work with the community.</p>

<p>While we didn’t get to experience that particular mode, we did spend some quality time with many of the aforementioned gameplay features, as well as each of the four combat classes. It’s a lot to take in, but so far promises made seem to be promises kept.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=qgHQNM1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-soldier-charge.jpg?itok=0XVKObGK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Battlefield 6</em> already feels incredibly polished, and not just in visuals. While yes, the fidelity is there, the explosions are bigger than ever, and the audio tuned along with it, it’s the gunplay that feels familiar yet fresh and tightly tuned.</p>

<p>Things are chaotic, but the assigned roles give you a sense of purpose - you’re not simply running and shooting, there’s the potential for specific tactical actions, and as the developers stressed, a real learning experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Support class in particular feels like a star for the versatility added to a typical healer. Being able to drag and revive people means you’re not going to be stuck out in the open, and playing around with shields, healing items, and zapping enemies with a defibrillator means that there’s a level of creativity involved outside of shooting a gun. When things get tough, hanging out in one of the vehicles isn’t a bad play either.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-helicopter.jpg?itok=m2fJ6Phd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-helicopter.jpg?itok=tuBrdDpA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The different game modes are also all unique in their own way. It truly does feel like you’re doing different things on the same map. This is especially true in the close quarters locations like Cairo, which relies a lot on buildings and small spaces.</p>

<p>These few hours were only a taste of what’s to come in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. With promises of post-launch support and an open beta for fans beginning early next month, it’ll be worth seeing if everything we saw holds up on a larger scale. The setup is certainly there, so it's safe to say, at least tentatively, that <em>Battlefield</em> is back.</p>

The video featured Limp Bizkit singing about a chainsaw. It was loud, bombastic, and frankly a bit embarrassing. But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit.

This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a></span>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>" were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it. </p><p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship. </p><p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p><h2 id="h88009"><a id=""></a>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2><p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war. </p><p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-recommend-id="image://5e44a3f016c7f34548f53bde816bd679" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a></span><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat. </p><p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun. </p><p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p><p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch. </p><h2 id="h88010"><a id=""></a>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2><p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-recommend-id="image://7e5ac75492678221c0f05f90c1a22a67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p><p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>'s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p><p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>maps. </p><p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384]]></content:encoded>
