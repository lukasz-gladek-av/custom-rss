              <p><em>Highguard’s</em> 5v5 mode, which launched over the weekend as a temporary experiment, is now a permanent mode in the free-to-play raid shooter. And while the new mode is better than the old 3v3 option, I’m not sure it’s enough to save this thing.</p> <p>On January 30, after some teasing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584"><em>Highguard’s</em> devs announced a new 5v5 mode</a> was being added to the game immediately following fan feedback that the original 3v3 mode wasn’t exciting enough. At the time, <em>Highguard</em> labeled the new option as a “limited time mode.” However, apparently so many players liked it, and the reaction to it was so positive, that the mode is going to stick around permanently alongside the 3v3 mode, which isn’t going away.</p>

 <p>“You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?s=20">posted <em>Highguard’s</em> official Twitter account.</a> “We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You've been asking, and we're happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay! ⚔</p> <p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision. <a href="https://t.co/S0QfgCE7vK">pic.twitter.com/S0QfgCE7vK</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Credit to developers Wildlight Entertainment for implementing a 5v5 mode into <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201"><em>Highguard</em> </a>so shortly after the game’s January 26 launch. And after playing a few 5v5 matches over the last few days, I do think it’s a better version of the game. In my experience, having more players on the map has led to more frequent firefights before the shieldbreaker fully spawns. It also makes raids bigger and more chaotic. It did cause some performance issues during those fights that involved most or all of the players, something Wildlight warned could be an issue. Hopefully, performance can be improved in 5v5 matches because it’s easily the best way to play <em>Highguard</em> and likely should have been the primary mode the game launched with last month.</p>

 <p>All that said, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">I’m not sitting here suggesting <em>Highguard</em></a> is suddenly a great game now. A lot of <em>Highguard’s</em> issues aren’t solved by adding more players. There are still too many competing mechanics causing issues, the visuals are bland, heroes are dull, combat seems too sweaty for more casual players, and collecting loot isn’t much fun. 5v5 doesn’t change that, even if it does make the game more fun to play.</p>

 <p>I suspect this 5v5 mode will be enough to help <em>Highguard</em> escape <em>Concord’s</em> fate and let it stick around for a few more weeks at least. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I’m not convinced the world needed another online-only team-based PVP hero shooter, even if it now supports 10 players in a match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new actual play live show is making the rounds. <a href="https://www.glasscannonnetwork.com/tour" rel="nofollow">Glass Cannon Network are selling tickets for Call of Cthulhu Live</a>, a live show that blends improvised storytelling, live performances, and the distinct, Lovecraftian cosmic horror associated with the franchise.</p><h2>The Call of Cthulhu Live Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, Call of Cthulhu Live features a fresh approach to the live experience. The show will be a national tour, featuring special guests like Keeper Troy Levallee and players Joe O' Brien, Skid Maher, Matthew Capodicasa, Jared Logan, Ross Bryant, Rob Kerkovich, Sydney Amanuel, Noura Ibrahim, Mary Lou, and more.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fresh spin on the material is that each show will feature a standalone investigation. Cast members and special guests will vary from show to show, ensuring that every experience at each venue is different. The closest comparison is another live play, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow">Dimension 20 Time Quangle</a>, except that show had the same cast playing different characters across different settings.</p><p>This structure is in keeping with Chaosium's <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> RPG. Based off the work of H. P. Lovecraft, the stories involve investigators uncovering the presence of supernatural forces beyond mortal understanding. The RPG is a tabletop staple, debuting in 1981. The game, currently on its seventh edition, stands alongside older peers like Cyberpunk and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p><p>In keeping with the source material, investigations usually end badly in <em>Call of Cthulhu</em>. Investigators either die or go irreversibly mad from the cursed knowledge they learn by the end. Because of this, investigations are usually self-contained affairs, lending themselves an episodic story structure. A fact to which Call of Cthulhu Live appears to be taking advantage.</p><p>If you are unable to physically attend the shows, the Los Angeles performance of Call of Cthulhu Live will be livestreamed, with digital tickets on sale for that show. It is unclear at this time if this show will appear on VOD.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> is on the verge of turning 10, but it’s not slowing down any time soon. While developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone previously stated he was shifting away from development on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>to work on his next game, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/haunted-chocolatier-stardew-valley-abandoned-release-date-2000664261"><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i></a><span>, he’s now doubling down on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>with news about an upcoming update.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview"><span>a massive interview with </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> published on Tuesday, Barone revealed some exciting details about the game’s 1.7 update. Possibly most importantly, he revealed that he’s adding two more marriage candidates, though just who they are will remain under wraps until the game’s tenth anniversary on February 26. He also teased long-awaited improvements to the game’s children, which are considered notoriously boring by…most of the game’s players.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other features possibly headed to 1.7 include a farm map editor, which would allow players to build their own maps instead of using the game’s presets. He even raised the idea of adding a social feature to let players share their map designs, which he tied to a staunch refusal of generative AI: “I’m interested in ways to make the game more just infinitely replayable without the use of AI. That’s never going to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has been occasionally teasing 1.7 since September, but prior to Tuesday, he’s only </span><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?s=20"><span>vaguely hinted</span></a><span> at “new character/social stuff” as well as the update’s obligatory new farm type.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Aside from 1.7, he also said he’d consider developing </span><i><span>Stardew Valley 2 </span></i><span>(and even started work on a sequel at one point but seemingly abandoned it). “In fact, I would love to because it would be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012,” he said.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Chocolate Versus Countryside&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>While Barone clearly has big plans for </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span>, he’s also spent the past few weeks opening up about the struggle to balance new </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>content with work on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/"><span>a blog post late last month</span></a><span>, he revealed he feels that he “shouldn’t have announced the game so early.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has seemingly flipped between development on the two games quite a bit. Initially, </span><i><span>Stardew</span></i><span> wasn’t even supposed to receive a 1.7 update—in 2025, Barone assured us that he was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><span>“committed to not working on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>until I’m done with </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>.”</span></a><span> In this latest interview, though, he said that he’s still working on both and has even expanded his team in order to delegate work on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>updates. While he admitted “the progress isn’t as fast as I would like,” he stated he feels he’s able to take his sweet time on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span> thanks to its lack of preorders and crowdfunding.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the meantime, </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>1.7 should tide us over. I’m especially intrigued by the promise of new marriage candidates. Is he adding entirely new characters to the game? Does the addition of exactly two candidates imply that there was some big, juicy divorce in town? We’ll have to wait until the game’s anniversary rolls around on February 26 to find out.</span></p>

There are plenty of rumors going around regarding what will be shown during the February 4, 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET show, as players look forward to seeing what comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Season 20: Vendetta.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-1-1770145039517.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/03/overwatch-talon-2-1770145042777.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch Taken Over by Talon. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As of last week, however, there is one big question on everyone’s mind: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1qp1ex6/yall_got_this_email_too/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Why did Talon take control of Overwatch</u></a>? Blizzard issued a hostile takeover hotfix last week, changing all iconography from the familiar Overwatch logo to that of the in-universe antagonist faction, Talon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been an unexpected, unexplained villain arc that’s continued through to today, with even official social media accounts affected by the changes. With confusion in the air, it would be strange if Blizzard <em>didn’t </em>talk about Talon during tomorrow’s showcase, so we’re hoping to find out what role it might play in Season 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Overwatch Spotlight is a shared moment with our community, for our community,” a recent <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24250387/step-into-the-spotlight/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> from the Overwatch team says. “A chance to see where the game is headed, hear directly from the team, and step into the next chapter side by side.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, several clues have the community expecting a more fundamental change for Overwatch 2. Specifically, fans across the internet believe this so-called “next chapter” will see the number 2 dropped from the Overwatch title altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speculation began when Blizzard announced the event last week, as audiences noticed the Overwatch logo featured on official artwork was missing its 2. It’s led many to assume the first-person live-service game could either soon drop the number, or that tomorrow’s showcase should cover information outside of Overwatch 2 itself. Theories for the former started to hold more weight when players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1qro4n1/overwatch_2_invasion_bundle_renamed_to_overwatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seemed to find evidence</u></a> suggesting its story-centered Invasion Bundle had dropped the two from its name, as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hero shooter, which first launched in 2016 and will celebrate its 10-year anniversary this year, went through a major revamp in October 2022 that saw it transformed into Overwatch 2. It gained three new heroes – Sojourn, Kiriko, and Junker Queen – a visual overhaul, gameplay changes across its dozens of heroes, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-becomes-worst-user-reviewed-game-on-steam-ever-even-as-tens-of-thousands-turn-up-to-play"><u>a lot of hate</u></a>, as players criticized <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-offering-double-xp-and-free-skin-as-apology-for-rough-launch"><u>its unstable launch</u></a> and the controversial adjustments to its monetization strategy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the more problematic changes have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>reverted or altered</u></a> in the years since launch, with 6v6 queue options, additional heroes, map adjustments, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>even loot boxes</u></a> all added within the past year alone. It’s resulted in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>a small resurgence</u></a> for the game, as players turn up as Blizzard attempts to steer toward a brighter tomorrow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another talking point players are hoping to see brought up includes what could be in store for next Season, such as potentially new maps, another collaboration or crossover, Perk reworks, and a theme. Fans are also hoping to see what its next hero may look like after Vendetta was added in Season 20, though the Overwatch team typically launches just one hero every other season, so we may have a slightly longer wait in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last time the studio put hype like this behind a showcase was last year’s February event, suggesting that whatever the developers have planned for tomorrow will likely be huge. Like the 2025 Spotlight, Blizzard has parternered with a<a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2018469470692360432?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> long list of some of the biggest streamers</a> for this year's show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, you can see how the inclusion of the latest major mode addition, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap"><u>Stadium</u></a>, had Overwatch players <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>having fun for the first time in a long time</u></a>.

<figure data-uuid="5cce4b9bd2ec7"><a title="Stardew Valley Sebastian" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cce4b9bd2ec7/stardew-valley-sebastian.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Stardew Valley</a> celebrates its 10th anniversary later this month. Yes, really. On 26th February 2026, ConcernedApe's monumental farming sim will turn a decade old. It came to Switch in 2017 and, in the time since it's release, has sold millions of copies and has consistently received a number of big free updates, with the next one — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/stardew-valley-creator-announces-version-1-7-update">update 1.7</a> — on the horizons.</p>
<p>And, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> ahead of the game's big birthday, Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone gave us a little tease of what to expect from the upcoming update, and they're related to children and marriage.</p><div><figure data-videoid="r3KMxc-vq0o" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytr3KMxc-vq0o" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3KMxc-vq0o?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed35e359pxirkg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Barone admitted he's "trying to not reveal too much because I like for it to be a surprise", but allowed himself to slip in a few little details into the chat: "Well, there is a popular fan request, which has to do with the children, trying to make the children a little more interesting."</p>
<p>Right now, children don't really have a function in the game — they're key to getting the Full House achievement, and you get some extra dialogue with your spouse, but that's about it. Perhaps we'll be able to talk to them more or maybe they can help on the farm when they're old enough. Who knows!</p>
<p>But long-time fans will also be excited to know that Barone is going to be "adding two more marriage candidates, but I'll reveal who it is on the anniversary day." There are currently 12 marriage candidates in-game, so this will bring up the list of eligible bachelors to 14. And of course, there are no gender restrictions here, either.</p>

<p>Of course, those aren't the only two things coming with update 1.7, which Barone also teases: "...there's a lot of other things in the update as well that no one's really asked for, but I think people will appreciate it."</p>
<p>Sounds like we'll find out a little bit more — at least on the marriage candidates — on 26th February, then! Perhaps we'll get an update on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">Switch 2 Edition patch and European release</a>, too.</p>
<p>Make sure you give <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">the full interview a read</a> for some lovely little tidbits about Barone's time developing the game, including how he comes up with ideas, his love of David Lynch, and the fact there's still a secret no one has discovered in-game.</p>
<p>Barone also mentions his next game, <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong>, which last week <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/i-am-not-going-to-abandon-haunted-chocolatier-concernedape-responds-to-fan-concerns">he had to calm fears about 'abandoning"</a> due to the long development time.</p>

			<p>The meteoric rise and sustained success of <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"><strong>Embark Studio's</strong> new third-person extraction shooter</a>, <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>, will be one for the history books of the video game industry if things keep going the way they are currently going. A new report from <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-was-once-again-steams">Alinea Analytics</a> claims that for <strong>the third consecutive month</strong>, ARC Raiders was the number one selling title across <strong>Steam, PlayStation</strong>, and <strong>Xbox</strong>.</p>



<p>That month was, of course, <strong>January 2026</strong>, during which Alinea Analytics says ARC Raiders sold an additional <strong>1.5 million copies</strong> just on Steam. On PlayStation and Xbox, it combined for an additional <strong>1.7 million copies sold</strong>, bringing the game's total lifetime sales to an estimated <strong>15 million copies sold</strong> across all platforms, generating an estimated <strong>$500 million in revenue</strong>, according to Alinea Analytics.</p>



<p>The game even hit a new record for monthly active users (MAU), reaching <strong>10 million MAUs</strong> in January, an increase of <strong>8%</strong> compared to December, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-estimated-to-have-sold-12-million-copies/">which itself saw a record-high daily active users (DAU) count of <strong>3.2 million players</strong></a> across all platforms.</p>

<p>When ARC Raiders arrived at the end of October 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-2-5-million-copies-in-debut-week/">it sold <strong>2.5 million copies</strong> in its debut week</a>. Less than a week later, it had sold <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/">over 4 million copies</a></strong> and even hit concurrent player counts of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-continues-strong-launch-hits-700k-concurrent-players/">over 700K players on Steam</a></strong>. A few weeks later, it had eclipsed <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/">7.7 million copies sold</a></strong>, and despite it only being out for the last two months of the year, Google's yearly review <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">declared it to be the most-searched video game of 2025</a>.</p>



<p>All of this happened amidst Embark Studios being <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">under fire for its use of <strong>GenAI</strong></a>, as Embark is not afraid <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/">to say with its chest that it will continue to use GenAI tech</a> as it sees fit, and dealing with heavy competition in the shooter genre from other standout hits from 2025, namely, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Of course, the question now is whether ARC Raiders will be able to seriously maintain this level of success and player engagement. As 2026 continues to roll on, the bigger releases set for the year, both ones we know about and ones we don't yet know about, could be what eventually causes players to move away from the game. </p>



<p>That said, it doesn't look like its community is going anywhere, considering the fact that since it launched on Steam, it has only fallen below <strong>100K</strong> concurrent players <strong><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#48h">once at the time of this writing.</a></strong></p>

Instead, AdHoc continued, "during the porting process it became clear that was not the case."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is the key point," AdHoc added. "Nintendo has content guidelines. Our game didn't meet those guidelines, so we made changes that would allow us to release on their platform. That's what happened here. Honestly we thought this would be obvious since we're the devs that released the fully uncensored version of the game on other platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While AdHoc has stated that this explanation was obvious, it has not been able to explain why Cyberpunk 2077 released unedited in most countries around the world, while Dispatch did not. Indeed, many fans have called for Dispatch to get the same treatment, with a censored version released in Japan, where the country's strict rating board has been blamed for not allowing the game to launch unedited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, AdHoc has responded on this point too — if only to say it is prohibited from explaining the situation in more detail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"AdHoc is legally unable to provide further comment on why separate SKUs were not possible for different regions," the company said in a statement to <a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/57271-dispatch-devs-say-uncensored-physical-switch-release-not-possible-can-t-comment-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoNintendo</a>, adding that there was "no possibility" for an uncensored physical edition either, and that it had no physical edition plans to announce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dispatch-is-censored-on-nintendo-switch-due-to-platform-content-criteria-developer-says">fans were shocked to discover that hit superhero game Dispatch had been censored on Nintendo Switch</a> — where enormous black boxes cover nudity and even a character raising their middle finger. While an option to hide these already existed on other platforms, on Switch it is enforced by default, and cannot be toggled off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/people-have-a-right-to-be-pissed-dispatch-developer-apologizes-to-fans-over-nintendo-switch-censorship-says-disclaimer-wasnt-visible-enough">AdHoc apologized to fans and said it that its own disclaimer on the changes should have been more visible</a>, and said fans had a right to be "pissed."

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition-is-out-now/</link>
            <guid>1424419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a lot you can say about Ubisoft’s recent decisions, from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-major-reorganisation-brings-layoffs-game-cancellations-including-sands-of-time-remake-new-creative-houses/">cancelling games</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/ubisoft-close-a-studio-weeks-after-the-workers-vote-to-unionise/">closing studios </a>they have been making big changes, none of which seem to have affected their share price, which has tumbled over 95% over ten years.</p>
<p>But fret not, they have a new release, one that was announced during <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2682515870?t=0h0m1s">Twitch stream</a> that no one appears to have watched.&nbsp;Tom Clancy’s The Division – Definitive Edition is ready for you to download from the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox Store </a>and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP0001-CUSA01262_00-THEDIVISIONDE000">PlayStation Store</a> and includes every single piece of DLC for the ten-year-old game at the bargain price of $49.99/£44.99</p>


<p>So to be clear, this is the first The Division game on PS4/XB1, an online-only multiplayer game that has a player count of just over *checks notes* 700<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/365590/charts/"> combatants on Steam&nbsp;</a>as of the time of writing. The base game has recently been on sale for $4.49. The game is so old that it doesn’t even have cross-play, but PS5 players did get a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/19/the-division-yes-the-first-one-gets-a-ps5-update/">60fps mode back in December.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At this point I would post the trailer for the Definitive Edition, but it doesn’t exist, so I’m sticking to my standard replacement of kittens.</p>
<p><iframe title="1 Hour of Kitten Therapy!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftgcwsBqS0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Get the complete The Division experience in this Definitive Edition! The base game, all three Season Pass expansions, and multiple cosmetic packs await you,” its description reads on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tom-clancys-the-division-definitive-edition/9pgffb0wzpkh">Xbox store</a>. “The Definitive Edition also includes gear sets, weapon skins, and customization options, everything you need to stand out as an elite agent.”</p>

<p>We gave The Division a score of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/03/14/tom-clancys-the-division-review/">8/10 back in 2016 .&nbsp;</a>“At its core, it marries solid cover-based shooting with a loot heavy RPG and an enticingly beautiful setting, but it really comes together when you can team up with friends and take on enemies, whether rebellious AI factions or other agents in the fraught and tense Dark Zone. There are a few foibles, but it’s a game that can easily draw you in and have you playing for hours on end,” said Stefan.</p>
<p>The third game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> was cancelled by Ubisoft last year, with the publisher saying they would focus on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>XDefiant&nbsp;was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">shut down eight months later.&nbsp;</a></p>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that their social deduction multiplayer game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killer-inn">Killer Inn</a> will launch into Steam Early Access on 12th February, with a ‘Free Stay Weekend’ trial and server test coming this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="KILLER INN | Steam???? Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KDtHM343udQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The muder mystery multiplayer m… game will be playable from 10PM GMT on Friday 6th February through to 9:59PM GMT on Monday 9th February on Steam. Everyone that participates in this trial, and that has played a previous closed beta test will receive a special weapon skin and nameplay banner for the full game.</p>
<p>With The Traitors a global TV sensation that adapts the already popular social deduction games of Werewolves and Blood on the Clocktower, Killer Inn could be a hit for those looking for a similar tone of game. But there’s a big injection of extra action to this particular game.</p>
<p>Players are divided into Wolves and Lambs, with the Wolves trying to kill all of the Lambs, while the Lambs try to gather clues and figure out the Wolves. As players are murdered, clues are left behind that give hints as to who the killer was, helping the Lambs narrow down who the Wolves are. When the Lambs are sure of their opponents, they can try to take them down in armed third person shooter combat, ganging up to take on their rivals with whoever they think are allies.</p>

<p>The game will feature 27 playable characters to unlock whether through play or with an optional in-game purchase, each with two unique abilities. The price during Early Access will be a rather modest £8, while the bundle with two extra playable characters, skins and advanced rule editing feature for custom lobbies comes in at £24 for the first two weeks, thanks to a 10% discount.</p>

<p>Not so black and white</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're suckers for a good murder mystery game with a funky visual style, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/posthumous_investigation">The Posthumous Investigation</a> looks like exactly that.</p>
<p>This is an upcoming noir thriller from developer Mother Gaia Studio and publisher CriticalLeap, where you'll be trying to solve the murder of Brás Cubas in 1937 Rio de Janeiro. The catch is that you're caught in a time loop, and will have just one day to get to the bottom of things before everything resets.</p>
<p>The thing that immediately caught our eye with this one is the black-and-white visual style, which lends the whole thing a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_of_the_obra_dinn">Obra Dinn</a>-esque noir flair that we can't help but enjoy. And with 14 different suspects to follow around the loop, we're anticipating more than a few "a-ha" moments to keep the dopamine levels high.</p>
<p>Here's a quick rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens, courtesy of CriticalLeap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Client is the Victim:</strong> Investigate a murder where the only witness is the ghost who hired you.<br>
<strong>Master the Loop:</strong> You have one day to solve the case, but infinite chances. Learn the routines of 14 distinct characters, shadow them through a stylized 1930s Rio, and use knowledge from previous loops to unlock new dialogue paths.<br>
<strong>A Living Literary World:</strong> Inspired by the biting satire of "The Brazilian Shakespeare," Machado de Assis, the game offers a witty, morally ambiguous narrative where no one—not even your client—is completely innocent.<br>
<strong>True Deduction:</strong> No hand-holding. Use your "Thinking Board" to physically connect clues, reconstruct timelines, and identify the killer through pure logic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one arrives on PC at the end of March, and the dev has confirmed that a Switch version is "to follow". Hopefully we won't have to wait too long to see what it's all about.</p>

You know, sometimes I wonder if Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone ever sleeps. At any given moment it sounds like he's working on something, whether that be yet another update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-creator-breaks-silence-to-shoot-down-myths-about-haunted-chocolatier-including-that-2030-release-rumour">or the definitely still in development, just wait a while you silly sausages</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>. And, as it turns out, somewhere along the line, Barone had even considered making Stardew Valley 2.
</p>
<p>
Speaking in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview">IGN</a> to commemorate Stardew Valley's impending 10th anniversary, Barone was asked whether or not he'd consider doing a sequel as opposed to more updates. "Yeah, I would," Barone plainly responded. "In fact, I would love to because it would just be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012, when I started working with Stardew Valley. 
</p>
<p>
"There's something fun about the number of possibilities in a whole new world, which I think would be fun for me. It'd be fun for my team. We'd be really excited about it. It's a bit difficult because people are so attached to Pelican Town and to the villagers in Pelican Town. I do fear a little bit that if it's a whole new cast of characters, people might feel put off by that."
</p>
<p>
Barone also floated the idea of setting Stardew Valley 2 in Pelican Town again, using the same cast but with a new story, but believed he'd have the same problem as just setting it somewhere new. "There was a time where I was starting to work on a Stardew Valley 2, but, I don't know. For various reasons, I moved over to Haunted Chocolatier instead. Haunted Chocolatier you could say is like the Stardew Valley 2, but it's a bit different of a game, so we'll see."
</p><p>
On making that comparison between Haunted Chocolatier and Stardew Valley 2, Barone noted later in the interview how he knows people are expecting his successor game to essentially be a sequel to the beloved farming game, something that weighs on him quite heavily. "That's been a constant struggle is like, 'Do I just do whatever I want and not think about the existing player base or do I try to please the existing player base?' And I feel like there's just going to have to be a little bit of a balance between those things."
</p>
<p>
The full interview is worth a read, as Barone is quite candid about a lot of his feelings and process towards Stardew Valley. Glad it's him making the thing and not me, sounds like a nightmare.

            <guid>1424407</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Barbie maker Mattel announced that it’s planning to make a live-action movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man, one of the company’s biggest flops ever. It’s yet another example of the toy giant tossing everything at the wall as it desperately tries to create another <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-barbie-movie-makeup-flash-games-y2k-lost-media-pc-1850680031"><em>Barbie</em></a>-sized movie success.</p> <p>On February 3, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/tony-the-tattooed-man-tracie-laymon-directing-mattel-movie-1236707313/"><em>Deadline</em> confirmed that Mattel</a> has teamed up with up-and-coming director Tracie Laymon to develop a live-action film based on the toy maker’s failed 1992 product. The toy, <a href="https://failure.museum/tony-the-tattooed-man-1992/">which was quickly pulled from shelves after parents complained</a>, allowed children to cover a nearly nude man in tattoos that could also be applied to kids themselves.</p>

 <p>Making a movie out of this toy is a wild idea that seems destined to fail, assuming it ever even happens. But things get even wilder and funnier when you read the quotes Mattel and the director provided to <em>Deadline</em> about the toy and the film. These are all real, folks!</p> <p>“After seeing <em>Bob Trevino Likes It</em> [Laymon’s recent Sundance flick] and the specificity and emotional depth that Tracie brings to her characters, I knew that she was the perfect person to develop Tony the Tattooed Man,” said Robbie Brenner, Mattel Studios’ President and Chief Content Officer. “It’s a story that feels especially relevant today, one that explores looking beyond first impressions and leading with empathy.”</p>

 <p>Keep in mind, we are talking about a toy that nobody remembers, that Mattel only released in an odd attempt to appeal to boys, and which flopped so hard that buying these figures online is tricky, as they are considered somewhat rare and collectible. With that in mind, let’s check out what the film’s director and writer had to say about the project:</p>

 <p>“I was immediately drawn to Tony the Tattooed Man from the minute I saw his name and then learned about his short-lived journey as a discontinued toy,” said Laymon. “His story is a reminder of the healing power of second chances and not judging a book – or a person – by their cover, a message I believe the world needs right now. It is an honor to partner with Mattel, who are true allies for artists, on a film that will help restore our faith in humanity.”</p> <p>Read those last few words again and truly ponder them. A movie based on Tony the Tattooed Man will “help restore our faith in humanity.” We really do live in the weirdest and worst timeline, huh?</p>

 <p>Perhaps this is all just a way for the people involved to try to get folks talking about the movie. If that’s the case, it worked. Then again, I’ve heard plenty of execs talk earnestly about the dumbest stuff, so I know all of this could also be genuine. Well, as genuine as this crap can be. It all feels like this is a deleted scene from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63br4rwl6IM">Apple TV’s <em>The Studio</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Anyway, good luck, Mattel. I bet this movie will <em>definitely</em> match the success and <a href="https://kotaku.com/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-meme-wikipedia-war-1850664668">cultural impact of 2023’s <em>Barbie</em></a>. I mean, I won’t make that bet, but if <em>you</em> want to waste your money on it, go ahead. I’ll be there to see whatever arrives in theaters.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/02/original-nintendo-switch-passes-the-ds-to-become-nintendos-bestselling-console/</link>
            <guid>1424401</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Although it was finally replaced last year by the new Switch 2, the orginal switch isn’t done just yet. Many recent Switch games (and a handful of major updates, like the one for <em>Animal Crossing</em>) have been released in both Switch and Switch 2 editions, and Nintendo continues to sell all editions of the original console as entry-level systems for those who can’t pay $450 for a Switch 2.</p>
<p>The 9-year-old Switch’s continued availability has helped it clear a milestone, according to the company’s third-quarter financial results (<a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2026/260203_2e.pdf">PDF</a>). As of December 31, 2025, Nintendo says the Switch “has reached the highest sales volume of any Nintendo hardware” with a total of 155.37 million units sold, surpassing the original DS’s lifetime total of 154.02 million units. The console has sold 3.25 million units in Nintendo’s fiscal 2026 so far, including 1.36 million units over the holidays. Those consoles have sold despite price hikes that Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/citing-market-conditions-nintendo-hikes-prices-for-original-switch-consoles/">introduced in August of 2025</a>, citing “market conditions.”</p>
<p>That makes the Switch the second-bestselling game console of all time, just three years after it became <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/nintendos-switch-becomes-the-third-bestselling-console-ever/">the third-bestselling game console of all time</a>. The only frontier left for the Switch to conquer is Sony’s PlayStation 2, which Sony says sold “over 160 million units” over its long life. At its current sales rate (Nintendo predicts it will sell roughly 750,000 Switches in the next quarter), it would take the Switch another couple of years to cross that line, but those numbers are likely to taper off as we get deeper into the Switch 2 era.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google’s Project Genie Shows “Meaningful Progress in Content Generation,” But it “Can’t Replace Creative Vision,” Says Analyst]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/</link>
            <guid>1424377</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/google-project-genie-causes-video-game-stocks-crash/">Last week</a>, <strong>Google</strong> debuted its latest <strong>generative AI</strong> experiment, <strong>Project Genie</strong>. It's a tool capable of generating <strong>interactive three-dimensional environments</strong> made <strong>entirely through generative AI</strong> that you can explore for one solid minute.</p>



<p>All you need to do (after paying the <strong>$250 monthly fee</strong> for <strong>Google's AI Ultra</strong> subscription) is write a prompt to start generating your own game-like worlds, but besides the paywall barrier, there are more than a few limitations to this technology in terms of it becoming the new way to make games.</p>



<p>The fact that it runs at a slide-show speed of 24 frames per second, the fact that you can barely interact with anything in the environment, that the worlds it generates are devoid of any kind of level design, or anything to really do in them, all come to mind before getting to the fact that these worlds only live for one minute at a time.</p>



<p>Still, that didn't stop stock market investors from panicking, causing the shares of major video game industry companies like <strong>Take-Two, Roblox,</strong> and <strong>Unity</strong> to take a nosedive, as if investors suddenly believed the age of game development as we've known it was over, and Project Genie was here to usher in a new age.</p>



<p>Obviously, that won't happen, and even if it does, as <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/">SuperJoost Playlist</a> author and co-founder of SuperData Research, <strong>Joost van Dreunen</strong> puts it, "<em>World models like Genie represent meaningful progress in content generation. <strong>But they can't re</strong></em><strong><em>place the creative vision, narrative depth, and intangible elements that make games memorable</em>.<em>"</em></strong></p>



<p>Dreunen, co-founder of one of the foremost video game industry analytics firms, before selling it to NielsonIQ, <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/engine-failure">offered his take on Project Genie</a> after it was revealed and so significantly impacted the stock market for a day.</p>



<p>The top-level takeaway is the aforementioned obvious, that GenAI models like Genie cannot do the job of top-tier game developers. "<em>Creating compelling game worlds is harder than it seems</em>," Dreunen writes, "<em>much like how AI can't simply prompt its way to the next great American novel.</em>"</p>



<p>Even as the technology improves over time, as these GenAI models certainly will, so long as major players like Google and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/openai-strikes-300-billion-project-stargate-deal-with-oracle-to-build-next-generation-ai-and-cloud-infrastructure/">OpenAI</a></strong> continue to invest in them, Dreunen argues that people won't want to play the games they generate, because people want to experience what expert artists and creatives can do - not what a piece of software that's only iterating on the actual creativity of humans can do.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that, currently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">players</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/">game developers</a> have made it clear that they have no serious love for GenAI tech and games made with GenAI. Dreunen cites the downfall of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-coming-ps5-next-year-xbox-port-under-consideration/">InZoi</a></strong>, but you need only look at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash <strong>Larian Studios</strong> faced</a> after it even flirted with the idea of using GenAI for concept art to see how players feel about the technology.</p>



<p>The only hope that GenAI world models like Project Genie and future iterations that will come after it have, if they have any hope at all, is potentially one day making something that people actually want to experience. Even then, it won't come without actual human input, with creatives using technology like Genie as a tool, if these technologies ever do find a place in game development.</p>



<p>"<em>The horseless carriage phase will pass. When it does, the winners won't be those with the fanciest AI tools. They'll be the ones who used those tools to make something genuinely worth playing</em>."</p>

              <p>Can the latest knock-off Vita out of China impress without breaking the bank? Blizzard QA testers win protections against AI and crunch. And <em>Apex</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends</em> will be unplayable on the original Switch starting later this year. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture is back after unexpectedly taking a day off so this is a bit of a beefier edition.</p> <p>I’m getting to be an old man and recently said “$2 for beans, in this economy?” out loud at the supermarket to nobody in particular. So I feel this <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/miski.bsky.social/post/3mdwvnfrcik24"><em>Earthbound</em> inflation meme</a> deep in my bones.</p> <h2>Anbernic reveals a bunch of new Vita-inspired retro handhelds</h2>  <p>From the Ayn Odin 2 Mini to the Trimu Smart Pro, the market for Vita-likes continues to grow. However, Anbernic, which arguably leads the pack when it comes to new retro and Android-based handhelds, announced new Vita-likes that literally have “Vita” in their names. The RG Vita and Vita Pro come in white and black with some slick little design touches. There’s no pricing yet or specs, so we’ll have to wait to see how they stack up. The Pros look very nice, though. The OG Vita still looks the best, but these should be fun alternatives, at least until Sony announces <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-portable-sony-playstation-handheld-switch-2-1851707119">its own new rumored handheld</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division: The Definitive</em> edition is just a DLC bundle</h2> <p>There was some speculation, and lots of fan copium, <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970">that the recently leaked definitive edition</a> of <em>The Division</em> would be some sort of next-gen port or include new content. Instead, it has appeared on the Xbox store and in the process revealed that it’s simply a new SKU that bundles a bunch of existing DLC for $50. <em>*Long, extended sigh*</em></p> <h2><em>Arknights: Endfield</em>‘s rogue gacha microtransactions, explained</h2> <p>The <em>Genshin Impact</em> meets <em>Factorio</em> action-RPG had to shut off PayPal integration after players randomly got charged thousands of dollars. What happened? “Based on our review, the issue affected 3,429 orders across servers, involving around 1,800 players,” the company told <em>Eurogamer</em> in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.eurogamer.net/arknights-endfield-paypal-problem-explained-80000">a statement</a>. “The total value of the affected orders was approximately $80,000, with the highest single affected transaction amounting to $5,289.” On the plus side, everyone accidentally defrauded gets their money back and the rewards they were accidentally charged for.</p>

 <p>Its new edition includes some extra modes, bosses, and multiplayer minigames. “Nothing here comes close to justifying the $80 price tag attached to <em>Mario Wonder</em>’s Nintendo Switch 2 Edition,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-already-tired-of-nintendo-switch-2-editions-and-even-new-mario-wonder-content-cant-change-that">Plant writes</a>. “Yes, there’s a $20 upgrade pack for folks who already own <em>Wonder</em>, but for new buyers, a visually upgraded version of a 2023 Switch 1 game with a few new Bellabells and whistles costs more than 2025’s Switch 2-exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which just feels completely out of whack.”</p> <h2>Blizzard QA testers ratified their first union contract</h2> <p>It guarantees annual wage increases, protects against mandatory crunch, and includes guardrails for how genAI is used. “After nearly two decades in the video game industry, it feels great to work with my fellow union members in ratifying a fair contract that makes it easier to see a real, long-term career in this work,” Blizzard Austin senior quality analyst Matt Gant <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/blizzard-quality-assurance-workers-ratify-video-game-union-contract-microsoft">said in a press release</a>. “This agreement gives us a better working environment with increased pay, benefits, and layoff protections that include recall rights and ensures that quality assurance work remains a stable and respected role for the workers who will build games long after us.”</p>

 <h2>Sony patents an endlessly customizable PlayStation controller</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-has-patented-a-touchscreen-playstation-controller-that-lets-players-choose-where-to-put-the-buttons/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> on a new PlayStation controller patent that turns the whole thing into a touchpad. It was filed back in 2023 and covers “designs and methods for a game controller.” Instead of remapping the individual buttons, the patented design would allow players to customize where the buttons themselves go. “Due to the size of physical control elements, game controls may be limited. In addition, inclusion of controls can increase controller size,” it reads. “There exists a need and a desire to allow for improvements and modifications to game controllers.” Probably not actually happening anytime soon, but it’s a neat idea!</p> <h2><em>Apex Legends</em> is quietly ditching the OG Switch</h2> <p><a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/2017296851247018038">Respawn announced the move</a> late last week, with season 29 being the final season update to come to the older hardware. “Starting August 4, 2026 (Season 30), <em>Apex Legends</em> will no longer be playable on the Nintendo Switch system,” the studio wrote. “Until August 4, 2026, players can continue to jump into the action, earn rewards, and enjoy matches per usual.”</p> <h2>How does Larian’s new RPG end?</h2> <p>“With a lot of fire.” The tease came from CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNKGRnvy5ds">during a studio livestream</a> of <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> on Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="8dfe57f054943"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined Ruff" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8dfe57f054943/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-ruff.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>2026 marks 40 years of the <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> series, a staggering achievement for one of the RPG genre's biggest and brightest. Known for its cosy atmosphere, warm character, humour, and iconic art, Dragon Quest is due a big year, and Square Enix is kicking things off with a brand new "reimagining" — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined.</a></p>
<p>Bringing what is regarded as one of the longest RPGs of the PlayStation era to Switch 1 and Switch 2, Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined has attracted joy — and a few raised eyebrows — for streamlining events and making a few tweaks to the game. What was a 100+ hour experience (or 70-ish-hours on 3DS) is now much leaner. So, how to you retain the magic when you're trying to appeal to new audiences, but make sure that old fans are satisfied?</p>
<p>We had a chance to ask the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, a few questions about the upcoming reimagining — which, for the record, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">we absolutely loved</a>. Ichikawa has worked on the Dragon Quest series since 2018, starting out with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> as an assistant producer.</p>
<p>As a long-time fan of the series, we asked him about his experience with the original PS version, what changes were difficult to make, and whether the team got to share their work with the series' artist, the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life: Before we dive into Reimagined, can you share with us the first time you experienced Dragon Quest VII, and what you thought of the game - PlayStation or 3DS version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takeshi Ichikawa, Producer of Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined:</strong> I was in the lower grades of elementary school when I first played the PlayStation version. I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?” and I don’t think I managed to clear the whole game back then.</p>
<p>When I played it again as an adult, I was able to complete it successfully, and I found the dark world filled with irrationality especially striking and modern.</p>
<figure data-uuid="84316e918d5fb"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/84316e918d5fb/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>There’s a lot of pressure to keep the traditions of Dragon Quest intact while modernising certain aspects. How do you juggle those expectations with a game like Dragon Quest VII Reimagined?</strong></p>
<p>As a major title with a passionate fanbase, there was certainly pressure. However, the excitement of being able to deliver this beloved franchise in a way that feels fresh outweighed it, and I believe we were able to enjoy the development process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I remember thinking at the very beginning, “When will the battles start?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Having worked on previous Dragon Quest games before in various different ways, how different is it working on a remake like Reimagined to say, a mainline entry such as Dragon Quest XI or a spin-off like Dragon Quest Builders 2?</strong></p>
<p>In a remake, we believe it’s essential not only to offer players a fresh experience but also to preserve the charm of the original version. Striking the right balance between these two is crucial.</p>
<p><strong>Given that it’s a big year for Dragon Quest in 2026 with the 40th anniversary, why is this year the right time to return to Dragon Quest VII? And why kick off the celebrations with this one?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past originally released in 2000 - so this year is its 26th Anniversary! Because of this, we felt it was the perfect time to bring its storytelling and unique atmosphere to a wider audience - especially now, in today’s world.</p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII Reimagined not only “reimagines” the story and emotional portrayal of its characters but also makes the game significantly more approachable and accessible. We believe this game will be enjoyable for both previous DRAGON QUEST VII players and newcomers alike!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e6e3829828eaf"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e6e3829828eaf/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the diorama style that’s used in Reimagined? Why did you decide to go with something completely different, as opposed to the HD-2D style used for Dragon Quest III and Dragon Quest I &amp; II?</strong></p>
<p>The original DRAGON QUEST VII was defined by Akira Toriyama’s designs, featuring charming, stylized characters. We considered how to convey that cuteness while still capturing the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>
<p>At the same time, we discovered that movies and games featuring doll motifs were well-received globally, which inspired us to combine this concept with DRAGON QUEST VII’s character designs. We felt this approach would create a visually appealing style, leading to the visual expression seen in the game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama. However, as mentioned earlier, we kept in mind throughout production that the visual style needed to match the charm of his adorable illustrations.</p>
<p><strong>Dragon Quest is usually known for being lighthearted and charming – at least, it always feels very cozy to us! But Dragon Quest VII is often considered one of the darker entries. How do you balance this and do you make any changes in Reimagined to lean more one way rather than the other?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is a work whose appeal lies in two aspects: the irrational and dark scenarios encountered throughout the journey, and the exciting coming-of-age story of an ordinary boy growing into the savior of the world. This title preserves that appeal while reimagining it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8152e720c2622"><a title="Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8152e720c2622/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You’ve talked about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/10/heres-how-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-team-streamlined-its-main">streamlining the game’s narrative</a> and the discussions you had on which scenarios you wanted to keep, rather than get rid of. How tough was it to cut the sections you eventually settled on, and do you have a favourite that was a must-keep for the final game?</strong></p>
<p>We felt that reimagining the scenario was necessary to create a more fast-paced and immersive narrative experience. Throughout the process, we consciously made adjustments to ensure that the original version’s unique atmosphere and core story remained intact.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to sum up Dragon Quest VII Reimagined in one sentence (or one word if you want a challenge), what would it be?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, we never had the opportunity to show this work to Toriyama.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This title allows you to experience the irrational nature of the world and the exciting story of growth that lies beyond.</p>
<p><strong>And finally, to wrap up this interview, what does Dragon Quest mean to you? And how will you be celebrating the 40th anniversary?</strong></p>
<p>DRAGON QUEST VII is the story of the growth of a boy from humble beginnings, and I hope that, through developing this title, I too have grown. I would be delighted if this game could serve as the beginning of delivering a wonderful 40th anniversary celebration of DRAGON QUEST to everyone.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>This interview has been slightly edited for clarity and flow.</em></p>
<p>Thank you to Ichikawa-san and the team at Square Enix for making the time to speak to us.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined launches on Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>. Will this be your first time playing the game, or did you play it on PlayStation or 3DS? Let us know down below!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crimson Desert Surpassed 2M Wishlists; Rep Says It’s in the Middle Between The Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-2-million-wishlists-middle-the-witcher-3-zelda/</link>
            <guid>1424338</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2018685912973242632?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced today</a> that the upcoming open world action/adventure game <strong>Crimson Desert</strong> has been wishlisted by <strong>over two million users across all platforms</strong>. </p>



<p>It is yet another strong confirmation of the mounting hype behind Crimson Desert. It's been a while since the market got a fantasy triple-A open world game of this scale (<strong>the world is said to be twice as big as Skyrim's</strong>), after all, and fans can't wait to get their hands on the game after many years of development.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in addition to celebrating wishlist milestones, Pearl Abyss is still sharing little nuggets about the game to keep players hooked until the <strong>March 19</strong> launch date. Just yesterday, we reported <span>on an interview in which PR Director&nbsp;<strong>Will Powers</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank">discussed the extensive amount of content players will encounter</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-campaign-very-small-percentage-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> beyond the main campaign</a> in Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>Now, another interview featuring Powers has appeared on YouTube. This time, the PR Director <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4dacjty4cYE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hosted by Luke Stephens</a>, who at some point said he felt the game leaned more toward Nintendo's <strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong> than CD Projekt RED's <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> in terms of gameplay dynamics versus narrative. The Pearl Abyss rep countered that <strong>Crimson Desert is actually squarely in the middle between those two open world masterpieces</strong>:</p>



<p><em>If you're going to do it a scale from one side to the other.... There's narrative driven cutscenes in there, too, so I don't want to put it on the far scale there because it's much more in the middle. In The Witcher 3, what drives you through that game is the story. First and foremost, that is a story-driven game. CDPR has created this immersive, amazing, story-driven world. We sit in between those. Is it more one or the other? It's literally right in between because you have that central thread that's pulling you through it, but then there's those narrative-driven like cinematics and everything that are very heavy story. But it's not like The Witcher 3 in the sense that CDPR's game is story, story, story focused.</em></p>



<p>Of course, that's not to say the game's overall quality will be comparable to those two. The Witcher 3 and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild are <strong>two of the highest rated open world games ever made</strong>, only comparable to <strong>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto</strong> and <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> franchises in this regard. Pearl Abyss would likely be happy just with getting relatively close in terms of critical reception.</p>

The purpose of a Tamagotchi is to have a tiny, portable digital pet with you at all times that you can feed and feed and feed until it grows into something slightly bigger, different, a new creature almost. It's generally a sweet, albeit potentially irritating (the beeps…) little micro-game that may cause a touch of stress, but certainly no feelings of fear. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-full-bloom">In Full Bloom</a>, however, asks "what if your Tamagotchi was actually a blob of an organism with nothing but a mouth that you must continuously feed… or else…"
</p>
<p>
The Tamagotchi connection to In Full Bloom is an explicit one, the '90s classic toys are directly mentioned on the game's Steam page. Yet instead of finding the likes of Mametchi, or Kuchipatchi, or Ichigotchi, you just have… "the mouth." This mouth is, maybe, I'm not sure, something akin to an amoeba? Or really a lump of flesh adorned with nothing but a single orifice it uses to consume whatever you place inside of it. This, in its totality, is the game.
</p>
<p>
You take your mouse, you click and hold on an object with the left button, bring it to the mouth's mouth, and release. And bit by bit it grows. And you start to notice changes. Those dents, is it forming eyes? Right there… it has teeth now. More teeth. More teeth. Even more teeth, a dentist's nightmare amount of teeth. It continues to get bigger too, so you must feed it larger and larger objects until… well, I'm not sure. There's a demo available to try, but it only goes so far, though judging from the game's page it can get as big as a planet.
</p>
<p>
There is admittedly not much game here on a technical level. Yet it still makes for a deeply uncomfortable experience. Some excellent sound design fuels the sensations from dread as you contribute to this thing's growth. I was left with a few questions from the demo too, particularly around who I am meant to be if there is a person feeding it. Neat stuff! I won't sleep tonight! If you'd like to join me in the night terrors, you can try out the demo, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3810240/In_Full_Bloom/">here</a>.
