<p>It has been revealed that Call of Duty is getting a crossover that wasn’t on many prediction slates for 2025. On December 11, a <strong>Street Fighter collaboration </strong>is landing in Call of Duty Mobile, bringing four legendary characters from the fighting franchise into the first-person shooter world.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Street Fighter crossover will yield new Operators, a host of themed weapons linked to the Street Fighter universe, and more exclusive rewards for those participating in the event through December.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-street-fighter-come-to-call-of-duty">When Does Street Fighter Come to Call of Duty?</h2>



<p>Call of Duty Mobile fans can take advantage of the Street Fighter crossover starting December 11, when the Hero’s Collection Operator Series Armory opens up, officially introducing the Street Fighter characters to COD Mobile.</p>



<p>The lineup includes some of the most recognizable characters from the fighting game’s roster:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ryu</li>



<li>Chun-Li</li>



<li>Akuma</li>



<li>Cammy</li>
</ul>



<p>On December 13, the crossover will be expanded via the Champion’s Collection Weapon Series Armory, which introduces the unique weapon skins to bolster the collaboration.</p>



<p>It’s a bold crossover that nobody really anticipated, but it’s a welcome one nonetheless. Call of Duty Mobile is, without a doubt, the most expansive and popular COD title ever made, and it’s doing the live-service model perfectly compared to the annual releases of the core multiplayer shooters.</p>



<p>This collaboration heralds the game’s sixth anniversary, and it’s the latest in a <strong>very </strong>long line of crossover events. In recent history, we’ve seen the likes of Gundam, Nier, Rambo, and even sporting icons like Lionel Messi make their way into the Call of Duty Mobile universe.</p>



<p>Will you be participating in Call of Duty Mobile’s Street Fighter crossover? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gentle-mates-beat-optic-texas-kaysan-tournament/</link>
            <guid>1368904</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The all-new Gentle Mates CDL roster has stepped up and shocked the scene to secure a win in Kaysan’s $50,000 Black Ops 7 tournament. The Kaysan Showdown VIII was the perfect opener for the Black Ops 7 season, pulling together four teams with unparalleled prospects for the upcoming year of competitive play.</p>



<p>It was FaZe Vegas, LA Thieves, OpTic Texas, and Gentle Mates that took to the stage, but when the dust settled, it was a surprise for many to see Gentle Mates standing with the trophy (virtually, of course).</p>







<h2 id="h-an-unpredictable-season">An Unpredictable Season</h2>



<p>On paper, nobody would have thought that Gentle Mates would beat the other three teams. You’ve got the back-to-back-to-back world champions in OpTic Texas, the cash-backed ‘super team’ in LA Thieves, and FaZe Vegas, a new, rebranded roster with serious potential.</p>



<p>Gentle Mates <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gentlemates-cdl-roster-revealed-2026-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its new roster</a> just days ago, revealing the squad that will carry the hopes of the French organization through the 2026 CDL season. If Kaysan’s tournament is anything to go by, those hopes are <strong>high</strong>.</p>



<p>The clips emerging from the tournament, which was an online event, were white-hot, showcasing a blistering Gentle Mates side that leaned heavily into the fast-flowing nature of Black Ops 7, which launched last month to a mixed reception at best.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Gentle Mates is going all in with this Call of Duty League roster through the 2026 season. Last year was a poor showing for the organization, which only just surfaced in the COD space after acquiring the LAG spot and rebranding for the impending season.</p>



<p>The new roster signing, a jersey refresh, and promoting some new sponsorships, like a clean Scuf controller variety, are all indications of Gentle Mates’ investment in Call of Duty.</p>

<p>The <strong>VALORANT Game Changers Championship</strong>, a massive $500,000 tournament, has wrapped in South Korea, leaving Team Liquid Brazil the victor over all comers. Ten of the best women’s and marginalized-gender teams came together in Seoul to fight for a considerable prize, and in the closing moments of the tournament, it all came down to two rival teams.</p>



<p>The Grand Final was a dramatic showdown between Team Liquid Brazil and Shopify Rebellion Gold, two of the most capable squads in the Game Changers scene. What unravelled was one hell of a VALORANT series.</p>



<h2 id="h-team-liquid-secures-180-000-in-seoul">Team Liquid Secures $180,000 in Seoul</h2>



<p>Shopify Rebellion Gold broke into the Grand Final after a defiant lower-bracket run, meeting Team Liquid, the tournament’s dominant upper-bracket organisation sitting on a white-hot streak. The best-of-five final lived up to the expectations set by fans, with both sides trading maps as the series unravelled.</p>



<p>Shopify led the charge with an easy win on Haven, but the series was set to go the distance, and it went down to the wire on the final map.</p>



<p>Team Liquid’s win denied Shopify a third consecutive Game Changers Championship win, and it was a redemption of sorts for the former team, having collapsed against Shopify during the 2023 Championship Final.</p>



<p>Beyond the Grand Final, the Game Changers tournament in Seoul represented the power of the Americas in the VALORANT space. MIBR GC and KRU Blaze brought up the rear, securing a third- and fourth-place finish, respectively, both of which hail from South America.</p>



<p>Team Liquid walks away from Seoul with the trophy and $180,000 in earnings, which is a nice payday after a hard-fought tournament.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Turok Origins To Be Released in 2026, Dev Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/turok-origins-release-in-2026-dev-claims/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Turok Origins was given a short but sweet reveal trailer by Saber Interactive almost a year ago, and since then, things have run quiet. We’ve got a few details about the game, and fans of the title have busied themselves pulling every shred of information out of that trailer, but until now, Saber has remained mostly silent on the topic.</p>



<p>Recently, one developer’s profile was uncovered on LinkedIn, bearing a clear indication that Turok Origins, which doesn’t have a release window at present, will launch in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-turok-origins-coming-out">When is Turok Origins Coming Out?</h2>



<p>If you head over to the Turok Origins website, you’ll see that it can be wishlisted on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series XS, and Steam, but there’s no indication of a release window – <strong>not even a year</strong>.</p>



<p>It has been a fair while since Turok Origins was revealed, and fans are wondering when this all-new dinosaur-slaying epic could drop.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered on a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/javi-bermejo-969b1a181/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">developer’s LinkedIn profile</a> that Turok Origins is ‘forthcoming’ in 2026:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The developer, a sound designer, also worked on Saber’s Radikal Fighters and is supporting the development of an ‘unannounced project’ at the studio.</p>



<p>Turok Origins is said to take players across various worlds as they explore a multitude of biomes throughout an immersive, ‘epic story’ that can be experienced either alone or with friends. The game has a diverse array of weapons and abilities to uncover, and it can reportedly be digested from both a first- and third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Here’s the snapshot trailer, in case you’re interested:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Goes Full Liquidation on Fitbit Charge 6, Now at Record Low for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-full-liquidation-on-fitbit-charge-6-now-at-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648957</link>
            <guid>1368814</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low</strong>, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn’t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/"> has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159</a> (which is a new record low).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Charge 6 has the <strong>best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made</strong>, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don’t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The <strong>built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides</strong> with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6’s touchscreen</strong> interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet.</p>



<p>Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. <em>Zone of Activity Minutes</em> count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration.</p>
<p>With normal use, <strong>like 24/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync</strong>, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don’t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn’t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day.</p>



<p>Smart notifications keep you connected by <strong>showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen</strong> of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the <strong>device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones</strong> and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges.</p>
<p>When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.</p>

            <guid>1368811</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A small yet highly credible video clip of GTA 6 has surfaced online. While it is from an in-development build, it does give fans an interesting insight as to how the game will look, gameplay-wise.</p>



<p>As one of 2026’s biggest upcoming games, Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto 6 has a lot riding on it. Through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">countless delays</a>, fans have been eagerly anticipating driving and robbing the state of Leonida for almost 10 years. Unfortunately, the trailers have seemingly only shown cutscenes, with raw gameplay yet to be put on display. That is, however, until now, as a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel has surfaced featuring a small video snippet of potential gameplay from GTA 6.</p>







<h2 id="h-former-rockstar-employee-s-video-portfolio-includes-gta-6-gameplay">Former Rockstar Employee’s Video Portfolio Includes GTA 6 Gameplay</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An ACTUAL GTA 6 leak has surfaced:</p><p>A former Rockstar employee has included GTA 6 development footage in their demo reel, this shows off a few animations for exiting bicycles and Monster Trucks.</p><p>Ocean Drive is clearly visible in the second clip</p><p> <a href="https://t.co/tZNhtByYrC">pic.twitter.com/tZNhtByYrC</a></p></div>— Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SynthPotato</a> found the clip from a former Rockstar employee’s demo reel portfolio. The name of the employee was, of course, not disclosed. Still, the reel has several animations from other Rockstar games like Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption 2, furthering its validity. From the looks of it, it seems the employee worked on a bit of GTA 6 prior to leaving.</p>



<p>As for what the clip is, it’s not a lot. The video, <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1995220816527835469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available above</a>, simply shows a character (unsure if NPC or player) dismounting from vehicles. While the first half shows a bike, the second has a render of Vice City, alongside what appears to be Lucia, one of GTA 6’s playable characters. It looks like it showcases how many ways the player character can dismount from a car, which is a rather neat detail.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the video is all fans have to go off of for GTA 6’s gameplay. With the recent November 19th, 2026, delay, it may be some time before more is shown. However, if the level of detail for even the simplest of vehicle dismounts is any indication, it might be the most realistic entry yet.</p>

Likewise, Epic has added a few new types of items that have no real precedent in Fortnite, and some of them are exceptionally powerful.</p><p>But for this story, the biggest new addition is the boss kits, which drop when you defeat an NPC boss. These kits are locked in your inventory until you win the round or die, make you look like the boss the kit came from, and give you increased health and stamina, and an ability unique to that boss that you have to activate manually by using the item.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-airpods-pro-3-for-cyber-monday-liquidates-black-friday-leftovers-at-record-low-price-2000648949</link>
            <guid>1368796</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with the AirPods Pro 3 a few months ago, and as usual, the company won’t directly discount its newest high-end earbuds. Amazon really stepped up on Black Friday with a big price drop on these great wireless earbuds and the good news is that the store decided to keep the discount going and even make it bigger for Cyber Monday. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon has them marked down to $219 right now, reduced from Apple’s standard $249 price</a>, creating the best deal we’ve seen on these earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Double Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already great AirPods Pro 2</strong>, and they create isolation that is as good as that of over-ear headphones, but in a small in-ear package. That better noise cancellation works by using microphones that pick up sounds from the outside world and computer-generated audio that creates exact anti-noise in real time.</p>
<p>When<strong> you turn on transparency mode</strong>, the earbuds let outside sounds in so you can hear conversations and environmental cues without taking them off. Apple improved this mode by adding active hearing protection that automatically lowers loud sounds from the environment like construction noise or subway screeches, while still letting normal sounds through.</p>



<p>The new acoustic architecture changes the sound quality by <strong>giving the bass more depth, making the voices sound</strong> incredibly clear across the frequency range, and making the vocals sound incredibly present. <strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make three-dimensional soundscapes that put sound sources around you in space. This makes movies and supported music feel more immersive than traditional stereo can.</p>
<p>Heart rate sensing is a real game-changer for earbuds because they have built-in sensors that track your pulse while you work out without needing chest straps or wrist-based monitors. The earbuds keep track of heart rate and calories burned <strong>during more than 50 different types of workouts</strong>, and they then automatically sync this data to Apple Health for full fitness tracking. When you connect your iPhone, you can use the activity rings, step counting, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence that gives you personalized training suggestions.</p>



<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s live translation</strong> feature makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages by providing real-time translation. The feature works by processing speech on your iPhone and translating between supported languages, and the translation plays through your earbuds while the other person hears their native language through your phone’s speaker. This conversational translation works well enough for travel, business meetings, or casual conversations where language differences would normally make it hard to communicate.</p>
<p>When you turn on active noise cancellation, the battery lasts for eight hours. When you use transparency mode with the hearing aid feature on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours. That runtime lasts through full workdays, long flights, or long listening sessions without needing to charge the case. The USB-C charging case lets you charge your device multiple times, <strong>and gives you more than 30 hours of total listening time</strong> before you need to plug it in. <strong>Five different ear tip sizes</strong> make sure that everyone can find a secure, comfortable fit that creates the right acoustic seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>When you think about how these just came out a few months ago and Apple never directly discounts new products, getting the AirPods Pro 3 for $219 is a good deal. These earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday for $30 less than their regular price, and they have features that other products won’t have for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-with-9-weeks-self-empty-crashes-to-record-low-cyber-monday-goes-zero-profit-for-final-clearance-2000648933</link>
            <guid>1368784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.</p>
<p>For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359</a> and this is the lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag</h2>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin</strong> into a sealed bag <strong>that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair</strong>&nbsp;and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.</p>
<p>Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair</strong> that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.</p>



<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models,<strong> this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random</strong> and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.</p>
<p>This <strong>combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes</strong> in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.</p>



<p>The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The <strong>design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs</strong>&nbsp;which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.</p>
<p>For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbooks-survived-black-friday-and-apple-went-even-lower-new-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648940</link>

              <p>Apple avoids running direct promotions on its products but Amazon has taken matters into its own hands with aggressive discounting throughout this shopping season. The online giant crushed MacBook Air M4 sales during Black Friday after slashing prices significantly, but Cyber Monday brings an even deeper cut that pushes the deal into record territory.</p>
<p>Right now, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, 16GB unified memory, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">256GB storage is going for $738, down from Apple’s standard $999 price</a> and undercuts even the Black Friday deal by roughly $10<strong> to hit an all-time low for Cyber Monday</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip has desktop-level performance that can handle tough tasks like editing 4K video, doing complicated spreadsheet calculations, or running multiple virtual machines without breaking a sweat. Apple’s second-generation 3-nanometer architecture packs more transistors into less space while using less power which means that it can process data faster and use less power than the already impressive M3 generation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a big step up from the 8GB base model that Apple used to ship and makes it easy to multitask across dozens of browser tabs, creative apps, and background processes. That <strong>memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share resources</strong> without the slowdowns that happen on regular laptops when the graphics and processor have to fight for separate memory pools.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts about 18 hours of normal</strong> use so you can get through a whole day of meetings, document editing, and web browsing without having to look for outlets. That level of performance stays the same whether you’re running on battery or plugged in, which is a problem with many Windows laptops when they’re unplugged. The MacBook Air is completely silent when it’s running because it doesn’t have a fan.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and is 500 nits bright</strong> so photos and videos look great with bright colors and deep contrast. Text looks sharp at the native resolution, which is easier on the eyes than lower-resolution displays when reading or coding for long periods of time. That screen space gives you enough room to work on multiple things at once while keeping the laptop small enough to fit in most bags without taking up too much space.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration adds AI features</strong> directly to macOS without needing cloud processing or paying for basic features. The system helps with writing, making content, and productivity workflows, and it does all of this on the device to protect your privacy. Your data never leaves your machine because it is processed locally. This solves privacy issues that come up with cloud-based AI services. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports let you transfer data at lightning speed and drive up to two external displays at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>MacBook Air runs macOS without any problems</strong> and all of your important apps, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Google Workspace, work perfectly thanks to Apple Silicon optimization. iPhone integration works great with features like iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your phone from your Mac, Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy content between devices, and Continuity Camera, which turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam.</p>
<p>When you think about how much Apple charges for this exact configuration directly, $999, getting the MacBook Air M4 for $738 is a great deal. This Cyber Monday price is $261 less than retail and gets you professional-level performance and a high-quality build.

From the outside, the System Case looks like a thicker version of the average Switch 2 travel case.</p><p>RDS designed the System Case with the Switch 2 in mind, but it can be used with the original Switch and Switch OLED thanks to the cushions on each side that double as brackets to hold the smaller consoles in place. Molded ridges protect the Joy-Con 2 triggers and provide an extra layer of protection beyond the ballistic nylon exterior. A padded, fold-out insert with slots for 16 game cards fully protects the screen.</p><p>The bottom side of the case has two compartments separated by a padded divider. The larger one has room for the Switch 1/2 Dock, a Pro Controller, or Joy-Con Grip. The smaller compartment is for a removable mesh bag with space for the official AC Adapter, an HDMI cable, and other small accessories. Elastic straps hold the accessories in both compartments in place.</p><p>The System Case also comes with two game card-size plastic cases for microSD Express and a cleaning cloth. The System Case has a padded handle and a rubberized zipper pull with the red Switch 2 logo.</p><p>If you want enough storage space for the Dock Set <em>and </em>a controller as well as other accessories, the Game Traveler Deluxe System Case is also available in a larger-size version similar to Nintendo's All-In-One Carrying Case.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/chatplayground-packs-25-ai-tools-into-one-at-nearly-90-off-chatgpt-gemini-claude-perplexity-and-more-included-2000648823</link>
            <guid>1368754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI tools aren’t exactly the demons most people make them out to be; if you know how to use them right. At this point, there are more than a dozen options out there, each offering a whole bunch of beneficial features that you can use to excel in studies, research, and even in your professional life. If you want to compare them all in one place and choose what works best for you, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>ChatPlayground AI is a platform that lets you explore and compare outputs from 25+ top AI tools side by side, in a single place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">A one-month subscription usually costs $29, but Stacksocial is offering<strong> lifetime access</strong> to the platform for just $80, after a whopping 87% discount.</a> It’s a leftover Black Friday deal, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 500 subscriptions have already been sold, so you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Jump in on it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>All Your Favorite AI Tools In One Place</h2>
<p>Starting with what the subscription gets you; it offers unlimited prompts across all the AI platforms, whether it’s GPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek. There is no lengthy requirement sheet with this one. Your system just needs to have the latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox to get started. Once your purchase is successful, Stacksocial will send the relevant links and code to your email, which you need to redeem within 30 days of your purchase.</p>
<p>The platform gets you access to over 25 popular AI giants like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 1.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, and more. Entering a single prompt delivers instant results from various AI models simultaneously, letting you compare their responses and pick the best according to your needs. You can use it to create images using text, refine text, edit documents, generate summaries for research papers that would normally take hours to read, and get quick answers to all your questions. Importing your own files is supported just as well.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in web search feature for up-to-date responses, and you can even refer back to previous conversations you had with the AI tools whenever you want. The Chrome extension integrates the platform into your everyday life, making it easy to get the help you want within seconds, without even launching the program manually. Those struggling to get efficient responses can head over to the prompt library that includes a wide range of ready-to-use prompts for optimal results. Best of all, the models can understand and respond in over 100 languages, so you can use what you’re most comfortable with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">On a normal day, you’d pay around $619 to enjoy lifetime access to all these features, but this deal takes a massive $539 off that not-so-friendly price tag</a>. But as you’d expect, it expires soon, so it’s best to grab it while it’s still live. If you want to explore more, other plans are also discounted. For instance, a lifetime subscription to the Pro plan is going for $50 after an 85% discount, while the Basic plan can be yours for $35, down from $204. That said, there are plenty of other lingering Black Friday deals on Stacksocial that are still going strong, even after the main event has wrapped up. It’s a great time to treat yourself to a service that feels slightly out of reach the rest of the year, and even gift it to a loved one!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-out-of-time-with-thousands-of-galaxy-tab-a9-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-clearance-2000648929</link>
            <guid>1368748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139</a>, which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos processing powers</strong> the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it <strong>creates spatial sound</strong> that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM <strong>work together to handle everyday tasks</strong> like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a <strong>microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB</strong> which is a cheap way to add more storage.</p>



<p>With multi-window display, <strong>you can run more than one app on the same screen</strong> at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. <strong>Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13</strong> work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.</p>
<p>With<em> Quick Share</em>, you can <strong>move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps</strong>. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.</p>
<p>You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-forgot-profit-on-dualsense-for-cyber-monday-drops-below-black-friday-price-to-all-time-low-2000648926</link>
            <guid>1368742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The DualSense Edge controller from Sony is rarely on sale because competitive gamers and PlayStation fans who want pro-level customization always want it. The price finally went down to $169 on Black Friday which is less than the usual $199 but Amazon is going even lower for Cyber Monday, bringing it down to $159. If you waited until Black Friday to see if the deal would get better, your patience has paid off with this new record low that makes upgrading to pro controller features much cheaper than it was just a few days ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6119/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customized Controller</h2>
<p>Sony <strong>made the DualSense Edge with replaceable stick modules</strong> to fix the most common problem with modern controllers: worn potentiometers inside the thumbstick assemblies that cause analog stick drift. If you use the controller for months or years and it starts to drift, you can just replace the module instead of the whole $200 controller and this modular method saves money in the long run and keeps your investment working like new.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>the two back buttons can be attached to either backplate</strong> and give you a total of four extra inputs that you can program to act like any other button on the controller. This placement lets you keep your thumbs on the analog sticks during important times instead of moving them to the face buttons and it gives you an edge in shooters where jumping or crouching while keeping aim control makes the difference between winning and losing.</p>
<p>You <strong>can set how far the L2 and R2 triggers travel before registering a full press</strong> with adjustable trigger stops. There are three preset distances that cover everything from hair-trigger sensitivity to full range motion. The shortest setting is best for fast-paced FPS games because it lets you fire weapons with very little finger movement, which cuts down on reaction time by milliseconds that are important in competitive play.</p>
<p>You can<strong> completely change the functions of any button on the PS5</strong> by going to the accessory settings: You can also turn off certain buttons if you keep accidentally pressing them. You can change crouch from circle to a back button, jump from L1 to L2, or make your own layouts that work with how you remember how to play on other platforms. The controller saves these settings to three different profiles that are stored in the hardware: You can switch between them right away by holding down the profile button and picking the one you want. This means you can have a profile that works best for Call of Duty, one that works best for Fortnite, and one that works best for racing games without having to change settings every time you switch games.</p>



<p>The <strong>braided USB cable that comes with the controller has a connector housing that keeps it in place</strong> so you won’t accidentally disconnect it while you’re playing wired. This also means you won’t have to deal with the annoyance of losing connection in the middle of a match because the cable wiggled loose. The carrying case protects the controller and holds all the extra parts, like spare stick caps, back button sets, and the connector housing.</p>
<p>The battery life is a little shorter than the standard DualSense because of the extra hardware for customization features: It <strong>usually lasts 5–7 hours of active play</strong> while the base model lasts 8-12 hours.</p>
<p>Grabbing the DualSense Edge for $159 instead of $199 saves you $40 on professional controller features that typically command premium pricing across the gaming industry. With the Cyber Monday pricing ending soon, this record low represents your best opportunity to upgrade your PS5 gaming experience before stock clears.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-held-back-during-black-friday-now-crashes-headphones-to-record-low-to-empty-final-stock-2000648922</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bose surprised shoppers who thought Black Friday deals were over by dropping the price of its <em>QuietComfort</em> noise cancelling headphones to an all-time low on Cyber Monday, and this makes it much easier to choose between Sony, Sonos or Apple models. These headphones <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">are now $199 on Amazon, down from their usual price of $349 which is a record-breaking 43% discount</a> that makes premium noise cancellation available at a mid-tier price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great ANC Headphones</h2>
<p>Bose designed these headphones with <strong>cutting-edge noise-canceling technology that uses both active electronic canceling and passive physical isolation</strong> from the over-ear design, and it makes a quiet bubble even in loud places like airplane cabins or busy coffee shops. The system listens to background noise thousands of times per second and makes sound waves that are exactly opposite to the noise coming in, so it cancels it out before it reaches your ears.</p>



<p>Aware mode changes things up by u<strong>sing external microphones to send sounds from the outside world into your ears</strong>: This lets you hear announcements, conversations or traffic without taking off your headphones. You can talk to people while wearing the headphones in this transparency mode, but voices sound a little different than when you hear them directly. You can also switch between modes with the push of a button, so you can do it right away when a flight attendant comes up to you or when you need to cross the street safely.</p>
<p>The <strong>audio quality has the warm, bass-heavy sound that Bose fans love</strong>&nbsp;<strong>with deep lows</strong> that make kick drums and basslines sound heavier without drowning out vocals or high-frequency details. You can change the bass, mid-range and treble levels in the Bose Music app to fit your preferences or make up for how you hear things. This changes the sound profile from bass-heavy to balanced or treble-focused, depending on what you like.</p>



<p>The soft memory foam and synthetic protein leather that make up the <strong>plush over-ear cushions feel good against your skin</strong> and make a good seal without putting too much pressure on your head. The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head and stop the pressure points that make you uncomfortable after wearing them for hours at a time. These headphones are comfortable enough for long flights or full workdays without making your ears tired or giving you headaches.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, <strong>the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which means you can go for days without needing to charge it again, even on long international flights. With USB-C quick charging, you can listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of charging, which is great if you forget to charge it overnight. When Bluetooth isn’t available or the battery runs out, the included audio cable with an inline microphone turns these into wired headphones.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get these <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones for $199 instead of $349, which is $150 less than the usual price for noise-canceling technology. You’re getting Bose’s best ANC performance, a battery life of 24 hours, comfortable all-day wear, and better sound quality for less than what Sony’s WH-1000XM4 usually costs on sale.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-for-cyber-monday-34-viewfinity-borderless-monitor-is-now-priced-like-a-budget-no-name-brand-2000648828</link>
            <guid>1368733</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last place you want to feel cramped is your computer screen. You can only keep so many windows and tabs open at the same time before a small screen makes you feel claustrophobic, and small screens for gaming? Yeah, they suck. This year make Cyber Monday the day you lose your big-screen FOMO forever — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">Samsung’s 34-inch ViewFinity Ultra-WQHD S50GC ultrawide monitor is practically begging you to click Buy Now at Amazon at just $210.</a></p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is taking an already well-priced ultrawide from a leading manufacturer — the ViewFinity S50 normally sells for $330 — and turns into an absolute must-have at 36% off. With this 21:9 ultrawide format creating an enormous horizontal space for work or play and doing it with outstanding resolution and super-fast refresh time, it’s one of the most versatile monitors available in this price range for Cyber Monday or any other day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Space, More Potential</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve already experienced the difference between a standard 16:9 monitor and a 21:9 ultrawide, it has to be seen to be truly believed. It’s not just the screen that’s bigger, the larger aspect ratio actually shows you more picture that is lost in 16:9 mode. That’s especially true for many games, where that extra peripheral vision comes in exceptionally handy.</p>
<p>The extra visual real estate isn’t wasted on a lousy picture, either. The Samsung ViewFinity S50’s WQHD (Wide Quad High Definition) images are delivered with a crisp 100Hz refresh rate and AMD FreeSync support for silky-smooth motion and no tearing. It’s HDR10 with support for over a billion colors and a 3000:1 static contrast ratio, so your photo or video editing work can be done on a sharp and color-accurate workspace, your streaming looks amazing and moves flawlessly, and your gaming is more immersive than ever before.</p>
<p>Here’s something your 16:9 monitor almost certainly can’t compete with — the ViewFinity S50 supports Picture-by-Picture (PBP) and Picture-in-Picture (PIP). You can connect two devices — a console via the HDMI input port and a PC via the DisplayPort, for example — and see them on the same screen at the same time. Or two PCs, or a PC and a Mac — you get the idea. It’s something a $210 monitor really has no business doing.</p>



<h2>Flat Is Fine</h2>
<p>Samsung’s vast fleet of high-quality monitors includes several curved models — the ViewFinity S50 is not one of them. But, while some people swear by a curved monitor, many don’t, and they’re the ones who will be most intrigued by an exceptional monitor that gives you the ultrawide 21:9 aspect ratio and larger field of view&nbsp;<em>without</em> being curved.</p>
<p>The performance of the ViewFinity S50 certainly isn’t diminished at all by not being curved, and with TÜV-certified Intelligent Eye Care features that include adaptive brightness, blue-light reduction, and flicker-free backlight, the ViewFinity S50 also won’t wear out your eyes.</p>
<p>Cyber Monday’s traditionally the day for amazing deals on tech upgrades, and if you have an average or slightly long-in-the-tooth older monitor, the Samsung ViewFinity S50 is most definitely going to be an upgrade. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6107/">The $210 price at Amazon is also pretty much unbeatable.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> fans are saying "no to AI slop" after some believe they've discovered AI-generated images in Epic's tentpole battle royale game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/say_no_to_ai_slop_a_billiondollar_company_should/">Reddit post</a> entitled "Say 'No' to AI slop, a billion-dollar company should have no problem supporting real artists for real art", Fortnite players have shared their thoughts on a number of alleged AI-generated images, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk1tw7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in-game</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrkcw00/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">posters</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk6ski/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sprays</a>, with some suggesting a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paljz0/comment/nrk2fc9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">boycott</a>.</p>

</span></p><p>The discoveries come just days after Epic boss Tim Sweeney suggested requiring developers to disclose whether or not generative AI has been used during the making of a game "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">makes no sense</a>".</p>
<p>Sweeney made the remarks responding to a social media post by a former Unreal Engine developer who <a href="https://x.com/cinedatabase/status/1993757796723306612">uses generative AI in his motion capture work</a> and suggested "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more".</p><p>"Agreed," agreed Sweeney. "The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation. It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-whats-coming-to-fortnite-chapter-7-pacific-break">10.5 million players logged on to see Fortnite's Chapter 6 finale</a>, with another three million clocking in via livestreams. To celebrate, Epic's pulled back the covers on Chapter 7: Pacific Break, revealing new map locations, new gameplay, Simple Build, and battle pass goodies.</p>

            <p>Industry leaders have attended a memorial service for Tomonobu Itagaki, the creator of Dead or Alive and the 3D Ninja Gaiden series, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-died-age-58">died last month aged 58</a>.</p>
<p>Tomonobu Itagaki was a celebrated figure in the Japanese video game development industry. He formed Team Ninja (originally called Tecmo Creative #3) back in the late 90s, creating not only the Dead or Alive series of fighting games, but also the 3D Ninja Gaiden games.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Yosuke Hayashi's eulogy about Itagaki</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Royta15/">u/Royta15</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/">ninjagaiden</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Amongst the attendees, which included Tekken director <a href="https://twitter.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1993986075782717449">Katsuhiro Harada</a>, executive VP of Koei Tecmo, Yosuke Hayashi, talked of meeting the developer, working for him, and getting back in touch shortly before his death.</p>
<p>"I never thought we'd meet like this," the executive said, as translated on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjagaiden/comments/1p8ttbe/yosuke_hayashis_eulogy_about_itagaki/">Reddit</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-were-so-cool-koei-tecmo-exec-makes-heartfelt-speech-at-tomonobu-itagaki-memorial/">VGC</a>). "My encounter with Itagaki-san dates back to 2001, when I joined the company as a new graduate. I was assigned to your department as a game planner. You told me you had no work for me. That's what you told me. Two weeks after I was assigned, I really had no work, haha. At the time, I lamented my bad luck, thinking it was the worst possible encounter.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>"My most memorable memory with Itagaki-san was the development of Xbox Ninja Gaiden from 2003 to 2004. The development team was in complete chaos, and it seemed like the game would never be completed, haha. But you were the only one who didn't give up. The two of us spent 12 hours every night checking every adjustment to the game. Those six months are a treasured part of my game-development career."</p>
<p>Itagaki left the company in 2008 shortly after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doa-producer-slapped-with-sex-suit/1100-6161240/">a former co-worker sued him for sexual harassment</a>. Although he was deemed innocent by Japanese courts in 2007, he ultimately lost his executive officer role. Later in 2010, Itagaki and Koei Tecmo reached a settlement after Itagaki claimed the company was withholding bonuses for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-or-alive-4">Dead or Alive 4</a>. Itagaki moved on to develop <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devils-third">Devil's Third</a> at Valhalla Game Studios.</p>
<p>Before he left the company, Itagaki reportedly told Hayashi "don't change the [Koei Tecmo] logo".</p>
<p>"No other unnecessary words were exchanged. You were so pure and cool," the executive said.</p>
<p>Hayashi also shared his last message from Itagaki in which the developer wrote: "Thank you for remembering our promise [not to change the logo]. Times have changed lately, and selling a million copies doesn't earn you much recognition from the world anymore. That's the era we've entered. Please keep making great products from now on."</p>

<p><strong>There are eight new weapons and pieces of equipment added in Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1, including a new mobility item—Wingsuits.</strong></p>



<p>The importance of Wingsuits early in the season is vital following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-the-battle-bus-fortnite-chapter-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">destruction of the Battle Bus</a>, as surfing the waves onto the island provide limited landing spots. If you get your hands on a Wingsuit early, traversing the map becomes much easier and you can head to further locations to hunt for loot, where there’s likely to be less competition.</p>



<p>A full list of the new weapons and equipment found in Fortnite this season are below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Iron Pump Shotgun</li>



<li>Twin Hammer Shotguns</li>

<li>Arc-Lightning Gun</li>



<li>Forsaken Vow Blade</li>



<li>Wingsuit</li>
</ul>
