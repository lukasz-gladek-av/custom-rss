Unfortunately for many PC players, when the open-world action RPG launched it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-pc-bad-performance-day-one-patch-ps5-xbox-se-1848588854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-pc-bad-performance-day-one-patch-ps5-xbox-se-1848588854">suffered from all sorts of nasty issues</a></span>. This wasn’t the case on the Steam Deck, though, where Valve actually implemented some fixes to alleviate stutter and other problems. This had the weird effect of making the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-valve-pc-steam-deck-namco-bandai-stuttering-1848664299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-valve-pc-steam-deck-namco-bandai-stuttering-1848664299">Steam Deck one of the best ways to play <em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>, and consequently, that’s where <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-most-played-games-elden-ring-helldivers-1851329172&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-most-played-games-elden-ring-helldivers-1851329172">many, many people played it</a></span>. Now, however, many players returning in advance of the imminent DLC aren’t able to enjoy <em>Elden Ring</em> on Steam Deck. </p><p>On June 20, Namco Bandai and From Software released update 1.12 for <em>Elden Ring</em>, which is needed to play the new DLC. However, it seems this update has broken the RPG on Steam Deck, with some players reporting that they can’t even connect to the servers to play <em>Elden Ring.</em> Others are reporting an odd bug where <em>Elden Ring</em> might just stop accepting inputs if you leave your Steam Deck idle for more than five minutes.<br></p><p>On Thursday, the official <em>Elden Ring </em>Twitter account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1803730488751743427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acknowledged the input bug</a></span> shortly after the update went live. It confirmed that the team was aware of the problem on Steam Deck and was already working on a hotfix. No release date or window was provided for when to expect this update, though the developer did “apologize” to Steam Deck players for the “inconvenience.”</p><p>I assume many players who bought <em>Elden Ring</em> on Steam Deck have access to a decent PC where they can play the game until the hotfix is live. But for those who don’t have a gaming PC and own <em>Elden Ring </em>on the Steam Deck, this is a crappy situation that hopefully will be fixed soon.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-print-and-play-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a wonderful charm to the nature of print-and-play <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. Whether free or available for a small fee, these do-it-yourself designs offer full experiences that rival professionally published titles. In fact, many hit games started off as print-and-play offerings, including The Resistance, Monikers, and Gloomhaven: Buttons &amp; Bugs. Clearly, this minified format does not hold back a stellar game or stifle its creativity.</p><p>The nine games on this list are some of the best print-and-play offerings currently available. This is a genre that boasts thousands of options, so whittling the list down to a select few proved quite a challenge. The end result is an array of titles that will suit varied tastes and proficiencies. So fire up the inkjet and pull out the scissors.</p><p><strong>TL;DR: The Best Print-and-Play Board Games</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="#deep">Deep Space D-6</a></li><li><a href="#bloc"><u>Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</u></a></li><li><a href="#for"><u>For Northwood!</u></a></li><li><a href="#voy">Voyages</a></li><li><a href="#net"><u>Netrunner: System Gateway</u></a></li><li><a href="#table"><u>Table Battles</u></a></li><li><a href="#head"><u>Heading Forward</u></a></li><li><a href="#two"><u>Two Rooms and a Boom</u></a></li><li><a href="#circle"><u>Circle the Wagons</u></a> </li></ul><h2 id="deep">Deep Space D-6</h2><div id="202226"><p><h3>Deep Space D-6</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>A large swathe of print-and-play games target <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-solo-board-games">solo play</a>, and Deep Space D-6 is one of the best. This game puts you in the role of captaining a United Earth's Fleet starship responding to a distress call. Warping into the sector, you quickly realize it was a trap and have now been ambushed. Your only response is to start rolling dice.</p><p>Each turn you roll crew dice and assign them to various stations on your spacecraft. You must split your concentration between internal and external threats, as you will face boarding parties as well as opposing ships. With several ship options, a multitude of threats, and various tactical considerations, Deep Space D-6 boasts a solid amount of depth in a little package.</p><h2 id="bloc">Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</h2><div id="202227"><p><h3>Bloc by Bloc: The Insurrection Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2-4</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 120-180 min</li></ul><p>This is the most complex and rich board game on this list. Bloc by Bloc is a semi-cooperative political experience about fighting a revolution. Players control factions of workers, students, neighbors, or prisoners, and utilize their force to combat the State. It’s a very fierce affair that embodies the use of violence to curb tyranny.</p><p>This is a multi-layered design that features hidden agendas, area control, and a high degree of asymmetry. Play occurs over multiple nights, with each participant executing actions and then bracing themselves for the game-controlled police response. It’s a fascinating game, and one that bears a striking theme. The cute facade and buffer between realistic depictions provide a touch of levity and blunt the game’s edge. This is a fantastic example, however, that board games can tackle serious topics and themes beyond surface-level violence and adventure. </p><h2 id="for">For Northwood!</h2><div id="202228"><p><h3>For Northwood!</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 15-30 min</li></ul><p>For Northwood presents the novel concept of a solitaire trick-taking game. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games">trick-taking game</a> genre, epitomized by titles such as Spades and Euchre, is a classic style of card game that has seen a huge resurgence in recent years. For Northwood takes this idea and translates it to a single player experience that is surprisingly effective.</p><p>The goal here is to peacefully unify the kingdom of Northwood. Each trick represents a conversation with Northwood’s rulers, playing out as a series of tense negotiations. This is such a clever format to present this idea, and it works wonderfully to inject a bit of drama and context to the card play. The approach is ultimately playing cards against a mindless opponent, the challenge level can get very high. You’re forced to make difficult decisions about when to use special once-per-game abilities, and you must manage your hand deftly to succeed. This is a winner, and a very easy game to print out and assemble.</p><h2 id="voy">Voyages</h2><div id="202229"><p><h3>Voyages</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1-8</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20-30 min</li></ul><p>The popular <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-roll-and-write-board-games"><u>roll-and-write</u></a> genre of games has players rolling dice and then marking up personal sheets to cross off boxes, mark off numbers, or color in spaces. Voyages has players use dice rolls to sail a ship across an open sea. The goal is to visit different islands and gather goods to deliver to various destinations. </p><p>Like many roll-and-write games, the experience shifts substantially with new sheets and layouts. There is a wide variety of sea maps to choose from, creating unique strategic challenges that demand clever sailing. This is a breezy game that is playable by a large number of players simultaneously. It requires a very modest amount of effort to print and assemble, and is one of the most accommodating games on this list. The gameplay is more worth the trouble, as Voyages is an excellent print-and-play design.     </p><h2 id="net">Netrunner: System Gateway</h2><div id="202230"><p><h3>Netrunner: System Gateway</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 45 min</li></ul><p>Magic: The Gathering designer Richard Garfield released the two-player cyberpunk hacking CCG Netrunner<em> </em>in 1996. It was later re-envisioned by Fantasy Flight Games as Android: Netrunner in 2012, cementing its legacy as one of the best card games ever made. Unfortunately, it officially went out of print in 2018, closing the doors on any future development and leaving a huge fanbase hanging in the wind. Or so we thought. </p><p>A group of fans has revitalized Netrunner in a completely free-to-play format, offering professionally illustrated card sets that continue the legacy of this astounding game. While the new card sets are free to print on your own, you can also purchase professionally printed decks online. The quality of artwork and game design is remarkable. It’s as if the game never died. Additionally, you can even acquire reworked versions of old cards, making for a very complete and nuanced game that is completely accessible from your computer. System Gateway is the starter set, a wonderful collection of cards that plays superbly.</p><h2 id="table">Table Battles</h2><div id="202231"><p><h3>Table Battles</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 10+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 20 min</li></ul><p>Amabel Holland is an enigmatic designer who has produced dozens of quirky and unusual titles from her co-owned studio <a href="https://hollandspiele.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollandspiel</a>. Table Battles is one of her most successful systems, offering a light and streamlined <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board game</a> that is flexible to cover many different eras of history. It’s fueled by a central dice activation system where players allocate rolled dice to unit cards in order to later activate and attack with them.</p><p>While this game is easy to pick up and learn, there is a degree of depth through tactical options such as counterattacking, utilizing strategic reserves, and screening attacks to cancel them. It’s a tense game where thoughtful maneuvering is paramount to success. This base set includes battles ranging from 1458 to 1776, but there are follow-up titles that cover the War of the Roses, the American Civil War, and even fictional setups such as Dinosaurs and Kaiju. </p><h2 id="head">Heading Forward</h2><div id="202232"><p><h3>Heading Forward</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 1</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>Another Hollandspiel title, Heading Forward is a very weird game about recovering from a brain injury. This solitaire design has players exploring rehabilitation from a terrible accident. You must relearn skills such as planning, shopping, and returning to work. All of this must be accomplished in a limited time as your insurance company will only fund your recovery for a defined timeframe.</p><p>To develop these skills you must rotate and swap out cards. They upgrade from weak level one skills all the way up to level four. Improving your acumen requires managing emotional and physical energy, as well as other resources. The road is fraught with setback, however, as hiding in the deck is a trigger card. This reignites the trauma of your accident and marks a major setback. This game one again displays that board games can reach for something greater. It’s based on designer John du Bois’ own recovery, and is a very intimate and memorable experience.</p><h2 id="two">Two Rooms and a Boom</h2><div id="202233"><p><h3>Two Rooms and a Boom</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 6-30</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 30 min</li></ul><p>Two Rooms and a Boom is one of the best social deduction games ever designed, and it’s thankfully available in a print-and-play format alongside the professionally published version. This is one of those <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party games</a> that works best with a large crowd. It excels with groups of 10 or more, as players are dealt secret cards that split them between two teams. All of the players are then divided between two rooms which are isolated from each other.</p><p>The blue team wants to protect one of their own, the President. The red team wants to ensure the player on their team that occupies the role of the bomber ends up in the same room as the President at game’s end. Over multiple rounds, each room will select players to be exchanged with the other location. At the end of the game, if the President is in the same location as the bomber, then the red team wins. If this doesn’t happen, the blue team succeeds. It’s simple but wildly entertaining. Players can secretly or publicly reveal their role cards. Cliques are established quickly and much negotiation occurs. Everything radically changes when new roles are added, such as players which are not allowed to show their role, ones which may only lie and never tell the truth, and ones with alternate private victory conditions. This is a fantastic game with a large amount of depth and variability that is sure to please a large crowd.</p><h2 id="circle">Circle the Wagons</h2><div id="202234"><p><h3>Circle the Wagons</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 8+</li><li><strong>Number of Players</strong>: 2</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 15 min</li></ul><p>This head-to-head card game has players developing their own prosperous town. The core of the game hinges on a unique draft system, where available cards are placed in a circle at the center of the table. Players take turns plucking cards from this circle and placing them in their own personal towns. </p><p>One wrinkle of the game is a set of three cards at the center of the circle. This trio dictate bonus ways to score when building towns and should not be ignored when formulating strategy. This is a clever little game that is enhanced by a large degree of variability. There is a plethora of combinations in card placement, and each session doesn’t quite work out the same way.      </p><p><em>Charlie Theel is a tabletop games freelancer.

The game also missed the actual 20th anniversary at the end of 2023, but better late than never! Ubisoft has released the launch trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition, which shows a new generation of gamers what they can expect to see.</p><p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil was originally released in 2003, and it put players in the role of Jade, an investigative reporter and spy who lives on a mining world called Hillys in the 25th century. When her world comes under attack by aliens known as the DomZ, Jade accepts an assignment to catalogue the species of Hillys before she is drawn even deeper into the ongoing invasion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Beyond Good &amp; Evil - 20th Anniversary Edition: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The original version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil was pulled from most of the online gaming storefronts ahead of the new edition. Some of the features of the 20th Anniversary Edition include upgraded graphics, controls, and audio, as well as 4K support and an anniversary gallery. There will also be a new "treasure hunt" that reveals more about Jade's childhood. According to Ubisoft, this mission will also include "a narrative link" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-ceo-says-beyond-good-and-evil-2-is-progressing-well/1100-6483947/" data-ref-id="1100-6483947">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>, the sequel which has been in development for a very long time.</p><p>Ubisoft briefly pulled the trailer for Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition because it accidentally preempted Limited Run Games' announcement of a physical edition later this year. Fans who only want the digital version of Beyond Good &amp; Evil won't have to wait that long. It will be available on all platforms starting on June 25.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/20/dragon-age-the-veilguards-leads-on-the-name-change-and-solas-role-in-the-story<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age 4 was revealed years ago under the name <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2018/2018/12/06/bioware-teases-next-dragon-age-game-with-the-dread-wolf-rises">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a>. However, with seemingly months to go before the game’s fall 2024 launch, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/06/dragon-age-4s-new-name-is-dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-gameplay-look-next-week">BioWare announced it was changing the name to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. Ahead of that announcement, <em>Game Informer</em> visited BioWare's Edmonton office for an exclusive look at the game for our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2024/06/09/cover-reveal-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard cover story</a>. It's here we learned that the name had changed.</p>

<p>I interviewed various Veilguard leads for the cover story, and one of the first questions I asked each of them was, "Why the name change?" Here's what each told me:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>BioWare's Leads On Changing The Name To Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4F3N4Lxw4_Y" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><strong>Veilguard game director Corinne Busche</strong>: "First of all, I would say that these games are reflections of the teams that make them, and as part of that, it means we learn a lot about what the heart and soul of the game really is as we're developing it. And we quickly learned and realized that the absolute beating heart of this game are these authentic diverse companions. When we took a step back, as we always do, we always check our decisions and make sure that they still represent the game we're trying to build. It just felt like we needed a title that represented what this game was truly about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, I want to be clear: I adore Solas [and] he plays an important role in the game, but this is not a game about Solas. So in all things we do, trying to capture that authentic experience, we felt the title really needed to change."</p>

<p><strong>Veilguard creative director John Epler</strong>: "Dragon Age has always been about characters, not just the villains, but also your team, your companions, the other characters in the world. And as we were building Dragon Age: The Veilguard – there's this analogy I like to use, which is, 'If you want to carve an elephant out of marble, you just take a piece of marble and remove everything that doesn't look like an elephant.' As we were building this game, it became really clear that it was less that we were trying to make The Veilguard and more like The Veilguard was taking shape as we built the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solas is still a central figure in it. He's still a significant character. But really, the focus shifts to the team. It's about the people you recruit. It's about stopping the end of the world with this group of specialists, these incredibly interesting and diverse characters that you recruit into your team. [We] realized Dreadwolf suggests a title focused on a specific individual, whereas The Veilguard, much like Inquisition, focuses more on the team."</p>

<p><strong>BioWare general manager Gary McKay</strong>: "First, let me say: Solas is still very much part of this game. This is absolutely nothing to say that he's taking a back seat. But when we reflected on what was really the heartbeat of this game, we really saw the companions jumping out at us. I think you could argue [these companions] are the best the franchise has ever seen. We have seven incredibly unique characters, each with their own personalities, motivations; they have deep stories, and you have an opportunity to really interact with these characters in a way that both shapes their story but also influences the main story, right down to having an opportunity to impact their fate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just the story; they are also integral to the gameplay as well. And so when you look at it from really what the heartbeat of this game is, the centerpiece of the game, it's about the companions – the Veilguard. We felt that the title needed to reflect what we thought the centerpiece of this game was."</p>

<p><strong>Former Dragon Age executive producer and Veilguard consultant Mark Darrah</strong>: "I think it's absolutely the right choice. Names can take on a momentum. Arguably, this game has kind of, in a way, been called Dreadwolf to some degree since its earlier days. As the game evolved, as [BioWare] figured out exactly what it was, it's very mature to step back and say, 'We called it something. Does it really still reflect what the game is?' And I think the fact the team was willing to take that step is amazing, and I think this is absolutely the right decision."</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="c645d6c8-af4e-403e-add8-a624bb426fd0" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>When I ask about Solas' role in the story after I learn his namesake is no longer in the game title, Darrah says Veilguard is still taking the Elven God's narrative in a good direction. He adds, "It allows us to, hopefully, give a good conclusion to all the varied attitudes toward Solas that are going to be coming from people who love Solas, who agree with Solas, who hate Solas, people who want to kick Solas off of a building – I think that we give you the opportunity to bring that to a close, but then tell a greater story about The Veilguard and about the world as a whole."</p>

<p>Talking to Epler, I learn more about how Solas isn't exactly the big bad I expected before seeing the opening hours of Veilguard. There's a lot more nuance to everyone's favorite bald elf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The most interesting villains to myself, and honestly most people, are not just straight up, 'I want to end the world.' To them, they are the heroes of the story, and Solas is no exception," Epler tells me. "Solas always feels that he is a tragic hero but a hero nonetheless, so he's coming into this believing firmly that what he did, that which you stopped him from doing, was the right thing – that you made a mistake. But now he's trapped and can't reach out and actively affect [Thedas], so he needs to work with you.</p>

<p>"That allows us to provide a lot of nuance to that relationship," Epler says.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNwHShylIg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>If you're wondering what Epler means when he says Solas trapped, it's quite literal – in the game's prologue, which is part of the 20-minute gameplay segment BioWare recently released (the above video), the player-character Rook and companions Lace Harding, Varric Tethras, and Neve Gallus stop Solas' attempt to destroy the Veil, a barrier between the magical Fade and Thedas. I won't spoil exactly what happens here, but Rook passes out moments later and wakes up in a dream-like landscape to the voice of Solas himself… because he's trapped here.</p>

<p>He explains he was attempting to move the Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain, both of whom are part of the Evanuris or Elven gods of ancient times, to a new prison because the old one was no longer containing them properly. Unfortunately for Solas, he's trapped here – the Fade – by our doing and Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain are free, blighted, and roaming Thedas. It's up to Rook to stop them, but it seems they'll have to work with Solas (or at least listen to his guidance and advice) to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"So one of the principles we took to when we were building the story of The Veilguard early on was we wanted the beginning of the game to feel like the final chapter of an earlier story and you're coming in right at the end, you're coming in as if you've been chasing Solas – the [Solas at the end of Dragon Age: Inquisition's Trespasser DLC] who said he was going to end the world and tear down the Veil," Epler adds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Epler says players will see early on (and as the narrative develops across Veilguard) that Solas sees much of himself in you, the player-controlled Rook, especially "the parts that maybe he doesn't like to face." As a result, there's an interesting push and pull between Solas and Rook. He says players can define the relationship between these two characters with their choices in dialogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You can continue to be suspicious and hostile towards him, or you can start to see him and find that common ground, that connection between the two of you, and really develop a different relationship over the course of the story," Epler says.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-gets-zombie-royale-game-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-gets-zombie-royale-game-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="143" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As part of the upcoming Season 4 Reloaded update, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>has a treat for Zombies fans available on both iOS and Android. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Activision confirmed that Zombie Royal is coming to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em> on June 26, which coincides with the start of Season 4 Reloaded. Zombie Royal is a limited-time game that first appeared in the original <em>Warzone</em>, and then Raven Software remade the mode in the battle royale sequel. </p> <figure data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone 2’s</em> iteration of Zombie Royale supported a lobby of 72 players in trios. When a player gets killed, they turn into a zombie instead of getting sent to the gulag. Zombies are relatively weak but have charged jump, gas grenade, and fury abilities that help take down humans more easily. Human players dropped a syringe of Antivirals upon death; if a Zombie player retrieved two Antivirals, they would be sent back into the map as a human player again. However, if a zombie is killed, they must be redeployed by a human squadmate.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">Activision did not specify if the <em>Call of </em>Duty: Warzone Mobile Zombie Royal game mode or if there will be more changes and innovations. There will be a full blog post one week before the mid-season update goes live that will detail the upcoming game mode. If this Zombie Royal is anything like what we have previously seen, it will undoubtedly be one of the most popular game modes in the battle royale. Players universally praised both previous versions. </p>

<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pokémon Go</em> frequently hosts limited-time events, typically only lasting a day or even one hour. That’s why it’s crucial to keep track of the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-raid-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">event schedules</a>, or else you may lose out on an exclusive new team member. To stay updated, here’s the current <em>Pokémon Go</em> Community Day schedule for June 2024.</p>  <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The next Community Day for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pokemon-go-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a></em> launches on <strong>June 22, 2024, from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. local time</strong>. The adorable Fire Mouse <strong>Cyndaquil</strong> takes center stage for this celebration, spawning more of this creature in the wilds. Shiny variants may also appear during this time, but unfortunately, they are not always guaranteed.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Niantic</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve captured a Cyndaquil, <strong>evolve it to Quilava</strong> to get a Typhlosion with a Blast Burn Charged Attack. However, you must do this during the event or two hours after its conclusion to gain this unique Pokémon.</p> <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">During the active hours of the Community Day in <em>Pokémon Go</em>, you’ll be reaping the rewards. Event bonuses include the opportunity to earn double XP and Stardust every time you capture a Pokémon. Lure Modules and Incense will be extended to a generous three hours, giving you ample time to make the most of the event.

 <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="212" data-injectable="false">Cyndaquil’s Community Day also offers an exclusive Special Research story for one US dollar. But if you want to save some cash, this Pokémon will have its own Field Research tasks for even more challenges.</p> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="false">As for the rest of the schedule, Niantic has <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/post/cd-savethedate-s15/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed other Community Days</a> for the following months. Specifically, you can look forward to a Community Day on July 31 and August 31. The Pokémon for these events haven’t been mentioned yet, so we’ll be sure to update this guide once we have more information.</p>

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Limited Run Games announced as part of <a href="https://youtu.be/0G3umAZ-nvM?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their LRG3 stream</a> that they will be localizing <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2</em> for the first time in North America. This looks like they’ll be publishing a translated version of <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em>, which released in Japan earlier this year.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true"><em>Assault Suit Leynos 2</em> is the third game in the <em>Assault Suit</em> series. In the West, we’d remember the first two games as <em>Target Earth</em> and <em>Cybernator</em>, but were actually <em>Assault Suit Leynos</em> and <em>Assault Suits Valken</em>, respectively. It’s part of a series of sci-fi mech games. I’ve talked about <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/heres-a-closer-look-at-retro-bits-assault-suits-valken-re-issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybernator/Assault Suits Valken</a></em> about a jillion times here on Destructoid. The series has seen something of a Western resurgence.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While <em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em> is largely a port of the Sega Saturn version of the game, quality-of-life features have been added, such as saving, loading, a rewinding. There are also option difficulty adjustments.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">More importantly, we never got <em>Leynos 2</em> in English. Our <em>Assault Suit</em> collection has been incomplete. This will bring us one step closer. Then the only thing missing is <em>Assault Suits Valken 2</em>, which is weirdly very similar to the <em>Front Mission </em>series. But then, <em>Front Mission: Gun Hazard</em> is extremely similar to <em>Assault Suits Valken</em> (because most of the staff is the same). So really, they were just returning the favor.</p>
 <p data-characters="58" data-current-count="58" data-injectable="false">But seriously, somebody translate and re-release <em>Valken 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false"><em>Assault Suit Leynos 2 Saturn Tribute</em> is out in North America sometime later in 2024. It’s coming to PS4, PS5, and Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="408" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Monopoly GO’s</em> Monopoly Games season just dropped today, and with it comes more albums than usual. Of all the seasons to release so far, Monopoly Games has the most number of albums, with 23 regular sets and five prestige variations. Fortunately, Scopely knows how daunting a task card-collecting is and has come out the gate revealing that four- and five-star sticker drop rates are higher this season.</p> <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false">In the initial announcement posts for the Monopoly Games season from Scopely, we learn more about the differences between this season and previous ones. Alongside Monopoly Games being longer than previous seasons, lasting nearly 100 days, we have better chances of receiving four and five-star stickers. </p> <figure data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Monopoly GO Discord / Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">However, this doesn’t necessarily reveal whether the odds of getting unique cards are higher. This season may turn into three months of constant duplicate cards, which, fortunately, helps encourage sticker trading in the community. Unfortunately, this also means you could get excited to get a new card and complete one of your sets, only to find that your packs keep giving duplicates. The post also doesn’t specify whether gold card drops increased this season, and there are no guaranteed gold sticker packs this season, so this could introduce a whole lot more Golden Blitz trading.</p>
 <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">Nonetheless, this is a welcome change for anyone looking to complete all 23 base album sets during the Monopoly Games season, especially if you want to experience prestige for the first time. The final vault in Stickers for Rewards vaults is also a lower price than in previous seasons, dropping from 800 stars to 700. Like last season, though, there’s no wild sticker or guaranteed new card pack in the vaults, so you can still get duplicate stickers regardless of which you buy.</p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly GO’s </em>Monopoly Games season will run from June 20 until September 26, 2024, giving you over three months to get all 207 stickers for its sets.</p>

By leveraging AI, we create more&nbsp;engaging and immersive experiences that provide each player with a unique, dynamic, and personalized experience. We also see great opportunities for AI in game development speed, logistics and planning. Embracer Group also understands the potential risks associated with the use of AI.</p><p>Our aim is to empower our employees with AI applications.</p></blockquote></div><p>Developers have expressed concerns about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24042070/gdc-state-of-the-video-game-industry-survey-2023-ai">the use of AI in making games</a> and how AI <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/4/23700619/ai-game-development-jobs-gdc-2023">might affect their jobs</a>. Those concerns might be particularly high regarding any AI initiatives from Embracer given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">the company’s recent layoffs</a>. But Tomas Hedman, Embracer’s head of privacy and AI governance, says the company doesn’t want to use AI in place of humans.</p><p>“We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them,” according to a statement from Hedman in the report. “This is the core of our human-centric&nbsp;approach to leveraging the potential with AI.” Hedman also argues that AI can “open up coding to a broader group of developers” by lowering the barrier to making games.</p><p>That said, Embracer believes it needs to adopt AI to stay competitive. In a heat map, Embracer identifies “non implementation of AI” as a potential “major” risk. “Not using AI for relevant tasks within Embracer Group will lead to us losing competitiveness and being outrun by our competitors,” the company says. Embracer also tracks AI governance as a potential risk, noting that the use of AI is “subject to general as well as specific laws and requirements.”</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/18/24181027/netflix-house-retail-dallas-king-of-prussia-2025"><h2>Netflix House will fill the voids left by dead department stores</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24181870/openai-former-chief-scientist-ilya-sutskever-ssi-safe-superintelligence"><h2>OpenAI’s former chief scientist is starting a new AI company</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct"><h2>Zelda is finally getting her own game</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/20/24181961/anthropic-claude-35-sonnet-model-ai-launch"><h2>Anthropic has a fast new AI model — and a clever new way to interact with chatbots</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/17/24180340/apple-pay-later-shutting-down-months-after-launch"><h2>Apple is shutting down Apple Pay Later just months after launch</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182599/elden-ring-patch-elden-beast-torrent<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wwqFyu">A new patch for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> was released Thursday, ostensibly to prepare the game for the arrival of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> DLC on June 21. But players of the base game are also getting a lovely treat, in the form of a major quality-of-life update to the base game’s final boss battle.</p>
<p id="yj9DIl">According to Bandai Namco’s <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-112">patch notes for version 1.12 of <em>Elden Ring</em></a>, developer FromSoftware has added a “new feature to summon spectral steed during the Elden Beast boss battle.” <em>Elden Ring</em> players who have faced the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24173795/elden-beast-boss-fight-how-to-beat">Elden Beast</a> will know what a relief it is to have Torrent available in this situation, as the final boss battle involves a torturous amount of running from one side of the battle arena to the other, back and forth, and back and forth again, while chasing the always-moving monster.</p>
<p id="3oF2s1">While the Elden Beast battle was a majestic and challenging final confrontation, the incessant running around players had to do to get in a few swipes of a sword or get within spellcasting range was something of a nightmare. Especially since the Elden Beast is a two-parter; one needs to defeat another boss, Radagon, before facing the beast, and failure in the second part meant repeating the first.</p>

<p id="RK3Ku9">But the ability to summon Torrent in the Elden Beast boss fight isn’t the only major quality-of-life update for <em>Elden Ring</em> in patch 1.12. FromSoft has added a new “Recent Items” tab to players’ inventory screen, letting them easily find the latest thing (weapon, cookbook, talisman, etc.) they’ve picked up. Newly obtained items are marked with a “!” symbol, which will be hugely important for players acquiring a ton of new stuff with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. (Note that the Recent Items tab is an opt-in feature in the game’s settings menu, and having used it for the past week, I highly recommend turning it on!)</p>
<p id="s5CnLC"><em>Elden Ring</em> patch 1.12 does a whole lot more. There are new hairstyles, new PvP-exclusive balance adjustments, and a long list of weapon and skill tweaks, all of which are worth reviewing before diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> for the first time. </p>

They’re the ultimate close-quarters battle weapon, with a fast rate of fire, large magazine size, and high DPS.

Like any other submachine gun, even those outside the meta, the key to winning a fight with one is to fire fast and fire first. If you can surprise your opponent, they won’t have a chance to react appropriately, leaving you the opportunity to unload an entire magazine in their rears.<br></p><p>Lastly, you won’t always have the option of your preferred weapon attachments, but if you can score a loadout drop and you have a Superi 46 in your kit, here’s what you should run:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Zulu OP3 Light Barrel</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: XRK Edge BW-4 Handstop</li><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Zehmn35 Compensated Flash Hider</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Phantom Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Rescue-9 Stock</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: 40 Round Mag</li></ul><p>Whether you’re running the Superi 46 as a primary or secondary weapon, it excels in close-range encounters. It’s typically best to carry a long-range accompaniment, such as an assault or bolt-action sniper rifle, to hit targets from afar before moving in to finish the job.<br></p><h2 id="h8058"><a id=""></a>Honorable Mentions in the SMG Category</h2><figure id="" data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-recommend-id="image://a14629acaa4b8e11be098d3cccf4fbca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A big red gun ready to take down the evil tractor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The SMGs in <em>Warzone</em> are highly effective, so most prove useful.

It’s not the top choice for competitive or diehard <em>Warzone</em> players, but the Swarm feels underrated. It’s swift, boasts a large magazine, and has one of the fastest rates of fire in the battle royale. You can make quick work of a small squad, should you land your shots.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>I didn't see much of Outlaws' story at Summer Game Fest, but what I saw of the gameplay did not leave a positive impression.</p></section>

                <p>I'm more shocked than anyone that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-outlaws/" data-ref-id="5000-590940">Star Wars Outlaws</a> didn't resonate with me. I love Star Wars, and have been hoping to get a new game in which we don't play as yet another Force-sensitive person. But after playing through three different sections of Outlaws at Summer Game Fest--each of which was about 15-20 minutes long--I walked away disappointed. Nothing about Outlaws feels bad; hell, bad would have been better than what I played, because then at least it could have been memorable in some way. Instead, Outlaws feels fairly mediocre and unmemorable. What I played feels like an amalgamation of different features and mechanics borrowed from other games that do those things better, all while masquerading as a Star Wars game without actually embodying the themes and storylines of Star Wars.</p><p dir="ltr">Taking place between The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, Outlaws sees you play as Kay Vess, a smuggler striving to be a famed scoundrel by accomplishing heists throughout the Outer Rim. Though I didn't get to see these elements, Outlaws will feature instances where Kay can talk her way out of trouble and the game will feature a system akin to Grand Theft Auto's Wanted levels, in which Kay's actions have consequences that can chase her across the open worlds she'll be able to explore.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Star Wars: Outlaws Feels Like Respawn’s Jedi Games | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At SGF, I played in three contained, linear levels. The first saw Kay working her way through an Imperial facility before leaping into her ship and engaging in a dogfight against some TIE Fighters. The second part focused on the game's platforming mechanics, with Kay navigating a derelict ship. The third and final portion of the preview presented a level in which Kay was tasked with stealthily infiltrating an organization's base to steal back some stolen tech.</p><p dir="ltr">I have individual complaints with each of the sections but my main gripe with Star Wars Outlaws, based on this slice of the game, is that Kay feels way too powerful. It's possible Ubisoft put me on the easiest difficulty for the preview to make sure I'd get through each one in a timely manner, but if that's not the case then Outlaws is laughably easy. The ease of the third part of the preview feels the most damning. I wanted to see what would happen if I broke stealth, inciting the dozen nearby enemies in the immediate area to attack me all at once. I easily killed them all and subsequently completed the first part of my mission without having to sneak around. With this newfound confidence, I ran through the second half of the level, forgoing stealth entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">I eventually reached a locked door that I couldn't go through until all the enemies who had seen me were dead. I was far enough away that I couldn't quite see the enemies all the way back at the start of the area but my cursor occasionally changed from gray to red whenever the game registered that Kay was "aiming" at them, even if I could no longer see them. I just held the trigger whenever that happened and sniped the guards without even having to aim myself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322385"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322385-sw3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Kay's apparent invulnerability and god-like powers persisted throughout the demo, whether it was surviving three-story drops in the platforming sections or getting into a firefight and tanking multiple hits. Aside from simply feeling dull to play, this actively gets in the way of Kay's characterization as a scrappy scoundrel and smuggler. If anything, playing as Kay should feel more like how Han Solo accomplished problems in the original Star Wars trilogy--you take your shot when you can but you're far better off running away when the blaster bolts start flying. Even if Kay has no apparent Force powers (it's entirely possible we discover she does in the full game), Outlaws seems to be designed in a way to encourage you to play like she actually does--she can easily perform huge acrobatic leaps, make pinpoint shots without a sniper rifle, and take on hordes of enemies like they're nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Kay's strength also detracts from one of the core pillars of Outlaws, which is Kay's adorable partner-in-crime Nix. Nix can be commanded to aid Kay in a number of ways, such as distracting guards, fetching an out-of-reach weapon, or exploding a grenade in a person's pocket. Causing someone who's just minding their own business to suddenly explode is hilarious, but I never felt like I needed to use that command, or any of the others, in order to accomplish my goals. Kay is so versatile and able on her own, I never actually used Nix save for a few moments when the Ubisoft rep beside me told me how I could use Nix to solve the problem at hand and I did so to see how it would play out. I left the preview wondering why Nix is even a part of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384" data-ratio="0.56206896551724" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4322384"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4322384-sw2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My misgivings about Outlaws' lack of challenge aside, what I saw of the minute-to-minute gameplay also isn't all that remarkable. Kay handles a blaster just about as well as any other third-person shooter protagonist, and much like her peers in the action genre, she is regularly stymied by locked doors that can only be bypassed with annoying lockpicking minigames or finding an energy pylon to energize with an electrified shot. Again, none of what I played feels outright bad but it is very familiar and none of it stands out as notably good as a result--it doesn't help that a lot of what Outlaws does, Star Wars games that have come out in recent years have done much better. The shooting is fine but pales in comparison to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-battlefront-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-463558">Battlefront II</a>, for example. The ship combat is unremarkable, especially on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-squadrons/" data-ref-id="5000-513910">Squadrons</a>. And the platforming challenges and puzzles feel like unimaginative speed bumps that don't take into account the same level of spectacle or narrative importance as those in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/" data-ref-id="5000-483335">Fallen Order</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor/" data-ref-id="5000-565322">Survivor</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I also didn't get a strong impression of Kay or any of the characters she met during the three sections I played. Perhaps Ubisoft is going for more of a blank slate for Kay to make her easier to connect to for more people, but even so, Star Wars lives and dies by its characters and it's difficult to feel excited for Outlaws when I played the game for nearly an hour and didn't really relate to anyone. It's an odd miss for Ubisoft, which usually develops games that are hit-or-miss for a lot of people but--at least for the story-driven ones--tend to have a handful of fairly memorable characters. Granted, Outlaws still could. But the sections I played through don't suggest that to be the case.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1744940974" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

reminded me of previewing 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/saints-row/" data-ref-id="5000-536956">Saints Row</a>, a game that paints over half-baked systems and average storytelling with the trappings of a franchise I love. Outlaws so far feels exactly the same, using the imagery and sounds of Star Wars to disguise an otherwise mediocre game. Maybe the full release of Outlaws will surprise me in a way the full release of Saints Row didn't, but I have serious misgivings about Outlaws that I didn't have prior to playing it. The full game could be fantastic, but if so, this preview didn't sell me on it.</p><p dir="ltr">As one final addendum, what I played at Summer Game Fest did not look <em>anything</em> at all like what was shown off during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-forward-2024-how-to-watch-start-times-and-what-to-expect/1100-6523848/" data-ref-id="1100-6523848">Ubisoft Forward</a>--that gameplay seems way more exciting and appropriate for a Star Wars game about a smuggler struggling to survive during the height of the Galactic Empire. That gameplay showcase dives into how Kay can use her scrappiness to learn new skills that will aid her in a pinch while still highlighting her shortcomings as an easily overwhelmed flesh-and-blood human who is better off fleeing from a dangerous situation than sticking around. If Outlaws plays more like what we saw at Ubisoft Forward and less like what I actually got to play at SGF, I think it will prove to be an entertaining Star Wars game. Only time will tell which experience we're going to get, though.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on August 30.</p>

<p data-characters="147" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Madden 25’s</em> new BOOM Tech system introduces physics-based tackling, improved ball carrier mechanics, and new catching and pre-play features. </p> <p data-characters="638" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">In the first <em>Madden 25</em> <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-25/news/gridiron-notes-welcome-to-madden-25">blog</a>, EA provided a deep dive into BOOM Tech, which has been two years in the making. To start, BOOM Tech offers realistic control with every tackle, meaning players can punish ball carriers with devastating hit sticks or fly past offensive linemen with new truck, dive, and stiff arm animations. In addition, the new data-driven physics take into account timing, weight, speed, strength, and player ratings in one-on-one ball plays. The new hit stick makes it possible to tackle ball carriers harder than ever before based on the angle of impact, stick-skill, and accuracy of the cut sticks, big hits, and trucks. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">Players will feel the tackles as if they were on the field themselves thanks to the new sound effects and controller rumble hactics when a crunching tackle connects just right. Offense also gets an overhaul thanks to Boom Tech. A new ball carrier balance and recovery system makes it easier for running backs to counter the hit stick, break a tackle, and recover their balance before going down. </p>
 <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="110" data-injectable="false">As for when players can try out the new BOOM Tech system for the first time, <em>Madden 25</em> launches on August 16. </p>

 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">Since the beginning albums are easy to complete, only requiring one and two-star stickers, they don’t provide much dice. However, the further you go, the more challenging the sets are to finish. Completing this rewards you with more dice, though, so it’s worth focusing on these when trading for new stickers or participating in events.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-stickers-in-nbsp-monopoly-go" data-injectable="false">How to get stickers in&nbsp;Monopoly GO</h2> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">Getting new cards in <em>Monopoly GO</em> requires opening sticker packs, which you can get using numerous methods. You’ll open sticker packs to gain new cards, and their rarities determine the card types you get. A one-star pack will usually give you one and two-star stickers, with five-stars being guaranteed to provide you with one five-star card, among others of random qualities.</p>
 <p data-characters="61" data-current-count="61" data-injectable="false">Below are some ways you can get sticker packs in <em>Monopoly GO:</em></p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false"> <li>Participate in banner events and tournaments</li> <li>Complete reward tiers in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-next-monopoly-go-partner-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partners events</a>, Peg-E’s prize drop minigame, and Treasure hunt events</li> <li>Finish your daily Quick Win objectives</li> <li>Redeem a free shop gift every eight hours</li> <li>Trade with other players</li> <li>Complete showroom tiers</li> <li>Redeem <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-join-the-tycoon-club-in-monopoly-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tycoon Club rewards</a></li> <li>Purchase sticker packs using real-world money</li> </ul> <p data-characters="563" data-current-count="944" data-injectable="false">By far the easiest ways to get sticker packs are completing reward tiers in ongoing events and tournaments. While beginning reward milestones give you low-rarity sticker packs, finishing every tier usually gives you several four and five-star packs, depending on the event. Completing your daily quick win objectives also gives you a one-star sticker pack each day, with your weekly prizes giving you extra packs. Alongside these, you can also trade with other players to get stickers, redeem Tycoon Club rewards, or even use real money to buy packs if you wish. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/videos/2024/6/20/24182415/elden-ring-cloth-shadow-of-the-erdtree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RRLtng">When you boot up <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> for the first time, make sure you appreciate <em>Elden Ring’s</em> unsung hero: cloth.</p>
<p id="qfRRgP">FromSoftware has long been the master of dynamic cloth physics. That is, cloth that doesn’t follow a pre-set animation, but instead moves procedurally, based on an in-game physics engine.</p>
<p id="qnbM1D">It sounds simple, but it’s genuinely <em>really hard to do.</em></p>
<p id="sKjsgy">But FromSoftware has been doing it for years, and <em>Elden Ring</em> is just the latest and greatest manifestation of the studio’s cloth obsession. <em>Elden Ring</em>’s cloth isn’t just technically impressive, though. It communicates vital information about the world, and the characters that populate it.</p>
<p id="XvlPGi"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24087922/mohg-how-to-beat-boss-strategy">Take Mohg</a>, for example.</p>
<p id="91TlR1">He’s a messy boy who loves drama — and he’s dressed for it. The cape that he’s flung over his shoulders is a sumptuous red velvet, with a gold tassel fringe. </p>
<p id="PNhg35">“It’s very, quite literally in my opinion, theatrical,” visual artist Faith Schaffer pointed out in an interview. “It’s your classic red curtain with gold fringe.”</p>
<p id="FLIqAO">Mohg is the shunned child of the royal lineage, but instead of accepting a life in the sewers, he’s convinced himself he’s going to create his own dynasty. That plan somehow involves dressing like an absolute pimp and kidnapping his stepbrother. But really, he has one of the most baroque outfits in the game, which reads as extreme compensation for the royal treatment he was denied. He is putting on a show.</p>
<p id="PEEz6y">And FromSoftware always goes the extra mile when it creates dynamic cloth. The Godskin Duo are, yeah, wearing flesh. It looks disgusting, clammy, and blobby. It would be gross under any circumstances. But this flesh-cloth has its own physics parameters that cause it to flop and wobble. </p>
<p id="DN21kS">It’s a great example of how good FromSoftware is at using uniquely tuned physics to create distinct <em>movement</em>. If they had copied and pasted the same physics parameters they used for a velvet shawl or cotton cloak, it would still be distressing. But they went the extra mile and tuned the dangly bits of the robe to move with a distinct, cartilaginous wobble. </p>
<p id="WjpjJF">To learn more about how FromSoftware’s cloth contributes to the incredible worldbuilding of Elden Ring, <a href="https://youtu.be/wSSqx-Dh6ko">check out the video above</a>!

<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">While exploring the Tiderise Cliff area in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>, the Rover can get an extra amount of 20 Astrite by taking part in the Kitten’s Luck Lucky Draw. </p> <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">But although the system behind the draw is simple —you pay the 5x fish fee, pick a chest, and then open it for a chance of getting the prize— finding the latter can prove to be a little tricky. So that you can find it on your first try, here’s in which chest the Ultimate Prize is located on <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-ultimate-prize-chest-location-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Ultimate Prize Chest location in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="244" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">You can find the Ultimate Prize in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> by opening the Basic Supply Chest located by the stairs leading to the Lucky Draw area. The chest will be located by a wooden lamplight and be placed almost parallel to a Standard Supply Chest.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="517" data-injectable="true">Upon opening the chest, the Treasure Store’s Hostess will show her surprise and close off her shop. Apart from the already mentioned 20 Astrite, you will also receive the following as part of the Ultimate Prize:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li>Three Wood Textured Shards</li> <li>6.000 Shell Credits</li> <li>30 Union EXP</li> <li>One to three Basic Energy Cores</li> <li>A random number of Basic, Medium, and Advanced Sealed Tubes </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-how-to-get-fish-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get fish in Wuthering Waves</h3> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">The main way to get fish in<em> Wuthering Waves</em> can be done by catching them. You can do that by heading to any body of water and then either swimming or walking to them before pressing the gathering key/button. Although the fish in the game are pretty passive and will usually only move after you reach them, you can attack them beforehand to make the process easier. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">I was able to find a large quantity of fish in the waters surrounding the Kitten’s Luck. You can also find a consistent amount of it on the shallow pool housing the Bell-Borne Geochelone boss. Interestingly enough, Tetra is the only type of fish currently available in <em>WuWa</em>. </p> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="592" data-injectable="false">If you are not in the mood to do the above, you can buy Fish from Mahe’s Grocery in Jinzhou. Each unit will cost 1.500 Shell Credits and you can purchase a maximum of 10 during each world rotation. Apart from its use on the draw, fish can also be used to make various recipes, such as the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-milky-fish-soup-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Milky Fish Soup</a>.</p>

It will be arriving sometime in 2024.</p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Do you remember <em>Fighting Force</em>? The first one was released in 1997. Reportedly, Core Design pitched it to Sega for the Saturn as <em>Streets of Rage 3D</em>. Sega passed on it. As a result, it didn’t even release for the Saturn, instead arriving on PS1 and N64.</p> <figure data-current-count="554" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Fighting Force Collection | LRG3 Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA2GwYOIqCw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It’s fun. It’s pretty loose. I don’t think anyone really had a good idea of how to do beat-’em-ups in 3D at the time, and this was no exception. Beyond just fisticuffs, there were also a lot of firearms. Honestly, I think what makes it stick out in my mind so much is its general vibe. There’s a real urban feel to its aesthetic that I love. The weirdest thing about it was that players had lives and limited continues, if I recall. Kind of a drag.</p>
 <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true"><em>Fighting Force 2</em> followed on PS1 and Dreamcast. I’m less familiar with this one because I had an N64 growing up. I’ve nearly bought the Dreamcast version on quite a few occasions in the last couple years. Contrary to the first game, the only footage I’ve seen of it takes place in some military complex. It’s also 1-player, what the hell? There’s no word if it’s the PS1 or Dreamcast version (or both) included in the collection. By the looks of it, it’s PS1.</p>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">I’m down. They’re admittedly not great games, but I have enough affection for the era. I guess I’m saying that I really <em>want</em> to like them and am willing to attempt it again.</p> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false"><em>Fighting Force Collection</em> is coming sometime in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/dont-skip-destiny-2s-best-most-explosive-titan-exotic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dont-skip-destiny-2s-best-most-explosive-titan-exotic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="338" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Us Titan mains feel it: the tinge of disappointment in the new Prismatic subclass. We bemoan the absolute lunacy of Warlock and Hunter kits while we try to cobble together a functional build using what seem to be the worst Aspects from every subclass. But there’s still hope. We just got one of the best damage Exotics in the game. </p> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false">How to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">The… well I won’t say <em>easiest</em>, but the most optimal (and fun) way to get Hazardous Propulsion is to complete the Final Shape campaign on Legendary difficulty. At the very end, you’ll be given an extra reward: a choice between the two new Titan Exotics. One is the Strand-focused Wishful Ignorance gauntlets, the other is the chest armor Hazardous Propulsion. </p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">Wishful Ignorance is great, but does it shoot rockets out of your shoulder blades? No? Skip it for now, because the <em>other</em> way to get these new Exotics is to reset your reputation rank with Rahool in the Tower, then focus-decode an Engram into one of them. So no matter which one you choose at the end of the campaign, you’ll be able to get the other a little way down the line. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-why-to-get-hazardous-propulsion" data-injectable="false"><em>Why</em> to get Hazardous Propulsion</h2> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">So we’re skipping one really good Exotic for this one. Why? Well, Titans don’t exactly have excellent damage Supers, do they? What if we had access to amazing boss damage that didn’t require a Super <em>or</em> our guns? </p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">When you get kills or land precision shots, this chest piece will load rockets. Using your class ability (even Thruster, mind you) will launch up to six rockets, which hit for about 28k damage <em>each</em>. That’s pretty good already, but they also buff your rocket launcher and rocket pistols by 35% if you land all six. And that’s <em>nuts</em>. Before today’s patch, this buff is overwritten by Radiant (a 25% damage increase), but this has now been fixed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-hazardous-propulsion-build-basics" data-injectable="false">Hazardous Propulsion build basics</h2> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">So, if you have this thing welded to your chest like I do, how do you make the most of it? Well, you’ll obviously want to use a rocket launcher in your heavy slot, and I’d suggest throwing a rocket pistol on as well. The Call, the new Strand sidearm from the Final Shape, suits this role perfectly, being kind of bonkers on its own. </p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">I’d also really suggest using Thruster, which unfortunately limits you to either an Arc or Prismatic subclass. I’d recommend Prismatic, since you’ll have a freer choice in Aspects and Fragments. The reason we’re using Thruster is its shorter cooldown and its lack of an animation: you’re going to be able to fire your buffed rockets a lot faster after casting it, and you’ll be shooting them more often. </p>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="false">As a “nice to have” bonus, I’d recommend a heavy rocket with Auto-Loading Holster or Reconstruction. This way you can pop off a heavy rocket, switch to The Call, then switch back near the tail-end of the buff’s lifespan to shoot another without having to stop to reload. The damage bonus to rockets can’t really be overstated, so it’s best to get as many shots in as you can while it’s up.</p>

<p data-characters="150" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The summer is stretching on, and though it’s got some games in the pipeline, it looks like Sony won’t be showing up to Gamescom this year.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="196" data-injectable="false">Sony will be not showcasing at the upcoming Gamescom 2024, as confirmed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-confirms-its-skipping-gamescom-again-this-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a>, reported first by <a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/gamescom/gamescom-2024-sony-playstation-absage/">Games Wirtschaft</a>. This makes it five years since Sony showed up at a Gamescom, back in 2019.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Even though it’s not the most surprising decision, it still comes as a disappointment for those hoping to see Sony’s games at the show, especially with how the PlayStation State of Play presentation in May was received by fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Sony had revealed release dates for <em>Concord</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and the <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port during the State of Play, with all three titles set to launch this year. <em>Concord</em> will be released on August 23, which falls amid the dates for Gamescom 2024. Moreover, the release dates for <em>Astro Bot</em> (September 6) and <em>God of War Ragnarok</em> PC port (September 19) are also not that far off.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">However, PlayStation is not the only platform skipping the major video games showcase event, as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-is-skipping-gamescom-this-year-ruling-out-a-switch-2-reveal/">Nintendo</a> will also not be present at Gamescom 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">While both of those major console platforms will be a no-show, Xbox has doubled down on its commitment to Gamescom 2024. Xbox has announced that it will return for Gamescom this year, and will host its “biggest booth yet”.</p> <figure data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="165" data-injectable="false">Moreover, Xbox has also revealed some of the games and DLCs that they will be showcasing at Gamescom 2024. Fans can expect to hear about the following games and DLC:</p> <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Age of Mythology: Retold</em></li> <li><em>Avowed</em></li> <li><em>Ara: History Untold</em></li> <li><em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em></li> <li><em>Diablo Immortal</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 76</em></li> <li><em>Towerborne</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em></li> </ul>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wizards of the Coast is launching two Secret Lair drops alongside the major<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-universes-beyond-assassins-creed-release-date-set-information-and-where-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering </em>set</a>. These drops will contain ten unique cards that are perfect for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed</a></em> and <em>MTG</em> fans or collectors alike, bringing characters and gear to life like never before. </p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Secret Lair drops compliment major set releases with incredible artwork, additional cards, or just alternate versions of cards that fans will find when they’re opening packs. Every drop is limited, meaning only those who purchase them when available or when stocks last will ever have them. As with every other Secret Lair drop, the <em>Assassin’s Creed: Lethal Legends and DaVinci’s Designs Superdrops</em> won’t be reprinted and will be a piece of <em>MTG</em> history you can own, play with, or keep in your collection forever. </p>

These are split into two sets of five, so you can purchase either or both. I’m going to aim to get both because I love the shift in themes between the two. See below for the cards you’ll get in each set. </p> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="563" data-injectable="true">Both sets will be available from<strong> June 24, 2024, until July 14, 2024</strong>. Wizards of the Coast messed up the dates during the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uicFvwDDlBQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeeklyMTG livestream</a> that revealed these cards, but Secret Lair confirmed the <a href="https://x.com/wizards_magic/status/1803141273118753054" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">correct dates on Twitter</a>. </p>

I have to say that Basim, Master Assassin sounds crazy and if you manage to pull off a win with his ability, then you’re a tactical genius. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Eivor, Raven Clan Champion</strong>: A 3/2 Legendary Creature and Human Warrior. Whenever a Warrior attacks, you can have its controller create a 1/1 white Warrior creature token that’s tapped while attacking.

After this phase, there will be an additional combat phase, but you can only activate this ability during combat. </li> <li><strong>Altair, Brotherhood Mentor</strong>: A 2/2 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-is-vigilance-in-magic-the-gathering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vigilance</a> and Haste. Gets +1/+1 for every experience counter you have. Tap to deal one damage to a creature you don’t control. When that creature dies this turn, you gain another experience counter. </li> <li><strong>Amunet, Tyrants’ End</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch and Haste. When Amunet, Tyrants’ End enters the battlefield, you become the monarch. At the beginning of your upkeep, if an opponent is the monarch, create a 1/1 black Assassin creature token with Deathrouch and Haste. </li> <li><strong>Basim, Master Assassin</strong>: A 4/4 Legendary Creature and Human Assassin with Deathtouch. Other Assassins you control get +1/+1. whenever a player loses the game, if they were attacked this turn by an Assassin you controlled, you win the game. </li> <li><strong>Edward, Jackdaw Captain</strong>: A 3/3 Legendary Creature and Human Pirate. Other pirates you control get +1/+1. At the beginning of your end step, gain control of target nonland permanent controlled by a player who was dealt combat damage but three or more pirates this turn. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-secret-lair-x-assassin-s-creed-davinci-s-designs-superdrop-cards" data-injectable="false">All <em>Secret Lair x Assassin’s Creed: DaVinci’s Designs Superdrop</em> cards</h3> <figure data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">These five cards are all equipment, so you’ll be using them alongside those Assassins above in the inevitable <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> decks you build. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="356" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Blade of Selves</strong>: A 2 mana Artifact Equipment.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite’s latest season is as chaotic as the media that inspired it]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-latest-season-is-as-chaotic-as-the-media-that-inspired-it.907083/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24180218/fortnite-chapter-5-season-3-wrecked<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="O2vFWC">Chapter 5 Season 3 of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is utterly overwhelming. The first time I dropped from the Battle Bus and onto the deserted lands of Brawler’s Battleground, I couldn’t tell up from down. The stadium — which is designed to look like a monster truck rally venue — comes equipped with flamethrowers, live rock music, and stacks of spinning rip blades. After winning a desperate scramble with other players and scattered AI bots, I didn’t stop to shield up and heal. Instead, I went into my menu and turned the sound down. </p>
<p id="XpUcJj">As it turns out, that flurry of activity in those opening moments came to characterize the general vibe of <em>Fortnite</em>’s latest big update. Dubbed “Wrecked,” this season pushes <em>Fortnite </em>away from its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23990967/fortnite-chapter-5-season-1-map-too-fancy">posh European locales</a> and instead creates an anarchic wasteland inspired by the likes of the Fallout games and, seemingly, Mad Max. Take those two franchises as starting inspiration points, then layer on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177794/metallica-stage-fortnite-festival-new-season">hefty serving of Metallica on top</a>, and the results are a gameplay experience that’s caked in chaotic sludge — so much so that it might weigh down the fun at some points. </p>
<p id="VqjJZX">The update is absolutely littered with new items. There are the Nitro Fists, which can melee through even the fiercest opponents with an explosion of power. There’s a new set of Medallions, which you pick up after boss fights and use to give yourself powerful buffs. There are the Lockjaw battle cars, which can plow through anything and contain mounted turrets. </p>
<p id="hs8fhI">If you don’t get one of the battle cars, that’s fine, because the map is literally covered with other vehicles you can modify, Flaming Boost Hoops that can send you zooming across the map (or into another player, if you so wish), and items like the Ride the Lightning guitar that allow you to soar through the sky. If you yourself want to become a weapon, no problem. The plentiful Nitro Splash allows your character to run through buildings and destroy them with a simple jump into the Splash. </p>

<p id="tQ55b0">This results in moments that feel either bad to lose or worse to win. I had one moment where I was just chilling on a mountain, looting a chest, when a player came up from the other side of the hill. I panicked and spammed the Nitro Fists and won with little to no finesse. </p>
<p id="5ledYD">At one point, I tried to attack an opponent driving a car and I missed. I backed up like a mom driving her kids to soccer in a minivan and missed again. I then looped around to try to hit them again and indeed I did. It landed enough damage that I could hop out and clean up the kill with a bit of gunfire. On the flip side, I was once looting a building quietly until someone amped up on Nitro Splash boosted through the entire building and yeeted me to another dimension, leading me to take some fall damage and making for an easy kill from their teammate in a car. </p>
<p id="AtX0bI">For better or worse, the developers successfully captured the spirit of anarchy this season. If you’re a casual player who just wants to mess around with friends, the pace of each match can ramp up in the blink of an eye as vehicles descend upon you and smash you to smithereens. If you play competitively, it’s less enjoyable — I’ve seen many posts online lamenting the sheer number and strength of new gimmicks at play here. My regular partner in duos has already decided he’s going to sit this season out based on a few play sessions. I don’t blame him, because it’s a lot, and a constantly irritated fan base appears to be the new norm for <em>Fortnite</em>. However, I can’t help but feel it’s all still very, well... <em>Fortnite</em>. </p>

<p id="7FXV4g">This is the same team that decided to take building, the titular and most original game mechanic in the game, and make it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23271397/fortnite-zero-build-battle-royale">an optional feature</a>.

Sure, but <em>Fortnite </em>has often had a Mario Kart blue shell logic to it all — that is, that any person can swoop in and win at the last moment — and that helps keep the game interesting to players of all levels. At the moment, it feels like the balance may be tipped a bit too far toward chaos. </p>

For the most part, posts in the <em>Helldivers </em>subreddit have been pretty tame though, which might honestly be due to the goodwill of the last big patch to hit the game. <em>Helldivers 2 </em>used to have frequent patches and fixes that seemed to solve one issue and cause several more, which eventually added up over the course of several months.

<p>In June 2023, Asus released the ROG Ally worldwide and forever changed the playing field where handheld gaming devices were concerned. Following in the ever-so-successful footsteps of Valve’s Steam Deck, Asus cornered a fair portion of the market by introducing a Windows 11-powered device with a white-hot processor and a gorgeous aesthetic – but it wasn’t without its teething issues.</p>



<p>Fast forward an entire year and the Asus ROG Ally is still at the top of the table – but it has been joined by some tough competition. In the last few months, the Lenovo Legion Go and the MSI Claw have entered the battlefield, and even a <strong>new </strong>ROG Ally model has surfaced – the ‘ROG Ally X’. </p>



<p>One year on, is the Asus ROG Ally still worth your money?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-powerful-playing">Powerful Playing</h2>



<p>With a Windows 11 OS as standard, the Asus ROG Ally is and forever will be a versatile and highly dynamic device. If you were to pair it with a wireless keyboard and mouse, you’ve got yourself a low-powered gaming PC. It can run more or less any launcher, and while some games are finicky in terms of compatibility, almost anything can be played on the device. It also supports every application you can install on a laptop or a PC, which is another huge bonus.</p>



<p>I’ve been toying with the Asus ROG Ally for a few months, and it’s so rare that I’ve had a bad experience. The biggest drawback is the unit’s battery, which flakes out after playing a ‘good’ game for more than 45 minutes. On charge, you can boost the ROG Ally into ‘Turbo Mode’ and keep playing for hours, but then you’ll need to contend with a little heat source in the palms of your hands.</p>



<p>From Fallout 4 to Escape from Tarkov and from Modern Warfare 3 to Days Gone, I’ve played quite a mix of games on the Asus ROG Ally. It’s a powerful device considering its size, but on plenty of occasions, I had to drop the quality of these games right down to the bottom to produce a stable and consistent experience – but that’s not a huge issue, as almost everything looks good on the 1080p, 7-inch touchscreen (which boasts a 120hz refresh rate).</p>



<p>The AMD RDNA-powered GPU and the 16 GB of RAM are enough to run most modern games, but the upgraded model is the one to go for if you want the best experience possible. In the Asus ROG Ally X, there’s a 1 TB NVMe SSD and 24 GB of RAM, plus a battery that boasts twice as much power.</p>



<p>However, the original Asus ROG Ally can still use the ROG XG Mobile eGPU to take advantage of the equivalent of an RTX 3070 GPU, while the ROG Ally X <strong>cannot</strong>. </p>



<h2 id="h-getting-to-grips">Getting to Grips</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In your hands, the Asus ROG Ally still feels very nice, even after months of use. It’s a sleek device that has a nice splash of RGB front and centre, which appeals to the gamer in all of us. The face buttons are a good size and are tactile, and the whole setup is made to mimic an Xbox or a PlayStation controller, right down to the sloped triggers and large, curved shoulder buttons. The thumbsticks are ‘full-sized’ and grippy, and the additional buttons that are there to accommodate extra inputs plus shortcuts to the onboard software are run-of-the-mill but on-theme.</p>



<p>With a stereo speaker setup boasting Dolby Atmos, the included sound system is decent enough, but I paired the ROG Ally with a Bluetooth headset to get the best experience possible. </p>



<p>Now that the ROG Ally X is on the market, you should be able to land a good deal on the Asus ROG Ally OG unit, but it’s best to get in quickly before stock dries up forever. It’s a solid gaming machine with fantastic multi-tasking potential, and it’s easily one of the best-looking devices out of the bunch when sat alongside the Lenovo Legion Go, the MSI Claw, or the Steam Deck. Even a year after launch, I still find myself using it a few times a week when travelling or simply lounging on the sofa and not wanting to drag myself to my PC.</p>



<p>I’ll keep hold of my ROG Ally until it gives up on me, basically.</p>

The team at Limited Run has built a new collection to find the answer. <em>Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</em> explores the franchise’s troubled history and enduring popularity.</p><p><em>Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</em> is a playable history that includes games, artifacts and interviews. All of the games have been carefully updated for modern PCs and consoles using Limited Run’s proprietary Carbon Engine. Along the way the team was able to smooth out some of the games’ rough edges.</p><p>At the helm of the project is Limited Run’s Audi Sorlie, a producer, author, Bubsy World Heavyweight Champion and arguably the world’s foremost expert on the furry franchise. Together with the team at Limited Run and Atari, he has created the ultimate retrospective celebration of Bubsy, the 3’6” tall 80 pound bobcat (with a pet armadillo named Arnold). What could possibly go wrong?</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

It uses emulation as a base, on top of which the Carbon Engine builds features like UI, rendering, audio, data management, controller inputs, and console-specific SDK features like trophies. It allows Limited Run to put out highly accurate, emulation-based ports of classic games for modern hardware. Old, well-loved releases can find a second wind on all-new hardware using the Carbon Engine. It is a core component of Limited Run’s vision for a world that is Forever Physical.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
