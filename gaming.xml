			<p>Codemasters announced today that <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-announced-for-may-30-launch-pc-requirements-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 25</a> will join the extremely elite club of games supporting path tracing. Just like with all the others (Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, Black Myth: Wukong, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Portal with RTX), the feature is a PC exclusive.</p>
<p>On the subject, the developer said:</p>
<p><em>Expanding on Ray Tracing technology and available as a new “Ultra Max” option in the graphics settings, light now follows every bounced path, including that from indirect lighting and multiple reflections. Shade, light, and colours dynamically shift as they would in real-life, whether you’re racing under the thousands of lights in Bahrain or navigating the castle section on Baku at sunset.</em></p>
<p><em>If you have a PC capable of experiencing it, Path Tracing is the most realistic simulation of light on track that we’ve ever delivered.</em></p>
<p>These aren't the only visual and technical improvements that fans will find in F1 25. Tonemapping and light balance improvements promise a more dramatic effect in all types of weather, with better representation of changes in cloud cover. There are also some enhancements to the track surface shader, which now displays more pronounced tyre and lock-up marks as well as physical changes based on other collected real-world data.</p>
<p>The addition of light detection and ranging scanning (LIDAR) makes tracks far more accurate overall. LIDAR also helped trees and foliage better match the species, placement, size, and shape of their real-life counterparts, with new additions such as cherry blossom trees in Suzuka.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Authenticity and Customization Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w2E_sML5CfY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Codemasters also introduced NVIDIA Audio2Face. This technology (already seen in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl) improved the facial animations that players will see during modes such as Career and Braking Point. The reintroduced press interviews now capture drivers delivering their responses in a more authentic fashion, with this technology extending to facility heads in My Team. Lastly, PS5 Pro console users will enjoy split-screen racing at 60 frames per second in this year's edition of the official F1 racing game.</p>
<p>Codemasters hasn't shared the system requirements for path tracing usage on PC, but we'll let you know once it does. F1 25 will be available on May 30 across PC and consoles.</p>

            <p>
Colours! They exist, right? They're all around us, everywhere you go, and as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> did something revolutionary: it made them customizable. Taking my sarcasm hat off for a moment, that means developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/netease">NetEase</a> added in the ability to choose different colour palette options for your costumes. It's just a small little way to add some amount of uniqueness to your version of the game's extremely pre-established characters, really. Except, the catch is that you have to pay actual money for them.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Well, ok, to be specific you have to buy them with <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1912740887026888751">600 of a new currency called Unstable Molecules</a>. But you can't just buy Unstable Molecules, you have to convert your Lattice into them, at a 1:1 exchange rate. How do you get Lattice? Finally, this is where you can spend your hard earned cash, by buying a 100-pack and 500-pack for about $6. Costumes themselves already go for around $20, which is one of the main ways the game makes money seeing as characters are always free, so I understand the thought process of charging for colour swaps.
</p>
<p>
Even still, you can't help but raise an eyebrow to extraordinary heights at a developer trying to ask people to spend real money on colours. Not to mention doing so a new currency obfuscates how much these things actually cost. Such is the curse of free-to-play live service games, I suppose, but a curse I find quite agitating.
</p>
<p>
Right now the colour options are only for a few characters like Magik and Luna Snow, and I imagine more will come in the future. I do wonder if NetEase will stick to their guns or just wait for people to stop complaining about it on Twitter (the site trying to be known as X).
</p>
<p>
In any case, Season 2 kicked off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-season-2-begins-now-with-emma-frost-new-team-ups-and-a-pc-performance-boosting-mode">just last week</a>, with NetEase promising that new heroes will be coming to the game every single month. Sounds like overkill and too much work for a team <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">that isn't as big as it used to be</a>!

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World - Full Gameplay Overview Nintendo Direct Presentation | Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Yoshida said (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/former-playstation-boss-predicted-the-switch-2-would-be-usd100-cheaper-than-it-is-but-isnt-irked-by-usd80-for-games-like-mario-kart-world-as-publishers-shouldnt-be-limited-to-a-fixed-price/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via GamesRadar</a>) that publishers should not be "limited to the fixed price on the shelf from the physical media days." Every game should be priced relative to what's being delivered he said, or in essence, "based on the value the publisher believes."</p><p>While Mario Kart World is $80, other first-party <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> are sticking with the $70 price point. Before this, Nintendo's Bill Trinen said Nintendo will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">"look at varying prices" for its games</a> "based off of just how robust the experience is."</p><p>Trinen added: "It's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value?"</p><p>Nintendo has also caught some heat for the $70 price point for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on Switch 2, in part over the fact that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-release-does-not-include-dlc-content/1100-6530815/" data-ref-id="1100-6530815">doesn't include the DLC</a>.</p><p>Also in the interview, Yoshida said he expected the Switch 2 to be priced at $400 USD, when in reality Nintendo went with $450 for the system itself and $500 for a bundle with Mario Kart World. Yoshida said the price hike might be due to "the cost of goods going up these days."</p><p>Adjusted for inflation, the Switch 2 is about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">$50 more expensive</a> than the original Switch ($300) when it launched in 2017. Nintendo will reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-to-be-sold-at-a-loss-due-to-higher-production-costs-analyst-says/1100-6530766/" data-ref-id="1100-6530766">lose money on every Switch 2 it sells at the start</a>.</p><p>Explaining the price increase, Nintendo's Trinen said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-switch-2-is-more-expensive-according-to-nintendo/1100-6530645/" data-ref-id="1100-6530645">everything in life gets more expensive with time, and new Nintendo consoles are no different.</a> Others believe Nintendo is raising prices <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because it can, knowing people will pay it.</a></p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5 worldwide. US preorders were expected to begin on April 9, but Nintendo delayed them due to Trump's tariffs. More recently, it was reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Nintendo could open US preorders for the Switch 2 in the coming days.</a> Some are wondering if Nintendo will re-open US preorders for the Switch 2 at a higher price point due to the tariffs, but it remains to be seen if that will happen.</p>

            <p>When I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-writers-new-dark-fantasy-vania-also-features-vampires-plus-screaming-spiders">first wrote</a> about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mandragora">Mandragora: Whispers Of The Witch Tree</a> in January, I worried I might have spotlighted a dud. Or at least, something fairly routine. Mandragora sure does look like a lot of dark fantasy side-scrollers - gritty yet plump and colourful, like they stuck a bike pump in Castlevania, or took a chisel to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trine">Trine</a>. It sure does have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> classes and skilltrees. It sure does have crafting, with hundreds of items to acquire. </p>
<p>I confess, I covered it in large part because they have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> writer Brian Mitsoda on the ticket. But then I read the comments on that piece, weeks later, and there were a few lost souls raving about playing the demo for hours. Mandragora launches today. I've now spent an hour or two with a full build myself, and yeah, this feels like the good stuff.</p><!--more-->

<p>The key opening draw is that for all the emphasis in certain trailers on systems and craftables, Mandragora seems very story-led. It takes place in an apocalyptic world where a sepulchral King Priest holds sway over the Crimson City, promising to keep the nightspawn at bay. The King Priest looks a bit like Judge Claude Frollo from Disney's The Hunchback Of Notre-Dame, and shares Frollo's enthusiasm for torturing witches.</p>
<p>You play a Crimson City inquisitor who intervenes to mercy-kill one of said tortured witches, saturating yourself with a mysterious power in the process. Seeking to save face, the King Priest anoints you as one of god's chosen, and sends you forth to track down another witch. Meanwhile, a voice starts whispering in your head. </p>
<p>The opening tutorial sections are filled with sturdily voiced NPC chit-chats that thicken the setting like delicious fistfuls of cornstarch. The character portraits twitch and glare like possessed oil paintings - some of the commenters on my last piece found them off-putting, but for me, they're the best thing about Mandragora's visual direction so far. Hurrying through the Crimson City, you bandy words with some fellow inquisitors and pick up the rudiments of dodge-rolling. Then it's off to the woods to rescue a blacksmith and bother some massive wolves.</p>
<p>As an action-RPG, Mandragora appears to have plenty going on, striking a balance between the lean feel of classic Castlevania and the unlocks fusillade of, say, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.  You've got a primary weapon and an auxiliary such as a spell or shield, a jump, a ledge-grab and a spread of gear slots. The combat goes heavy on stamina management and evasion, with the promise of stirring abilities and passives together into bespoke methods of monster-murderment.</p>
<p>The animations and controls are a bit halting, but it all seems engrossing enough. Still, I'm more interested in the gently labyrinthine levels, which are woven around Dark Soulsy altars where you can fast travel and level up, and are nicely abundant in secretive high platforms and concealed entrances.</p>
<p>Again, though, what grabs me upfront is the centrality of the story and writing. Even at its gamiest, Mandragora appears to be going for a certain consistency. There's a tutorial beat early on where you smash some crates and the merchant who owns those crates cusses you out, only to realise that you're an Inquisitor and beg for forgiveness. I like a game that knows how to turn an everyday Crash Bandicootism into characterisation. I'll hopefully have more thoughts down the road (Mandragora is an estimated 40+ hours in length). In the meantime, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1721060/Mandragora_Whispers_of_the_Witch_Tree/">here's the Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And honestly, I find that even more enticing that shaving microseconds off of my best times on my favorite tracks. (OK, admittedly, I’ve not actually lost too many hours in that particular pursuit since an obsession with the N64's Koopa Troopa Beach level.) It reminds me of another gaming obsession: smashing every barrier and smashable billboard in <em>Burnout Paradise</em>.</p><p>Not playing driving games properly is a bit of a habit. And the best driving games are the ones that positively encourage it, like <em>BP</em>, and also the wonderful <em>Forza Horizon</em> games. Sure, there are races and cups and what-have-you, but what if I just drive over there? There might be a windmill! There might be yellow fencing I’ve yet to knock over.</p><p>I return to <em>Burnout Paradise</em> with a concerning frequency, almost never replaying all the races, my enthusiasm focused on smashing my way around Paradise City. It’s a passion strong enough to get past the game’s interminable opening screens and the contemptible babble of Worst Character In All Of Fiction, DJ Atomika. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, albeit without all the barriers to break, is giving me that same drive (sorry) to aimlessly explore.</p><p>The footage shows <em>so</em> much stuff to find out there! All those pads to jump off, blocks to bop, blue P switches to trigger, and then coins and who knows what else. It’s going to be just so much fun to veer away from the races and uncover the secrets. Or just pootle about, nudging at the edges, seeing if I can break the boundaries, and approach the kart racer like a third-person action game.</p><p>It’d be nice if it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">didn’t cost such an absurd amount of money</a></span>, although I’ve been fortunate enough to pre-order the bundled version (the magic of being a foreigner to your shores). I really hate that. I don’t care for any of the half-assed arguments about “worth” and “value”—I just hate that it means the game and all the joy it looks like it could offer will be cut off from so many more people.</p><p>Privileged as I am, I’m now far more hyped for this than I was before, my hopes of an open-world game beyond the racing seemingly validated. And then the racing on top of that, too! It’s fun to be <em>this</em> pumped for the ninth entry in an ongoing franchise.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, among the many different scenes was a sneakily silly reference to an infamous moment in Mario history, and it all revolves around a little blue penguin.</p><p dir="ltr">During the Free Roam section of the presentation--at around the 12:04 mark--we see the Penguin racer approaching a cliff and driving off of it, plummeting to the water below. The kart lands safely in the waves, and the little guy cheerfully drives away. This is a far more fortunate fate than old-school Mario fans anticipated back in 1996, when the baby penguin debuted in the Cool, Cool Mountain stage of Super Mario 64.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-sued-for-allegedly-selling-charli-xcx-dance-without-permission-and-its-like-the-last-five-years-never-happened<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Back when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> was getting properly big, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-princes-carlton-sues-fortnite-for-copying-his-legendary-dance">Carlton from the Fresh Prince famously tried to sue Epic Games</a> for the use of his dance in the game. (You could also buy the Carlton dance in Destiny, I remember, which I absolutely did, but I suppose Fortnite had just become the biggest game on the planet at the time.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, Carlton - real name Alfonso Ribeiro - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-dance-litigation-crumbles-as-alfonso-ribeiro-refused-carlton-dance-copyright">was ultimately unsuccessful, as were a handful of other similar cases</a>. But whether because of the bad publicity or actual legal concerns, Fortnite pretty quickly cleaned up its act. Today it's home to countless dance emotes, music tracks and other bits and pieces, all agreed legally and above board.
</p>
<p>
But now, six years on from Carlton vs Fortnite, we have the maker of the Charli XCX Apple dance vs Roblox. The former has alleged that the latter sold their dance without permission, raking in roughly $123k (£93k) in sales. Has no one learned anything over the past half decade?
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit">Polygon</a>, Apple dance creator and copyright holder Kelly Heyer began legal action this week. Heyer originally posted the dance on TikTok last summer, and it was correctly licensed by Fortnite and added to that game last December. 
</p>
<p>
Roblox, according to Heyer, added the emote last August after contacting her to gain permission, but before the permission was actually granted. 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement," Heyer's attorney Miki Anzai said. "Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."
</p>
<p>
Charli XCX herself, by the way, does not seem to be getting involved. The artist has used the dance on tour, but was not part of its creation. 
</p>
<p>
"As the Apple Dance emote comprises solely of the Apple Dance choreography, completely separate and distinct from the Charli XCX song, the sole 'artist' for purposes of the emote is Ms. Heyer," the TikTok creator's lawsuit reads.
</p>
<p>
Responding to the lawsuit, a Roblox spokesperson said the game took "the protection of intellectual property very seriously and is committed to protecting intellectual property rights of independent developers and creators to brands and artists both on and off the platform". 
</p>
<p>
"Roblox is confident in its position and the propriety of its dealings in this matter and looks forward to responding in court."
</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Roblox boss Dave Baszucki said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">parents who were "not comfortable" about their children's safety shouldn't let them play Roblox</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Imperfect Words Of Parasite Eve]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-imperfect-words-of-parasite-eve.1166931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parasite-eve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There used to be words to describe this, but they were imperfect. They were abstract ideas, loosely gathered, that served as a way through. Before the words I needed became the words wielded as blades in headlines and discourse, they were something beautiful but weird and alarming. They were <em>Parasite Eve</em>.</p><p>I bought <em>Parasite Eve</em> in September 1998 at a new-and-used video game store in Whitehorse, Yukon. I can’t recall the name of it anymore, but like all things in a small town, I can still picture it through the memory of all the landmarks that led me there: up the street from the SAAN store and the mall that isn’t really a mall, around the corner from the record store that isn’t there anymore, and across the road from the store that sold Hummel figurines of blank-faced children casting forlorn glances at an unseen God and discount copies of the King James Bible.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> was given prominence on the shelf by the pedigree of its publisher Squaresoft (now Square Enix) and was displayed in conversation with its brethren. <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, released by Squaresoft in January of 1997, was the catalyst for sculpting Playstation devotees from children raised by parents who called all video games “Nintendos”. While <em>FF7</em> remained an insistent pleasure, catalogued by my well-worn and dog-eared copy of the official Prima strategy guide, I was hungry for something more as its secrets and mysteries waned.&nbsp;</p><p>A <em>Parasite Eve</em> ad in Electronic Gaming Monthly lingered in my mind: Portraits of two women’s faces, crafted by polygons, with the tagline “the worst foe lies within”. The ad claimed <em>Parasite Eve</em> was “the cinematic RPG” and promised the game would come with a collectors CD containing playable demos of <em>Xenogears, Bushido Blade 2, Brave Fencer Musashi</em>, and, notably<em>, Final Fantasy VIII</em>. I knew little about what <em>Parasite Eve</em> was going to be, but in my mind it was going to be everything, with a free demo of <em>FF8 </em>to boot. I can always be tantalized with the promise of a free taste of my lasting desires.&nbsp;</p><p>Every lunch break from work, I would walk up to the video game store and ask if <em>Parasite Eve </em>was out yet, until the day that it was, and then its secrets were mine to take home and unravel. When I bought it, the guy warned me that it was a Girl Game. “Just wanted to make sure you know”, he said. I said I wanted it mostly for the <em>FF8</em> demo, and left quickly with my lies in tow. I finished the rest of the workday, sped home, burrowed into the basement where the good TV sat alone in the dark, snapped the first disc into the flimsy Playstation spindle, and went to the Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>RPGs were still a new sensation for me, and while their meandering opening minutes are familiar to me now, at the time it felt like a challenge. In the opening of <em>FF7</em>, Cloud Strife leaps from the roof of a moving train to fight a whole mess of nameless Shinra guys, but in <em>Parasite Eve</em>, protagonist Aya Brea opens her story tepidly, reluctantly taking a dud on a pity date to opening night at Carnegie Hall.&nbsp;</p><p>My desire to keep going wavered at this moment, the clerk claiming this was a Girl Game taunting my heart. I was already struggling to weave the tender threads of my identity into some perfect tapestry of masculinity; I was afraid of being perceived by anyone, including myself, as anything other than status quo. I had questions about myself that had no clear answer: No words to describe how I felt at odds with my body, how I desired a change that I could not name or seek out. All this worry, all the careful upkeep of a lie, piled on and ran slipshod through the hallways of my anxious mind when Eve, <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s antagonist, emerged on stage piloting the body of a struggling New York actress and set the theatre on fire.</p><p>I had to know more. The ad in EGM had promised a cinematic RPG and here it was coming true, seamlessly moving between otherworldly cutscenes and action I was able to control. Given free rein of Aya Brea’s movement, albeit with the clunky tank controls <em>Resident Evil </em>was just beginning to popularize. Aya rushed the stage, and for the first time in a video game I questioned the outfit choices of my avatar. I wondered how she could run in the heels she wore with her black cocktail dress, where she had stashed the gun she pulled on Eve. I wanted to know where Aya kept her secret things, and how she managed to pull it all together with ease.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I wanted words to describe the secrets of my body. A framework to develop a skeleton upon which to lay sinew and skin, to run blood that felt like my own through my veins. Cloud’s brief dalliance with crossing the boundaries of gender at the Honey Bee Inn in <em>FF7</em> had opened a window, but the door remained closed.&nbsp;</p><p>I wanted to stumble upon change in the wild and have it happen to me without having to ask. I wanted there to be words I never had to seek out. I wanted it to be easy, because I always wanted it to be easy. I wanted Cloud to point through the screen and demand my attention as he recited the words that could describe a body severed from its heart. I wanted words like ‘transgender” and “dysphoria” to materialize, even though I didn’t know they were real.&nbsp;</p><p>On <em>Parasite Eve</em>’s stage, as Aya has her gun trained on the fire-conjuring opera singer, Eve monologues about the cells in the body, how they call out in desperate communication. Then I’m controlling the action; I let Aya shoot Eve in the chest for very little damage. Eve laughs, and Aya wonders what is changing in her. “My Body!…It’s…! It’s getting hot!”&nbsp;</p><p>As Aya’s latent Parasite Energy came alive in her, my mind cried out with desire for questions it never knew were real. Eve says, “Just what I thought”, but gives no explanation why.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Parasite Eve</em> plays with formula. Engage in combat and the game becomes a blend of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>. Aya moves freely within the environment, able to sidestep attacks and wait for her action meter to build. She is like me, waiting to be ready. Throughout the game, Aya has a gun, then a club, then another, bigger gun. She has armour and stats and levels up. You can freely move about the battlefield, stopping only to select commands to attack, use items, or take control of Aya’s Parasite Energy. There are early shades of what would become the active battle mechanics of the overwrought remakes of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, but here it’s pared down, with no party to control or broader magic system. It’s streamlined, beautiful in its simplicity. It’s a game that puts you into its world so completely that you might never return.&nbsp;</p><p>After Aya defeats her on the stage, Eve flees into the basement of Carnegie Hall like the Phantom lurking below the world. You can choose to jump down and give chase, or you can choose to forget it. I have only ever jumped down immediately. When you land, a mysterious child awaits you, and Aya gives chase into the stone hallways of the basement. A rat mutates before her eyes, its monstrous transformation triggered by changing cells in its body. It becomes a grotesque version of its former self, and then in death it becomes nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>In dressing rooms, bodies lay charred and dying on the floor, one of whom mutters the name “Melissa” as it succumbs. A diary in another room tells me that Melissa is the body that Eve has grown inside of, taken over and turned into something more. Something evil, but something aware of who they are. Melissa writes in her diary about the life she wants for herself and how she would make a deal with the devil to have it, even just for a moment.&nbsp;</p><p>The words in Melissa’s diary are familiar desires for desperate change. She knows there is something in her, something dangerous maybe, that she cannot find words to describe. Her desires have a name she doesn’t know for a change she cannot imagine. I remember my own hands clasped in desperate prayer for whatever God or devil might change me, and the fear that whatever I was hiding in my body might destroy everything I know. How afraid I was to admit I was willing to take the risk.&nbsp;</p><p>When Aya eventually finds Eve once more, she tells her of the mitochondria in the body she can manipulate and control, how she can turn anyone and anything into whatever she sees fit. Anyone save Aya, with whom she shares a secret bond, and is immune to the transformations happening around them. Aya fights more rats, a mutated parrot, and Eve again. Out of combat, the game returns the tank controls and clunky movement to my hands and I bid Aya to move. As she runs, I can hear the click-clack of her steps on the floor, and I worry about her feet in those heels.</p><p>The monstrous change Eve brings about in the lives she destroys should be terrifying, but it lights a fire of possibility in my chest all the same. I never tell anyone I want to know how it feels to be made so wholly new. In the game it’s grotesque, but that’s just pixels telling a story. I wonder how it would feel for my own bones to grow and reform into the beautiful vision of a body hidden in my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The day after the Carnegie Hall incident, Aya dons her civilian attire: blue jeans, white shirt, leather jacket. Effortlessly cool but no less alluring. I move Aya through New York City as Eve turns people into goop and animals into monsters. We fight at the zoo, at the natural history museum. We battle on a carriage pulled at breakneck speed by a horse on fire. With each encounter, Eve begs Aya to join with her, become one with her. The body is hot, and desperate, and yearning. Aya defies Eve’s call, but questions herself all the same. Someone different from her peers, seeking to understand who she is becoming without hiding from the power challenging her perception of the truth of her body.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea of representation has changed in the years since I searched for words and phrases in places they would never appear. I built ideas out of imperfect texts, and found sanctuary where none was slated to be built. Now, when the words appear, they are focused, honed like a blade. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has a trans bartender who street races with a truck emblazoned with a trans flag. The ghost in <em>Paper Mario</em> is canonically trans. There are flags and phrases hidden among the digital bric-a-brac of the world. This is all a net positive, but building a name for myself from grotesque and beautiful hints made transness an idea that never really needed the right words in order to build an altar to limitless potential. I need the answer of transness less than I needed the possibility of the questions it begged me to ask, of who I was and what I could build of myself by challenging an easy narrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There were no words to describe who I really wanted to be, but there were hints and allegations, and they were alive in <em>Parasite Eve</em>. I played it all without ever once turning the Playstation off, and when it was over I played it again, searching for the secrets that might yet reveal themselves to me.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-escapist-siliconera-destructoid-layoffs"><h3>Gamurs Websites Aren’t Just Laying Off Workers, Entire Sites Are Being Mothballed</h3></a><p>'Entire websites, like the Escapist and Twinfinite, are just sitting basically dormant'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo"><h3>The Pitt&nbsp;Isn’t&nbsp;Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama</h3></a><p>In between instilling an appreciation for medical personnel, it’ll have you fujoshiing out</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong> CI Games <a href="https://x.com/CIGamesOfficial/status/1912876320360439961" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that there will be a small delay to the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0 on Steam due to a technical issue. The Epic Games Store, Windows Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X versions are unaffected.</p>
<p><strong>[ORIGINAL STORY]</strong> Today, CI Games launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen 2.0</a>, a 'definitive' update to the Soulslike game that seeks to address several of the community's requests. Marek Tyminski, CEO of CI Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Version 2.0 is the definitive edition of Lords of the Fallen and contains 50+ post-launch updates. The Free Friend’s Pass, shared progression co-op, and more are our way of saying thank you to our community. Honestly, the game has grown way beyond what we first imagined when we launched in 2023 – now is the perfect time for new players to join our franchise and current fans to experience Lords in an exciting new light.</em></p>
<p>As the executive mentioned, the game now includes fully shared co-op progression and a Free Friend's Pass. There's now free access to the character creator and the entire tutorial area of the base game. Following the completion of the tutorial, players can experience the entire adventure in online co-operative multiplayer when playing with a friend who owns the base game. Character progress and loot are saved between sessions, though only the host retains world progression.</p>
<p>In Lords of the Fallen 2.0, both co-op players save all mainline story progress when on the same ‘New Game’ playthrough, having killed a similar number of main bosses (within one). Defeated bosses and lit beacons persist in both worlds; both players can revive each other and collect 100% vigor and all loot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen 2.0 Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WOqW5SRwYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There are also other improvements to be found in Lords of the Fallen 2.0. The character creator now includes improved facial options, skin textures, and body shapes for both male and female models. The User Interface has been overhauled to be cleaner and easier to navigate, and a new guidebook has been added so players may reference previous tutorial prompts at any time.</p>
<p>The combat system now has more accurate weapon handling and refined lock-on mechanics. Mobility has been improved, featuring quicker evasion moves and more responsive controls. A dedicated jump button improves the platforming experience. Weapon audio was enhanced, amplifying every swing, parry, and block. A brand-new Umbral Lamp guidance mechanic now highlights the path forward through Mournstead. Lastly, new grievous strike button prompts have been added.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a free update for existing users. Any potential newcomers can now get the game at discounted pricing:</p>
<p>● PlayStation Spring Sale (April 9th – April 23rd):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 72% off at $19.60<br>
○ Deluxe Upgrade Pack (from Standard to Deluxe): 72% off at $5.60<br>
● Xbox Spring Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 70% off at $20.99, also included in Game Pass<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 70% off at $23.99<br>
● Steam Custom Sale (April 17th – May 1st):<br>

● Epic Games Store Savings (April 10th – April 24th):<br>
○ Standard Edition: 67% off at $19.80<br>
○ Deluxe Edition: 67% off at $23.10</p>
<p>The game didn't score highly <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, but perhaps he'll be willing to give it another chance with the release of Lords of the Fallen 2.0.</p>

It’s unclear if Norrin will show up in <em>First Steps</em>, or if the Marvel Cinematic Universe is playing with the character’s backstory. Either way, the Silver Surfer is the “herald” of Galactus, who marks Earth for destruction before the big guy shows up to do his thing. We see her confronting the Fantastic Four, and her arrival sends the public into a frenzy. Everyone is looking to the heroes for answers and reassurance, and Mister Fantastic straight-up tells them that shit looks bleak. All of this is happening as the Fantastic Four is expecting a new addition, as Sue Storm is pregnant, and an incoming apocalypse is not an ideal situation to bring a baby into.</p><p>Check out the trailer below:</p><p>All four members of the Fantastic Four are confirmed to star in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, as each actor was featured in Marvel’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474">obnoxiously long casting reveal last month</a></span>.

Amid all the new tricks and modes, Nintendo also confirmed a slew of new and returning tracks and racers for Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the course side, there were several new courses shown off as part of the roamable world. From the streets of Crown City to the water of Salty Salty Speedway, there are plenty of places to explore and shortcuts to discover. Mechanics like wall-riding and grinding seem like they'll add quite a bit for players to uncover. Here's what we spotted in today's Direct.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Confirmed Courses Shown in Today's Direct</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario Bros.

Mario Kart World looks to be making some deep pulls from Mario's history. The usual suspects of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi are joined by the likes of Spike, Conkdor, Penguin, and more. Here's everyone we spotted in a kart during today's Mario Kart World Direct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World Confirmed Racers From Today's Direct</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Mario</li><li>Luigi</li><li>Peach</li><li>Daisy</li><li>Rosalina</li><li>Pauline</li><li>Yoshi</li><li>Toad</li><li>Koopa Troopa</li><li>Baby Mario</li><li>Baby Luigi</li><li>Baby Peach</li><li>Baby Daisy</li><li>Baby Rosalina</li><li>Wario</li><li>Waluigi</li><li>Bowser</li><li>Goomba</li><li>Spike</li><li>Cow</li><li>Lakitu</li><li>Toadette</li><li>Bowser Jr.</li><li>Birdo</li><li>King Boo</li><li>Shy Guy</li><li>Donkey Kong</li><li>Nabbit</li><li>Pirahna Plant</li><li>Hammer Bro</li><li>Monty Mole</li><li>Sidestepper</li><li>Cheep Cheep</li><li>Dry Bones</li><li>Wiggler</li><li>Cataquack</li><li>Pianta</li><li>Rocky Wrench</li><li>Conkdor</li><li>Chargin' Chuck</li><li>Penguin</li><li>Stingby</li><li>Swoop</li><li>Dolphin</li><li>Para-Biddybud</li><li>Pokey</li><li>Coin Coffer</li><li>Peepa</li><li>Snowman</li><li>Fish Bone</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">It's quite a line-up so far, and will probably only expand as we learn more about this game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo shared with us a Mario Kart World Direct and it revealed much more about the launch title for the Nintendo Switch, including new details on characters, courses, races, secrets, and so much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This roundup has gathered everything you need to know about this Mario Kart World Direct and we hope it will help with the wait until this much-anticipated game launches alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Courses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World will feature a ton of new and old courses on its interconnected map, and we were introduced to a few of them today, including Mario Bros. Circuit, Crown City, Salty Salty Speedway, Starview Peak, Boo Cinema, Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What should be most exciting for returning Mario Kart players is that the older courses have been "reimagined to feel at-home within this vast, new world, offering fresh experiences on classics." </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Characters and New Techniques</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering up to 24 racers can compete in one race, Mario Kart World will need a lot of characters to ensure everyone doesn't play the same one. While there are sure to be more added and revealed, this Direct featured such characters as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy, Baby Rosalina, Rosalina, Koopa, Rocky Wrench, Conkdor, Goomba, Spike, Cow, King Boo, Bowser, Donkey Kong, Waluigi, Baby Mario, Baby Luigi, Birdo, Bowser Jr., Lakitu, Toad, Wario, Pauline, Toadette, Shy Guy, Nabbit, Piranha Plant, Hammer Bro, Monty Mole, Dry Bones, Wiggler, Cataquack, Pianta, Sidestepper, and Cheep Cheep.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Driving with these characters will be even more fun this time around as there are new techniques to utilize. Charge Jump gives racers a chance to dodge enemy attacks, reach higher places and rails that can be grinded on, and even jump towards a wall to ride on it for a short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most exciting new additions is Rewind, as it will let players try again to reach a hidden path or take a turn better or whatever! However, it is important to note that rivals will still move normally if you rewind so you could find yourself in even more trouble if you aren't careful.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mario Kart World Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Races - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There are two main modes in Mario Kart World - Grand Prix and Knockout Tour. Grand Prix will be the mode fans are used to as players will need to compete in multiple races to win the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Flower Cup, and more. However, this time around players will drive from course to course instead of exiting out to a menu, which should make for a much more seamless experience thanks to Mario Kart World's more open structure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to conquer all of the Grand Prix Cups, a certain "colorful course" may appear which sure sounds like Rainbow Road. It won't be easy though, as there will be new obstacles like cars that shoot bullet bills and Hammer Bros. that throw their namesake hammers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Knockout Tour is a battle-royale-esque mode where you have to race from one side of Mario Kart World's map to the other. The only catch is you have to be in a certain place at each checkpoint or you will be knocked out of the race. The winner will be the last driver standing in the Golden Rally, Ice Rally, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mario Kart World Free Roam</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario Kart World's Free Roam mode, players will be able to drive wherever they'd like without the worry of trying to be in first place. As you explore, you will discover things like P Switches (hundreds of them!) that will activate blue coins you'll need to collect and start missions. These missions will be challenges that will improve your skills outside of races.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There will also be hidden coins like Peach Medallions, hidden panels, and much more. Oh, and there is a photo mode in Free Roam that will be available to always capture that perfect moment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Visiting Yoshi's restaurant will also be a joy as you can pick up "Dash Food" that will give you a boost of speed and an outfit inspired by your meal! Some examples shown were a cheeseburger, sushi, skewers, chips, roasted meat, pizza, ice cream, and more.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Playing Mario Kart World with Friends</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing Mario Kart World with friends will undoubtedly be one of the best ways to play this racing game, and Nintendo is giving players a ton of options in how they can do that. Such options include having four players play on one system, local wireless play with up to eight players (two systems of four), and up to 24 players from around the world playing in Online Play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big feature in Mario Kart World is allowing players to free roam with their friends in between races. Players will be able to see where their friends are on the map and fast travel to them for some fun. You can then battle or race with custom rules or just explore the map with them. Photo Mode will also be available for friends!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameChat will also be an integral part of Mario Kart World as players will be able to talk to their friends and even see their reactions live on video for those who have a comptabile camera. If all players are on a single system, the camera can even detect up to four faces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Modes</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the modes we mentioned above, players will be able to jump into Time Trials, where there will also be an option to go online and race against ghost data of others around the world. VS Mode is next and it offers a ton of customization, including the option to compete with up to four different teams of racers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle Mode is back as well, and it includes such coompetitions as Coin Runners and Balloon Battle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Items</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be familiar items returning to Mario Kart like Bullet Bill and Lightning, there will also be some new additions like the Coin Shell that can knock rivals off course and provide a trail of coins for players to collect. There will also be an Ice Flower to freeze enemies, Hammers to attack enemies and block their paths, a Mega Mushroom that will grow players to monstrous heights, a Feather that will let players jump to avoid attacks, and even a Kamek item that will call in the classic character to transform players into something mysterious.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Support Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mario Kart World is aiming to be a game for players of all skill levels, and to reach that goal Nintendo is including some support features to help like Smart Steering, Tilt Controls (Joy-Con 2 wheel compatible!), Auto-Use Item, Auto-Accelerate, and the ability to adjust both the Vertical and Horizontal Camera.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-for-nintendo-switch-2-first-hands-on-preview">hands-on preview of Mario Kart World,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">how Nintendo is justifying its $80 price tag,</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/our-big-nintendo-switch-2-interview-with-nintendo-of-americas-bill-trinen">our big Nintendo Switch 2 interview with Nintendo's Bill Trinen</a> to learn more about the console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

<p>Earlier this month, Nintendo let Ars Technica and other outlets have access to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">a small hands-on slice of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a> ahead of its planned June 5 launch. Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq4uCJDwO9U">a short livestreamed video presentation</a> gave a bit of extra information about how exactly the full version of the free-roaming Nintendo Switch 2 launch game will work in practice.</p>
<p>As the name implies, <em>Mario Kart World</em> sets itself apart from previous games via a "vast interconnected world" that you can roam freely between the actual race courses. That open space between races will feature "hundreds of P-switches," Nintendo said, each of which activates a small mission to "hone your driving abilities." Free-roaming racers will also be able to find hidden medallions and question-mark panels, as well as "drive-thru" food items that can be used to unlock new outfits.</p>

<p>While cruising around the Mario Kart "world," players will stumble onto new courses "inspired by their surrounding region," as well as "nostalgic courses for past titles... reimagined and spread throughout the world." When playing in Grand Prix mode, the drive between these courses will be integrated into the usual four-course cups themselves; after racing Mario Kart Circuit in the Mushroom cup, for instance, the second race&nbsp;"will have you covering the distance from Mario Bros. Circuit to Crown City," Nintendo said.</p>
<p>The game's other main race mode, Knockout Tour, slowly whittles 24 racers down to just four via checkpoints spaced throughout the course. These "extended rallies" will take racers across the game world, with one track seamlessly flowing into another on a preset path.</p>

<p>Players who prefer a more traditional three-lap race on a single course can do so via the game's VS Mode races. The traditional battle mode will also return, with a Balloon Battle mode focused on hitting other players with weapons and a Coin Runners mode focused on getting more money than your opponents.</p>

<p>For Sigman and the Darkest Dungeon team, it was important to establish an overarching design philosophy that was set in place. That said, the details within that framework may change or evolve significantly during development.</p>
<p>“In this age of early access and easily updatable games, balance is a living thing,” Sigman said. “It’s highly iterative throughout the game’s public life. We will update balance based upon community feedback, analytics, evolving metas, and also reflections on our own design philosophies and approaches.”</p>

<p>The problem, of course, is that every change to an existing game is a double-edged sword. With each update, you risk breaking the very elements you’re trying to fix.</p>
<p>Speaking to that ongoing balancing act, Sigman admits, “It’s not without its challenges. We’ve found that many players eagerly await such updates, but a subset gets really angry when developers change balance elements.”</p>
<p>Getting one of your favorite heroes or abilities nerfed can absolutely sink a game or destroy a strategy you’ve relied on for success. The team relies on a number of strictly mathematical tools to help isolate and solve balance problems, but on some level, it’s an artistic and philosophical question.</p>
<p>“A good example is how to address ‘exploits’ in a game,” Sigman said. “Some games try to hurriedly stamp out all possible exploits. With a single-player game, I think you have more leeway to let some exploits stand. It’s nice to let players get away with some stuff. If you kick sand over every exploit that appears, you remove some of the fun.”</p>
<p>As with so many aspects of game design, perfecting the balance between adversity and empowerment comes down to a simple question.</p>
<p>“One amazing piece of wisdom from Sid Meier, my personal favorite designer, is to remember to ask yourself, ‘Who is having the fun here? The designer or the player?’ It should be the player,” Sigman told us.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of approach that players love to hear. Even if a decision is made to make a game more difficult, particularly in an existing game, it should be done to make the play experience more enjoyable. If it begins to feel like devs are making balance changes just to scale down players’ power, it can begin to feel like you’re being punished for having fun.</p>
<p>The fine balance between power and challenge is a hard one to strike, but what players ultimately want is to have a good time. Sometimes that means feeling like a world-destroying demigod, and sometimes it means squeaking through a bloody boss encounter with a single hit point. Most often, though, you're looking for a happy medium: a worthy challenge overcome through power and skill.</p>

The monsters absorb energy from downed bodies to evolve into greater threats, creating a combat loop where players don't just need to juggle threats coming in from all sides, but also keep an eye on the enemies they kill so they don't become food for the next enemy that spawns.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making a system like this juggles a number of unique disciplines—level design, AI programming, combat design, and more.

The aforementioned harvesting mechanic at the heart of the enemy AI systems allows for multiple evolutions. Enemies don't just get stronger, they can also learn new attack patterns and mutate into new character models. The pair showed off how basic enemies have two tiers of evolution, meaning players who can't knock down every enemy will face an entirely new kind of monster that could turn the tide in a fight.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-we-need-to-define-what-it-means-to-be-safe-as-gamers-around-the-world-a-code-of-ethics-in-gaming" target="_self" data-discover="true">'We need to define what it means to be safe as [players] around the world:' a code of ethics in gaming</a></p><p>Image via Bloober Team.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair explained that gunplay and traversal in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cronos </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn't just an updated version of what Bloober made in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Player movement and shooting is meant to mimic what is often referred to as the "tank controls" of survival horror games from the late '90s and early 2000s. These games limited player movement, slowed down aiming, and used restrictive camera angles to make it harder to spot enemies at a distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though novel for their time, advancements in video game combat as a whole make "tank controls" a less appealing experience for most modern players. To recreate that sensation without relying on decades-old restrictions, Bloober made two key design decisions. The more subtle one was to mandate that guns not fire with a simple trigger press. They need to be charged up, giving enemies time to close the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The more surprising choice—one that greatly diverges from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—was to not give players a "dodge" button. Players instead are given a resource-dependent flamethrower burst that can push enemies away or eliminate dead bodies used for power-ups. The resource-juggling is familiar to survival horror, but denying players a dodge button goes against recent trends. None of this, the pair said, could be done without Bloober increasing headcount and seeking out developers with specific skills.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/-a-vicious-cycle-translator-unions-call-out-keywords-for-lowballing-contract-workers" target="_self" data-discover="true">'A vicious cycle:' Translator unions call out Keywords for lowballing contract workers</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We bolster a team [with] specific people," said Zieba, noting that Bloober hired a dedicated "gunsmith" whose sole job would be making the charge-heavy guns.

"It's easier to get better specialists who love survival horror like us," he said. Zieba said the studio at large still operates in a "hybrid" mode. "But for some of them, we know there is no going back," he said.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features more than 100 notes to collect and read, and it's worth searching for each one. Compulsion Games knocked it out of the park regarding storytelling in South of Midnight, and these notes are no exception.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll notice more notes to grab in this chapter than in any previous chapter. So if you were going to try and find them yourself, it's best to be vigilant about searching an area before you move on.</p>
<p>But if you're already here, I imagine you want to make sure you don't miss any of the 15 notes in Chapter 7. Here's where to grab each one.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 7</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 had 11 notes to find, Chapter 6 had 10, and now Chapter 7 has 15. And that's not even the most you'll see in a single chapter. But that's still to come.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Lost Boy</strong> - At the start of the chapter, follow the path until you hear Hazel point out the old sawmill, which will happen just before you're about to jump across a river. Jump across, and turn left to find a climbing path that leads you up and around the rock wall to an area blocked by the bramble and vines. You'll find the note on a box next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lost Liquor</strong> - You'll find this note after the first combat encounter of the chapter. Once you've cleared it, look to the right and you'll likely be able to spy a health filament behind some branches. You'll find the note resting on some boxes just ahead of the branches, and since you're there, you might as well grab the filament.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Lieutenant Laurent</strong> - When you reach the memory object showing a clip of Hazel's mother, look to your right. You'll find the note on an old dresser at the entrance to a path with a box and a Floof knot to jump to.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Babblin' Boy</strong> - After finding the last note and crossing the river, turn left to find a path blocked by some branches you can push out of the way. Behind them, you'll find the note on a box next to a metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Baby Faced Laurent</strong> - From the last note, follow the path, and you'll have to cross the river again, using echoes of a bridge to do so. Once you've passed the echo bridge, turn left, and you'll find this note on a box next to another metal sheet.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Lil' Drunkards</strong> - After finding the last note, follow the path and jump over two big bramble vines. You'll see this note in a hollow dead tree that should be directly in front of you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>End of Prohibition -&nbsp;</strong>After clearing the combat encounter that ends with you using Crouton to clear the Stigma, you'll head under a large tree as you follow the path to leave. This note is to the right of the path, underneath the tree.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Boy out of Time</strong> - You'll find this note almost immediately after you find the last one. Once you walk beyond the tree, you'll see a building to your right. The note is resting on a structure just on the porch of the building.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Heart of Lace</strong> - After the cutscene with Laurent at the Juke Joint, head back into the shop and go up the stairs. You'll find this note on a box next to Laurent and Lacey's picture.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Treatment</strong> - Once you reach Milltown after using the grapple, head straight down the path, and you'll find this note inside the house on the right, on a table next to a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Mother's Last Words</strong> - Inside the same house you find the last note in, this note is on a bedframe at the back of the house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Everything Helps</strong> - When you enter Milltown, you'll be able to see a broken-down well to your left. Turn left past the well, and then look to your right to see a building that's missing a wall. Walk into the building to find this note on a box on your right, just ahead of a combat encounter.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Father's Job</strong> - After clearing the combat arena just beyond the last note you found, and watching the first of Laurent's memories, this one will be waiting for you in a building to the right of a big crane, next to two giant saws crossed over each other and making an 'X'.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Penny Saved</strong> - You'll find this one on the second floor of the sawmill, which you reach after finding all four of Laurent's memories. When you make it to the second floor, you'll use your grapple to cross a big gap around the outside of he mill. Once you're back inside, look to your left to see some wood you can push out of the way. Push that, then another bundle of wood, and you'll see this note resting on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Maintaining Productivity</strong> - This last note can be found in the office, just beyond where you found the previous note. You'll also find a Floof knot in this office, right next to the note on a desk.</p>
<p>And that's where you can find all 15 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 7. If you've followed these guides so far, you'll have found 53 out of the 103. Only 50 more to go.</p>
