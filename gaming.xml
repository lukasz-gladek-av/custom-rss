<figure data-uuid="7d8da377289a5"><a title="20TH NFS MW" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d8da377289a5/20th-nfs-mw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/need_for_speed_hot_pursuit_remastered">Need for Speed</a> video game franchise, much like those movies with Vin Diesel in them (you know, the car ones), well...there's a lot of them. In fact, there are over 20 Need For Speed games as things currently stand, and some of them are even good!</p>
<p>Yep, I'd go so far as to say that some of them are very, very good indeed, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/need_for_speed_most_wanted">Need for Speed Most Wanted</a>, I'm quite confident in declaring, is the best of the bunch. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/need_for_speed_hot_pursuit_remastered">Hot Pursuit</a> does come close, I'm not gonna lie, it's 99% of the way there in terms of moment-to-moment thrills (and it's got a very nice Switch remaster these days), but 2005's Most Wanted remains king of the series, with a GameCube port that really impressed back in the day as it got rid of the game's very noughties, yellow-tinged filter. The p**s filter, if you will.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fqlztnx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Now, don't worry, there's a poll at the bottom where you can vote against me for <em>your</em> favourite from a selection of NFS titles <em>[You're 100% right, it's definitely got '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/need_for_speed_most_wanted_u">Most Wanted</a>' in the title. - Ed.]</em>, and I'd love to hear all arguments for and against in the comments.</p>
<p>But, for now, I'd like to celebrate 20 years of Most Wanted — it launched in Europe on 25th November 2005, and 10 days earlier in North America — by talking about why it's so damn good, and that comes down to the simple fact that it focuses intensely on street racing and pursuit skills at a <em>driving level</em>, rather than utilising pursuit tech or special powers (à la Hot Pursuit) to bring cop chases and illegal racing activities to life in a thoroughly exciting and organic-feeling way.</p>

<p>Of course, Hot Pursuit came later, and in practice, its focus on gadgets worked really well, within the confines of what it was doing. However, in the street racing world of Most Wanted, on the streets of Rockport, and facing off against its 15 rival racers (all of whom you're charged with taking down, whilst also developing a troublesome relationship with the local fuzz), pure racing skills, timing, slick handbrakes, and last-minute misdirections are where it's at. And it's deliciously entertaining all the way for it.</p>
<p>In the races here, you get to indulge in street-set circuit and point-to-point efforts that like to hammer home that you aren't just racing, you're breaking the law. You cheeky sod. So you've got these awesome movie-like vibes straight out of the gate framing the action — something that racers don't often bring to the table outside this franchise — before the cops then show up like clockwork to make everything feel x100 cooler than it already did.</p>
<p>There's so much opportunity within this racing triangle of you versus your rivals versus the cops that no two races ever come off the same when the law gets involved. I mean, why win anything straight-up and boring style, when you can mess with some po-po at the same time?</p>
<p>Video games, and especially these days with battle passes and all that jazz, come with so much baggage, so many distractions. Most Wanted, though, has you locked and loaded, aware of your objective and on the streets racing without any of that nonsense in double quick time. This is a game where the thrill of a close thing, speed multiplied by danger, and driving super-boosted and turbo-charged with style is the order of the day, but it's also a game that gives you racing that works competitively when it has to. Indeed, the one fly in the ointment of the Gamecube version was that it had no online play, which was a shame given how well this one plays with other folk.</p>

<p>It's the sort of upper-echelons type of arcade racer that nails the <em>feel</em> of things deliciously. It strikes a sexy balance in the handling of its roster of 37 vehicles that sits exactly where it should do, in a magical spot between sim and all-out arcade silliness.</p>
<p>It's a feeling that Need for Speed games get right more than most. Hot Pursuit nailed it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/need_for_speed_underground_2">Underground 2</a> nailed it, and Most Wanted gets it bang on, too, and it gives these games a timeless quality that's rare in the genre, meaning that even now, booting up your GameCube to have an anniversary race or two, it's not lost any of its ability to draw you in. <em>Just one more race, and then I'll write that goddamn anniversary post.</em> That sort of thing.</p>
<p>It helps, too, that the GameCube got such a good port, besides the omission of online. I was very impressed in 2005, and actually preferred the look of this one to my Xbox copy, as it didn't have that awful yellow filter that I mentioned. The less said about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/need_for_speed_most_wanted">the awful DS port</a> the better (I could have not said anything at all but where's the fun it that?), as some things are just a bridge too far, but the GameCube version got it spot on, and continues to do so, in its fluidity, wonderfully slick controls and in graphics that, while aged for sure, still bring it home and get the job done in 2025.</p>
<p>Now. With that being said, I would love to know, on this 20th anniversary of my favourite NFS, what your favourite NFS game is from the abridged selection below. So, make sure to give the poll a vote and sound off down below if you feel...well...if you feel the need. Innit.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Got a favourite that's not in the list here, or just straight-up disagree with anything about Most Wanted, be sure to let us know in the comments!</em><em><br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have released Project Motor Racing today on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. Players can jump in today and get a feel for the 70 cars across 13 classes and 28 tracks available at launch.</p>



<p>More tracks, cars, brands, and more will be added in post-launch updates, but right off the top, Project Motor Racing has a lot for players to dig their tires into, especially as it's <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/">arriving with full modding support,</a> which was announced this past June. And that's not just modding support for PC players, it's for console players too, thanks to the official GIANTS Editor and the UGC Portal allowing for mods to be easily integrated for all players.</p>



<p>Straight4 Studios and GIANTS Software also released a new launch trailer, which you can check out for yourself below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3bdKDsJcNUw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The single-player "<em>survival-style career</em>" mode lets players experience the intensity and the real-life consequences that come with professional racing, and how quickly a star-studded dream career can turn into a nightmare.</p>



<p>"<em>Project Motor Racing was created by people who love this sport and shaped by a community that cares just as much</em>," said Ian Bell, chief executive officer at Straight4 Studio, in a press release. "<em>We hope it gives racers the same sense of connection and excitement it gave us - something true to the sport we all love</em>."</p>



<p>On top of Project Motor Racing arriving with a bunch of cars and tracks to dig into, players will also be able to play it with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-in-project-motor-racing-prologue-go-wayback/">full DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</a>, as it is one of this week's titles added to the list of games supporting NVIDIA's upscaling tech.</p>



<p>"<em>By combining Straight4’s racing expertise with our proven modding ecosystem, we’re creating a platform that can grow, evolve, and stay authentic through its community</em>," added head of publishing at GIANTS Software, Boris Stefan. "<em>This launch is just the starting grid for our ambitions</em>. <em>We’re committed to growing Project&nbsp; Motor Racing into a defining name in the genre</em>."</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-final-clearance-on-anker-iphone-charger-basically-giving-it-away-for-free-at-this-point-2000647203</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-goes-final-clearance-on-anker-iphone-charger-basically-giving-it-away-for-free-at-this-point.1364092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Anker charging bundle has become the <strong>#1 bestselling charger on Amazon over Black Friday</strong> and the pricing explains the overwhelming popularity immediately. Apple asks for $20 for a single 20W charger that doesn’t even include a cable and forces separate purchases that drive total costs upward quickly.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">$11, down from $18, you’re getting here two complete 20W Anker chargers + two USB-C to USB-C cables</a> in a single package that costs less than one official Apple charger alone. Anker’s good reputation as an <strong>Apple-approved accessory manufacturer</strong> sold in the Apple Stores instills confidence that these chargers meet quality and safety standards without paying Apple Tax premiums.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>20W Fast Charging That Meets Apple’s Official Specs</h2>
<p>This 20W power output provides the <strong>fastest charging speed supported by the USB-C ports</strong> of the iPhone 15, 16, and 17 models-just like Apple’s own charger specifications. Compared to the old 5W adapters that came packaged with earlier iPhones, this wattage offers noticeably quicker charging: by up to 50% for most devices.</p>
<p>You will be able to charge your iPhone 17 to about 50% in roughly 30 minutes when paired with a 20W charging system. For phones supporting fast, seamless top-ups during daily routines or during stopovers at home between activities, the charging speed works just as well with iPads, Samsung phones, and other USB-C devices equipped with Power Delivery fast-charging protocols.</p>



<p>The compact<strong> dual-port design includes both USB-C and USB-A outputs</strong> to charge two devices at once with no compromise in speed and without occupying multiple wall outlets. A configuration like this proves to be a real asset in homes where wall outlets remain scarce and several family members fight for a chance to charge their devices.</p>
<p>Charge your iPhone through USB-C while powering AirPods, Apple Watch, or older Lightning devices via the USB-A port with the appropriate cables. The intelligent power distribution ensures that both ports deliver optimal charging speeds rather than splitting power inefficiently, which would slow both devices down.</p>



<p>Anker has several safety features including <strong>overvoltage protection</strong> to prevent excessive voltage from damaging connected devices, temperature control that reduces power output if overheating occurs, and short circuit protection to shut off power during fault conditions. Such protections count because many no-name low-cost chargers have inadequate safety implementations and poses the risk of fire or even device damage through poorly regulated power delivery.</p>
<p>The <strong>included 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cables</strong> are long enough to support comfortable device use while charging, from floor outlets to desks or bedside tables, without tight stretching. The length of the cable balances portability for travel and practicality for daily use at home, where often 3-foot cables can be frustratingly short.</p>
<p>At $11, the Anker 2-pack includes four pieces in total: two 20W dual-port chargers and two 5-foot USB-C cables, all at 41% below retail this Black Friday. Apple sells its single 20W charger sans cables for nearly double which makes Anker’s value proposition for buyers needing more than one charging point absurdly favorable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-tab-s10-fe-drops-to-record-low-for-pennies-might-be-time-to-offload-that-ipad-now.1364089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung and Apple battle relentlessly across every product category from smartphones to laptops to tablets, with each company trying to outdo the other on features, performance, and ecosystem integration. The <strong>Galaxy Tab S10 FE launched just months ago</strong> as Samsung’s direct challenge to standard iPads and offers comparable performance and features at more aggressive pricing.</p>
<p>The <em>Fan Edition</em> designation indicates this model <strong>prioritizes value over bleeding-edge specs</strong>, and positions it as the sweet spot in Samsung’s tablet lineup where you get flagship features without paying flagship premiums. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/">At $359, down from $499, this 128GB/WiFi model has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday that undercuts not just the standard iPad but also Samsung’s own higher-tier Tab S10 models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5676/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Rivals iPads</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.9-inch LCD display at 2304 x 1440 resolution</strong> contributes to sharp visuals above the standard iPad resolution while matching the pixel density of more expensive tablets. You get an <strong>on-screen refresh rate of 90Hz</strong> that results in notably smoother scrolling, animations, and gaming compared to the 60Hz screens still common on tablets from rivals in this price range. This higher refresh rate makes daily interactions feel more responsive and fluid and reduces the subtle lag that plagues lower-refresh screens when you scroll rapidly through long documents or social media feeds.</p>



<p>The<strong> included S Pen stylus is a significant added value</strong> and allows handwriting, drawing, and precise input sans separate purchases like the Apple Pencil, which adds $129 to iPad prices. The pressure-sensitive tip and low latency make writing experiences that truly feel like pen on paper, rather than plastic on glass and encourages actual note-taking and sketching rather than awkward finger drawing</p>
<p><strong>Powered by the Exynos 1580 processor</strong>, it delivers ample performance for all multitasking, gaming and media consumption needs without thermal throttling and battery draining, issues that plagued mid-range tablet chips from yesteryear. It’s <strong>optimized by Samsung for smooth performance</strong> across productivity apps such as Microsoft Office, creative tools such as Adobe apps, and entertainment platforms such as Netflix, YouTube, and mobile games.</p>



<p>The<strong> IP68 rating for water resistance speaks to the exceptional durability</strong> for tablets that are normally kept away from water exposure. It certifies submersion up to 1.5 meters in water for up to 30 minutes, covers everything from kitchen spills to poolside use to bathroom entertainment without anxiety. Protection extends the tablet’s life by surviving accidents that would destroy unprotected devices.</p>
<p>It features a large-capacity cell and efficient power management<strong> for a battery life of up to 20 hours of mixed-use</strong>&nbsp;and covers several days of normal use between charges. Super Fast Charging reduces downtime when recharging becomes necessary, providing hours of use from brief charging sessions. The starting storage configuration is 128GB, <strong>with microSD expansion supporting up to 1TB additional capacity</strong> to ensure ample room for apps and documents.</p>
<p>At $359, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE gives you a 10.9-inch 90Hz display, Exynos 1580 processor, included S Pen with AI features, IP68 water resistance, a 20-hour battery, and expandable storage at 28% below retail this Black Friday. Fan Edition positioning delivers the optimal balance of features and pricing that makes premium tablet capabilities accessible without iPad premiums or flagship Galaxy pricing.</p>

        <p>Long ago, in the golden era of Talea, the Emperor kept the lands peaceful, and the people prospered. After passing away without naming a successor between his twin sons, a civil war raged between the North, Logos and the South, Mythos – fighting for who would take control of the throne. The townsfolk lived in fear from the atrocities being carried out in the conflict. In a bid to stop the destruction, a part of the empire’s military became Talea’s dedicated protectors.</p><p>From the everlasting darkness of war, these people were the beacon of light that brought people hope. The Lumen were born, and as guardians in their provinces, they ensure the safety of the residents of Talea, both the people and the Animon.</p><p>Since ancient times, people have long studied the Animon. Not much is known of their nature to this day. They’re made of Anivis, an energy that flows through the whole world, and they possess the ability to affect emotions and interact with the very soul of every living being. Catch the Animon and become inseparable partners as you harness their elemental powers and battle alongside each other with your Holoken.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Catching Animon</strong> – Test your skills with the Holoken and catch Animon in the field to recruit them to your party or initiate an incredible and exciting battle against them to prove your mettle! Every Animon can perform their own abilities and skills, and victory is achieved through using the best strategy with your team. There are around 140 known species with 13 elemental types, which are categorized with attributes depending on the emotion they’re able to evoke in people.</li><li><strong>Battles</strong> – Engage in thrilling 1v1 duels or team up for epic four-versus-four showdowns with your party in battle.

If you’re feeling adventurous, you’ll be able to experiment with ingredients to help nurture your Animon.</li><li><strong>The Anispace</strong> – The Anispace is a place that exists and doesn’t exist at the same time. A space detached from the world as we know it. Here is where you’ll find your Animon after you capture them and where you’ll be able to train your Animon for battle. Customize their space when they’re not in your battle party and create stronger bonds with them!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Explore the Region of Talea</span></h2><p><iframe title="LumenTale: Memories of Trey | Explore the region of Talea" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h_-20MkLzxE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/lumentale-memories-of-trey-delayed-to-spring-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft has teamed up with rubber footwear brand Crocs to give us some of the most, errm, eyecatching shoes on the market.</p>
<p>You see, these officially licensed Crocs have been designed to look like an Xbox controller, meaning they have been adorned with the controller's X, Y, B, A buttons and D-pad, as well as left and right analog sticks, and a white Xbox button. On the strap, meanwhile, is a green Xbox logo (which has replaced Crocs' own crocodile emblem).</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-in-project-motor-racing-prologue-go-wayback/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-available-in-project-motor-racing-and-prologue-go-wayback.1364056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest PC games to support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation are Prologue: Go Wayback!, which launched last Thursday <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, and Project Motor Racing, due to launch <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/299970/Project_Motor_Racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> today.</p>



<p>The former is a single-player, open world, emergent, survival roguelike game created by PUBG creator Brendan Greene and his team at PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. In Prologue: Go Wayback!, players can traverse a new wilderness space of around 64 square kilometers that is generated every time they play. They can chart a path across rugged terrain, overcome the elements and write their own exploration story as they attempt to reach the distant Weather Tower. The game has a year of content updates already planned, after which it will launch its 1.0 version. Players with a GeForce RTX 50 Series GPU can activate DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation to get the highest possible frame rates. GeForce RTX 40 Series users can boost their FPS with DLSS Frame Generation, and all other users can enhance performance with DLSS Super Resolution, which leverages NVIDIA's latest transformer AI model. </p>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is the second of a series of game projects planned by PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions, the ultimate goal being Artemis, a massive multiplayer sandbox game that is still many years out. You can read our exclusive interview with Brendan Greene <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-qa-fortnite-and-others-just-look-like-ip-bubbles-to-me-the-metaverse-has-to-be-different/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<p>As for <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-arrives-this-november-with-full-modding-support-on-day-one-new-trailer-showcases-career-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Motor Racing</a>, it's the new racing simulation game developed by Straight4 Studios and published by GIANTS Software. The game offers racing fans 28 tracks spanning multiple eras and over 70 faithfully replicated cars across 13 racing classes. Project Motor Racing includes a single-player career mode, a multiplayer mode where you can compete against others and navigate races packed with four classes, all of which are attempting to win their respective categories simultaneously. GeForce RTX 50 Series players can use DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation to get maximum performance. GeForce RTX 40 Series players can increase their frame rates with DLSS Frame Generation, while all other users can activate DLSS Super Resolution to enhance image quality using NVIDIA's most recent transformer AI model.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the city builder game Whiskerwood <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was launched on Steam Early Access</a> by Minakata Dynamics and Hooded Horse. Its twist is that you do not manage humans, but mice who toil under cat overlords. A free demo is available, and both the demo and the full game support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLAA.</p>



<p>Lastly, NVIDIA reminded its users that the highly anticipated action/adventure game Tides of Annihilation, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-stunning-boss-fight-gameplay-showing-off-mirror-realm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was showcased once again last week</a> during the Xbox Partner Preview event, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation on day one.</p>



<p>As a side note, NVIDIA users can claim a free Battlefield 6 Marksman SVK-8.6 DMR weapon skin from the NVIDIA app with GeForce Rewards by following these simple instructions: load the NVIDIA app, click “Redeem” on the left nav, and follow the steps to get the skin while supplies last.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-clears-32-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off-2000647195</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-32%E2%80%B3-165hz-gaming-monitor-odyssey-curved-display-now-goes-40-off.1364053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 57-inch Odyssey G9 ultrawide monitor commands attention and premium pricing,<a href="https://kotaku.com/samsung-57-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitor-240hz-1ms-is-800-off-hardcore-gamings-holy-grail-at-a-record-low-2000646508"> even when sales roll around</a>, but not everyone wants or can accommodate a display that dominates entire desks and requires dedicated space planning.</p>
<p>Standard-sized desks deserve premium gaming monitors too, and the <strong>32-inch Odyssey G55C delivers flagship features</strong> in dimensions that fit normal workspaces without sacrificing immersion or performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/">At $199, down from $329, this QHD curved gaming monitor has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and became the <strong>best-selling model across Samsung’s entire Odyssey lineup</strong>. That combination of 1000R curvature, 165Hz refresh rate, and genuine HDR10 support at this aggressive discount explains why it’s so popular.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5925/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000R Curvature That Matches Human Vision</h2>
<p>This <strong>2560 x 1440 QHD resolution packs 1.7 times more pixel density than standard 1080p displays</strong>&nbsp;and makes for noticeably sharper visuals where text stays crisp and game details remain clear during fast motion. As it is a sweet spot in resolution, it offers meaningful visual improvement over Full HD without the extreme GPU horsepower that 4K displays require to maintain high frame rates in demanding games.</p>
<p>Modern mid-range graphics cards handle QHD gaming comfortably at high settings, something that often forces compromise between visual quality and smooth performance if using 4K. Its wider aspect provides more horizontal screen real estate, which benefits both gaming and productivity by allowing the display of more content simultaneously, whether tracking enemies in competitive shooters or managing multiple windows during work sessions.</p>



<p>The <strong>aggressive 1000R curve radius comes closer to the natural curvature of human peripheral vision</strong> than, say, gentler curves at 1800R or even flat panels, making for immersive viewing that wraps content around your field of view. That tight curvature puts every part of the screen an equal distance from your eyes when properly positioned, minimising eye movement required to scan across the display while maintaining consistency in focus between centre and edges.</p>
<p>Racing games are dramatically better-the curved display creates peripheral awareness of oncoming corners and competitors. First-person shooters pick up situational awareness with better peripheral enemy detection. The effect of immersion proves most pronounced during longer gaming sessions, where the curved display pulls you into game worlds more effectively than flat monitors do, which maintain psychological distance between viewer and content.</p>



<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate ensures smooth motion rendering</strong> that eliminates the choppiness plaguing 60Hz displays when the game’s camera pans fast or the character is moving at incredible speeds. In competitive games, high refresh enables reduced motion blur and better target tracking to give you clear views of enemies in movement and quicker reaction capability when events catch you by surprise.</p>
<p>The <strong>response time of 1ms MPRT complements</strong> the high refresh by making sure pixel transitions are done fast enough to prevent ghost trails behind moving objects. FreeSync from AMD Radeon synchronizes display refresh with your GPU’s frame output and removes screen tearing for fluid visuals without the stutter that occurs when refresh and frame rates desync.</p>
<p><strong>HDR10 support extends the color range</strong> and contrast ratio beyond what standard dynamic range displays are capable of showing, revealing details in both shadows and highlights that SDR crushes into solid blacks or blown-out whites. Game scenes gain dramatic impact through deeper blacks, brighter highlights, and more saturated colors, making virtual worlds feel more alive and realistic.</p>
<p>At $199, the Samsung Odyssey hits that perfect sweet spot between immersion and practicality for standard desks, while the feature set compares well to premium monitors available for as much as twice the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/an-early-black-friday-shocker-apple-drops-a-749-deal-on-the-m4-macbook-air-at-amazon-2000646931</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-m4-macbook-air-hits-a-margin-free-black-friday-price-but-apple-only-offers-a-small-batch-for-black-friday.1364047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, here’s one we were not expecting on the Monday of Black Friday Week — a massive unannounced deal from Apple, of all companies. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">The 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the shocking subject of a huge 25% off deal at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $749</a>. With Apple’s laptop fleet of brand-new M5 models soaking up most of the attention, they’ve decided to sneak in a killer deal on a killer laptop.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the M4 chip makes this MacBook Air a beast for productivity, streaming, multitasking, or pretty much anything else you ask of it. The M4 was built specifically to run Apple Intelligence, and the MacBook Air has all of Apple’s industry-best features like the brilliant 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and 18 hours of battery life. It’s a perfect match for an iPhone, with the real-time mirroring feature that lets you answer calls and texts without having to break stride to reach for your phone, and it’s a seamless pairing with any of the AirPods models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Not New, But Definitely Not Old</h2>
<p>The M4 chip that drives the impeccable performance of the MacBook Air was Apple’s state-of-the-art processor and possibly the best anywhere in the tech world until the M5 dropped just this past October. So you don’t exactly need a time machine to hearken back to the days when the M4 ruled the roost, and the debut of the M5 does not detract one bit from its performance.</p>
<p>The M4 chip is twice as fast as the M1, and a mind-blowing 23 times faster than the last of Apple’s Intel processors. The Neural Engine that’s built into the M4 not only makes Apple Intelligence possible, it makes it run with blazing speed. There’s sufficient processing power for the Air to power up to two external displays with the same fast, fluid performance even for demanding tasks like video editing.</p>



<h2>Multimedia Superstar</h2>
<p>The MacBooks have long been among the very best laptops for connecting remotely for work or pleasure, and the M4 MacBook Air is a great example. The 12MP Center Stage camera ensures you’ll show up on the other end of a video call looking your best, and the MacBook Air’s three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio bolster a pro-level connection. Having Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections eliminates any online glitch-outs to keep the conversation rolling without interruption.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air isn’t one of those laptops with a million ports and jacks for external devices, but what it has — two Thunderbolt 4 ports in addition to its MagSafe charging port and a headphone jack — are top-notch for connecting external monitors or external storage or charging devices.</p>
<p>For a Monday deal during Black Friday Week, this one’s a shocker. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5916/">Apple’s 13-inch M4 MacBook Air shedding $250 from its price at Amazon and landing at a record-low $749 was most definitely not on our Bingo card</a>, but it’s real, and it’s potentially one that could cause a supply-draining stampede. We would not recommend sleeping on this one too long.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest year-end questions people have about the gaming industry this year is whether or not Battlefield 6 will outsell Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a feat that would end a 20-year run of Call of Duty's dominance. It remains to be seen if that will happen, and while we wait for the data to come in, Circana's Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m65enfy2fk2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some data points</a> about the shooter category in the US.</p><p>To begin with, Piscatella pointed out that the last shooter game to outsell a Call of Duty title in the US over a full year was Gears of War in 2006. The last FPS to beat Call of Duty was Star Wars: Battlefront II in 2005.</p><p>Call of Duty has reigned supreme in the US not just in the shooter and FPS categories, but generally as well. A Call of Duty game has finished the year as the best-selling title for 13 of the past 16 years, the exceptions being 2013 (GTA 5), 2018 (Red Dead Redemption II), and 2023 (Hogwarts Legacy).</p><p>"Still have some big weeks of potential sales to come, but this part of the market hasn't been this competitive in 20 years," Piscatella said of the shooter and FPS categories of the gaming market.</p><p>He added that comparing titles over such a long time horizon is imperfect because the gaming market today is much more "dynamic," especially with things like subscription services and free games like Fortnite. This means "sales alone don't tell the whole story."</p><p>Battlefield 6 is already performing better than Call of Duty's latest releases in the US. First-month sales of Battlefield 6 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380">higher than any other game's first-month sales going back to 2022</a>, meaning Battlefield 6 sold better out of the gate than 2024's Black Ops 6 and 2023's Modern Warfare 3. Battlefield 6 needed<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-first-month-sales-were-higher-than-any-game-since-2022-in-the-us/1100-6536380/" data-ref-id="1100-6536380"> just 22 days</a> to eclipse the entire lifetime sales of Battlefield 1 in the US.</p><p>It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-lost-300-million-in-sales-due-to-game-pass-report/1100-6535256/" data-ref-id="1100-6535256">missed out on $300 million+ in revenue for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> because it was on Xbox Game Pass. That doesn't tell the whole story, though, as the Black Ops 6 release no doubt incentivized people to sign up for Game Pass.</p><p>People will want to compare Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7, but no comparison between the two would be complete or necessarily fair for a variety of reasons. One is that Black Ops 7 is available on Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass. Another is that Black Ops 7 is releasing on more platforms than Battlefield 6, as Activision's game is supporting last-gen platforms and EA's is not. Yet another element to consider is that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-in-three-days-ea-confirms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 sales are reportedly skewed toward PC.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 launched on November 14, and in a break from tradition, Activision's celebratory first-weekend post <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-isnt-sharing-any-black-ops-7-launch-weekend-game-stats/1100-6536299/" data-ref-id="1100-6536299">did not include any data about how the game is performing</a> compared to past games. Before this, Activision <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-does-worry-about-fatigue-as-black-ops-7-arrives-right-after-black-ops-6/1100-6535019/" data-ref-id="1100-6535019">acknowledged "fatigue" around the Black Ops brand given the back-to-back releases of Black Ops 7 in 2024 and Black Ops 7 in 2025.</a></p><p>Prior to Black Ops 7's release, industry experts said Battlefield 6 didn't have a real chance at beating Black Ops 7, in part because of the size, scale, and momentum of the Call of Duty series. One analyst said people buy Call of Duty every year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-looks-great-but-it-wont-beat-call-of-duty-this-year/1100-6534282/" data-ref-id="1100-6534282">"autopilot purchasing," even if they complain about a lack of new features or innovation.</a></p><p>Circana's report for US sales in November will be released on December 17, so keep checking back with GameSpot to see how Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 sales compare.</p>

            <p>When Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, the game director of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> and secondary director on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, left CD Projekt Red in 2021, he did so under a dark cloud, accused of workplace bullying. A four month-long external investigation cleared him of any charges but the taint of the accusations linger still.</p>
<p>"It's always difficult," Tomaszkiewicz told me when we met in London last week. "It's always difficult because when stuff like this happens, it's really difficult to show people that it wasn't like this, because people like to assume some things."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-director-leaves-cd-projekt-following-investigation-into-workplace-bullying">When Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red, he acknowledged in an email</a> that "a lot of people are feeling fear, stress or discomfort when working with me", and he apologised "for all the bad blood I have caused". He promised to work on himself and set about changing his behaviour.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the issue last week, Tomaszkiewicz told me problems seemed to arise when CD Projekt Red grew rapidly in size following the release of The Witcher 3, in 2015. That game was made on average by 160 people, he said - a figure that jumped to 205 closer to release, when the then-small Cyberpunk 2077 team was pulled in to help. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saving-cyberpunk-2077-how-cd-projekt-red-recovered-from-one-of-video-games-most-disastrous-launches">By the time Tomaszkiewicz left CD Projekt Red in 2021</a>, however, there were more than 1000 people working there.</p><p>During Cyberpunk 2077's unwieldy development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekts-new-witcher-game-director-speaks-out-on-crunch">CD Projekt Red became linked with a culture of crunch</a>, but the studio's intense way of working does stretch back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/seeing-red-the-story-of-cd-projekt">the beginning of The Witcher series of games</a>, which of course Tomaszkiewicz was a part of. "For half-a-year we were working 12-hour days every day, all weekends, all the time," lead character artist Paweł Mielniczuk once told me while recalling The Witcher 1's development.</p>
<p>In 2017, not long after The Witcher 3 as a project was put to bed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-this-approach-to-making-games-is-not-for-everyone">CD Projekt Red responded to apparent low studio morale by saying, "This approach to making games is not for everyone</a>," so this was clearly an issue before Cyberpunk 2077 development got properly underway. Perhaps it was just a more visible issue when lots of new people joined the company.</p>
<p>Working in teams of that size made it hard to know the people you were working with, Tomaszkiewicz said to me, which made it especially hard for people to pull together during the more strenuous development periods. "The problem was - I was analysing it - that people feel differently when you are anonymous for them because the company is huge and [they don't necessarily know you]. The stress is not comparable to the situation when you work with them arm in arm every day," he said.</p>
<p>"I decided that I want to open my own company and do things differently," he added. "I want to have the maximum amount of people [similar to] how we had it in The Witcher 3, because at that time, I knew everyone, full name and surname, and in our company it's totally the same."</p><p>The company he's referring to is Rebel Wolves, which he co-founded in 2022 alongside a handful of other former CD Projekt Red staff, including writer Jakub Szamalek, artist Bartłomiej Gaweł, animator Tamara Zawada, and a few others from the Polish game development scene.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves currently has 155 people working on The Blood of Dawnwalker, its debut half-human, half-vampire role-playing game - almost exactly the same number of people that worked on The Witcher 3 for the bulk of its development. Given the studio's heritage, it's no surprise The Blood of Dawnwalker passes more than a passing resemblance to The Witcher games, in tone as well as appearance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-directors-new-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-is-different-to-that-classic-cd-projekt-red-game-in-one-big-way-it-doesnt-have-a-main-quest">but there are notable and significant differences.</a></p>
<p>"I know everyone," Tomaszkiewicz continued. "I work with them every day, not only to feedback and review their stuff, but doing the stuff with them. I implement the quests, also. I'm scripting the combat and the opponents.</p>
<p>"I want to be the leader not the boss," he said. "I want to work with them and show direction and help them to go in this particular direction, not be somewhere there in Olympus and not have the camaraderie with the people. I want to feel this crazy fire as I felt it in The Witcher 3, The Witcher 2, in The Witcher 1. And later, when the team was too big, I lost it somewhere. And right now I have it back."</p>
<p>The Blood of Dawnwalker will be released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series S/X sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.</p>
<p>The iconic brand has successfully translated their <strong>legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers</strong> that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/"> At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Re-Engineered Soundstage</h2>
<p>The third-generation design expands the <strong>stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models</strong> through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.</p>
<p>The Marshall signature sound <strong>emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character</strong> that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.</p>



<p>Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker <strong>with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementation</strong>&nbsp;which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.</p>
<p>Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional <strong>wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available</strong> for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and y<strong>ou’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box</strong>. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. <strong>The speaker has tactile, analog controls</strong> at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.</p>
<p>The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="519">LEGO is a timeless toy that continues to capture the hearts of people of all ages. It’s not just for kids. Anyone with a sense of nostalgia or creativity can dive into the fun. LEGO has a vast array of collaborations with different fandoms, and perhaps one of its most popular partnerships is with Marvel. Among the many sets inspired by the Marvel universe is one based on the most iconic scene from the second film in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, and its now available at a discounted price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">This particular LEGO set of the Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train showdown typically sells for $55, but it’s currently on sale for 20% off, bringing the price down to $44</a>. This price drop makes it a great deal for any LEGO fan or Spider-Man enthusiast looking to recreate one of the most memorable moments from the early 2000s Spider-Man films.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="519">Most Iconic&nbsp;Spider-Man Moment</h2>
<p data-start="867" data-end="1630">If you were a teenager during the mid-2000s, you probably fondly remember <em data-start="941" data-end="955">Spider-Man 2</em>, the sequel to the 2002 blockbuster. The movie remains a fan favorite and is often cited as the best of the trilogy and even all the Spider-Man film adaptations. Spoilers for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> I guess&nbsp; but, for many, the standout scene from this movie is the subway sequence, where Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man must save a runaway train from crashing. In this scene, Spider-Man, after losing his mask, uses his webs to slow down the train, and in the end, the New York City passengers agree to keep his identity a secret.</p>
<p data-start="1632" data-end="2357">The LEGO set that pays tribute to this unforgettable scene contains 393 pieces and includes not only a detailed train model but also four minifigures: Spider-Man, Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, and Aunt May. Spider-Man comes with two interchangeable heads—one masked and one unmasked—so you can replicate the scene exactly as it happened. The set also features Doc Ock with his four mechanical arms, which are adjustable and can be posed in a variety of ways. Two of the arms are equipped with laser beams, while the other two can attach to the train to create that intense showdown. Though not actually present during this scene in the movie, J. Jonah Jameson and Aunt May are included just to fill out the set. I guess they’re more recognizable than the kid who returns Peter’s mask.</p>


<p data-start="2359" data-end="2692">The completed set measures over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide, making it a perfect size to display once you’ve finished building it. The roof of the train is removable, allowing you to take a closer look at the interior details, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p data-start="3194" data-end="3606" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a Spider-Man fan or simply someone who love to collect LEGO, this set offers a great way to relive a classic moment from the <em data-start="3324" data-end="3338">Spider-Man 2</em> movie. And with the current discount, you can save $11 when bringing home this piece of cinematic history.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem features a brand-new protagonist, Grace Ashcroft, and the devs recently spoke about how she differs from other protagonists. </p>



<p>Capcom seems to be cooking up a storm with Resident Evil Requiem, and the anticipation is only going higher as the release date draws closer. Recently, the developers revealed during an interview that the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">characters from previous games</a>. Now, the producer has opened up about how Requiem’s Grace is different from other main characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-grace-is-an-ordinary-person-but-is-a-bit-more-used-to-guns">Resident Evil Requiem’s Grace is An Ordinary Person, But is a ‘Bit More Used to Guns’ </h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://checkpointgaming.net/features/2025/11/we-speak-with-producer-masato-kumazawa-about-resident-evil-requiem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CheckpointGaming</a>, Resident Evil Requiem’s producer Masato Kumazawa was asked to talk about Grace. Kumazawa explained that the whole point is “scaring the players,” and, from his perspective, “she is the most scared or easily prone to being scared protagonist in the series.” The producer added that he wants other players to “be scared with her and enjoy the atmosphere with her,” noting that “she’s an ordinary person.” </p>



<p>However, Requiem’s Grace is an FBI Analyst, which makes her well-versed with guns. At the same time, when comparing characters like Chris and Leon, “they’re not like, ‘Oh, we get a gun, and we start shooting everything,’ or we get to close combat and have no problem.” When talking about ordinary, Kumazawa believes that Ethan is “the most ordinary in terms of just saying normal”; Grace is just a bit more used to guns than he is. </p>



<p>Kumazawa added that Grace is not an expert like Leon or Chris. They aim to make players feel they have limited resources and to have them figure out “what they can do with the limited amount of things that they have.” The game is closer to “classic type of horror survival,” but it’s not all classic as there are “new elements and new weapons in order to make it more fun.”</p>







<p>In other news, a new claim states Resident Evil Requiem <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">definitely has at least one DLC in development</a>. Additionally, the upcoming title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expected to sell better than RE Village</a>.

            <p>Roblox's CEO has called the problem of predators on the platform an "opportunity", as the company updates its safety measures with age verification checks.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">announced back in September</a>, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/11/roblox-requires-age-checks-limits-minor-and-adult-chat">Roblox has expanded its age estimation technology</a> to all users wishing to communicate with others. Back in July it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">introduced an AI to estimate a user's age through video selfies</a>, partly in response to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-online-safety-act-explainer">UK's Online Safety Act</a>. This is now required by all users.</p>
<p>Roblox is predominantly used by children and teenagers, but has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">criticised for its questionable safety measures</a>. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">report last year claimed Roblox reported 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a>. As a result, the company is taking steps to improve child safety, with AI at its core due to the scale of the platform - over the summer, for instance, hit game Steal a Brainrot had over 25 million concurrent users.</p>
<p>However, this year three US states have filed lawsuits against Roblox over child safety issues - that's Louisiana, Kentucky, and Texas. Further, over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation have been filed in US federal court this year.</p>
<p>In this context, Roblox CEO David Baszucki appeared on the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/21/podcasts/hardfork-roblox-child-safety.html">New York Times podcast Hard Fork</a>, where hosts Casey Newton and Kevin Roose immediately asked him for his thoughts on "the problem of predators on Roblox".</p>
<p>"We think of it not necessarily just as a problem, but an opportunity as well," said Baszucki. "How do we allow young people to build, communicate and hang out together? How do we build the future of communication at the same time?</p>
<p>"At the scale we're at, 150 million daily actives, 11 billion hours a month, like what is the best way to keep pushing this forward?"</p>
<p>Roblox is indeed working on safety improvements, but it's shocking to hear the CEO of a major gaming platform call pedophilia an "opportunity" as it jeopardises the safety of children.</p>
<p>Indeed, throughout the interview Baszucki appears focused more on promoting technological advancements and highlighting the sheer number of users on the platform, rather than the importance of child safety.</p>
<p>After discussing the use of AI filters and age estimation, Baszucki was asked how confident he is these measures are working, considering it would appear predators have found little difficulty in bypassing such measures in the past.</p>
<p>"I don't want to comment on it," Baszucki replied. He added, in a response generally avoiding the question: "It's one of the primary things we're doing is trying to keep people on our platform. It's an interesting industry situation. I would say, we're not waiting for the rest of the industry. We're like, we're always trying to stay ahead of it."</p><p>Baszucki was then asked outright "You don't think you have a problem with predators on the platform?", to which he responded: "I think we're doing an incredible job at innovating relative to the number of people on our platform and the hours, in really leaning into the future of how this is going to work."</p>

</figure>
<p>Baszucki also argued the benefits of having open-ended text communication in Roblox, despite potential issues with safety. "There's a lot of kids who find their peeps on Roblox," he said as part of his response. "There are a lot of kids when they're lonely or isolated actually - I'm not going to use it as an excuse or anything - but I get a lot of calls from famous parents who said, 'Look, my kid would be dead if it were not for finding a community on a platform like Roblox to stay connected with'."</p>
<p>After Baszucki mentioned the "mind-blogging" scale of the platform, the hosts brought up a report from Hindenburg Research that claimed Roblox was "compromising child safety in order to report growth to investors". Baszucki dismissed the allegation.</p>
<p>"Fun," he said. "Let's keep going down this. And so, first off, Hindenburg is no longer in existence, correct? So, you should report on that. They went out of business for some reason."</p>
<p>Eventually, in an effort to avoid further questioning, Baszucki tried to manipulate the hosts into agreeing with his views on AI success, and joked "is this a stealth interview where actually you love everything we're doing and you're here to stealthily support it?" He later added: "I thought we were going to be talking about fun, funny things in the industry and all of that. So I'm not frustrated, I'm just kind of figuring out how much fun time I have with you guys and how much fun time we have versus kind of this superfocus."</p>
<p>Eventually the conversation turned to Polymarket, a crypto-currency prediction platform where users place bets on future events through a blockchain network.</p>
<p>Baszucki, it would appear, is a fan of the platform. And when jokingly asked if he would put a prediction market in Roblox - essentially allowing children to gamble - he said "we would", but noted the need to account for different legislation around the world.</p><p>When the hosts stated this was a "horrible idea", Baszucki replied: "Well, I actually think it's a brilliant idea if it can be done in an educational way that's legal. And so, imagine no free Robux, no free prizes, just a game called the Dress to Impress Predictor, where it's not like trying to get kids' money or anything like that. I would be a big fan of it."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for further comment on the interview.</p>
<p>It's a disastrous interview, following other instances from Baszucki. Back in 2024, he told Eurogamer <a href="http://baszucki/">children making money on the platform isn't exploitation but a gift</a>. Then, earlier this year, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">told the BBC parents shouldn't let their children play Roblox</a> if they are "not comfortable" about their in-game safety.</p>
