            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie studio Yahaha Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special</em>, a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Clock Tower&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, will be coming to Steam Early Access "soon".</p>

<p>In a press release, the studio describes the game as a mixture of "nostalgic '90s 16-bit gameplay" and "cinematic horror", with touchstones like Dario Argento's giallo movies and classic 80s slashers contributing to its tone and aesthetic.</p>

<p><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>casts you as Sarah, a babysitter (because of course she is) who gets caught up in what Yahaha describes as "a night of psychological terror". I don't think it's possible to be a babysitter without going through at least one of those.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=FIbhkWE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=57pO8UWO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure, and you can try it out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>You can look forward to spooky delights like "eerie phone calls", which feel like a classic trope for 70s and 80s horror, and "a seemingly alive plastic dinosaur", which absolutely doesn't feel like a trope.</p>

<p>Yahaha says you'll like this one if you're a fan of old-school survival horror, point-and-click adventure games, and "atmospheric mysteries that keep you guessing", and it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't a fan of the last one on that list, at least.</p>

<p>Most intriguingly, the developer promises a touch of "retro sci-fi" in&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>as well, so it sounds like things take a decidedly weird turn. Consider me on board for this one.</p>

<p>The game's Steam page shows off some rather evocative imagery, including what looks like a millipede crawling in and out of the mouth and eye sockets of a corpse. You'll probably know whether this one's for you or not based on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=F9qXw-5W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=3sXYyJPx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like spooky vibes and 80s horror,&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you don't have to judge by screenshots alone; a demo is available for you to check out right now. All you've got to do is download it on Steam and you're set.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, it'll come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The devs estimate it'll stay there for around 12-18 months before getting a full release.</p>

At the time, the Chinese-made PlayStation 5 exclusive looked like another project heavily inspired by FromSoftware’s Soulsborne games. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898/slides/10&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-game-show-2024-monster-hunter-wilds-mgs-3-remake-1851661898/slides/10">playable demos last year</a></span> revealed it’s much closer to a <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> or <em>Devil May Cry</em>-style action game. A new six-minute trailer shows exactly why, and gives the vibe that <em>Phantom Blade 0</em> could be the next <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194513" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="192" data-playlist="194513,197298,197284" data-current="194513"><div><p>Blade’s Book Club Is The Best Thing About Marvel’s Midnight Suns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194513/194513_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19959.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new footage released in preparation for the Chinese New Year next week shows the game’s protagonist facing off in a boss fight against the “Seven Judgements,” a formation of warriors constantly trading attacks and healing one another. We also get a look at new snake-shaped swords, a venomous softblade, and savage ax and ink cut abilities, </p><p>The second phase of the boss fight shows one of the Seven Judgements resurrected as a puppet on a string swinging through the battlefield as death metal rock plays in the background. Again, while it all has the look and presentation of a <em>Dark Souls</em> game at first glance, the speed of combat and the array of abilities locates it much closer to a traditional action-game genre. The trailer ends with the puppet unleashing one final ultimate attack before being defeated.</p><p>Made by Bejing-based developer S-Game, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> is another blockbuster breakout from a studio that previously worked on much smaller games. It follows a warrior named Soul who is framed for a murder and has only 66 days to find the true killer, before a magic spell keeping him alive ends. Designer Soulframe Liang has called it a semi-open world game and likened its presentation to “kung fu punk.”</p><p>After <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>—another debut AAA action game from a Chinese studio—became one of 2024's breakout hits, <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em> so far looks like it has the potential to follow a similar trajectory. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DanielOlimac/status/1881776112025620742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaming consultant Daniel Camilo claims</a></span> <em>Black Myth</em>’s success was actually crucial to getting extra funding for <em>Phantom Blade Zero</em>, suggesting the game might end up being even more ambitious than its developers initially planned. </p><p>We won’t know for sure until it actually comes out, and a release date has been conspicuously missing from the last year of gameplay reveals. Maybe S-Game is waiting for the next PlayStation showcase to reveal it. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-2-trailer-gives-more-details-on-maps-modes-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has released a new trailer for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, confirming five new multiplayer maps and a returning mode during Season 2.</p>



<p>Starting January 28 when the new season launches, players will get access to three new maps with two additional ones coming mid-season. The three maps coming at the beginning of the season are Bounty, Dealership, and Lifeline while Bullet and Grind come midseason. As far as the location details, there’s not much to go on with the maps aside from what was shown in the short trailer.</p>



<p>Lifeline is a small map that’s set on a burning ship in the middle of the sea; dealership takes place in an area surrounding a car dealership of some sort; and bounty, while hard to fully decipher, appears to be at a mansion or museum. Again, however, that was the toughest to see the exact location.</p>







<p>In addition to the new maps, Black Ops 6 Season 2 sees the return of Gun Game along with new weapons such as swords. Lastly, the trailer gives a glimpse at the new Zombies map, The Tomb. According to Treyarch, The Tomb was designed with “tighter play spaces with a focus on replayability”.</p>



<p>Full details on everything coming in Season 2 is expected this week. One detail that’s been confirmed is that players will be able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/treyarch-disabling-crossplay-ranked-console-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn off cross-play</a> in Ranked Mode moving forward.</p>

Dealership looks like it's set in a car dealership. It's hard to make out the setting for Bounty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In keeping with an apparent ninja theme, the trailer confirms the addition of swords via an operator dual wielding katanas. Developer Treyarch had already teased the addition of an “iconic” SMG with Season 2, and it’s rumored to be the PPSH-41 from Call of Duty: Vanguard​​​​​​.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Zombies, the trailer shows a first look at gameplay of the new map, The Tomb, as well as an ice staff. Warzone does not appear to be represented in the video.

It will focus on gameplay tuning, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements with the coming season, pushing back new content originally planned for the launch of Season 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

    <p><span>Games industry icon says goodbye after 30 years.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Insomniac Games [305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a> CEO Ted Price will retire from the games industry at the end of March after 30 years, he <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. Studio veterans Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider, and Jen Huang will become Insomniac Games’ new co-studio heads. <span id="more-939685"></span></p><p>Here a message from Ted Price on his retirement:</p><blockquote><p>Hi everyone,</p><p>I’d like to start this blog by acknowledging how difficult things have been for our team members and our players in Los Angeles over the past several weeks. As I write this, news reports are being shared predicting more challenges ahead with the fires due to extreme weather.</p><p>Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and we’ll continue to work with our peers at Sony to support our team members and their families as they continue to deal with the tragic situation.</p><p>I’m so proud of the numerous Insomniacs who have rallied to help others in LA both inside and outside of Insomniac. Helping those who are less fortunate is part of our mission statement. Insomniacs embrace it daily and it’s one of so many aspects of our culture that I love.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Another aspect of our culture I hold dear is the Insomniacs’ ability to pull together and successfully overcome what often seem like insurmountable obstacles.</p><p>Speaking of which, despite a challenging 2024, Insomniacs stayed fully focused on building games for our fans. As a result of the team’s persistence and collaboration, we’re in one of the strongest positions we’ve experienced in years, with each game in development looking beautiful and playing fantastic.</p><p>Therefore, last week, I felt comfortable announcing to the Insomniac team that after having been incredibly fortunate to enjoy such a fulfilling career in games, I’ll be retiring from the industry at the end of March. Today, I’m sharing this news more broadly.</p><p>I actually made this decision last year. For me, after over 30 years of leading Insomniac, I felt it was simply time to step aside and let others pave the way for our team.</p><p>During the past year, I had the opportunity to work with the senior leadership team at Insomniac to create a succession plan that I know will provide the continuity, stability and strong leadership necessary to deliver more of what our fans cherish over the next several decades.</p><p>So also today, I’m extremely happy to announce that Chad Dezern, Ryan Schneider and Jen Huang will become Insomniac Games’ new Co-Studio Heads.</p><p>I believe strongly that for us to continue our success, we need leaders at the top who are intimately familiar with how we do things, leaders who have helped build our culture and our processes, and who have earned people’s trust.</p><p>For many years, Chad, Jen, and Ryan have been instrumental in making Insomniac what we are today. I’ve seen each lead major initiatives here which have positively changed Insomniacs’ lives. Plus, they’ve consistently demonstrated the kind of collaboration and transparency that’s part of our DNA. And just as important, their skillsets are truly complementary.</p><p>There is no way that I would ever consider handing the reins to a team I didn’t trust to take care of Insomniacs and lead us to even greater heights. Chad, Jen and Ryan are that team. For those who may not be familiar, please take a moment to get to know them here.</p><p>To conclude this blog, Insomniac has been my life, my home away from home, for three decades.</p><p>I want to thank every Insomniac for having a positive and lasting impact on my life. Working side by side with Insomniacs for so many years has been a gift that I’ll cherish for the rest of my days.</p><p>I also want to thank our fans who, for three decades, have shared their enthusiasm, their encouragement and their support – inspiring us to take every game farther than the last. We do what we do for you. And I can assure you that we won’t be slowing down.</p><p>As for me, I’m very excited to officially join the ranks of Insomniac fans. I can’t wait to experience our future games purely as a player. Plus, I can’t remember the last time I played any game and wasn’t unconsciously scanning for bugs. I’m ready to break that habit!</p><p>Finally, I’m confident that under the combined leadership of Chad, Jen and Ryan, Insomniac will continue to deliver the industry-defining games that players have come to expect from us… while making a positive and lasting impact on people’s lives for decades to come.</p><p>Thank you to Insomniacs, to our players and to videogames for 30 wonderful years.</p><p>—Ted Price</p></blockquote><p>And here are <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/22/whats-next-for-insomniac-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">messages from each new co-studio head</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Ryan Schneider, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“I started my Insomniac career during the <a title="Platforms > PS2 [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps2">PlayStation 2</a> era in studio marketing and communications, quickly shifting my role to become Insomniac’s first community director and helping establish the role within the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [46,770 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> ecosystem. I joined Insomniac’s senior leadership team several years ago and have held multiple studio roles including Head of Franchise <a title="Genres > Strategy [214 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">Strategy</a> &amp; Studio Relations. In that role I partnered with teams within and beyond Sony Interactive on how and when we talk about our games, including in-game creative integrations. More recently, I’ve served as Head of Brand &amp; Leadership Strategy, which means I’m ensuring through communications, coaching and culture development that what Insomniac says to the world about itself and our games matches what we believe and how we act inside Insomniac.</p><p>“Outside of work, I play games with my family almost nightly. We enjoyed completing <em><a title="Games > ASTRO BOT [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/astro-bot">ASTRO BOT</a></em>&nbsp;and <em><a title="Games > LEGO Horizon Adventures [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/lego-horizon-adventures">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a></em> over the winter break. I also love cycling (road and gravel).”</p><p><strong>Jen Huang, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“I joined our incredible studio eight years ago as [Chief Financial Officer] and Head of Finance, and our team has had my heart ever since. As part of our leadership team, I directly support our development teams across all titles, overseeing project planning, production strategy, business operations, resource planning, and co-development partnerships. Together with the best team in the world, we’ve shipped 12 games since my first day, and I’m super excited about the unforgettable experiences we’ll bring to players in the future.</p><p>“Before joining Insomniac Games, I was a senior finance executive, providing strategic and financial leadership to global tech and entertainment businesses.</p><p>“I’m passionate about driving innovations that elevate our studio and community. Outside of work, I support Glendale’s neighborhood libraries and love playing games with my kids. Over the holidays, I immersed myself in <em>ASTRO BOT</em>&nbsp;and <em><a title="Games > Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a></em>—and loved those unforgettable <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,004 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s.”</p><p><strong>Chad Dezern, Co-Studio Head, Insomniac Games</strong></p><p>“One afternoon, I picked up a copy of <em>Spyro The Dragon</em> for Research™ purposes. I was floored by its charm and attention to detail—here, clearly, was the work of a team at the top of their game, and I wanted to learn their secrets.</p><p>“I joined Insomniac in 1998. Since then, I’ve had the honor to contribute to five generations of PlayStation as an Environment Artist, Art Director, Studio Director for the Durham studio, and—starting in 2017—as the Head of Creative. As a senior leader, I support the creative, story, and research teams across all titles to help ensure that our games ship with a uniquely Insomniac vision and a high degree of polish.</p><p>“So what secrets did I learn? Mainly that magic happens when talented people build on each other’s ideas even as they challenge each other to advance their craft. In my new role, I’m excited to work with Ryan and Jen to continue Insomniac’s tradition of creative collaboration.”</p></blockquote><p>Going forward, Insomniac Games plans to “keep making the games you love, while taking care of the people who make them,” as well as “preserve what has made Insomniac special for 30-plus years while exploring how we can strategically evolve to succeed for decades to come.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-introduces-new-unified-account-system-with-free-pirate-yakuza-skin.1088745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-account-system-pirate-yakuza-skin<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has introduced a brand new unified account system that promises to give you access to rewards when playing either Sega or Atlus games, as well as "using their online services". The first of those bonuses is available to grab right now if you sign up.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ1QNG67ZW54BR35EAZRAJ7Y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on its website, Sega says that signing up for an account will give you "the latest news" about Sega and Atlus games and promotions, and that it'll also grant you access to "exclusive bonuses", as well as "the ability to link accounts" across platforms.</p>

<p>Signing up before March 7th will give you access to a special&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>&nbsp;</em>skin, which lets protagonist Goro Majima wear the iconic gray suit sported by longtime series main character Kazuma Kiryu (except in&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=txvBflv7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=myRBjEN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can get yourself a free&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>skin if you sign up for a Sega account.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you won't be able to use the skin until the game itself comes out, and signing up for an account doesn't get you a copy of&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, unfortunately. Still, if you're planning to play it anyway, signing up can't hurt, right?</p>

<p>If you want your free skin, you'll simply need to create a Sega account <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, then link it to a corresponding platform in order to redeem the skin on that platform. Obviously, you won't be able to redeem it on Switch, since&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out for that console.</p>

<p>Could the fact that Kiryu's iconic suit is appearing as a skin in the game perhaps portend further development of his story in&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>'s plot? I sure hope so, because&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>'s ending left me desperate to know what happens to him next.</p>




<p>At the moment, there's no suggestion that the Sega account will become mandatory for playing Sega or Atlus' games, although I'm sure if that does happen, Sega and Atlus will know how their fans feel about it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Sega has also <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ71YSH5ZR99A3GSYS1CMTTX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that some users are having trouble authenticating their accounts, promising to resolve the issue soon. Hang on in there if that's you.</p>

<p>Xbox is increasing the size of external storage the Xbox Series consoles will support. In a new update coming to the consoles—Xbox Insiders will get first access to the feature—external hard drives larger than 16TB will now be compatible with the systems.</p>



<p>“We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play,”  the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company said</a>. “Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilize all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list.”</p>



<p>While the company says that the update adds support for “drives larger than 16TB”, it doesn’t set a new limit. Based on that, it could be inferred that the partition method allows as large of a external drive as you can afford. If you already have a larger drive, Microsoft says they may need to be reformatted.</p>







<p>“Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives,” they said. </p>



<p>This isn’t going to be the only news from Xbox this week as the company airs their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual Developer Direct</a> on January 23. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of all the news that comes from the showcase.</p>

Activision has revealed the season's new gameplay trailer, which features new multiplayer maps, more DLC weapons, and operator skins. The trailer also gives a first look at gameplay and Wonder Weapons for the upcoming Zombies map.</p><p dir="ltr">While most of the post-launch content for Black Ops 6 has forgotten about the game's '90s setting, the Season 2 trailer includes a remixed version of Bush's 1996 hit "Machinehead." Season 2 is themed around ninja-esque operators who are dual-wielding katanas, as seen in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXpnKJBhL48" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXpnKJBhL48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One of the multiplayer maps shows gameplay inside a car dealership, which is simply called Dealership. Another multiplayer map features a super-yacht that looks similar to the Hijacked map from Black Ops 2, but this is apparently a new yacht map called Lifeline. A third map is called Bounty, but we don't get to see much of the setting. These three maps will arrive at launch, while two additional maps will drop during the midseason.</p><p dir="ltr">Zombies footage is also featured near the end of the trailer, giving the first look at gameplay on The Tomb map. It also reveals the map's unique Wonder Weapons, which are four staffs similar to the ones used on the fan-favorite Origins map from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Activision shared the new <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1881754960213512314" rel="nofollow ">promotional art for Season 2</a>, which reveals the katanas, PPSh-41 submachine gun, and FAL rifle as the new weapons in the game.</p><p>Season 2 will bring several game improvements, including the ability to turn off cross-play in Ranked Play modes. Here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-2-start-date-and-details/1100-6528774/">everything rumored and announced for Season 2</a> so far.</p>

One of these features is the bigger Joy-Con controllers which now connect to the screen via magnetic attachments. A brief clip on the company’s website gives us a better look at how it works, but it’s an innovation that Nintendo  first teased over eight years ago. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The current Switch has its Joy-Con controllers attach by sliding through a railing on the side until a locking mechanism clicks them into place. Owners then press a very (very) small black button on the back to release the mechanism to slide them back out again. With the Switch 2 there’s no sliding and seemingly a whole lot less friction overall, as the Joy-Con merely click into place and hold on through the force of magnets alone.</p><p>A short snippet recently published on Nintendo’s website shows this all happening in slow motion, including how the (much) bigger triggers on the back of the Joy-Con are held to release the magnets and pull the controllers back away from the screen. It’s a much more elegant solution and, if combined with other Joy-Con features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1i31e7k/comment/m7p9qfn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported anti-drift Hall Effect joysticks</a></span>, mouse-like optical sensors, and a mysterious new C button, could make the Switch 2 feel like a bigger upgrade than it initially appears. </p><p>But it turns out that magnetic Joy-Con, one of the primary points of speculation <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">throughout months of Switch 2 leaks</a></span>, weren’t actually a secret at all. Nintendo revealed it was exploring the feature as early as its pre-release breakdown of the original Switch back in 2017. Here is Nintendo executive and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> producer Yoshiaki Koizumi teasing the design possibility to Nintendo of America’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl0XiEgng4LZFpYVDd8oR8A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang</a></span>, all the way back then:</p><p>“We tried a lot of different things in terms of connecting the Joy-Con to the console and one that I was particularly excited about at the time was using magnets where you would just snap it right to the console, but as you would play sometimes it would just fall into your lap,” he said at the time. “But because we still wanted to have something that was sturdy enough for you to hold onto the console but also gave you that sort of satisfying snap that the magnets did that’s how we came up with the mechanical rails that give you a click.”</p><p>Nintendo has a way of making its inventions, whether in hardware or the games themselves, feel like they magically appeared out of nowhere, but often it turns out  that they were leftover ideas from long and arduous trial and error processes, later repurposed when the moment is right or newer tech makes them more feasible. So it seems to be with the Switch 2's magnets. I’m super-eager to try them myself and see how they hold up. Hopefully, Nintendo worked out all the kinks this time around. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-sales-have-passed-5m.1088688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ed Boon has revealed the latest sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, the most recent entry in the long-running fighting game franchise, and it turns out the game is doing about as well as a recent indie smash hit.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825218538467395" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Boon reveals that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at five million sales, as well as the fact that it's still ranking in the top 15 most-played games on PlayStation 5 (according to data that looks suspiciously similar to Circana's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">usual roundup</a>).</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s sales roughly on par with those of indie smash hit poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">revealed to have hit the same milestone yesterday</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=IBARtKWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=YG0Rx-Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has apparently reached five million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>belongs to one of the longest-running fighting game franchises in the world, and it was also released several months before&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, so its achievement is perhaps a little more humble in that light.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, around two months after&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s initial release, Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-eyes-more-live-services-as-mortal-kombat-1-sells-nearly-3-million-copies" rel="nofollow">revealed that the game had sold three million copies</a>. That means it's picked up another two million in just over a year.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed a slew of crossovers that have no doubt boosted its profile. These have included DLC fighters like <i>Invincible</i>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em>'s...uh...<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>.</p>

<p>The game's latest crossover DLC fighter is Conan the Barbarian, and believe it or not, he's never appeared in a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>game before, although another iconic Arnie character, the T-800 Terminator, was added to&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11&nbsp;</em>as post-launch DLC.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, it is, despite its name, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Released in September 2023, the game's story serves as another reboot, realigning some characters and reimagining others to create a new narrative continuity. It's still got plenty of the same blood-spattered fighting gameplay you know and love, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-1-ante-1-hand-each-round-mean-in-balatro-hieroglyph-voucher-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve come across the Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro and are unsure what it does, you’re in the right place. It stumped me, and my heart sank when I realized the full extent of what it did. Let’s avoid the same mistake happening to you.</p>



<p>Early games of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> are understandably a lot to take in. Jokers, Card Enhancements, Planets, Spectral modifiers, etc. But Balatro’s Hieroglyph Shop Voucher is a perfect example of how a simple misunderstanding can bring a run crumbling down. I took this the first time it appeared, having a vague idea of what it would do, and it didn’t help.</p>



<p>With greater understanding, I now know Hieroglyph’s full value and worth. Let me pass this knowledge on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-hieroglyph-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does Hieroglyph Voucher Do In Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those daring enough. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Buying the Hieroglyph Voucher reduces your Ante by one, but you have one fewer Hand for every subsequent Blind you come up against from this point on.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-1-ante-explained">-1 Ante Explained</h3>



<p>When you start a game of <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Balatro</a>, you are immediately on <strong>Ante One of eight</strong>. If you beat the Boss Blind—after the Small and Big Blind—you progress to <strong>Ante Two</strong>, and so on.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’ve beaten the Small Blind on <strong>Ante Four</strong>. You go to the Shop and purchase Hieroglyph, and your Ante counter now changes to <strong>Ante Three.</strong> You have gone back a whole Ante!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hand-explained">-1 Hand Explained</h3>



<p><strong>The default Hands you start with is usually four</strong>. Different Decks can change this, but by and large, you’re going to start with four. A Hand is the <strong>amount of times you’re allowed to submit cards in exchange for a score</strong>.</p>



<p>So, if you buy Hieroglyph and have four Hands available, <strong>this tally goes down to three</strong>. You now only have three chances to score points for any Blind you come up against.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-use-1-ante-1-hand-hieroglyph-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Use -1 Ante -1 Hand Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Hieroglyph should only be procured if you have an extremely effective strategy and you’re obliterating every Blind with a single hand.</strong></p>



<p>The Voucher is designed so that if your setup is OP, <strong>you get another Ante to make it even stronger</strong>. If you’re already destroying Blinds in one or two goes, losing a Hand won’t affect you. </p>



<p>You can also try Hieroglpyh if you’re<strong> struggling and desperately need something to turn your run around</strong>. This is very risky, and losing a Hand could sign your death sentence. The <strong>Paint Brush</strong> (+1&nbsp;Hand Size) and <strong>Palette </strong>(+1&nbsp;Hand Size again) Shop Vouchers are incredible additions to your arsenal if you can get them.</p>



<p>They negate the consequence of losing a Hand and can give you a clean reset. I pick and choose my Hieroglyph usage—mainly for those OP runs—but it’s a great tool to be more powerful and <strong>take your run into Endless Mode</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>How often do you take Hieroglyph in Balatro? Are there any other scenarios you’d suggest buying the Voucher I haven’t already outlined?</p>

While practically nothing is known about this project, Sega described it as a "large scale global title" that many fans are expecting to be an accumulation of various games akin to what Call of Duty has done with its titles or what Ubisoft is working on with Assassin's Creed Infinity: essentially a hub for myriad other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It’s unclear at the moment. TheThiny said the fight was discovered after a player completed “a bunch of Floyd challenges then he appears. This video was taken in the Towers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How many challenges must be completed? We’re not sure, but it’s a lot. Could it be that each challenge completion increases the chance Floyd will turn up? We’re not sure, but maybe?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players are still working out Floyd’s moveset, which appears to combine attacks and abilities from various characters on the roster. Floyd isn’t officially playable, but that hasn’t stopped dataminers from getting hands-on with the character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s super cool is that beating Floyd in this secret fight unlocks a brand new stage, the beautiful Field, which players have already noticed is from the Mortal Kombat 1 announcement trailer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">New Stage:<br>Field<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MK1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MK1</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MortalKombat1?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MortalKombat1</a> <a href="https://t.co/ygkarWNRhU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ygkarWNRhU</a></p>— thethiny 🐰🍉 (@thethiny) <a href="https://twitter.com/thethiny/status/1881782846047899712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, Floyd is in Mortal Kombat 1, which means Ed Boon has finally made good on his desire to add the character.

                <p>Chappell Roan, like so many of us, loves video games and specifically Fortnite. In a new interview, the "Hot To Go" singer discussed her appreciation for video games and called on Epic to give her a Fortnite skin of her own someday.</p><p>Fortnite already has a "Hot To Go" emote, and Roan teased that a new emote inspired by her song "Good Luck Babe" might also come to Fortnite. But she really wants her own skin.</p><p>"That is what I am going to use this interview for," Roan said. "Please give me a skin. Please."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEhSOz0VoqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZEhSOz0VoqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Roan also revealed in the interview that she plays Fortnite on Switch ("that's how serious I take it," she said) and already bought the Ariana Grande skin. She was told during the interview about Fortnite's new first-person shooter mode, Ballistic, and joked that she's not interested because it means she wouldn't get to see her Ariana Grande skin.</p><p>Additionally, the 26-year-old said her idea of a perfect night involves video games and recreational drugs. "Well, if I want to have like a really good night I just eat an edible and play video games," she said. "But if I'm trying to have fun like, out, I'll take 'shrooms."</p><p>Roan also mentioned how she hopes Epic can create a Chappell Roan skin of her Statue of Liberty costume, with an apple bong as the back bling.</p><p>Fortnite's next big update is coming on January 31, which is when Fortnite OG Chapter 1, Season 2 goes live.

		<p>It seems the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> release date has leaked, the game set to launch on 15th May 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and naturally day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The leak has seemingly come from an article that was briefly posted online by Gamekult, spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">Resetera</a>, who may have been briefed ahead of time on the content of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">Xbox Developer_Direct stream that will take place tomorrow</a>, Thursday 23rd January.</p>


<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>
<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them ahead of expected launches in 2025, and alongside Doom: The Dark Ages, it will be visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and one final surprise studio and game reveal – there’s been lots of rumours for an Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake…</p>
