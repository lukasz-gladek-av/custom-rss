Assembling an entirely Acceleration-focused kart and driver can be a detriment in races with longer stretches of road. Someone with a higher Speed stat will pass you eventually.</p><p>There is a lot of nuance as to what karts and characters are the model pairing for each track, if not the best overall combo. Acceleration is arguably the ideal kart stat for most players, but it all comes down to preference. Some might feel better with a Speed build or one that’s more balanced. Always go with what feels the best and most rewarding. If your dream is to conquer every 150cc set of races with Cataquack and the Lobster Roller, more power to you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-best-vehicles-online-150cc-1851786067]]></content:encoded>

Now, as an adult, summers don't quite hit the same. Whether it's the weight of the world bearing down on me or the severe lack of couch co-op games, I'm not sure. But, every once in a while, a special game comes around that brings me back to that feeling of pure joy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Split Fiction, the follow-up from It Takes Two developer Hazelight Studios, launched earlier this year and features another amazing co-op adventure designed specifically for two players. Despite being only a few months old, the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are already discounted to just $35 during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-prime-day-2025-sale-top-deals-live">Prime Day</a>.

Split Fiction is shaping up to be another instant classic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its predecessor, Split Fiction is a split-screen experience designed for two players that can be played locally or online. It even includes a Friend Pass so you and a buddy only need to purchase a single copy in order to play together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game features plenty of memorable moments and requires you to carefully coordinate with your partner to solve puzzles as you alternate between sci-fi and fantasy worlds. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Our reviewer gave it a 9</a>, saying "Split Fiction is so good at wanting to be played it’s hard to <em>stop </em>playing. It simply doesn’t stay the same long enough for it to ever become boring." In fact, it's already on our list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-video-games-of-2025-so-far">best games of 2025</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking to save even more on PS5 games, we've rounded up the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-prime-day-ps5-games-on-sale-at-amazon">best Prime Day PS5 deals</a> available right now, so make sure to stock up before the sale is over.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Should I play It Takes Two first?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the similarities between the two games, Split Fiction is a completely new experience featuring a brand-new story and characters. So, if you never got around to It Takes Two, you don't have to worry about missing anything by jumping straight into Split Fiction. Although, there are quite a few nods and inside jokes for players who have played the previous game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Shop the lowest prices this Prime Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matthew Adler has written for IGN since 2019 covering all things gaming, tech, tabletop games, and more.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 - Vex the Siren | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Vex stands apart from previous playable Sirens by focusing heavily on minions that she can summon, transforming her role into a kind of necromancer/pet class. One of her skill trees entirely focuses on a large alien cat familiar called Trouble, which Vex can summon and teleport around the battlefield. Many of the additional skills and modifiers on the tree augment Trouble's capabilities in battle, allowing them to soak up more damage, taunt enemies, or even explode.</p><p dir="ltr">As a Siren, Vex possesses many other abilities too, including one that allows her to send out a blast of phase energy, sprout some gnarly-looking wings, conjure a little orb/turret, and blast enemies with a projectile from her free hand, all in one fell swoop. For her final of three Siren action skills, Vex can summon copies of herself to do long-range DPS or project a psychic reaper that gets up close to enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">For the curious, you can already sneak a peek at Vex's <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/game-info/vault-hunters/vex/" rel="nofollow ">full skill trees</a> and get a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJDE_Jn2K5I&amp;ab_channel=Borderlands">deeper look at some of her skills</a>.

In true Borderlands fashion, the short, which comes in at just over three minutes, is exceptionally bloody and chock full of gags. In it, Vex works a retail job at the series' equivalent of a big-box store when she taps into her Siren powers. Along the way, she falls for a cute guy, is threatened by a customer, and even manages to sneak in what appears to be a joke at Borderlands 3's expense in the middle of the gory affair.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a fun little peek at Borderlands 4's world, and there appears to be more of it on the horizon. Gearbox is set to roll out similar videos for the rest of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/borderlands-4-all-vault-hunters-classes-skills/2900-6583/">playable vault hunters</a>, who can be seen at the tail end of the short around a campfire with Vex.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 launches September 12 and will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. It'll arrive on the Nintendo Switch 2 later in 2025.</p>

This wasn’t a surprise for anyone who had been paying attention, but for those who weren’t, it was a shock that the game hadn’t already been shut down years ago. <em>Anthem </em>was a tragedy of errors.

Knowing the end is coming, I booted up <em>Anthem </em>again for the first time in six years. I had hoped that with time and distance, I would be able to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/so-long-anthem-see-ya-in-the-skies-2000623943&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/so-long-anthem-see-ya-in-the-skies-2000623943">appreciate the game for what it was</a></span>. I wasn’t as down on <em>Anthem </em>as others back in the day, and even thought there was potential hidden under the live-service glut. Now, half a decade later, and having seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767">Electronic Arts desecrate BioWare</a></span> in the years that followed, I think I resent <em>Anthem </em>as a destructive detour more than I did back then. But even the worst games don’t deserve to be obliterated.</p><p>In 2019, I tried to see the good in <em>Anthem</em>. I recognized it for what it was: a trend-chasing game likely demanded from on high by a publisher looking for its next live-service hit. It didn’t matter if it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">pulling resources</a></span> from the types of games BioWare was historically known for or if it was diametrically opposed to what made the studio such a powerhouse in the western RPG landscape. Loot shooters and forever games were the current hotness, and expertise and legacy weren’t as important as the trend of the moment. But in the margins, I saw flashes of BioWare’s best-in-class character writing, and by god, its flying mechanics still feel pretty incredible in 2025. But now that EA and BioWare are shutting the game down, what once felt like a studio trying to make the best of a bad situation just feels like a cynical attempt at fitting a square peg into a round hole.</p><p><em>Anthem </em>is the quintessential “made by committee” video game. It looks like the kind of thing you see a kid playing in the background of a TV show that is just descriptive enough to read as a video game but not distinct enough to have any discernible personality of its own. Everything about it feels like it’s meant to depersonalize you in favor of a spotlighting faceless, ugly suit of armor called a Javelin. You can’t customize your freelancer’s appearance, the character doesn’t even have a name, and the preset faces you choose will show up in-game fewer times than you can count on one hand. Its binary dialogue choices feel specifically written to have no impact, rather than even attempting to emulate the illusion of choice like the rest of BioWare’s catalog. </p><p>The only real expression you get is in the colors and designs you slap on your Javelin, and even the sleekest among them are some ugly clunkers that no amount of customization can beautify. You can change up your emotes, but they’re the same handful every other player has. In many of their other releases, against all odds, BioWare has excelled in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-trans-choice-rook-gender-pronouns-1851682607">handing players a higher level of authorship</a></span> than they usually receive in big-budget games. <em>Anthem</em>, meanwhile, doesn’t just feel like a pivot away from player expression; it feels like it was actively trying to stifle it at any chance it could. In 2019, I had some hope that BioWare would course-correct this in future updates, but now that those aren’t coming, what remains of <em>Anthem</em> feels creatively sterile, both for players and BioWare.</p><figure id="" data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-recommend-id="image://0d0c49f37a7a440f474423a45101c30b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Choosing the freelancer preset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not flying around in your Javelin, most of <em>Anthem </em>takes place in a vaguely sci-fi fantasy fortress called Fort Tarsis. Here is where some of BioWare’s strengths show, with characters who provide tantalizing glimpses into a world that feels otherwise underdeveloped. Owen, the player’s sprightly assistant who eventually betrays you, could have been a classic BioWare character in a game that afforded its relationships the same depth as its other work. But because <em>Anthem </em>can only gesture at the acclaimed BioWare house style, characters mostly talk <em>at</em> the player, rather than to them. Meeting <em>Anthem</em>’s cast feels voyeuristic, with its first-person perspective and lackluster dialogue options emulating something like Disney’s theme parks that have a character set up in one designated area for you to interact with briefly as you pass through. Ironically enough, that feels appropriate given that a lot of Fort Tarsis feels like an abandoned theme park. Walking through rooms that were once meant to facilitate repeatable quests is haunting, given that there aren’t other players to help you play through them.</p><p>As much as playing <em>Anthem </em>feels like looking into a void, flying through its non-descript environments still fucking rules. The flight controls feel incredible. The Javelins you can pick from are each huge, clunky monstrosities, but <em>Anthem </em>manages to make them feel weighty and light on their feet at the same time. Flight in video games is easy to get wrong because it can often either feel too slow to be useful or it can be so floaty that it can be hard to maintain control and precision. <em>Anthem</em> hits the perfect sweet spot. It’s kind of wild that the internet spent so long clowning on BioWare for <em>Anthem</em>’s misguided live-service aspirations and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/people-are-ripping-apart-mass-effect-andromedas-animati-1793334047"><em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>’s animations</a></span> that we glossed over how the studio had become a real force to be reckoned with on the action combat front. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">is rightfully divisive</a></span>, but it received a lot of praise for its tight, fluid combat. <em>Anthem </em>is a dry as hell game emulating trends it was years late to, but you won’t find a better Iron Man simulator on the market. That’s including the actual <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/iron-man-vr-the-kotaku-review-1844238508"><em>Iron Man VR</em> game</a></span>. Well, that’s actually your only option now, because <em>Anthem </em>isn’t actually on the market anymore. The game<em> </em>has been delisted from every online store, and physical copies are going to stop working in January.</p><figure id="" data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-recommend-id="image://c42dd5be12d1cee150b605df9532ec6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Anthem screenshot showing the player set their expedition to Private." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I played through the early hours of <em>Anthem</em>, I had almost forgotten it was supposed to be a multiplayer game. There were hints, such as the way mission objectives were spread across large areas encouraging teams of players to split up to find them, but I was having a decent enough time handling the game myself that it wasn’t until the haunting “matchmaking” icon showed up when I tried to start a mission, only to get no answer from other players, that I forgot <em>this </em>is why <em>Anthem </em>is going away forever.</p><p>In EA’s announcement blog, there’s a Q&amp;A section that says the reason <em>Anthem </em>is shutting down and will be unplayable after January is that the game was “designed to be an online-only title, so once the servers go offline, the game will no longer be playable.” Meanwhile, here I am, holding my own in battles which, yes, were obviously meant to be experienced by multiple players at once, but are still perfectly serviceable to play alone. But putting in the effort under the hood to make <em>Anthem </em>a single-player game someone could still experience after next January would require work that EA and BioWare don’t seem willing to do. No one at the studio has been working on <em>Anthem</em>, and EA even confirms in the post that flipping the switch in January won’t result in any layoffs. So if no one’s working on it at all right now, why would they devote the resources to rebalancing the game for offline play so it isn’t dropped into a black hole?</p><p>One of the frequent refrains in <em>Anthem </em>is that freelancers are “strong alone, stronger together.” At the time, this tagline felt like a desperate plea to BioWare fans who had grown accustomed to the team’s solitary RPGs that they weren’t being left behind in this uncharacteristic pivot. <em>Anthem </em>is a game you can play with others, but if you persist, you can play it by yourself, too, right? Well, not anymore.</p><figure id="" data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-recommend-id="image://4807cbc9368f163859de14a2c3cf67f1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Javelin with the Mass Effect N7 logo on it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shutting down <em>Anthem </em>is probably the right business decision. If I can’t even find players when the game is in its final months, that probably means that not enough people are roaming around Fort Tarsis to justify the cost of keeping the game online. That being said, it also feels like one last deluded assertion that the game couldn’t have been anything other than what it was. It’s an act that asserts <em>Anthem </em>was always intended to be exclusively a multiplayer experience, an assertion that the game itself insists wasn’t the case time and time again. Finishing the scant story content that exists in <em>Anthem</em>, the start of what was meant to be a years-long endeavor, feels like scrambling through a series of unfinished design documents, with vague ideas written in big red letters that it doesn’t feel like BioWare or EA really had thought about much. But even given the slapdash approach here, EA destroying <em>Anthem</em> while also scattering the studio’s foundational talent to the winds marks the latest instance of cultural vandalism this company has committed on BioWare’s history.</p><p>Whatever BioWare was planning was killed before it got out the door, and now all we have is a time capsule of corporate hubris, and we won’t even have that for much longer. <em>Anthem </em>had such a blind confidence in “the demands of the market” that it forgot to consider whether following them was worthwhile. Nobody knew where <em>Anthem </em>was going. After years of work, the upheaval of a studio’s storied legacy, and years of horror stories to go with it, it turns out the only place <em>Anthem </em>went was absolutely nowhere.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136]]></content:encoded>

The Forgotten Wisdom affix, which grants bonus XP, has also been adjusted to make it so XP motes dropped by enemies will now split experience between party members instead of only granting experience to the player who picked it up. Additionally, the maximum number of motes that can spawn in a dungeon has significantly increased, while the frequency has been slightly reduced. Each mote grants more XP as well, though motes will no longer spawn from monsters summoned by other monsters or in Horadric Strongrooms.</p><p dir="ltr">Other areas that will now have increased rewards include tiers of The Pit above tier 70, which will now grant additional Artificer's Stones on completion. Legion events will also reward more salvage materials and Forgotten Souls when completed on Torment difficulties. Arcana, a new seasonal component used to modify Horadric spells, are also now picked up automatically.</p><p dir="ltr">As for class balance changes, there are a few buffs for each class, with Barbarian receiving the most adjustments. Barbarian abilities like Hammer of the Ancients, Double Swing, Upheaval, and even Whirlwind are getting some significant buffs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s been an undercurrent of opinion, ever since <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> took audiences by surprise earlier this year, that the approach taken by the turn-based fantasy RPG is the cure for everything that ails <em>Final Fantasy</em>. It delivers an old-school take on the genre that’s much less flawed than both<em> Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,</em> garnering rave reviews, GOTY buzz, and impressive sales for a first-time studio. <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans have been jealous. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196411,197544" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Jesus, I see what you’ve done for<em> Clair Obscur </em>and I want that for us,” you can almost hear them pleading. There’s been a search for what the Square Enix franchise, which Sandfall Interactive’s <em>Clair Obscur </em>was inspired by, can learn from the new kid on the block. For some long-time fans, one of the takeaways has been that the Japanese series should return to its roots as a turn-based game. <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>producer Naoki Yoshida was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked about that at Anime Expo 2025</a></span>.</p><p>“With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system,” he responded. “That doesn’t take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game’s systems around it.”</p><p>Yoshida  continued, “This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It’s not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it’s going to become more action-based. [I’m] not necessarily going to be on <em>Final Fantasy 17</em>, so we also don’t want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like<em> 17</em> or even <em>18</em>. We don’t want to put them on a rail.”</p><p>The answer helped elucidate all of the considerations that go into designing a sequel. You can’t just pick things from a list and start sticking them together. Each element, from the graphical style to the type of story being told to the gameplay mechanics, needs to compliment one another and act in harmony. Ideally, each thing might flow organically into the next, making each new decision feel like a natural consequence of the last rather than something being arbitrarily inserted to please fans or shareholders. </p><p>Something I think a lot of the conversations lording <em>Clair Obscur</em> over <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s head miss are that combat isn’t where the latter has faltered in recent years. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s arcade-like real-time action is flashy, precise, and incredibly satisfying. The only real shortcomings were that it didn’t dive deeper into some of the underlying systems—more Eikon ability synergies, elemental damage, more varied equipment options—and it wasn’t hard enough . Each of those is easily iterated on in a sequel, as the series has done throughout its history. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> offers an even bigger rebuttal to the turn-based question in my mind because that’s essentially still what it is. <em>Final Fantasy</em> combat has long operated on a continuum between static and real-time, going back to the series’ introduction of the ATB system to let enemies act independent of player decision-making. This is why Square Enix often refers to<em> Rebirth</em> as a command combat system. While you can move around in battles and positioning is important, the most important tasks are all automated by the characters themselves and carried out by selecting them from a menu. There are dodges, parries, synergies, summons, and all the rest, but at its core it’s already working off the same logic as <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s combat system, and in much more robust ways. </p><p>It’s perfectly fine if fans just want a new<em> Final Fantasy</em> that marries expensive graphics with a traditional turn-based system, though there are no shortage of other RPGs out there, including many from Square Enix itself, that already cater to those classic sensibilities. But the combat itself is far from the weakest part of the modern entries in the franchise. What’s actually holding it back, without a doubt, are the stories. I’m not going to relitigate every turn in each of the sprawling adventures release over the last decade. I’d argue <em>Final Fantasy</em> storytelling has been on the decline since the end of the PS2 generation with <em>FFXII</em>, a still-stellar game for plenty of other reasons. <em>Rebirth </em>and <em>FFXVI</em> both had glaring issues, though. </p><p><em>Rebirth</em> is a world-class game in so many ways, from the cinematic presentation to the maximalist open-world design, but it bungles many of the original source material’s most important moments without providing interesting new interpretations, tensions, or epiphanies in return. The Gold Saucer section is a perfect encapsulation. The theme park is beautifully and entertainingly recreated and chock full of fun distractions. But Barret’s backstory of having his YIMBY idealism exploited by Shinra to turn his hometown into a Mako-harvesting dump gets short shrift and feels hollowed out. His encounter with Dyne, the friend whose life he accidentally ruined, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/1e295v7/what_the_fuck_did_they_do_to_dyne_in_rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is overshadowed by a cartoony infusion of clear-cut moralism</a></span>. It was one of many narrative misfires up and through <em>Rebirth</em>’s bizarre ending. </p><p><em>FFXVI</em> faltered even more frequently. For every great character moment between Clive, Joshua, and Cid, there was something in the larger narrative about geopolitical rivalries and enslaved magic users that was either straight-up dumb or borderline offensive. It never quite grapples with the stakes of its grim worldbuilding before eventually ditching it all for some old-school <em>Final Fantasy</em> guy-in-the-sky deus ex machina shit that undermines everything players had previously become so emotionally invested in. I say this with complete love for the game as a whole, which I am currently playing a second time, but <em>FFXVI</em> lives up to its <em>Game of Thrones</em> influences with a third act that’s every bit as disappointing as the end of the HBO series. </p><p>My take away from<em> Clair Obscur, </em>then, is not that RPGs need to be turn-based to find love again, but that <em>even</em> a turn-based RPG can win over modern audiences if the story, acting, and presentation are all top notch. There is no reason the next <em>Final Fantasy</em> can’t do all of those things on top of harnessing the franchise’s current combat systems. For everyone else, well, <em>Dragon Quest XII</em> shouldn’t be that far away. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players have been waiting patiently all season for the chance to unlock the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-cel-shaded-superman-looks-incredible/1100-6532550/" data-ref-id="1100-6532550">first obtainable Superman skin in four years</a>, and Friday was supposed to be the day. But the folks at Epic have apparently goofed something up, and most of the new Superman cosmetics, including both versions of the skin, are locked for everyone regardless of whether they own the battle pass.</p><p>Players can unlock the free items--a loading screen, a cape, and a pickaxe--but everything else in Superman's set is stuck. Players who level up enough to unlock some of the items report seeing the normal "you just unlocked these items" splash screen after returning to the lobby, but then the skin, glider, and other items that require the battle pass don't actually appear in the locker.</p><p>Reddit has been inundated with complaints about this--the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx9yqy/i_dont_think_hes_from_dc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">front</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx7wgz/this_superman_parachute_looksstrange_to_me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">page</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lx74vg/so_even_after_i_had_gotten_the_glider_it_doesnt/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1lxa7jn/i_leveled_up_and_claimed_the_skin_but_nothing_but/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/hot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FortniteBR subreddit</a> is covered in posts about this topic. Despite how widespread the issue appears to be--I'm also experiencing this phenomenon myself--Epic has not yet publicly acknowledged the problem on <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">@FortniteStatus</a>, though there is a page about in <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Gameplay/why-did-i-not-receive-superman-rewards-in-fortnite-after-unlocking-them-a000095274?lang=en-US&amp;sessionInvalidated=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Epic's self-service support portal</a>. It's possible the lack of a public response is due to Epic's summer break, when most of the company's employees are on vacation--Friday being the final business day of the break. [<strong>Update: </strong>Epic has now <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1943747417863590259" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">acknowledged</a> the problem, though it hasn't offered a timeline for a fix.]</p><p>It remains a frustrating turn of events for fans, particularly for those who have been waiting years for a chance at a new Superman skin. The old Superman skin is permanently locked to the Chapter 2 Season 7 battle pass, released in 2021, and so this is the first time newer players have had the opportunity to get a Superman skin.</p><p>Alongside the new Superman skin, Epic released a pair of other characters from the new film in the item shop on Thursday, though the much-requested Lex Luthor was not among them. Instead, we got skins for the villainous Engineer, and the scene-stealing Mister Terrific, and both of them will be available in the shop until July 24.</p><p>Cosmetics aren't the only exciting aspect of Fortnite's newest collaboration with DC. Epic added on Friday a new Superman mythic item to Battle Royale and Zero Build, which allows one person per match to turn into a fully powered Superman who can fly around and melt folks with his heat vision. And after next week's major patch, Superman's Fortress of Solitude will be added to the island as well.</p>

                <p>Road to Glory is the default game mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>. It allows you to create your own player and work your way from high school to college, simulating all of the challenges and triumphs in that journey. When you're first making your player, you can select a position for them to play. Naturally, the most popular position that most players will select, is quarterback. If you were one of the many players who chose to play as a quarterback, one of the first questions you'll have is which Archetype is best for that position in College Football 26.</p><p>Below, you can see an explanation for the QB Archetypes and which one we recommend picking.</p><h2>All QB Archetypes in College Football 26</h2><p>In total, there are four QB Archetypes you can select in Road to Glory. Each one has its strengths and weaknesses, and you don't have to conform to the playstyle that the Archetype outlines. As you progress in Road to Glory, you'll be able to unlock abilities and increase attributes that can make your quarterback a true jack-of-all-trades.</p><p>However, this doesn't mean that your initial Archetype choice isn't important. This determines your playstyle for high school and the early parts of college. Your choice could also have an impact on what school you choose to attend, as one school might have an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-offensive-playbook-to-use-in-college-football-26/1100-6533072/" data-ref-id="1100-6533072">offensive playbook</a> that plays more into the play style of your Archetype.</p><p>You can see all four QB Archetypes in Road to Glory below:</p><ul><li><strong>Pocket Passer QB</strong> - This Archetype follows in the footsteps of quarterbacks such as Joe Burrow, Peyton Manning, and Cade Klubnik. You'll primarily throw the ball from a stationary pocket and not worry about creating plays with your legs.</li><li><strong>Dual Threat QB</strong> - This Archetype is a blend of the Pocket Passer and Pure Runner Archetype. You'll be strong with your arm as well as your legs, forcing defenses to account for you as a passer and a runner.</li><li><strong>Backfield Creator QB</strong> - This Archetype is modeled after quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Drake Maye. You won't be considered an overt threat as a runner past the line of scrimmage, but you have a keen ability to extend plays in the backfield by averting pressure and delivering an accurate throw.</li><li><strong>Pure Runner QB</strong> - This Archetype gives you plenty of speed, quickness, and agility to be a better rusher than passer. While quarterbacks like Lamar Jackson can still be lethal through the air, their top strength lies in their ability to run with the ball and make plays with their legs.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530446" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530446"></a><figcaption>All four QB Archetypes in Road to Glory</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530446-img_6843.jpg"></figure><p>As you can see, all four Archetypes are quite different from one another, but which is the best one to select if you just want the most dominant quarterback in Road to Glory?</p><h2>Best QB Archetype in Road to Glory</h2><p>When picking a QB Archetype in Road to Glory, you have to remember a couple of key factors. First, your quarterback won't be a strong passer when they first start out in college, regardless of whether you select the Pocket Passer QB Archetype or not. Unless you're playing on an easy difficulty and choose to be a five-star recruit, you won't have the best passing stats or arm strength to effectively throw the ball all over the field.</p><p>Second, every QB Archetype starts out with some kind of passing ability. So, even if you pick Pure Runner, that doesn't mean your quarterback won't be able to complete any pass. Pocket Passer isn't the only Archetype that allows you to excel at throwing the ball.</p><p>With all of that in mind, the <strong>best AB Archetype to pick is</strong> <strong>Backfield Creator</strong>. This is very similar to the Scrambler Archetype from CFB 25, which was by far the most popular pick all year in that game. Backfield Creator gives you solid stats all across the board and allows you to go in any direction with your quarterback once you start to level them up.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530437" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530437"></a><figcaption>The stats for the Backfield Creator Archetype</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4530437-img_6844.jpg"></figure><p>You can make plays with your legs, throw the ball downfield, and scramble out of trouble when defensive pressure breaks through. Backfield Creator is somewhat similar to the Dual Threat Archetype, but Dual Threat places a slightly larger emphasis on running with the ball. So, if that's more up your alley, then you can select that Archetype.</p><p>As for Pocket Passer and Pure Runner, these are more niche options that tend to limit your quarterback early on. Selecting either one makes it difficult to become an all-around quarterback until you start to unlock more abilities and attributes.</p><p>Of course, it's your Road to Glory playthrough, so pick whichever QB Archetype you think can excel with and go from there. Once you're done selecting your Archetype, make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-coach-archetype-in-college-football-26-dynasty-mode/1100-6533046/" data-ref-id="1100-6533046">best Coach Archetype for Dynasty</a> mode in CFB 26.

One notable feature that isn’t explained at all are the handful of giant vehicles you can briefly take over. It doesn’t take long to figure out that driving into the large question mark opening on their backside is key to controlling them, but none of that matters if you can’t find any to begin with.

This is the biggest NPC vehicle by far. It stands out with its two containers that display <em>Mario Kart</em> in large red letters. <strong>Semi-Trucks are typically encountered on wide paved roads with multiple lanes.</strong> I’ve often seen them in connecting races with Toad’s Factory as well as the Golden Gate Bridge lookalike that connects Crown City and Faraway Oasis.</p><p>The standard circuit races don’t feature long stretches as much, so you won’t see any of these unless you’re driving between tracks. No need to worry about the sanctity of an old-fashioned race ruined by an obnoxiously fast automobile.</p><p>Another way to drive Semi-Trucks, as well as the other vehicles we’ll be covering, is to take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-coins-question-marks-outfits-1851784658">P-Switch Challenges</a></span>.

Pushing the stick up will plunge the nose of the boat into the water, while pushing the stick down will lift the nose up. Alternating between the two can help you soar above big waves.</p><h2 id="h81369"><a id=""></a>Where to find Helicopters</h2><figure id="" data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-recommend-id="image://a1167518173ced4b663cd8d749de31f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="ario drives toward a helicopter with a giant question mark inside." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Special vehicles only get rarer from here. First up is the Helicopter, which is easy to spot in the air thanks to their chunky orange design. Bear in mind that these are separate from the tiny yellow MKTV helicopters that spectate races. <strong>Helicopters fly in a preset loop, so the best way to take one over in Free Roam is to follow it until it lands for a short period.</strong></p><p>Finding them during a race is also a mixed-bag. They’re not located in similar environments the way Semi-Trucks and Speedboats are. I’ve also seen more variance in how they’re presented, such as being an integral part of the race from DK Spaceport to Peace Stadium. Conversely, you can find one hidden behind a building when racing between Mario Bros. Circuit to Toad Factory. </p><p>Controls for the Helicopter also make full use of your Joy-con’s stick, and in proper inverted orientation for flight: Moving it up will make the Helicopter descend, while moving it down makes the Helicopter climb up.</p><h2 id="h81370"><a id=""></a>Where to find UFOs</h2><figure id="" data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-recommend-id="image://36302b5efe0b888367611900a7b710ba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shy Guy drives toward a UFO and a couple of smiling cows." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That brings us to the last and rarest of the bunch–the UFO. I’ve yet to see this one during an actual race, although it does appear randomly in the Free Roam mode. Keep an eye on the sky and you just might see this saucer with colorful lights hovering by. <strong>UFOs typically stay in motion, but following one for long enough will make it come down to the ground and allow you to drive into its tractor beam to take it over.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You don’t have to rely on luck to find one out in the wild. There is at least one UFO that remains idle in the Free Roam mode and resets after you’ve interacted with it. <strong>This stationary UFO can be found on a cliff overlooking the river between Dry Bones Burnout and Mario Bros. Circuit.</strong> More specifically, it’s on the cliff to the left of the great staircase that leads towards the Dry Bones Burnout area. Follow the mountainside left until you can drive up the slope and see a set of torches and a metal fence. Drive along the path to find the UFO, a couple of cows, and a Nabbit to catch.</p><p>Controls for the UFO are similar to the Helicopter, with the stick controlling both descension and ascension. One standout difference is that pressing the R button will enable the tractor beam. You can use this to pick up everything from other cars, coins, and even enemy NPCs.</p><p>Even if the open world can feel bare at times, <em>Mario Kart World</em> has a lot of fun interactables and secrets to discover. Keep exploring the environment and the tracks themselves! You never know where any large vehicles might be available.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-semi-truck-ufo-helicopter-1851786066]]></content:encoded>

If heaven is truly paradise, a place where I’ll be happy forever, I expect <em>Tony Hawk</em> games. They are some of the best video games ever made, blending snappy controls, fun level design, and awesome music into an incredible skateboarding experience that I’ve always enjoyed since I was a young boy.</p><p>And <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-demo-review-huge-combos-million-points-bam-ps5-1851784238"><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</em></a></span>, the latest entry in the franchise, continues the franchise’s history of delivering pure, concentrated joy, one kickflip and combo at a time. Sure, some changes might ruffle feathers, and I ran into one too many bugs, but<em> THPS 3+4</em> overcomes its mistakes and has become one of my favorite games of 2025.</p><h2 id="h110208"><a id=""></a><strong>What is <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4?</em></strong></h2><p>If you’ve never played a <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>game before, let me explain how these things work. You have a collection of levels and each has goals, like score a high number of points or collect a certain number of items. You have two minutes to complete these goals, but you can try as many times as you like. Completing enough goals unlocks new levels to skate. Do everything you can, and you unlock more goals that are harder. </p><p>And that’s basically it. It’s a shockingly simple formula, but it works because it adds<em> just enough </em>tension. Each two-minute run is a mad dash to complete a specific goal, reach a certain area, or find that last item you desperately need. Every crash or mistake in a two-minute run in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> feels painful as you lose some time.</p><p>However, the two-minute timer, which was a key part of the first three games, wasn’t a feature in <em>THPS 4.</em> Instead, that game used a semi-open world structure, letting players complete various goals as they saw fit in bigger levels than those in past games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836">All of that is gone in the new remake</a></span>. As someone who didn’t play much <em>Pro Skater 4</em>, I don’t mind the remake taking levels from that game and remixing them into the classic two-minute format. But I also get that for some people, this is a huge change that ruins half of <em>THPS 3+4’</em>s package.</p><p><em>THPS 3+4</em> does offer the option to increase the run timer to as high as 60 minutes, which sort of recreates the laidback, open-world vibes of the original<em> THPS 4</em>, though it likely won’t be enough for people who consider the fourth entry in the skateboarding series their favorite.</p><p>It’s not just how you play the levels that has changed in the remake, as the very levels themselves have received big graphical updates, and here, the changes are almost all positive. All of the levels in<em> Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>are filled with new details, high-res textures, and improved models, making them feel more alive than in the old games. But developer Iron Galaxy (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">who worked on the PC port of <em>THPS 1+2</em></a></span>) was careful to make sure the classic levels still feel great to skate and aren’t too visually busy or messy. You can still clearly see ramps, rails, collectibles, and more. </p><p>This is key in a game where you are often moving very fast in the middle of some huge combo and have to make decisions with little time to think. I never experienced a moment in the remake where I was confused about a piece of the level or what was skateable.</p><h2 id="h110209"><a id=""></a><strong>Something new, please</strong></h2><p>Interestingly, Iron Galaxy has created three new levels in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> One is a large dilapidated waterpark, another a movie studio, and the other places you inside of a pinball machine played by Tony Hawk. </p><p>I was concerned that these levels might not be able to hold their own next to the classic parks. Thankfully, Iron Galaxy nailed it. The waterpark-themed area feels like something original <em>THPS </em>devs Neversoft (a studio killed by Activision) would have created back in the PS2 days. Likewise, the pinball level injects some more absurdity into the collection in a way I really appreciated and which is true to the series. I mean, the first game included an Area 51-like level with a UFO and an alien. Oh, and the pinball level includes a very nice nod to original devs Neversoft. Finally, the movie studio level feels so much like an original park that I forgot to include it in the first draft of this review. </p><p>Speaking of changes, <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’</em>s soundtrack isn’t just the same songs from the old games. Again, like the changes made to<em> THPS 4</em>’s levels, some fans won’t like that most of the old songs are gone. But they’ve been replaced by a soundtrack filled with bangers, including new songs from artists featured in the original <em>THPS 3</em> and <em>THPS 4. </em>It makes the package feel less like a nostalgic retread and more like a new game. It’s not. It’s still very much a remake, cashing in on nostalgia. But when I was playing one of the new parks, listening to new music, and playing as one of the many new skaters included in the game alongside old <em>THPS</em> vets, I found myself enjoying something I didn’t expect to have in 2025: A new <em>Tony Hawk</em> game. A good one, too. What a wonderful treat buried in this fantastic remake.</p><p>For fans who like to get creative, <em>THPS 3+4 </em>features a very powerful skatepark creator that lets you build basically any kind of level you want. And you can share them across all platforms, too. People are already recreating levels from other <em>Tony Hawk</em> games, and I’ve spotted at least one Mario-inspired track, too. If enough talented creators pick up <em>THPS 3+4</em>, I might have an endless number of new levels to skate, complete with custom goals and collectibles. The remake also supports online play. So you and a few friends can free skate together on a user-created remake of<em> Doom</em>’s E1M1. What a world we live in! There’s also a create-a-skater option, but these can’t be shared online.</p><h2 id="h110210"><a id=""></a><strong>Happiness is a skateboard</strong></h2><p>I’m realizing that I’m nearly done with this review, and I’ve not mentioned yet how skating feels in <em>THPS 3+4</em>. That’s because it’s just so perfect that I don’t have much to add beyond that. It takes what was created for <em>THPS 1+2 </em>and builds on it ever so slightly, but without breaking anything. Skating around a level, even in free skate mode with no goals or timers, is a joyful experience. It just feels so damn good. I always felt in control as I skated, and tricks felt snappy and responsive. Popping a random kickflip on my way to a goal never failed to make me feel a jolt of endorphins firing off in my brain. I have no notes to share about skating in <em>THPS 3+4.</em> It’s very good. It makes me happy. I love it.</p><p>What I don’t love are some of the bugs I encountered while playing <em>THPS 3+4</em>. None of them were game-breaking, but sometimes I’d have my screen go black or the camera get stuck in a weird spot. A quick level reset usually fixed these problems, but some screen tearing on Xbox continued to happen when booting up a level. Performance remained solid, but it was a small annoyance I spotted over and over. Hopefully, a future patch can fix some of these bugs and the tearing issue.</p><p>Even if the issues are never patched,<em> THPS 3+4 </em>is still a fantastic game. If you’ve enjoyed playing <em>Tony Hawk</em> games in the past, then you should check this thing out ASAP. While the changes to <em>THPS 4</em>’s levels might disappoint some, the new music and levels are rad, and the skating feels as perfect as ever. If that gaming room in heaven exists, it better have a copy of <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4.</em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-pro-skater-review-is-it-good-levels-1851786124]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Whose turn is it?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been one of the breakout hits of 2025. It's also a classically styled turn-based role-playing game, taking cues from many popular series, including Final Fantasy. These two factors have both led to many questions about whether Final Fantasy might return to its own roots, and now the question's been posed to one of Final Fantasy's front-facing leads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoki Yoshida, the director/producer of Final Fantasy 14 and producer of Final Fantasy 16, was asked in an <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with AnimeNewsNetwork</a> whether mainline Final Fantasy games could go back to being turn-based, in the wake of Clair Obscur's success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," said Yoshida. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18," Yoshida continued. "We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The answer, essentially, is still up in the air. Final Fantasy changes with each entry, after all; aside from creating new stories and casts for each mainline numbered entry, each game can range from highly iterative to full-on evolutions or change-ups. Looking at the gameplay shifts from, say, Final Fantasy 9 on through 12 and 13 emphasizes how the series often shakes things up for each successive installment.</p><div id="best-mainline-final-fantasy-games" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3><h3>Best Mainline Final Fantasy Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yoshida has talked about this in the past, within the context of Final Fantasy 16 opting for a very action-oriented system. That <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/final-fantasy-16-ditched-turn-based-combat-to-appeal-to-younger-generations-producer-says/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">entry tried to appeal to a different crowd</a>, because of the "expected" sales and impact of a mainline Final Fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've had these conversations before, around the future of Final Fantasy, and will probably have them again. After all, simply judging by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/everything-you-need-to-know-about-final-fantasy-xv-2">development timelines</a> of the past few mainline games, it might be a bit until we start hearing about Final Fantasy 17, much less 18 or beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and its development team at Sandfall Interactive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sells-33-million-in-33-days-not-bad-for-a-game-some-thought-was-going-to-get-crushed-by-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">have certainly struck success</a> by honing in on their goals and passions, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-baldurs-gate-3-dev-larian-reveals-what-he-wanted-to-say-at-the-game-awards-2023">maybe that is the true objective to strive towards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-producer-naoki-yoshida-says-theres-not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-future-entries-will-be-turn-based-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Aaron Keller hears you all and agrees: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/">Overwatch 2</a> could definitely use more story content right about now, stating that for it to be "firing on all cylinders" it needs to once again make story content a pillar of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller, who serves as Overwatch 2's director, was recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20r5IX0UEnM&amp;ab_channel=Jay3">interviewed by content creator Jay3</a> about many aspects of the live game, including the status of a map editor/creator, a looking-for-group function, and the process of creating just one of the game's many heroes. The latter question eventually led to discussion about the state of narrative content in Overwatch 2 and Keller was refreshingly frank about the matter.</p><p dir="ltr">When probed about a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-boss-says-more-tv-shows-and-movies-are-possible/1100-6530062/">potential TV series</a>, Keller responded by saying that the team "would love to do that" before springboarding off of the question to address narrative-starved fans. Keller continued, saying that the team sees a lot of sentiment online that "Overwatch has dropped the ball when it comes to story and lore."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the fact that the Overwatch games have always been multiplayer-first, Blizzard has always employed a story team that fleshed out the game's constantly expanding cast. These storytelling efforts encompass many aspects of the game, like sprays, emotes, voice lines, interactions with certain other characters, in-game bios, events, and skins. Outside of the game, it has manifested as comics, novels, and vibrant animated shorts and cinematics, the latter of which Jay3 points out that he misses at one point in the interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Keller seems to as well, claiming, "For me personally, for us to say Overwatch 2 is firing on all cylinders, we need to have some of that come back," all the while expressing that he and the team know that they used to to put out more animated shorts in the past and want to again. Accordingly, he claims that the team had large ambitions of pursuing story content in Overwatch 2, but then, as is often the case in game development, things went sideways. </p><p dir="ltr">Keller admitted, "To speak frankly about it, we did have a big plan to go after story in the game. That was the PvE side of it, with the campaign and everything like that. And it didn't work out." When Overwatch 2 was first announced, a major new feature of the then-upcoming sequel was the implementation of a PvE mode complete with a story that would weave together a cohesive campaign featuring a number of the Overwatch cast.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the heavily anticipated PvE mode was detached from Overwatch 2 prior to its launch in 2023, and was eventually scrapped, which prompted "a kind of reset moment" for the game's team. Aspects of it were later salvaged for later updates, like a content pack of PvE missions that was sold to players post-launch. One of Overwatch 2's newest additions,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/overwatch-2-stadium-heroes-and-abilities-list/2900-6490/"> the Stadium mode</a>, also adapts the canned PvE mode's skill-progression system into a PvP format that has proven to be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/">success</a> with fans of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">But for fans of Overwatch's larger narrative and cast, these additions, as well as constant balance changes and mechanical pivots, have come at the cost of little-to-no in-game story content, let alone cinematics. Keller and the Overwatch team seem to get that though, and want to get back to it, sharing, "It's just there's been a bit of kind of like a step backwards that we had to take in order for us to be able to start moving forward on it again."</p><p dir="ltr">With the game seemingly in a healthier place these days, Keller's comments could be a positive sign that Overwatch's narrative will be a larger part of the game again in the near future.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It will, however, have what DICE is calling Training. Players will be able to choose between two different Training paths for each class. Training levels up over the course of a match by tackling objectives or engaging in teamplay, after which players gain more passive bonuses unique to the class. Upon reaching level-three Training, players can use an unique active class ability.</p><p dir="ltr">One example of a Training ability shared in the blog post is for the Recon class, which at level three will be able to call in a UAV that automatically spots enemies for a duration. Depending on the Training Path players select, their level-0, level-one, and level-two passive Training abilities will be different, though the level-three active ability will be the same, with only one active ability for each class. Triggering a level-three ability resets Training to level two, after which players will be able to start rebuilding charge on their level three ability.</p><p dir="ltr">Once again using the Recon class as an example, selecting the Sniper Training path grants improved spotting capabilities at level zero all the way to making it so enemies hit with sniper headshots becoming unrevivable at Training-level two. Alternatively, choosing the Pathfinder Training tree makes it so players move more quickly while crouched and prone at level zero and makes it so damaging enemies automatically spots them at level two. You can see the full Recon Training perk tree below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1456" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530374"></a><figcaption>Each class will have two Training paths to choose from, culminating in an active ability.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4530374-battlefield6recontrainingtree.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Training looks to be a major new system in Battlefield 6--one that DICE states is there to incentivize players to efficiently engage in their chosen role and to promote teamplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157326/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I have to admit, I was really nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>. I played the first ‘<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tony_hawks_pro_skater_1_plus_2">1 + 2</a>’ collection back in 2021 and absolutely loved it, but my early teenage years were shaped by the Birdman’s third and fourth console outings. So to say that a lot was riding on Iron Galaxy’s remake would be an understatement, and early concerns regarding THPS4’s shift in structure definitely rattled me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can wholeheartedly say that this latest nostalgic revisit to what I would argue was the peak of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-tony-hawk-games-of-all-time">the Tony Hawk’s series</a> is a success – albeit with a few caveats.</p>
<p>So let’s start with the pink elephant in the room. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/tony_hawks_pro_skater_4">Pro Skater 4</a> has been drastically altered to fit more in line with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/tony_hawks_pro_skater_3">Pro Skater 3</a> (and THPS1 + 2, for that matter). So instead of roaming about each level at your own pace and triggering missions by speaking with the local citizens, you’re instead racing against the two-minute clock, with missions completed organically as you make your way around.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157318/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a bitter pill to swallow for veterans hoping for a more 1:1 remake of the original, but I have to admit that it still works pretty well as is. Yes, the levels in THPS4 are much larger than those that came before, and so tasks like collecting the S-K-A-T-E letters might prove more difficult with the ticking clock. But having the entry align more closely with the third <em>does</em> make for a more cohesive experience; one I’m certain newcomers will appreciate.</p>
<p>Speaking of cohesion, despite development moving from the now-defunct Vicarious Visions to Iron Galaxy, THPS3+4 feels instantly familiar to those who played the original games and the 2021 remake of 1 + 2. It plays exactly how you’d want, with slick, responsive controls, outrageously over-the-top combos, and heaps of potential when it comes to player and board customisation.</p>
<p>You’ve got a really solid selection of skaters to choose from, including Hawk himself, Zion Wright, Chloe Covell, and more. Unlockable characters include Bam Margera and <strong>TMNT</strong>’s Michelangelo, while if you opt for the Digital Deluxe Edition, you can also play as <strong>DOOM</strong> Slayer and the Revenant, with additional bonus music tracks included.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157323/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Each skater has various advantages and disadvantages, but by collecting stat points hidden around each level, you can boost everything from speed to lip balance. The good news is that if you switch skaters, you can immediately apply all stat points previously collected, so there’s no need to go through the motions again and again.</p>
<p>As for the levels themselves, they’ve been absolutely wonderfully recreated. Unlike the first two entries, 3 + 4 really leans into the whole <strong>MTV</strong> / <strong>Jackass</strong> influence and includes some truly ridiculous missions that make use of the additional NPC characters located throughout each stage. So, you can ‘Bury the Bully’ in Canada, ‘Stop the Pickpockets’ in Airport, and ‘Photobomb the Tourists’ in Alcatraz. Some missions have been altered somewhat, so don’t expect to see Ollie the Bum hallucinating pink elephants. They’re still around, but the context has been switched up a bit.</p>

<p>In addition to the familiar favourites, Iron Galaxy has also seen fit to create a few new tracks of its own, and I’ll be honest, they’re <em>awesome</em>. Waterpark in particular is a true highlight, with the myriad waterslides and empty pools making for a proper skateboarding playground begging to be combo’d into oblivion. It gives me hope that Activision could soon green-light a brand new Tony Hawk’s game, but I’m not going to hold my breath.</p>
<p>One thing I do want to call out, however, is the music. And to be clear, the soundtrack here is <em>banging</em>; really good stuff. You’ve got Iron Maiden’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qbRHY1l0vc"><strong>2 Minutes to Midnight</strong></a>, Sex Pistols <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ah1JM9mf60"><strong>Holidays in the Sun</strong></a>, Mastodon’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv_QcNplLxM"><strong>Precious Stones</strong></a>, and <em>so</em> much more. The problem, however, is that music is a powerful source of nostalgia, and the majority of the originals’ tunes have been left out, with only six tracks represented from THPS3, and four from THPS4.</p>
<p>I want to reiterate that the soundtrack is really rather good, and ultimately many newcomers will discover some life-long favourites here, just like I did back in the early 2000s. But why couldn’t Iron Galaxy appeal to both crowds? I broke into a massive stupid grin when Bodyjar’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18P614-bnS4"><strong>Not the Same</strong></a> kicked in for the first time, and I just wish that the collection included a few more nostalgic hits.</p>
<p>Moving onto multiplayer, you’ve got a few options to keep you busy once you’re done with the single-player portion. One of the highlights is the new ‘HAWK’ mode, which sees you hide H-A-W-K letters around levels before riding around to locate your opponent’s letters. It’s a cool little mode, and it’s nice to see something that’s not just 'see who can score the most points'.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157327/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, while multiplayer works well, actually finding a match can take a little while. It’s early days, in one sense, but if the game’s struggling to find matches at launch, then I dread to think what it might be like in a year or two.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard multiplayer, you’ve also got the Create-A-Park mode. Here, you can try out custom parks from a hefty selection, though it’s safe to say that some of the early designs leave a bit to be desired. Heck, I can’t talk, I wouldn’t be able to do much better, but I’m definitely looking forward to seeing a few creations that don’t just rely on silly gimmicks.</p>
<p>The actual creation tool is pretty fun and intuitive, with assets selected with the D-pad and placed on the ground with the analogue sticks. You can rotate pieces, zoom in, pan the camera around – all sorts. It’s a neat little tool if you’ve got a flair for park creation, but ultimately I can’t see myself using it that much.</p>
<figure><a title="Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157324/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, looking at how the game runs on Switch 2, I’m mostly very impressed. In handheld mode, there can be a little bit of aliasing, but by and large the game is remarkably on par with the likes of the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, hitting what feels like a solid 60fps with some gorgeous reflection technology on display with puddles.</p>
<p>The lighting looks great in levels like Tokyo and Foundry, and pop-in is thankfully kept at a minimum. Some of the NPC characters can look a little goofy at times, sure, but if anything, this felt like a callback to the original games. That’s my excuse at least – deal with it.</p>
<p>Finally, you can view some of the scenery with the game's photo mode, which works really well and adds in a number of cool little filters and effects for good measure.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is another welcome return to the franchise's glory days, presenting the third and fourth entries with revamped visuals across the board while retaining the same slick gameplay. Some folks might be unable to get over the structural changes to Pro Skater 4, and I have to admit to being a little disappointed at the lack of classic music tracks, but overall, the positives absolutely outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>If you're looking to inject a hefty dose of nostalgia into your life, or you simply want to see what the Tony Hawk series was like at its absolute peak, then this should prove a fine addition to your Switch 2 library.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/datamine-leak-points-to-ea-hosting-a-battlefield-6-open-beta.1241769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-spotted-in-new-datamine/">Insider-Gaming</a>, a datamined leak points to EA hosting an open beta for its next entry in the Battlefield series, which we only know as Battlefield 6 for now, since its official title has yet to be revealed. </p>



<p>While datamining Battlefield Labs, the program through which EA is testing new features for the next Battlefield game and consistently playtesting the new entry, the datamining group 1BF Telegram Group found "<em>Battlefield 6 Open Beta</em>" added in the most recent update, though no further details came with the phrase. </p>



<p>It's not the biggest shock that EA would plan an open beta for its next major shooter, since that's the common pattern for how multiplayer-focused games are launched. The beta not only gives the developers a chance to stress-test the servers, it gives players a chance to get a feel for the game ahead of its proper launch. </p>



<p>We've seen a number of leaks for Battlefield 6, including videos of the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-new-alpha-leak-video-of-rush-mode/">Rush Mode</a>, and footage of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-campaign-footage-has-leaked-online-from-the-latest-battlefield-labs-update/">campaign</a>, and EA has even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-showcases-destruction-next-battlefield-game-and-it-looks-like-old-school-destructible-environments-back/">officially shared clips</a> from the Battlefield Labs playtests to show how development is progressing. </p>



<p>A full, proper reveal for the game is all we're missing at this point, which, according to EA, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-next-battlefield-game-will-be-revealed-this-summer-new-battlefield-and-skate-due-to-release-by-april-2026/">due to arrive sometime this summer</a>. It could be that alongside the full reveal, EA will announce the open beta and the dates it'll be live, but for now, we'll have to wait and see. </p>



<p>When the reveal does happen, hopefully, it goes well, as EA reportedly has extremely high expectations for this new shooter. A recent report pointed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">EA executives setting a target of 100 million players</a>. It also claimed that the budget for this new game has hit an eye-watering $400 million, which at least partly explains why EA executives are hoping the game can reach such high player numbers. </p>

                <p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 comes loaded with plenty of levels, including every stage from the original versions of both games as well as a few brand-new stages, like Movie Studio and Pinball. However, developer Iron Galaxy actually created several more levels--11, by our count--that you can find via the Create-A-Park mode.</p><p>Select Create-A-Park and you'll see a whole bunch of user-created courses. Thus far, they are ... well, they aren't good, to put it mildly. Most are simply advertising an easy way to earn a few of the game's hardest achievements, and offer little else. However, scroll down and you'll see a "Developer" section, where all the levels were designed by Iron Galaxy itself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> You Win Some, Lose Some - Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Now, to be clear, these stages lack the complexity--both visual and mechanical--of the "real" stages in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, but their simplicity and emphasis on performing nearly impossible tricks helps to make them a good contrast after you've had your fill of the others. Iron Galaxy even put in collectables and other goals to make things more interesting, albeit ones that are fairly easy considering the small size of these stages.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4530352"></a><figcaption>Skateboarding is totally legal in whatever dimension this is.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4530352-thpsextrastage.jpg"></figure><p>However, be careful not to select one stage in particular: Torment Nexus.

            <p>
Ghost Town - the spooky, 80s-set VR puzzle-adventure from the studio behind the acclaimed The Room series - is a genuine treat, and one that's poised to shake off its former Meta Quest exclusivity very soon. Developer Fireproof Games has announced Ghost Town's paranormal delights will be available on PC via Steam VR from next Tuesday, 15th July.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town whisks players back to the London of 1983, where protagonist Edith Penrose - who runs a paranormal detective agency halfway up a South London council block with her tech savvy flatmate Rina - is attempting to find her missing brother, Adam. The ensuing urban fantasy adventure takes players first to a remote Scottish island and then around various immaculately realised London locales, which I won't spoil here.
</p>
<p>
It's fantastic stuff, full of clever puzzling, satisfyingly tactile environmental interactions (if you love The Room series, you'll feel right at home here), and just a brilliantly cinematic approach to its storytelling as Ghost Town leaps through time and its wonderfully orchestrated set-pieces. There's a bit in a lighthouse that might be one of my favourite gaming moments this year! It helps, too, that its small cast of characters is brought to life by some stellar performances.

<p>
Ghost Town originally launched for Meta Quest (amid plenty of critical acclaim) back in April, with Fireproof promising a PC VR and PSVR 2 release would follow at a later date. There's still no update on that PlayStation VR 2 version, but the studio has now confirmed Ghost Town is coming to Steam VR in just a few days time, on 15th July.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear if Ghost Town's PC release will bring any improvements to take advantage of the potentially beefier hardware at players' disposal, but I've asked Fireproof and will report back if I hear anything. Until then, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">wishlist Ghost Town now</a>, and a demo's available too.

Opening the controller requires you to first forcefully remove a faceplate held in place by adhesive tape before a single screw is visible. But you’ll need to extract several other parts and components, including the controller’s mainboard, before its battery is even accessible.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/687610/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-teardown-repair-upgrade">previously revealed</a>, the Pro 2 is still using older potentiometer-based joysticks that are prone to developing drift over time.

                <p>A long-requested feature is finally sailing to Sea of Thieves, but players will have to shell out some cash to take advantage of it. Custom servers, along with other unannounced "benefits," are included in a subscription service coming to Rare's live-service pirate game in early 2026. Developers from Rare made the announcement during a Community Direct video on Wednesday.</p><p>Sea of Thieves is dependent on emergent encounters with both computer-controlled enemies and real players, both of whom can engage in hostilities with players. With custom servers, players can create their own "private customisable sandbox" with adjustable options for loot and enemy spawns. Private servers can also run "Safer Seas Fleets," allowing players to invite their friends, free of beligerent randos. Rare has not stated how much this subscription model will cost.</p><p>Rare was one of the many studios hit by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">massive layoffs at Microsoft</a>, which also resulted in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">cancellation of the studio's project Everwild</a>. Gregg Mayles, a veteran of the company who served as the creative director for both Sea of Thieves and Everwild, reportedly departed Rare following the latter's cancellation.</p><p>The nearly hour-long Community Direct did not address the layoffs, the fate of Everwild, or Mayles' exit from the company. Instead, the video featured five members of the Sea of Thieves team addressing the health of their online game and detailing additions coming in the next several months.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NKQiiI3ElkU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Rare also touched on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-season-17-introduces-smugglers-faction-and-new-weapons/1100-6532263/" data-ref-id="1100-6532263">already-announced Season 17</a>, which introduces a new faction called The Smugglers' League and additional loot to the game's sandbox. Seasons overall will have a more monthly structure, introducing new content and events every month rather than throwing everything new at the players upon the season's debut.</p><p>With Season 17 specifically, the first month will properly introduce The Smugglers' League, the second month brings a "heist" live event, and the third month will refresh the map's Skeleton Forts. The developers also briefly teased Season 18, which centers on the perilous Devil's Roar area of the game's world.</p><p>And in a move that might excite devoted players, Rare is lifting the NDA from the game's Insider Programme, which provides preview builds showcasing upcoming updates to Sea of Thieves. The developers describe the move as a "first step" in opening larger conversations with the game's community.</p><p>It's been rough waters for Rare, but the studio appears keen to reassure Sea of Thieves players that the game still has wind in its sails, hopefully for years to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It wasn’t all that long ago that accessibility was barely a concern for many video game companies. Some time in the past half decade or so, major publishers realized they could augment their marketing efforts with good old-fashioned back pattery, and now here we are. But there’s more to games than products and features. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about the ways disability journalism surrounding games needs to evolve.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by award-winning disability reporter <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/supercrip1994.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Stoner</a> to discuss Disability Pride Month, as well as his own <a href="https://www.ign.com/person/Hotwheels94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing body of investigative work</a> in the accessibility space. Grant draws a line from the early days of companies largely ignoring accessibility-related concerns to the moment they realized such options could serve as a marketing hook – and then up to the present, which Grant argues would be better served by journalism that goes beyond praising PR-friendly features.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to the horse girl sensation that’s sweeping the nation: <em>Umamusume</em>. Chris, like the whole internet, is obsessed. He explains why this oddity speaks to him, and then we grapple with how the game’s newfound fandom has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/horse-girl-gacha-gamers-are-so-obsessed-with-pink-racer-haru-urara-that-the-farm-that-owns-the-real-life-horse-shes-based-on-who-never-won-a-single-race-had-to-respond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impacted real horses</a>. Finally, we decide that anyone who pastes into a document (or email or what have you) with formatting is a deviant who deserves to be confined to the deepest reaches of hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that Aftermath can buy a horse and then have an <em>Umamusume</em> horse girl named after it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Grant: </strong>I think a lot of stories about advocates and consultants are usually through a positive lens. They tend to focus more on the work they do to benefit the company. I think the biggest example is <em>The Last Of Us II</em>. When that game came out, they really put their consultants on sort of a press junket where they were shopping them around to different outlets and showing the good work they did and everything.&nbsp;</p><p>We saw that again with <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, with their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7aVUqmQ_Sc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blind driving assists</a>. [Accessibility consultant] Brandon Cole, who sadly is no longer with us, and Phil Spencer and the Turn 10 team went everywhere, to every publication to talk about the work that they did and the work that [Cole] did.&nbsp;</p><p>But we rarely see what those advocates and consultants go through on a daily basis to be able to do their jobs. I think if we could humanize that, it’ll help maybe not developers and publishers, but it’ll help the community better understand what it actually takes to perform these jobs. As for what I want the industry to start doing: shift away from [only covering] studios that develop these games and create these features, because you can read those pieces everywhere. I think we should instead focus more on disabled people in the industry – whether that’s workers, players, or developers – and how they interact in this space.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Also, a developer is not permanently good. That’s not a condition of the developer; that’s a condition of the people who’ve worked there. [A studio] could just get shitty. It’s a very real and meaningful impact that can happen.</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> That’s what spawned <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-employees-community-members-allege-ablegamers-founder-fostered-abuse-behind-closed-doors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my AbleGamers piece</a>. The work they did there was good, but then over time it allegedly became a toxic environment that made it so that you couldn’t really highlight the good work anymore without acknowledging the harm that they were doing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> My guess is that a lot of stories like that go unreported, especially in vulnerable communities. I think you often find a lot of abuse in vulnerable communities. Do you feel, Grant, like disabled communities are uniquely vulnerable to this type of abuse?</p><p><strong>Grant:</strong> The disability community, in my experience, we treat each other like a monolith or a family unit. And when that family unit is disrupted in any way, the disability community often struggles to accept that. Because for years, we’ve been cast aside. We’ve been not given the same space as other people. We’ve always had to fight harder than most to belong, especially in the gaming industry. So whenever stories like this highlight that there are some messed up things going on, oftentimes the community itself struggles to accept it, because we’ve conditioned ourselves to believe that we’re all one big happy family.&nbsp;</p><p>I also tend to blame marketing departments for big companies that make us feel that way. Like Xbox’s tagline “When everybody plays, we all win,” I argue that has done more harm to the greater movement because it makes us act like we’re all friends – which then allows these bad actors to come in and make victims out of the particularly vulnerable. So I think there’s different layers to why disabled people feel the way they do about these stories, but mostly it’s the fact that we struggle to have individualistic agency. We’re mostly led to believe that we’re all one big happy family and that no one would do this to us because we’re all one big happy family.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/plushie-lawsuit-emotional-support-chicken-nuggets-what-do-you-meme"><h3>Plushie Maker Suing Over ‘Emotional Support Chicken Nuggets’</h3></a><p>It’s a pretty standard copyright and trademark infringement case, despite being about stuffed chicken nuggets.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-disability-pride-last-of-us-forza]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rimworld">RimWorld</a> is boldly going where no acclaimed sci-fi colony sim with a weird cannibalism obsession has gone before: up a bit. RimWorld is leaving the ground behind and heading into space for the first time in its new paid Odyssey expansion, which launches today on PC.
</p>
<p>
Core to Odyssey's heft of new <em>stuff</em> is the ability to built a gravship; essentially a mobile colony players can slowly expand to include the likes of living quarters, labs, workshops, and pretty much anything else they might need. Things start small, though, and initially you'll be using your gravship to explore the planet, landing anywhere you can reach in search of food, fuel, treasure, special weapons, even souvenirs such as exotic birds.
</p>
<p>
And to add some variety to your jaunts, Odyssey introduces new biomes, including the fungal glowforest, gaseous scarlands (home to mechanoids and toxic rain), the bountiful grasslands, the blizzard-ravaged glacier plains, even the molten lava fields - all making use of a new landmarks system said to 'transform' world generation with the likes of cliffs, chasms, fjords, islands, and more. And to spice things up even further, Odyssey introduces 40 new animals to tame, train, trade, or even eat, including sparrows and bluebirds, wolves and scimitar cats, seals and otters, even porcupines and prairie dogs. Oh, and there's fishing now too.

<p>
As you explore, you'll encounter trap-rigged reactors, insect-infested caves, and downed orbital platforms - all potentially home to gravcores you can use to grow your ship and travel further still. And, yes, it'll eventually be possible to leave the planet's atmosphere to start a new chapter in orbit: mining for ore on asteroids, or exploring orbital platforms and hollowed-out satellites (just watch out for scavengers). And tying this together are new multi-part quests players can pick up from ancient maps, passing visitors, and anonymous signals.
</p>
<p>
"Space is a harsh place," warns developer Ludeon Studios in its Odyssey announcement, "so build your ship to survive. Airtight walls protect your colonists and their pets from the vacuum of space. Heaters keep the interiors warm, while oxygen pumps provide life support. Build airlocks with vac barriers to prevent depressurisation of the ship, and equip spacefaring colonists with vac suits before they exit into the void."
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's new gear and weapons - think AI-assisted rifles and sawn-off shotguns - plus new enemies, including hunter drones, wasp drones, ancient sentries, and the cyclops mechanoid. That's all leading up to a new late-game threat in the form of the hateful mechhive. "When you reach the inhuman mind behind this terror, you face a choice," Ludeon teases. "Will you destroy it and shut down every mechanoid for good - or take control of its power?"
</p>

Odyssey - RimWorld's fifth expansion since its  release all the way back in 2013 - is available through <a href="https://rimworldgame.com/odyssey/">Ludeon's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3022790/RimWorld__Odyssey/">Steam</a> right now, costing £19.99/$24.99 USD. And if you've yet to pick up the base game, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/">currently discounted by 20 percent</a>.
