			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-trailer-gorgeous-eva/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> won't just look like a modern game, but it will also play as one without taking away what makes the original unique, according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p>Speaking with Play magazine, as reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metal-gear/metal-gear-solid-delta-dev-says-that-konami-wants-to-make-the-remake-feel-familiar-but-not-old-our-whole-goal-is-to-make-sure-that-it-still-feels-like-the-game-that-you-played-20-years-ago/">GamesRadar</a>, the series producer commented on the remake, saying that their whole game while remaking the third entry in the popular stealth series was to make sure it still felt like the original game without making it feel like an old game. Modernizing gameplay was also somewhat forced by the improved visuals, as some of the original gameplay elements did not fit well with the remade graphics.</p>
<p>The new control scheme featured in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater plays a rather important role in this regard, giving players the chance to experience the game like never before while allowing users to also experience the remake as if it were the original. Any other change was deemed unnecessary, as it would have taken people out of the original experience. The best outcome for the remake, according to Okamura-san, is for long-time fans to still feel nostalgic while playing it.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is still scheduled for a 2024 release on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S, although at this point, it's clear the game will not be released this year. We will keep you updated as soon as possible on when the game launches, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

Digital Foundry notes that the power consumption is up from the 340W-rated base PS5, meaning the console might be a bit of a power hog. We’ll see how efficiency settings salvage people’s energy bills. It also points out that the 16.7 teraflops is lower than previous leaks, while the addition of 2GB RAM is higher. Ultimately, the devil will be in how well the PS5 Pro can leverage a custom configuration and new PSSR upscaling tech to deliver results above and beyond what an off-the-shelf PC is capable of at a similar price point. </p><p>Sony, meanwhile, finally gave the full list of over 50 games that PS5 Pro owners will be able to checkout at launch and see these beefier specs and upscaling in action.

And<em> Returnal</em>, Housemarque’s excellent 2021 roguelike space shooter, is also missing. <em>Elden Ring</em>, one of the best selling and most critically acclaimed games of the past few years,  doesn’t appear to have any upgrades at launch either. </p><p>While PS5 Pro enhanced modes let games take advantage of better framerates, resolutions, and texture density, developers also need to put in the work to make those upgrades happen. It’s possible many of the above games will see their improvements begin rolling out in the not-too-distant future. In the meantime, even regular games should get some overall performance stability boosts from the more powerful PS5 Pro hardware. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The announcement came in the same breath that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-pc-officially-announced-with-january-release-date"><u>Sony announced a PC version of Spider-Man 2</u></a> launches in January — one of the quickest turnarounds from single-player PS5 exclusive to PC from the company so far.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review"><u>Spider-Man 2 review</u></a> returned an 8/10.

While Insomniac has a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Wolverine game</u></a> in the works, fans are hoping the developer will also release a Marvel’s Spider-Man spinoff similar in scope to the hugely successful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales"><u>Miles Morales standalone</u></a>, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-todd-tells-fans-insomniac-used-only-10-of-his-venom-dialogue-in-marvels-spider-man-2"><u>Venom the potential focus</u></a>.

Taking inspiration from the Dark Souls games, it tells the story of fabled Dark Crusaders who must embark on an epic quest to overthrow Adyr, the demon God.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our 8/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-review-2023"><u>Lords of the Fallen review</u></a>, IGN said: "Lords of the Fallen is an awesome Soulslike with a fantastic dual-realities premise, even when performance shortcomings and wimpy bosses crash the party."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Lords of the Fallen Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Hexworks also added a “more exploration-friendly” Umbral realm with update 1.6, as well as enhancements to take advantage of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, which comes out November 7. Patch notes are below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hexworks said Lords of the Fallen on PS5 Pro has a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode running at 4K60 based on 1440p, and Quality Mode running at a native 4K30.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>With version 1.6, new Lords of the Fallen players are more empowered on their journey across Mournstead, with a series of changes during the early part of the game. These include a more gradual onboarding into the Umbral Lamp’s unique abilities, and improved navigation in the tutorial area.<br>As for the wider community, a highly-sought player request has been the ability to more thoroughly explore Umbral – the game’s secondary, darker realm that runs alongside its core world. While retaining its dark allure and tension, the changes – which include subtler soundscapes, an adjusted enemy spawn curve for improved pacing, and reduced vignette effect - all combine to better support exploration of the Umbral.<br>Rounding off the update is a raft of additional performance updates and further difficulty adjustments, including mob redistribution, adjusted ranged enemy perception, and improved platforming. Full patch notes are available to read.</blockquote><h2 data-cy="title2">Lords of the Fallen Update v.1.6.12 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented further gameplay adjustments informed by community feedback and extensive playtesting. It’s rewarding to see our Steam ‘Recent Review’ score rising, reflecting the positive impact of these ongoing improvements, and we’re committed to continuing this journey with your valuable input.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Highlights include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Mob Density:</strong> Based on your feedback, we’ve fine-tuned certain mob encounters to create a smoother, more immersive combat experience by isolating instances to prevent mobs from stacking up. Returning players may find it worthwhile to start anew, as we’ve added a few fresh surprises along the way! (Original enemy distribution and density can still be accessed via NG+ modifiers.)</li><li><strong>Ranged Enemies:</strong> We’ve adjusted the perception of certain ranged units to correct instances that felt unfair or unrealistic.</li><li><strong>Jumping:</strong> Platforming in Pilgrim's Perch has been refined with improved indicators, making jumps clearer and navigation smoother.</li><li><strong>PvP Scaling:</strong> To elevate skill-based play in PvP, we’ve rebalanced scaling mechanics, particularly where magic-infused weapons and spells are concerned. These tweaks apply exclusively to PvP, so PvE players can continue with their current builds unaffected.</li><li><strong>Attack Displacement:</strong> Some weapon attacks have received slight adjustments to reduce displacement, providing a greater sense of control while preserving effectiveness and supporting your playstyle.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Enhanced Tutorialisation, Onboarding, and Start-Up Experience</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve taken steps to further enrich the onboarding experience for new players in Lords of the Fallen, building on feedback from our veteran Lampbearers. We want every new player to feel empowered on their journey, and we understand that some early tutorials may have presented a steep learning curve. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Improved Lighting in the Defiled Sepulchre:</strong> Enhanced lighting and visual adjustments make this initial tutorial area clearer and easier to navigate.</li><li><strong>Gradual Umbral Tutorialization:</strong> Core abilities like ‘soulflay’ and ‘syphoning’ now have dedicated tutorial spaces later in Redcopse, allowing new players to engage with each feature more gradually.</li><li><strong>Simplified First Jump Tutorial:</strong> We’ve refined the jump tutorial to be more accessible (hands up in the comments if you cleared it on the first attempt!).</li><li><strong>Lightreaper Boss Adjustment in NG0:</strong> To clarify the intentional design of this encounter, we’ve removed the Lightreaper boss fight from the tutorial area for NG0 players. Rest assured: the Lightreaper still lurks within Mournstead and will make a return as a surprise in NG+.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A More Immersive Umbral Realm for Explorers</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbral, the parallel realm intertwined with the living world of Axiom, is accessible at any point in the game, offering an expansive world of alternate pathways, hidden treasures, and secrets. We know how much you enjoy exploring Mournstead, and many of you have asked for a more exploration-friendly Umbral realm. Embracing this idea, we’ve made some tweaks to enhance its immersive vibe while preserving its mysterious, challenging nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Umbral remains intentionally hostile, we’ve made adjustments to its sounds, visuals, and enemy spawn curve. Now, the threads (Umbral natives) are slower to detect your presence, allowing you some precious time to explore before the realm’s haunting intensifies. Eventually, the Scarlet Shadow will appear, forcing you to decide: escape or engage in an epic showdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These changes make Umbral better suited for exploration while preserving its eerie intensity and challenging atmosphere:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Dynamic Ambient Sound:</strong> Initial entry into Umbral is now accompanied by subtler soundscapes, building in intensity as you remain longer, reaching a crescendo before you must find an exit, or risk facing the Crimson Reaper.</li><li><strong>Adjusted Enemy Spawn Curve:</strong> Enemy appearances are now better paced to create a smoother, gradual build-up of tension.</li><li><strong>Increased Delay for Scarlet Shadow:</strong> You’ll now have more time to explore before the Scarlet Shadow emerges, enhancing the suspense.</li><li><strong>Reduced Vignette Effect:</strong> Based on player feedback, the vignette effect has been softened to improve visibility while exploring Umbral.</li><li><strong>Clearer Umbral Eggs:</strong> We’ve added a special VFX to eggs set to spawn Umbral natives, as we noticed some players had difficulty distinguishing between active and inactive ones.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">These updates create a richer exploration experience within Umbral, preserving its dark allure and escalating tension for daring adventurers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Performance Improvements</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve implemented additional performance enhancements across several of the game’s more graphically demanding areas, optimising the experience for players with lower-spec computers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>New Challengers Incoming!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Lords of the Fallen now fully harnessing the power of the PS5 Pro, prepare for a fresh wave of cross-players venturing into Mournstead! Be sure to welcome them - whether with a warm salute in co-op or the cold edge of your blade in PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside ongoing support for Lords of the Fallen, Hexworks is working on a sequel due for release at some point in 2026. Publisher CI Games has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lords-of-the-fallen-2-enters-full-development-as-ci-games-reveals-new-details">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> (for lack of an official name) will have a "more commercial" art style and narrative, suggesting it wants the game to have more mainstream appeal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CI Games also promised gameplay improvements, more game mode options, and full "shared-progression" co-op alongside the "core" single-player campaign, all developed with "elevated production values" fueled by Unreal Engine 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The publisher confirmed it had received a "major investment" from Epic Games for PC exclusivity on the Epic Games Store, which means Lords of the Fallen 2 will not initially launch on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance. Walmart, for example, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-black-friday-2024-when-does-the-sale-start">announced its official sale</a> for November 11 this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

            <p>A group of Monkey Island fans have come together to create their own, mini point-and-click adventure game based on Monkey Island series.</p>
<p>It is called The Booze of Monkey Island, and project developer Bean Adventure Agency describes it as a "love letter" to the official Monkey Island games. Once again, players are popped into the shoes of Mighty Pirate Guybrush Threepwood, and once again, his love Elaine has fallen afoul of LeChuck. These are characters originally created by Ron Gilbert, as Booze of Monkey Island's creators acknowledge in the opening credits.</p>
<p>The game starts with Guybrush in a destroyed ship, with a comatose pirate and a lot of debris standing between him and the way out. Of course, this being a homage to the point-and-click Monkey Island games, Guybrush can use objects around him to puzzle his way out of the ship, and onto the relative safety of Booty Island. Here, he makes a deal with the local bartender: convince three more patrons to frequent his bar, and he will help get Guybrush's  ship seaworthy.</p>

<p>I have played through the first few puzzle sections - which I won't spoil here in case you fancy taking your own dive back into the depths of the Caribbean - but I will say this: it is a pretty slick little fan-made project for fellow Monkey Island fans. It boasts fun dialogue, great graphics and the same atmosphere you would expect from an official game from Gilbert and company.</p><p>Along with familiar locales, such as the Governor's Mansion, players will also come across some familiar faces as they explore Booty Island. This includes Wally and Kate Capsize. Meanwhile, conversations with those on the island reference things that happened in the official Monkey Island games.</p>

<p>As for what Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert is up to, earlier this year it transpired the developer is working on a new game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monkey-island-creator-ron-gilbert-has-a-2d-pixel-art-game-in-the-works">which he describes as "Classic Zelda meets Diablo meets Thimbleweed Park"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/building-ultimate-captain-america-first-avenger-mtg-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Magic and Marvel are coming together, starting with five secret lairs that are releasing in early November. Five iconic Marvel characters are getting unique <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>cards in their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" New Magic: The Gathering Marvel Crossover Details Revealed, Including new Secret Lair and Set">own secret lairs</a>, paired up with reskins or new arts of other cards to complement them.</p>

<p>A Secret Lair gives you some good cards, but we’re going to go through how to build a Marvel MTG deck around the commanders, starting with Captain America, First Avenger</p>

<h3>Examining Captain America, First Avenger</h3>



<p>Our first step is to examine Cap, who is appropriately Red, White, and Blue (in a nice flavor nod, they rearranged the normal order of color display from blue, red, white to fit the traditional America order). He comes with a solid body as a 3 mana 4/4 and has two abilities, in ‘Throw…’ and ‘…Catch’.</p>

<p>Throw… is the more unique ability of the two, letting you unattach an equipment to deal damage equal to the equipment’s mana value divided among up to three targets. Few cards have ever used <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Aunattach&amp;unique=cards&amp;as=grid&amp;order=name" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="List of cards that have Unattach in their text">unattach in rules text</a>, and none ever in this way. As for …Catch it is a free equip trigger, letting you give Captain America a piece of equipment at the beginning of combat on your turn at no cost.</p>

<p>What this shows us is a commander who is equipment focused, like any number of Boros commanders. Part of what makes Captain America special is that he adds blue to the mix, opening up new cards for this archetype. Combine that with providing a potentially unique take on the archetype, Captain America, the First Avenger provides an interesting tweak on a well known archetype.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Equipment</h3>



<p>It’s time to suit up Captain America! There are a lot of equipment that can be included but I’m going to focus on a handful that you should look at including in your own Captain America deck.</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden </a>is from the <em>Assassin’s Creed Universes Beyond </em>set, and is the highest mana value equipment in Magic: The Gathering. It also comes down cheaper based on other historic permanents you control (aka legendary cards, saga’s and artifacts). It is perfect for Captain America, First Avenger to throw, but it’s also good for him to wield in combat as it gives the equipped creature +10/+0 and vigilance.</p>

<p>Sword of War and Peace is an automatic inclusion, in its <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1730/sword-of-war-and-peace" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Shield of War and Peace">Shield of War and Peace</a> styling that comes with the secret lair. You’ll probably want to include at least one other <a href="https://scryfall.com/search?q=otag%3Asword-of-x-and-y" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Swords of X and Ys">Sword of X and Y</a>, as they are very good. I recommend <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/124/sword-of-feast-and-famine" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sword of Feast and Famine">Sword of Feast and Famine</a> in particular as it untapped lands when you deal damage to an opponent, letting you do some more throwing post-combat or cast more spells, and gives protection from green and black.</p>



<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/rvr/260/illusionists-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Illusionist's Bracers">Illusionist’s Bracers</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/c21/48/battlemages-bracers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Battlemage's Bracers">Battlemage’s Bracers</a> are for doubling activating abilities. These are helpful for getting more out of Captain’s Throw… ability, making it far more lethal. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/td2/74/grafted-exoskeleton" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Grafted Exoskeleton">Grafted Exoskeleton </a>is a way to turn those throws into extra lethality by making that damage all poisonous, letting only ten damage wipe out a foe - one Excalibur toss becomes lethal.</p>

<h3>Captain America’s Support</h3>

<p>To get Captain America to battle takes more than just a few weapons however. Luckily, there’s no lack of support that we can supply for him.</p>



<p>With one piece of equipment we really want in <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>, we need quartermaster’s to fetch the goods. That’s why we are looking at tutors like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/31/stoneforge-mystic" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Stoneforge Mystic">Stoneforge Mystic</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/230/kellan-the-fae-blooded-birthright-boon" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Kellan, the Fae Blooded">Kellan, The Fae-Blooded</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/59/steelshapers-gift" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Steelshaper's Gift">Steelshaper’s Gift</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/34/open-the-armory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Open the Armory">Open the Armory</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mrd/35/fabricate" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fabricate">Fabricate</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/222/fighter-class" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fighter Class">Fighter Class</a>, and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/6/enlightened-tutor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Enlightened Tutor">Enlightened Tutor</a>. These all can grab Excalibur, or whichever piece of equipment is most useful at any given moment.</p>

<p>For other equipment support we’re looking to a mix of creatures, and enchantments to get extra value, cheapen the cost and return them. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/17/forge-anew" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Forge Anew">Forge Anew </a>is a staple of equipment decks for good reason, resurrecting one equipment, giving instant-speed equipping, and giving you a free equip each turn. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/698/puresteel-paladin" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Puresteel Paladin">Puresteel Paladin</a> lets us draw cards for playing them (just like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/88/sram-senior-edificer" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sram, Senior Edificer">Sram</a>, who’s also invited to the party), and skip equipment costs as long as we have three or more artifacts.</p>



<p>Reinforcing Captain America, First Avenger we also bring <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mul/65/zirda-the-dawnwaker" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Zirda the Dawnwaker">Zirda, the Dawnwaker </a>to cheapen the cost of his ability, and of all of the equip costs. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otj/203/ertha-jo-frontier-mentor" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ertha Jo, Frontier mentor">Ertha Jo, Frontier Mentor</a> provides another ability doubler, as well as a pair of bodies to pick up dropped equipment. <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/14/codsworth-handy-helper" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Codsworth, Handy Helper">Codsworth, Handy Helper</a> is an under the radar helper as well, as it can freely equip things once a turn, gives Captain America Ward 2, and can tap for two mana to play equipment.</p>

<p>Captain America also needs protection, and for that a mixture of creatures and instants come to mind, in addition to some equipment you can include. In the realm of creature cards, there’s the likes of <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/33/skrelv-defector-mite" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Skrelv, Defector Mite">Skrelv, Defector Mite</a> (who I prefer here over <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/702/mother-of-runes" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Mother of Runes">Mother of Runes </a>due to being an artifact, and a legendary creature), and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/669/pippin-guard-of-the-citadel" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Pippin, Guard of the Citadel ">Pippin, Guard of the Citadel</a> who can cheaply stop removal spells. A relatively new option is <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/240/hydroelectric-specimen-hydroelectric-laboratory" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Hydroelectric Specimen">Hydroelectric Specimen </a>which can redirect a single target spell to itself, and as a modal dual-faced card, is optionally playable as a land instead.</p>



<p>Spellwise we have some counterspells and protection spells. The counterspell suite should look at <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/110/arcane-denial" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Arcane Denial">Arcane Denial</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsc/114/counterspell" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Counterspell">Counterspell</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/94/fierce-guardianship" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Fierce Guardianship">Fierce Guardianship</a>, and the modal card <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/241/sink-into-stupor-soporific-springs" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sink into Stupor">Sink into Stupor </a>(another bonus land option), though you can modify this for your preferred counterspells, with the focus being stopping spells that can remove Captain America or key equipment. Protection spells should complement that and include options like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/32/teferis-protection" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Teferi's Protection">Teferi’s Protection</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/1728/flawless-maneuver" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Flawless Maneuver">Flawless Maneuver</a>, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/znr/37/sejiri-shelter-sejiri-glacier" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Sejiri Shelter">Sejiri Shelter</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Deflecting%20Swat" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="https://scryfall.com/card/cmm/214/deflecting-swat">Deflecting Swat</a>.</p>

<p>Using what's above I made an example list, and included a list of later cuts in the maybeboard. Here is <a href="https://archidekt.com/decks/9743049/captain_america" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Captain America Deck">the list </a>for your use to consider ideas for your own list.</p>

<p>A lot of the options above aren’t necessarily the cheapest so let’s do a quick budget ($2.00 or less) rundown of cards for some areas.</p>

<p>Hopefully all of this helps you build the best Captain America, First Avenger deck to lead against all the challengers you will face.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runemasters-review-punishingly-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What is it about sacred temples that make them such juicy targets for roving monsters and villains? That’s a question you… won’t have time to answer in <i>Runemasters</i>, a new <a href="https://funforge.fr/en/products/runemasters">cooperative game by Funforge</a>. I’ve been on a real hot streak reviewing great new board games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/chandigarh-board-game-review-colorful-and-think-y"><i>Chandigarh</i></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/botanicus-review-it-grows-on-you"><i>Botanicus</i></a>, and now the good folks at Flat River Group sent me the slim-but-tricky <i>Runemasters </i>to check out, so follow along for my <i>Runemasters</i> Review!</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Runemasters</i>, And How Do You Play<i>?</i></h2>

<p>Designed by Antoine Prono with illustrations by Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez, <i>Runemasters</i> is a cooperative tower defense game for 1 - 4 players, where players take on the role of guardians protecting a temple from hordes of enemies. Each of the four guardians has a different distinct special ability and ultimate power, which you’ll need to use against the incoming threat.</p>

<p>And believe me, that threat will, indeed, be incoming! One of the things I find most interesting about <i>Runemasters </i>is that it is, quite simply put, extremely punishing. I feel like many cooperative games, over the past five years or so, have softened their difficulty levels. This makes sense when so many of them are more narratively driven, inviting users to explore a world and story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=CikAl8Pi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-1.jpeg?itok=gRAE-BMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each hero brings unique skills to the table... will they be enough?</figcaption></figure><p>But sometimes you just want to bash your head against a wall in a coop game that’ll leave your gaming group in shambles, like <i>Pandemic</i> or <i>Spirit Island</i>. <i>Runemasters</i>, I’m happy to report, is a return to that classic form.</p>

<p>In the game, you’ll flip over cards depicting monsters and place them on a colored track that matches their card color. Each turn, they’ll move one space closer to the temple, and automatically deal damage to any hero blocking their path. If no hero’s on the path, they’ll damage the temple. If all your heroes die, or the temple takes too much damage, you lose!</p>

<p>To defeat these monsters, you’ll roll custom six-sided dice. The dice allow you to deal a point of damage to the first enemy in your track if one of their “weak points” matches a symbol you rolled. Or you can use those symbols to power up your ultimate power, perform a special ability, or swap spaces with another guardian.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=ltun32no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-dice-rolls.jpeg?itok=YO5WLgUv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dice rolled can be used to damage an enemy's weak spots, move, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Defeat most of the monsters in the stack of monster cards, and you’ll reveal the Dawn card - if you survive with at least one hero still on the board, you win!</p>

<h2>The Pleasure Of Difficulty In <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>Maybe I’m a chronically bad dice roller (FACT), but it was such a challenge to get the right symbols at the right time. There are many clever, interlocking mechanics in this little game that add to your strategic options - you can spend the dice you roll to build a wall, or expend mana points to re-roll dice - but I was still left struggling again and again.</p>

<p>But I want to be clear: <i>this is not a bad thing</i>! Cooperative games in this style have lead to some of the most fun, joyfully anguishing moments in my gaming career, and when we finally did beat the game after multiple tries, we were left feeling utterly triumphant. I really enjoy the way the game doesn’t overload you with options, while still managing to give you a few key tools in your hero’s toolkit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=bGcYfnQL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-characters-2.jpeg?itok=L3wS_IGj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ismoros's ability to shield heroes from enemies is not to be overlooked.</figcaption></figure><p>The one major downside with <i>Runemasters</i>, however, is also intrinsically tied to the difficulty and design of the game - and that’s player elimination (Boo! Hiss!). In this game, if your hero is killed - that’s it, you’re done! One of the heroes can resurrect other characters twice in the game, but A. that takes a lot of work to build up the magic power to do so and B. if <i>that</i> hero dies, there’s no resurrection happening.</p>

<p>I would like to see a mechanic where you come back after you die, but suffer some sort of penalty. Even if the penalty imposed made the game equally as hard as losing a character, at least that player wouldn’t have to sit around and wait for everyone else to finish the game. In most cooperative games, if your character dies the entire game is a loss (that’s how they do it in the gloriously chunky <i>Cthulhu: Death May Die</i>, which is of course an entirely differently scoped game, but I just played it so it’s fresh in my mind).</p>

<p>The flip side to this, which solves the problem of player death, is that this game can just as easily be played solo mode. You don’t need to make any adjustments, and if one of your characters dies, you’ve still got plenty of game to go!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=anGLWXt5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-lineup_0.jpeg?itok=igqRqZYZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We're in big trouble here, we've lost a hero (who would be occupying the yellow space) and monsters are backed up on the green path!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Artwork And Components Of <i>Runemasters</i></h2>

<p>The illustrators Paul Mafayon, Théo Guillot, and Adrien Martinez have truly outdone themselves with the quirky, angular designs on all of these cards. The heroes look extremely stylized and have a lot of kinetic movement to them, the monsters are all great renderings of classic dungeon threats, and there’s overall a clean, unfussy look to the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=cCsQ79ff 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/runemasters-review-enemy-cards_0.jpeg?itok=1xlKmjgp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy cards and event cards show off the distinctive illustrated style of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>The components are sturdy cardboard, with all heroes coming as cardboard standees and all villains represented by cards. This isn’t really a game where you need detailed miniatures, and it keeps the price nice and slim at around $30 at most retailers.</p>

<h2><i>Runemasters </i>Review - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a game that’s going to challenge your gaming group, and love a little slash and dash dice-chucking, you won’t find much better out right now than <i>Runemasters</i>. But be warned, player elimination means that you may be sitting by the wayside while your friends are still in the temple trying to defeat a blue dragon! With superior artwork, clean game design, and a high degree of difficulty, <i>Runemasters</i> is a must-try to brave adventurers out there.</p>

However, once you complete Zelda’s Adventure, you may be wondering what you should dive into next. Here are nine other games that could fill the <em>Zelda-</em>sized hole in your gaming soul.</p></div><div><p>This one is a bit of a gimme, but it’s also the easiest to recommend. If you’re aren’t quite ready to move on from the aesthetic of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> and somehow missed the other 2D <em>Zelda </em>game on the Switch, there really isn’t a title that will satisfy you more than <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening. </em>Developed by Grezzo, who also developed <em>Echoes of Wisdom, Link’s Awakening </em>is a remake of the beloved Game Boy game that was originally released in 1993. The 2019 title utilizes an art style that is nearly identical to the most recent entry, so players will feel right at home as they play as Link after he wakes up shipwrecked on a mysterious island.</p><p>Both of these games are similar in that they are fairly different from other Zelda titles. While <em>Link’s Awakening </em>still lets you control Link, meaning combat is pretty traditional, everything else about the game is distinct. With no Zelda that needs rescuing, the game is a little more personal, as Link’s only goal is to gather the tools that will get him home. Those looking for something different in the franchise can’t do much better than <em>Link’s Awakening.</em></p></div><div><p>Zelda wasn’t the only Nintendo princess to get her chance to shine this year, as the publisher also released <em>Princess Peach: Showtime! </em>which gave players the chance to step into the slippers of Mushroom Kingdom royalty.</p><p>While <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> shares a lot of DNA with other entries in the franchise, <em>Showtime!</em> has very little in common with most <em>Mario </em>games. The game sees Peach visit the Sparkle Theater to catch a show, only for a villainous band to take it over. While Mario would solve this problem by jumping on their heads, Peach goes about it her own way, showing off her versatility by dressing up into many different roles, all with their own unique mechanics. Not only is it a strong showing from Peach, but it also constantly switches things up for the player, ensuring they never get bored as they help the iconic princess save the day.</p></div><div><p>Most of <em>Echoes of Wisdom’s </em>combat revolves around creating “Echoes” that will get their hands dirty so you don’t have to. There is another group of Nintendo characters who are accustomed to this method of fighting, the many captains of the <em>Pikmin</em> franchise.</p><p>Much like<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Pikmin 4</em> will have you go around gathering minions to help take down enemies and solve puzzles. A major difference between the two, howver, is that while the Echoes are a major point of the former, the Pikmin are almost the entire point of the latter. The player character in <em>Pikmin 4 </em>has no offensive moves to speak of, requiring them to most effectively target enemy weakness with the creatures they have in their arsenal. They also must use strong resource management to ensure they can defeat foes that come their way while maintaining enough manpower (or PikminPower) to overcome numerous obstacles, whether they’re carrying multiple items back to base or creating new pathways. </p><p>If you’re looking for a game that offers something similar to <em>Zelda’s </em>Echoes but pulls it off with more focus, <em>Pikmin 4</em> is a strong candidate.</p></div><div><p>Probably the least popular title on this list, <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is a game that needs a bit of an explanation. The indie released earlier this year sees you take on the role of a little spaceship in a world heavily inspired by the original <em>The Legend of Zelda.</em> Unsurprisingly, controlling a spaceship plays very differently than an elf boy with a sword, which makes <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> an exciting remix of the original NES title. </p><p>Part RPG, part Shoot Em’ Up, <em>Minishoot’ Adventures </em>is quite unlike anything else out there. You will literally start with no abilities before quickly picking up a weak gun that offers the smallest bit of protection. As you pick off enemies, you will slowly gain experience, which can then be used to power up everything from your movement speed to damage output. There are also new weapons and abilities that will be acquired as you take on the game’s dungeons, which can then help uncover more secrets scattered around the map.<br></p><p>It’s a fantastic game that scratches that <em>Zelda </em>itch while offering a completely different experience. The one caveat is that currently, it’s only available on Steam, but if you have access to a PC and are looking for something a little different after <em>Echoes of Wisdom, Minishoot’ Adventures </em>should be at the top of the list.</p></div><div><p>In <em>Zelda </em>games, you usually spend just as much time physically fighting enemies as you do mentally trying to overcome the games’ many puzzles. This is a major part of the franchise’s appeal and key to its longevity, but after spending hours thinking through Echoes of Wisdom’s many in-game problems, you may want to give your brain a rest. Luckily, Nintendo has you covered with <em>Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition</em>.</p><p>As this is a Musuo Game, the only thinking you’re doing here is wondering what character you should mow down armies with. If you’re unfamiliar with the genre, <em>Hyrule Warriors </em>has you pick a hero (or villain) from <em>Zelda</em> history and take on countless mobs of enemies. There are no dungeons to explore, or secrets to uncover, only large-scale combat. After you most likely had countless echoes destroyed during your playthrough of <em>Echoes of Wisdom, </em>getting to destroy someone else’s minions will be a nice change of pace. As an added bonus, you can also play as Zelda herself, if her solo outing caused you to fall in love with the character even more.<br></p><p>There is a successor titled <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, but given its ties to the <em>Breath of the Wild </em>timeline, and the original’s focus on the entire series, it’s not quite as good of a fit. </p></div><div><p>The <em>Zelda </em>series has inspired many imitators of varying quality. While some of these games miss what people love about the iconic franchise, <em>Death’s Door </em>is not one of them. The indie title has you step into the talons of a crow who works as a grim reaper, gathering the souls of those whose time has come. On paper, it seems very different from Nintendo’s series which usually stars an elf-boy, but the gameplay loop is incredibly similar, making it a perfect fit for those who just wrapped up <em>Echoes of Wisdom.</em>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Death’s Door</em> will have you explore dungeons, solve puzzles, and take on all manner of tough creatures, much like <em>Echoes of Wisdom. </em>However, <em>Death’s Door</em> doesn’t pull all its inspiration from one famous title, as it also incorporates elements from the wildly successful <em>Souls </em>games. While it is not as frustratingly difficult as FromSoft’s library, it does place a higher emphasis on combat than <em>Zelda</em> titles, allowing you to feel the rush of victory when you finally defeat a tough boss.<br></p><p>If <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>left you wanting a bit more of a challenge, <em>Death’s Door </em>might have what you’re looking for.</p></div><div><p>One of the first things you might notice about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is its creative art style. The clay-like animation is a feast for the eyes that has really only been seen in film and television. While few (if any games) provide an identical experience, <em>The Plucky Squire’s </em>is about as close as you can get. </p><p>The Devolver Digital-published title lets you play as characters from a storybook, and the 2D portions convey this fantasy world. As they transition into the real world, the graphics change from a cartoon design to a toy-like one, reminiscent of Zelda’s adventure. Outside of the visuals, the game doesn’t offer too much that hasn’t been seen before, but if your eyes are craving creativity, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> will make sure they get their fill.</p></div><div><p>One of the more interesting facets of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is how it’s basically a creature collector in disguise. Every time you defeat an enemy for the first time, you gain access to its Echo, opening up new strategies to tackle the game’s many obstacles. While <em>Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow</em> is not focused on gathering monsters to summon during combat, it does have a fairly similar take on collecting and using enemy abilities.</p><p>Most enemies in <em>Aria of Sorrow</em> have a special move that the protagonist Soma can gather and equip by defeating them. Unlike <em>Echoes, </em>it’s slightly more difficult to obtain these moves, since Konami’s title randomizes whether the slain monster will drop its ability, but the feeling it evokes is incredibly similar. You can spend hours combing Dracula’s Castle just to encounter every foe and add its powers to your toolbox.<br></p><p>As a Metroidvania, it’d also give you a bit of a break if you’re tired of the standard adventure fare after wrapping up <em>Echoes</em>. Best of all, the game is part of the <em>Castlevania: Advance Collection,</em> giving you two other fantastic titles for one reasonable price.</p></div><div><p>Okay, hear me out on this one. Yes, on the surface FromSoft’s highly acclaimed title has little to nothing in common with Nintendo’s latest outing in Hyrule. Everything from the tone to the gameplay to the difficulty is the complete opposite of the blissful experience <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> provides, which is what makes it the perfect palette cleanser.</p><p>There are also just enough minor similarities to help get you through the brutal gauntlet <em>Elden Ring</em> throws at you. You will have “Spirit Ashes” that you can obtain as you journey through the dreary, devastated Land Between to help you survive and defeat horrifying bosses. There’s also a familiar sense of exploration that includes finding secret dungeons scattered throughout the world, though <em>Elden Ring’s</em> is obviously much grander (and more dangerous).<br></p><p>Of course, this pick isn’t for everyone. But if you found the new <em>Zelda </em>a little too breezy and are looking for a completely different type of experience, <em>Elden Ring </em>will offer an experience unlike anything else. Also don’t be afraid to call on other players. It’s a feature of the game. It’s not cheating!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The time has come and 210 days after the initial service was supposed to shutter, Nintendo's 3DS and Wii U online servers are officially gone.

			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/?dm_i=2AEH,217EC,AMZC5B,7CM2V,1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voting is now open</a> for Ultimate Game of the Year and Best Game Adaptation in the Golden Joystick Awards. If you've been wanting an opportunity to vote for your favorite game this year, the Golden Joystick Awards is the perfect opportunity. There are plenty of categories to vote in this year, and you can choose from categories such as Best Indie Game, Studio of the Year, and New Best Audio Design. In total, there are<a href="https://wccftech.com/voting-is-now-open-in-the-42nd-golden-joystick-awards/"> 21 categories</a> to vote in this year, and as mentioned by Daniel Dawkins, this year has seen the most votes ever in their initial round of categories.</p>
<p>In a statement made by Daniel Dawkins, the Content Director of Games, Video, and Digital Events, he said that there has been "a record ten million+ votes in our initial round of categories... Ultimate Game of the Year is our most prestigious award which sits in its own voting window from November 4 to November 8, allowing the judging panel more time to assess the big winter releases."</p>
<p>Although this year has been somewhat quiet in terms of big releases, it has also seen the release of iconic games such as Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Tekken 8, and even games like Balatro and Satisfactory becoming big hits. In a world where people didn't have faith in the Silent Hill 2 remake, it was released and was done justice by Bloober Team and Konami, who knocked it out of the park. There are a lot of fantastic games to choose from on the nominations list for Ultimate Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards, and here are all of the nominees for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal Well</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24283482/valorant-is-winning-the-war-against-pc-gaming-cheaters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Multiplayer games on PC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21246229/pc-gaming-cheating-aimbots-wallhacks-hacking-tools-developer-response-problem">were a mess</a> back in 2020. Developers were struggling to respond to blatant cheating as more and more people turned to gaming at home during the covid-19 lockdowns. <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>, <em>PUBG</em>, and <em>Destiny 2 </em>were all riddled with people using aimbots to automatically shoot opponents or wallhacks to see everyone on a map.</p><p>Riot Games’ <em>Valorant </em>stood out because of its controversial and aggressive anti-cheat system, Vanguard, which had the potential to keep cheaters away. Now, four years later, it’s clear that Vanguard is winning the war against PC cheaters unlike any other anti-cheat system.</p><p>“We don’t see as many of the cheats that try to function on the machine and get access,” says Phillip Koskinas, director of anti-cheat on <em>Valorant</em>, in an interview with <em>The Verge</em>. “That has just become too much of a chore for cheat developers.”</p><p>Vanguard has made it far more difficult for PC gamers to use things like aimbots or wallhacks. This is partly due to a controversial kernel-level driver that is always running after you boot your PC. Riot’s Nick “Everdox” Peterson developed a system in Vanguard that detects when cheat engines are trying to get access to <em>Valorant</em>. “He came up with a fairly novel way to know that something has been mapped into kernel memory that isn’t supposed to be there,” says Koskinas. “The method is so cute that I can’t explain it because they’ll figure it out too quickly.”</p><p>The method sounds like it works similarly to when you crack open a piece of hardware and those little plastic clips fall off to let the device manufacturer know you have voided the warranty. “Once that’s done, we know that something happened and then we just wait to see something occur on <em>Valorant </em>that confirms you’re using it for cheating,” says Koskinas.</p><p>That’s led cheaters to move increasingly toward hardware to bypass systems. One of the most popular ways that cheat engines now hook into games involves direct memory access (DMA) with dedicated hardware. “You’re basically using a PCIe card to request reads of physical memory,” explains Koskinas. “They have developed techniques with these cards, the most popular one being Squirrel, to do a lot of traditional memory scanning but totally externally.”&nbsp;</p><p>That means a cheater will have a secondary PC that is scanning the memory space of <em>Valorant</em>, looking for player positions. A cheater can use this second PC with a monitor to display a special new radar that lets them know exactly where opponents are. It’s a devastating cheat in a game like <em>Valorant</em>, where players rely on tactics, positioning, and stealthiness to get an advantage.</p><div><figcaption><em>DMA cheating involves dedicated hardware.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Riot Games</cite></p></div><p>Riot has also developed methods to detect this new form of hardware-level DMA cheating thanks to Peterson. His invention essentially blocks reads to internal memory by suspicious devices. I recently ran into an issue with this DMA protection, as Vanguard started blocking my network card every time I loaded into a <em>Valorant</em> game. Riot has a list of hardware and firmware that is trusted, but the network card on my motherboard was using a method that looked suspicious. The issue was rectified within hours, but it showed how powerful Vanguard was that it could knock out my PC connectivity until I rebooted.</p><p>Most of the cheats for <em>Valorant</em> these days have been reduced to triggerbots, programs that use screen readers to look at the center of your monitor and then automatically shoot when a player’s crosshair is placed over an enemy. Koskinas says these account for “about 80 percent” of cheats in the game.</p><p>The addition of Vanguard to <em>League of Legends</em> earlier this year also <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-vanguard-x-lol-retrospective/">dramatically reduced scripters</a>, and the <em>League </em>team revealed in August that it had banned more than 175,000 accounts for cheating since Vanguard was introduced.</p><p>That’s encouraging for <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League</em>, but the situation isn’t as bright for other game developers that build their own anti-cheat systems. <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/windows-kernel-defenses-arent-enough-to-stop-a-lucrative-game-cheating-market-new-study">A recent study</a> from the University of Birmingham revealed that cheats for Activision’s <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em> remain accessible and affordable, and that Activision’s Ricochet anti-cheat falls short against more sophisticated cheats. Activision even had to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272984/activision-anti-cheat-hack-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-warzone">fix an anti-cheat hack</a> in <em>Warzone </em>and <em>Modern Warfare III</em> that led to legitimate players getting banned.</p><p>“Ricochet has talented individuals on the team, but they clearly do not have enough funding or freedom,” says <a href="https://x.com/zebleerpo">zebleer</a>, the developer behind Phantom Overlay — one of the most popular cheat engines for games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and more. “<em>Call of Duty</em> is overrun with cheaters. They are implementing quick fixes. They are not implementing things they should be implementing likely because Activision won’t let them.”</p><p>Zebleer thinks Vanguard is clearly winning against cheaters, thanks to the anti-cheat team having funding, talent, and freedom. Riot has hired engineers that have developed cheat engines in the past, including Koskinas, who developed and sold cheats more than 15 years ago to help fund his academic career.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the researchers at the University of Birmingham agree that <em>Valorant</em> has the best anti-cheat system. It was ranked at the top of the anti-cheat pile, followed by <em>Fortnite</em>, which also uses a kernel-level system. <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, <em>Battlefield 1</em>, and <em>Team Fortress 2</em> were ranked at the bottom.</p><p>The researchers also highlighted weaknesses in Windows protections that allow cheat software to inject itself into the kernel, just like malware does. After the devastating CrowdStrike incident, Windows kernel access has become a hot topic as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242947/microsoft-windows-security-kernel-access-features-crowdstrike">Microsoft is increasingly looking at ways</a> to help CrowdStrike and other security vendors operate outside of the Windows kernel.</p><p>Riot is looking to Microsoft to help secure <em>Valorant </em>further. “Microsoft got a lot more proactive about revoking the certificates for drivers that were malicious,” says Koskinas. “We kind of chase what Windows is willing to do, so if they start requiring virtualization-based security to be on, or hardware-enforced stack protection, or hypervisor code integrity, we will leverage those features that protect Windows for us and just require them to be on and recede from the kernel space.”</p><p>Vanguard will soon only start when the game launches, provided you’re using all of the latest Windows 11 security features, instead of being always-on after boot. That should help with some of the privacy concerns, too.</p><p>Riot’s focus for anti-cheat is on Windows right now, and there are no plans for Linux support with <em>Valorant </em>or <em>League of Legends</em>. While the Steam Deck supports some anti-cheats, developers like Riot are increasingly shying away from Linux. “You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,” says Koskinas. “You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.”</p><p>Respawn just <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat">dropped support in <em>Apex Legends</em></a>, citing similar concerns to Riot about cheating. Epic Games also refuses to support <em>Fortnite </em>on Steam Deck / Linux <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">due to a lack of users</a>. “Imagine if Steam Deck just has the security handled so we know it’s a genuine device, it’s fully attested, all these features are enabled, we’d be like cool, go game, no problem,” says Koskinas.</p><p>While Riot seems to be on top of traditional PC cheating, it may have to contend with AI-powered cheating soon. That could come from dedicated hardware like <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/monitors/msis-ai-powered-gaming-monitor-helps-you-cheat-at-league-of-legends-looks-great-doing-it">MSI’s monitor that helps you cheat</a> in <em>League of Legends</em> or screen readers that get increasingly complex. Riot is particularly concerned with image reading. “That is where all cheating is heading,” says Koskinas. “We’ve done a lot of research into what human mouse and keyboard input looks like, but it is a concern.”</p><p>One possible future could see AI cheats and AI detection battling against each other in a virtual war. “We’re at a disadvantage, honestly. [AI models] can learn what human input looks like,” says Koskinas. <em>Valorant </em>is winning the war right now, but AI could reset the playing field of this ongoing cat-and-mouse game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While we're getting a Gears Of War prequel in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears Of War: E-Day</a>, this does mean that Gears Of War 6 is yet to be a thing. In a recent episode of IGN's Podcast Unlocked, former Gears Of War director and current Diablo 4 lead Rod Fergusson revealed what his plans were for Gears 6 when he left. In short, he was going to take the game to space. Righto.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>When asked for his thoughts on Gears Of War going down the prequel route, Fergusson said that it was ultimately a "really smart" decision, despite not being in line with his original plans for Gears 6. He was then, of course, asked what those plans were.</p>

<p>"I was just getting us off Sera, so Gears 6 was to leave Sera," Fergusson said - Sera being the planet that Gears is set in, all Locusted up and very much in a bad spot. Following up on this, he talked about how the story would be centred around the Union of Independent Republics rocket technology glimpsed in Gears 5.</p><p>"We were sort of laying the seeds and the groundwork that in taking over that UIR territory, we've adopted their space program," Fergusson said. "So what I wanted to do with Gears 6 is take you off Sera to encounter what that could mean to the rest of the galaxy or, at least, the rest of the solar system. Not that you'd be hopping [between planets], but... it was old, Russian-era, sputnik-type tech, so we weren't going to start Mass Effect-ing this. It was really about, 'let's get you to a new place to encounter what this looks like.'"</p>
<p>While I do think the Gears story needs a shake up, I don't know if the above "we're shipping off elsewhere" approach would have tied things together well. If anything needs changing about Gears it's surely the characters. I wish the series would drop the dull JD Fenix and co, and give us a more interesting roster without leaving Sera. Maybe they're not even COGs. Maybe we lean heavily into the survival horror that the original did so well? There's so much more to mine in Sera, I think, before you start introducing aliens.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/sony-confirm-the-55-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-for-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony has confirmed the full list of games that will be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced when the mid-generation high-powered console launches later this week. While many were already known, it’s now fully confirmed that 55 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> games will take advantage of the PS5 Pro hardware.</p>
<p>What Sony has not detailed is the specific enhancements that each game is using. The PS5 Pro can be used in a number of ways, with Sony talking up the ability to combine the commonly seen 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes on PS5, giving Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates. Alternatively, developers could lean in on using the beefier GPU to push ray traced graphics. And across the board, games can use PSSR for hardware upscaling that’s of a higher quality than FSR 2.</p>


<p>But again, all of this will be on a game-by-game basis and used in different ways by different developers.</p>
<p>Here’s the 55 games that will be enhanced on day one.</p>

			<p>A new update for Lords of the Fallen is launching today, thanks to creators CI Games and HEXWORKS. With this update comes a brand new tutorial, updates to the Umbral system, and some gameplay balancing to provide a smoother experience for those who are getting stuck into the game. In addition, Update 1.6 for Lords of the Fallen adds the PS5 Pro enhancement update, which provides a ton of graphical improvements for those who plan on picking up the game. One of the most critical parts of the update, other than the graphical improvements, is the enhanced onboarding and tutorial experience, which is provided to newcomers after they receive feedback from veteran players.</p>
<p>With the gameplay and performance enhancements for the PS5 Pro, it adds a 40% increase in pixel density, with an enhanced Performance Mode that means the game will run at 4K60 based on 1440p, and the Quality Mode will run at a native 4K30. The nitty-gritty of these enhancements was already covered prior and you can read all of that info on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-lords-of-the-fallen-enhancements-revealed-more-updates-planned-sequel-teased/">this post</a>.</p>
<p>To celebrate this major update, the standard version of Lords of the Fallen will be on a 50% discount on Steam from 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT through to November 11, costing $29.99. As stated above, the onboarding system is now a lot more gradual and kinder to allow players to get used to the ebb and flow of Lords of the Fallen. This includes the Umbral Lamp capabilities, as well as better navigation through the tutorial area, which previously was tripping players up and made it difficult to get to grips with the traversal system.</p>
<p>One of the most highly requested features for this update was to give players more time to thoroughly explore Umbral, the second realm that you could hop into and explore, which ran alongside the core world. There have been some changes to Umbral to make it a bit more accessible overall, which includes making the soundscapes subtler, as well as adjustments to the enemy spawn curve to improve the overall pacing of the secondary realm and a reduced vignette effect, which was previously quite significant and could smother some of the details of the Umbral Realm.</p>
<p>This update for Lords of the Fallen is available now on Steam, the Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 and will be available for the PS5 Pro as of November 7, with the all-new graphical enhancements as listed in their announcement.</p>
<p>If you want to explore the patch notes' nitty-gritty and what else was changed besides these significant factors, they have uploaded the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1501750/announcements" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full patch notes</a>, which tell you what you can expect from Lords of the Fallen now in update 1.6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/discussing-queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-standalone-expansion-new-princesses<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess"><em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>, a deckbuilding card game from designer Kyle Shire and publisher Darrington Press, they’re back again for a standalone that doubles as an expansion; <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02324209-a2e3-4a29-9940-d2c9418e30b1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems"><em>Queen By Midnight: Quarter Past</em></a>. Last week we got to sit down with Shire and Alex Uboldi, Game Production Manager at Darrington Press, to talk about the new expansion including the new playable Princesses, how they balanced each character, and whether any more ideas are bouncing around in Shire’s Head.</p>

<p>Before hopping into the interview it’s important to explain that <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is a deckbuilding game where players take on the role of Princesses fighting for a chance to become Queen. Spend Clout to purchase cards from your character deck, or the shared bazaar, to build up your strength and defeat all of the other princesses before the clock strikes midnight.</p>

<h2>The Inception And Collaboration Behind <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></h2>

<p>To begin our interview Shire introduced himself and the history of development for<em> Queen By Midnight.</em> “The TLDR is wayback in the day I had this weird idea for a card game that I had kicking around for a very long time. I was working full time for a company that rhymes with shmeshminima and didn’t really think anything was going to come from [<em>Queen By Midnight]</em> and when shmeshminima went shmesmwaway I had a bunch of time on my hands and I needed to fill it with something to do. This game became my reason to get out of bed in the morning for the longest time.”</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//y8Vj_uhNKPA"></iframe></p>

<p>After some time, and returning to work, Shire explained that he had continued to work on it behind the scenes until the creation of Darrington Press as the game publishing arm of Critical Role was created. “Darrington Press came along I pitched it to Ivan and thank got someone as talented and wonderful as Alex Uboldi came along and managed to fish all of the good threads out of my tangled mess and managed to make a really great game, and now another one.”</p>

<p>Uboldi hopped in to offer his side of this meeting “When I started at Darrington Press one of the first projects that was handed to me was the original <em>Queen By Midnight</em>. I took it and I played it with a bunch of different groups and every group I played it with loved the game”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every group I played it with loved the game so I’m like ‘Ok, there’s something special here’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was a lot of my job to basically help develop the art, the graphic design, go through all of the cards and make sure there was consistency,” Alex spoke further on his input to the creation of the finished product that we know today. “Basically it was bringing Kyle’s vision to life in the most beautiful way possible.”</p>

<p>I asked Shire what it was like having that game, that he was working on in the backburner become such a success, he said “It’s been a dream come true. Any single time I am able to go into a game store and see my game, and talk to game store owners and people playing it, and get their feedback there’s no greater feeling.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love hearing all the stories of people saying ‘I won with this character, and I really want to try these other characters’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shire and Uboldi shared a common appreciation of hearing peoples stories of winning the game. Whether it be a slow burn through the game, taking out specific Princesses immediately, or using an ability to steal everyone’s Clout etc.</p>

<p>Uboldi admitted “Those stories of people playing the game, that’s why I really do this.”</p>

<h2>How To Build A Princess</h2>

<p>When Shire brought the game to Uboldi and the Darrington Press team he already had a lot of ideas for the Princesses, how they would perform uniquely, and what kind of personality they would have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=M0jQriZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=VjnhS9aK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Azil With A Z is a new Princess for <em>Quarter Past</em></figcaption></figure><p>“We did a lot of working together to make sure the Princesses felt like they were their identities, they developed in cool and interesting ways. Neither of us expected as we were bouncing ideas off each other that these Princesses would develop into fully fledged characters that both of us are happy with.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the expansion Uboldi explained that the process was very similar “We wanted to make the expansion for this game because we love this world and we want to see more from it. Kyle laid out all of the design for the four new pricesses.” At that time Shire already had ideas for the vibes of each of these new Princesses as well as their mechanics to make them a unique play experience at the table.</p>



<p>Four new Princesses have been added as part of <em>Quarter Past</em>; Elise LeKraken, Azil With A Z, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar.</p>

<p>Talking on the inspirations for these characters Shire explained that "if Ursula is to Devine, then you will have Elise LeKraken to Monet X Change. Dialing back to the original conceit behind Ursula and making that the focal point for our mermaid princess is just absolutely inspired."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more on the mechanics and gameplay style for each of these new Princesses you can check out our full review of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Azil With A Z is our wonderful nod to Alice in Wonderland. Our absurdist and surreal princess. Her whole vibe is that she's the only princess who has access to all three classes. I always tell people that she's the chaos character, if you're not interested in winning but want to cause a bunch of chaos you've got to play Azil."</p>

<p>Uboldi continued describing the characters talking about Qasima Al-Basar "who is our Princess Jasmine meeds Aladdin analog. By day she's a princess and by night she's a vigilante who protects her kingdom personally. We wanted to create a character who felt like she hed a lot of tools for espionage, but if she needs to she doles out great damage."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=4FAHv1II 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=tEXcy-me 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Princess has their own unique deck and playstyle</figcaption></figure><p>The last of the new characters is Kahurere Skyfisher who doesn't want to be Queen, but she wants to bring the whole system down. "She is Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia meets Moana. Because she doesn't have this grand kingdom she has to use more covert means. Her mechanic is laying traps for all the other Princesses. They can either keep the traps in their hand to be a dead card or play the trap to draw another card, but the trap will do something to help Skyfisher"</p>

<p>This deck is all about the other players making choices to have benefits together, or working against one another. Uboldi explained that what drew him to liking this character was that it's very "Interactive. It lets you talk to the whole table and it involves everyone and that's where the game is it's most fun"</p>

<p>While all four of these characters have their own unique mechanics Shire did explain that they designed each to be a far more aggressive character, making big moves quickly.</p>

<h2>There Might Be Two Lost Princesses?</h2>

<p>Interestingly when talking about how he came up with the original concepts for the Princesses that the first game would have twelve Princesses. "So I had cooked up rough ideas for 12 princesses, eventually I thought it was madness and cut it down to six that I felt like were the six most well baked out of them."</p>

<p>From the other six they were included in Shire's original draft of the first game for potential expansions and four of those are what we can now play. When asked if we would see these two final Princesses Shire said "I don't know, we'll have to figure that out, I have an idea but we'll see…" as Uboldi shrugged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=h3MVrdxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=yACaCTQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the full clocktower <em>Quarter Past</em> tracks the game with this more portable alternative</figcaption></figure><h2>Creating Balance Across The Lands</h2>

<p>As each Princess has their own unique deck and you can now play with up to ten Princesses I was curious to understand how they approached balancing so many characters. Having already created the prior six helped them have a good baseline. Uboldi explained that "We looked at the original princesses and the baseline power level. We scaled everything to match that power level, but because we were making these changes to the core deck it changes the dynamic of these princesses to be much more aggressive."</p>

<p>By not having the ability to block an attack, it allowed them to design the pricesses to be more aggressive knowing that they're also more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>"Against each other they felt very balanced, but against the Core Set Princesses there was interesting gameplay for the Princesses who are holding off an assault and trying to go over the top or Princesses who are trying to race down their opponents."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=vni-9QJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=6ECpO2BL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This expansion also contains errata cards for the base version so you can play it in it's 'best' form</figcaption></figure><h2>Expansion As Well As Standalone</h2>

<p>Many board games when expanding a roster of playable characters would simply release a character expansion and move on. For <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> I was impressed that not only was this four new playable characters that interact with one another but that it came with all that that you need to play it on it's own.</p>

<p>Uboldi explained that for Darrington Press they understood that the base game retailing at $70 that was a high price point for something you might not like. "We designed <em>Quarter Past</em> as a great entry place for newer players"</p>

<p>"We really wanted it to work well on it's own, we even designed the Princesses and Bazaar cards to be simpler but mechanically deep to make this as approachable for a new entry player as possible."</p>
