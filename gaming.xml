Mantic Games and Kodansha Ltd will help adapt the iconic cyberpunk sci-fi series, beloved for its blend of worldbuilding, existential philosophy, and cybernetic technology, to the gaming table.</p><h2>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG Announcement</h2><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG will adapt the world of danger, espionage, and artificial intelligence found in the original manga, created by legendary mangaka Shirow Masamune.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The game will feature a bespoke RPG game system created by a team of acclaimed designers, including the legendary Alessio Cavatore (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow"><em>Bolt Action</em></a>) and award-winning writer Zak Barouh (<em>Animon Story</em>). The system will combine fast-paced, narrative-driven mechanics, with philosophical depth. A fitting mix, given the source material.</p><p>The influence Ghost in the Shell has had on cyberpunk sci-fi cannot be understated. The manga pushed the visual identity of cyberpunk dystopias with it s juxtaposition of urban decay and futuristic technology. It explored ideas of transhumanism and identity in a world where consciousness can be downloaded.</p><p><em>Ghost in the Shell's </em>influence is so ubiquitous, from aesthetics to themes, it can be found everywhere. From feature films like <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> to games like Mike Pondsmith's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk </em>TTRPG</a> or the iconic immersive sim, <em>Deus Ex</em>.</p><blockquote><p>“We’re absolutely thrilled to be bringing The Ghost in the Shell to the world of tabletop roleplaying” said Ronnie Renton, CEO of Mantic Games. “This is one of the most iconic and influential science fiction worlds ever created, and we’re honoured to be entrusted with the official license. Alessio and Zak have worked tirelessly to ensure every story told at the table feels true to the original manga, allowing players to live, think, and fight in the world of Major Kusanagi and the iconic Section 9.”&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is a departure from Mantic Games' past history of licensed work. Most of the licensed games they have produced are miniature-based tactical experiences like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/halo-flashpoint-war-games-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/walking-dead-all-out-war-comes-to-end" rel="nofollow"><em>The Walking Dead: All Out War</em></a>. That experience will undoubtedly be useful given the source material's history of gunfights and mech battles.</p><p>The <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> RPG is set to come out in Summer 2026.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-the-final-chapter-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-explained/</link>
            <guid>1439812</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is finally here, and the twisted story of murderous toys continues. However, before it arrived, plenty of fans were theorising that this could be the final Chapter in the series, with a natural conclusion seemingly drawing near. </p>







<p>Well, now that the game is in the hands of the masses, the answer is pretty clear, and it seems like the fanbase is pretty divided on the outcome. If you’re wondering whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/poppy-playtime/" id="1176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Poppy Playtime</a> will continue after Chapter 5, then you’re in the right place, as Insider Gaming has it all figured out.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-chapter-5-of-poppy-playtime-the-final-chapter">Is Chapter 5 Of Poppy Playtime The Final Chapter?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s not over yet. Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 is not the final chapter. Judging by the ending of Chapter 5, a sixth chapter is all but guaranteed.</strong></p>



<p>Without spoiling the ending, which raises even more questions, it’s clear that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mob-entertainment/" id="3160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mob Entertainment</a> aren’t quite ready to cut the cord and wrap up Poppy Playtime just yet.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-does-poppy-playtime-chapter-5-cost-price-explained/" id="177112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How Much Does Poppy Playtime Chapter 5 Cost? Price, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>For fans of the franchise, this is great news, as that means there is bound to be even more monstrous cuddly toys to evade and mysteries to uncover. But it also raises a new question: When will Chapter 6 be released? </p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-poppy-playtime-chapter-6-release">When Will Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 Release? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t let him catch you! Image by Mob Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Although it may be obvious that Poppy Playtime Chapter 6 is a given, no official confirmation of its existence has been made by Mob Entertainment. Therefore, there’s no official release date to share. </strong></p>



<p>However, chapters for Poppy Playtime have released fairly regularly, with a new one dropping pretty much every year since the franchise began back in 2021. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/best-horror-games-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 Best Horror Games Ever, From Resident Evil to Outlast</a></li>
</ul>







<p>With that in mind, it’s highly likely that Chapter 6 will be released sometime in 2027, though that’s purely speculation. The franchise missed a year of content back in 2023, so it’s not a guarantee, but that would imply that it’d arrive by 2028 at the absolute latest.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[After Working 80-Hour Weeks For Eight Years, Blue Prince Creator Says Next Game Probably Won't Be Quite As Ambitious]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-final-update-tonda-ros-interview/</link>
            <guid>1439797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>Blue Prince</em>, as outlined by our own Chris Person in <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review/"><u>fittingly meticulous detail</u></a>, is a marvel. It’s also a game whose ending has <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><u>proven elusive</u></a> both structurally and thematically. But there is a light at the end of the epically lengthy tunnel – at least for creator Tonda Ros.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked Ros at DICE in Las Vegas last week if <em>Blue Prince</em>’s brain-pulverizing labyrinth contained any remaining secrets, he reacted with a coy smile.</p><p>“[Players] have certainly mined it pretty well,” he told Aftermath. “Now, is that well enough? I’m gonna leave that for future generations to answer.”</p><p>But <em>Blue Prince</em> will get one last major update before Ros gracefully bows out.</p><p>“There is a little bit still coming that I’m working on – some final touches on the game before I button it up and move on to more projects,” he said. “So even if the people mining [for more secrets] currently turn up empty handed, there will at least be something on the horizon that they can look forward to.”</p><p>This is not to say that Ros feels like he asked players to solve a puzzle sans all the pieces at launch. His goal was to release something that felt complete in a sense that harked back to bygone days; updates, in his mind, are about polish and clarity.</p><p>"I really wanted to get it all in for launch, and I feel like that was my ultimate desire, because I really like the old-school games where they put it out there, and that's the game,” he said. “It's definitive from day one. It's on a disc, and it's timeless. Obviously we have a big temptation in the modern world: You can continually update and tinker with your things, and oftentimes maybe tinker too much, and you'll start dividing your audience. So I really tried my hardest, but it's my first game. Ultimately, it wasn't worth the crunch. ... [I decided to] focus on bugs and catch up on my own time afterwards. But it's gonna be one big final update, and then it's gonna be final forever."</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em>’s last update, Ros said, will not stray from the game’s current path; the plan is just to refine what’s already there.</p><p>"Nothing I'm going to do will fundamentally change any of the narrative according to the structure,” said Ros. “It's mostly just polish details. There'll be a couple more cinematics because I didn't have time to do all the cinematics I planned. I really want to put everything I wanted into the game. ... So I'm gonna finish my vision on the cinematics, and that'll provide more details for people. But fundamentally, I made sure from day one that all the puzzles were in the game – all the narrative and overall structure."</p><p>There’s a reason Ros wasn’t able to include absolutely everything he’d mapped out in <em>Blue Prince</em>’s release version: He was already working himself to the bone.</p><p>"I was working, I think, 80 hours a week for eight years straight," he said.</p><p>Whatever comes after, he added, will necessarily dial things back at least<em> a bit</em> in terms of ambition.</p><p>"<em>Blue Prince</em> will likely be the most ambitious game I ever make, because I don't think I physically can do this again,” Ros said. “It was an incredibly long journey, so it might take as much time [to make my next game], but I certainly won't be working as hard. ... That's just not sustainable now. It's a young man's game."</p><p>Still, Ros, a filmmaker who decided to devote eight years of his life to his first major video game project, hasn’t burnt himself out on games yet.&nbsp;</p><p>“The recognition [<em>Blue Prince</em> has received] certainly helps the decision, but I think I did fall in love with game development,” said Ros, who had just received the DICE game design and independent game awards. “I come from a filmmaking background, but game development just suits me really well. It’s fun to take your time and to be able to fulfill your vision without the stress of running a set. I just kind of love it right now, so I’ll continue doing it as long as I find it enjoyable.”</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending/"><div><p>Does Blue Prince Never End? - Aftermath</p><p>There is so much more to Blue Prince than its stated goal.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Publisher <strong>CI Games</strong> and developer <strong>Hexworks</strong> have released the minimum and recommended PC system requirements for <strong>Lords of the Fallen 2</strong>, the sequel to 2023's Soulslike game. </p>



<p>The specs are listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the game's Epic Games Store page</a> and match the previous game's CPU and RAM requirements. However, <strong>the GPU requirements have increased</strong>: from Lords of the Fallen's GTX 1060/RX 590 and RTX 2080/RX 6700 to Lords of the Fallen 2's RTX 2060/RX 5700 and RTX 3080/RX 6800 XT. As a reminder, the game is powered by <strong>Epic's Unreal Engine 5</strong>, just like the previous installment.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Spec</th><th>Minimum</th><th>Recommended</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OS</strong></td><td>Windows 11</td><td>Windows 11</td></tr><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>Intel i5-8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</td><td>Intel i7-8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Memory</strong></td><td>12 GB RAM</td><td>16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</td><td>NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Login Required</strong></td><td>Epic ID</td><td>Epic ID</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Audio Language</strong></td><td>English</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Text Languages</strong></td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td><td>English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Russian</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced in June 2024</a> as an <strong>Epic Games Store exclusive</strong> for PC. However, earlier this week, CI Games CEO <strong>Marek Tyminski</strong> <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/2023059329600119256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seemed to tease that this could change</a>, <strong>suggesting a Steam launch on day one</strong>.</p>



<p>We'll see. On another note, this afternoon, Ryan Hill (Creative Strategist at CI Games) noted that the reception to <a href="https://wccftech.com/bolder-braver-bloodier-ci-games-digs-into-lords-of-the-fallen-2-combat-in-new-developer-deep-dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last week's gameplay deep dive</a> has been "<strong>incredible</strong>".</p>



<p><em>I'm seeing the age-old 'blame the customer' rhetoric popping up again in the games industry. No gamer wants to waste time, money or effort, just to be disappointed by a gameplay experience. It is nearly always the game at fault.</em></p>



<p><em>It would have been very easy for us to 'blame the customer' in 2023 when Lords of the Fallen launched. Instead, we took it on the chin, rolled our sleeves up, and released 70+ updates. Three years later, and we've just revealed the first alpha footage of Lords of the Fallen 2. And the response has been incredible. We listened, we acted. And guess what? It worked. But we're far from done yet. Gamers want good games. End of.</em></p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen 2 will be released this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/</link>
            <guid>1439782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The new <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/presentation-the-state-of-video-gaming-in-2026"><strong>State of Video Gaming 2026 Report</strong> </a>from <strong>Matthew Ball</strong>, chief executive officer at <strong>Epyllion,</strong> is now available, and as usual, there are more than a few solid insights and takeaways to make note of. Like how software sales for the global video game market in 2025 rose by <strong>5.3%</strong> to a staggering <strong>$195.6 billion</strong>, but at the same time, funding from private investors hit another major dip, dropping by <strong>55%.</strong></p>



<p>Console software sales also hit an all-time high, recovering from the post-COVID slump to hit <strong>$41.6 billion</strong> in spending, a <strong>2.3% increase</strong> compared to the highs of the 2020 pandemic. That said, the majority of that spending has gone to <strong>platform services</strong>, which would include things like <strong>PlayStation Plus,</strong> <strong>Xbox Game Pass</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch Online</strong>. </p>



<p>Actual game sales and transactions were down nearly <strong>11%</strong> compared to last year, which is a tangible example of why subscription services have become so important for platform holders. That's why, while the entire industry faces concerns about hardware sales, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-memory-shortages-ps5-ps5-pro/">Sony in particular is less concerned</a> due to its software revenue. It's also why the company plans <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increases-monetizing-install-base/">to lean more on its current install base,</a> and why we could likely see a price increase on PS Plus if the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dram-nand-shortages-will-extend-beyond-2030-warns-phison-ceo/">memory crisis continues to worsen</a>.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, when comparing PC gaming to console gaming, PC gaming not only didn't have to endure a post-COVID slump, but PC content sales have grown by <strong>30% since 2020</strong>.</p>



<p>It's also worth noting that a huge chunk of that spending and growth comes from players in China, who account for <strong>20% of global player spending.</strong> But even without factoring in the spending that comes from China, the PC market still sits above the console market growth by a solid <strong>$6.7 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>The lack of investment coming into the industry, however, continues to have a major impact on the industry. Outside of some of the biggest companies, like when <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-boss-christoph-hartmann-departs-amidst-mass-16000-layoff/">Amazon lays off thousands of employees at once</a>, layoffs like what we see from studios like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckreation-three-fields-entertainment-staff-at-risk-layoffs/">Three Fields Entertainment</a></strong> don't just come from disappointing game sales. A lack of private investment means that smaller teams like Three Fields can't survive if their projects aren't huge hits.</p>



<p>Another side-effect of this that's noted in the report is that, where possible, studios will look to outsource more of the development process to try and keep internal costs down. And while PC gaming continues to outpace console gaming, one platform that is growing, which Ball also believes will become one of the industry's biggest factors, is <strong>Roblox</strong>.</p>



<p>The platform was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/">top-played games in 2024 and 2025</a>, and reached <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-sets-record-concurrent-users-gaming-platform/">a staggering <strong>47.3 million concurrent users</strong></a> in August 2025. That said, as big as Roblox is, it'll be interesting to see how much the platform continues to be impacted <a href="https://wccftech.com/texas-attorney-general-sues-roblox-claims-it-puts-pedophiles-and-profits-over-safety-of-children/">by the legal efforts against the company</a>, as it has earned a reputation for a lax approach to child safety on the platform. Now, at least, the company is trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-will-require-age-verification-with-facial-recognition-to-unlock-chat/">improve its ability to protect children on the platform</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Usually, pro esports players are hesitant to change up their peripherals, especially before a big tournament. Getting comfortable with a new keyboard or mouse can be especially daunting when, y’know, your entire job is on the line. But a new mouse is making waves in a </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2</span></i><span> tournament as players try to get any edge they can in the team-based shooter.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Logitech only just released the X2 Superstrike and the new $180 gaming mouse is already becoming a fast favorite for competitive </span><i><span>Counter-Strike 2 </span></i><span>players. As pointed out by </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-technology-is-just-better-why-counter-strike-pros-are-loving-a-new-mouse-that-reduces-the-time-it-takes-to-fire-their-first-shot-by-up-to-30ms"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, 13 of the ongoing PGL Cluj-Napoca tournament’s remaining 50 players have all switched over to the X2 Superstrike. Apparently no one wants to prioritize familiarity over potentially losing out on reaction time.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Logitech’s website boasts that the mouse is a “breakthrough in ultra-low click-latency technology.” It uses something called a Haptic Inductive Trigger System (or HITS) instead of traditional switches to allow users to click with a lot less travel time while receiving customizable haptic feedback. Basically, it saves players even more time from the second they try to fire off a gun in an online multiplayer shooter to the instant the hit registers on the enemy player.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PART 1. Here is my feedback on this mouse. It's a game changer. NO, you won't become good with this NO, but yes, the click response is faster, which I really like, and it's really great and excellent of Logitech to have created this technology. Part 2 below 🔽 <a href="https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3">https://t.co/RNQIk6L4q3</a> <a href="https://t.co/l6XvScTLUO">pic.twitter.com/l6XvScTLUO</a></p> <p>— Polo922 (@Polo922_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Polo922_/status/2022435891852292374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>How much time, exactly? Up to 30 milliseconds. That’s 20 milliseconds less than the average time it takes a human to blink their eye. The <span>X2 Superstrike effectively gets you a half-blink advantage over the competition if you’re skilled enough to need it.&nbsp;</span><span>It’s probably not beneficial to casual players, but for competitive players, a more responsive mouse that can fire just a few ticks earlier can be a game-changer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>, Logitech apparently sped up the technology’s development after receiving encouragement from pros who tested it. This isn’t really a surprise, however, considering the fact that the X2 is basically a fancier spiritual successor to the Superlight 2, which was already a top pick for </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros.</span></p>

 <p><span>We do know that some (if not all) of these players had access to the mouse in advance. Kscerato already won the MVP award at the Thunderpick World Championships using the mouse back in October. Still, it’s pretty impressive to see a mouse taking over a competition so quickly, especially considering that a few high-ranking teams like the Mongolz, Team Falcons, and FURIA now have half their players using the mouse.</span></p> <p><span>The X2 Superstrike is obviously a new favorite in the </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>community, but I’m personally curious to see if the mouse spreads to other esports. Based on its newfound status as a hot commodity among </span><i><span>CS2 </span></i><span>pros, I could see it becoming the default gaming mouse in other competitive games like </span><i><span>Valorant </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>League </span></i><span>as well—that is, if it isn’t banned.</span></p>

<p>Another first for CM Punk is now checked off the list: his indie wrestling theme song will be included in the next WWE video game.</p>



<p>Today, everyone knows that “Cult of Personality” by Living Colour is the song that plays whenever CM Punk heads to a WWE ring. However, there was a time when “Miseria Cantare: The Beginning” by AFI blared over PA systems as CM Punk made his way to the squared circle in promotions like Ring of Honor and Ohio Valley Wrestling.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a>, young CM Punk is a playable character, and not only have they included his Ring of Honor attire from the early 2000s, but the AFI song is also in the game. This news was reported first by <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/wwe-2k26-myrise-lead-talks-this-years-campaign-and-why-fan-favorite-jordynne-grace-is-taking-on-the-role-of-a-villain-we-work-so-far-ahead-from-wwe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TechRadar</a>.</p>

<p>Amy Rose has found her voice.</p>



<p>Amy Rose was teased at the end of the third Sonic film. Now, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">the Hollywood Reporter</a> has shared that Kristen Bell has been tapped to voice everyone’s favorite pink Hedgehog in Sonic 4, coming in March 2027. She joins the cast, which includes Jim Carrey, Ben Schwartz, James Marsden, and more.</p>



<p>Past Sonic movies have also featured Idris Elba voicing Knuckles the Echidna and Keanu Reeves voicing Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>







<h2 id="h-kristen-bell-s-history-in-top-ips">Kristen Bell’s History in Top IPs</h2>



<p>Kristen Bell’s most famous voice-acting role is likely Princess Anna in Disney’s Frozen films. However, she’s also known for voicing Lucy in the first Assassin’s Creed game. Now, she adds Amy Rose to the list.</p>



<p>At this time, plot details are scarce regarding the fourth Sonic movie. Amy Rose is best known as the franchise’s most established female character. If you ask Amy, she’s the love of Sonic’s life, but he’s never fully committed to that.</p>







<h2 id="h-amy-rose-s-history-in-sonic-the-hedgehog">Amy Rose’s History in Sonic the Hedgehog</h2>



<p>The character debuted in Sonic CD in 1993 but became a focal point of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog/" id="570">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> franchise with Sonic Adventure in 1999. </p>



<p>The character has regularly appeared in games since then, sometimes as a playable character. She’s also been a key player in the Sonic X, Sonic Prime, and Sonic Boom cartoons.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sega/" id="52202">Sega </a>announced plans to bring other IPs from the ’90s into animation.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-starfield-2-shut-down-and-promises-more-news/</link>
            <guid>1439767</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bethesda/" id="419">Bethesda Game Studios</a> has put a spanner in the works of everyone hoping for a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/starfield/" id="307">Starfield</a> resurgence by closing down claims that ‘Starfield 2.0’ is on the horizon (or the <em>event </em>horizon? Space joke).</p>



<p>Recently, those who attended behind-closed-doors sessions hosted by Bethesda were quickly taking to social media to pledge the imminent evolution of the game, but Todd Howard wants to set expectations straight. He has done so in a new interview by stressing that everything <strong>going forward </strong>will be about Starfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-bethesda-game-studios-is-focusing-big-time-on-starfield">Bethesda Game Studios is Focusing Big Time on Starfield</h2>



<p>Starfield hasn’t exactly had the most love from Bethesda Game Studios. The game dropped in September 2023, and despite claims of a yearly DLC release schedule, we’ve had just <strong>one </strong>expansion land – Shattered Space. That expansion was known about <strong>long before </strong>the game came out, but by today, the game’s second expansion hasn’t been unveiled by the company behind the space-faring RPG.</p>



<p>Like other Bethesda titles, Starfield has relied heavily on the modding community to keep the content flowing.</p>



<p>However, now that the Fallout TV show has wrapped and Bethesda is looking to make Fallout 76’s content updates less ambitious, more focus can be applied to Starfield. In a recent interview with Kinda Funny, that’s exactly what Howard alluded to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of Starfield content, we haven’t talked about it yet. The end of last year for us was prickly, for us – we have periods where we focus on IPs and franchises, and Fallout obviously dominated the fall and earlier this year, but you’ve seen it. </strong></p>



<p><strong>And I can tell everybody we’re gonna be talking about it really soon. We’re moving into a phase where we’re going to be talking about Starfield and really show that in the right way.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then shut down the rumors and claims about Starfield 2.0, the sought-after next level of the sci-fi RPG that everyone believes would make it worth playing again.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>It is not Starfield 2.0 – I’ve seen some of that, and for expectation setting – I think it’s the kinda thing where – if you like Starfield, we think you’re going to love this. It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but you know ‘meta’ – using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t. </strong></p>



<p><strong>But if Starfield is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places – I don’t think it’s going to change that fundamentally, but if you’re someone who loves Starfield and we think, we’re really happy with it.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Starfield is in dire need of a resurgence, especially as we’re not getting a new Fallout game for many years and The Elder Scrolls 6 doesn’t seem to be surfacing any time soon. Once upon a time, Starfield was the most hotly anticipated game in the business, but now it feels ready to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Some older die-hards may have an original VB knocking around or might have sampled its monochrome delights sometime over the last 30 years, but for many players — especially in Europe, where the system never launched — this is likely their first taste of Nintendo's <em>other</em> Boy.</p>
<p>Yes, we all know this curio was a commercial failure, but its slight library still contains worthwhile experiences, and the promise of more games (including two that were completed but shelved and have languished in Nintendo's vault for three decades) makes NSO an ideal venue to dip into the catalogue without forking out for original hardware. Granted, at $99.99 / £66.99, the VB Switch accessory isn't cheap either, but an original Virtual Boy in decent, working order will set you back <em>a lot</em> more than that.</p>

            <guid>1439725</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sorry, folks, the rumored <em>Starfield 2.0 </em>update isn’t happening. While the 2023 space RPG is getting a big update in the near future, Bethesda’s creative director Todd Howard threw cold water on the rumors of a big 2.0-like overhaul for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em>.</a></p> <p>On February 18, <a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">as part of a larger interview with <em>Kinda Funny</em></a> about Bethesda and its games, Howard talked about what’s coming for <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-2-0-expansion-bethesda-ps5-2000654580"><em>Starfield</em></a>. As pointed out by host Greg Miller, he and other content creators had already seen the next big update as part of a preview event months ago, and he asked why that content was still under embargo. According to Howard, Bethesda was focused on <em>Fallout</em> and big <em>Fallout 76</em> updates last year and early this year because of the show. But now, the studio is refocusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-exploration-astronauts-moon-boring-1851786351"><em>Starfield</em></a>.</p>

 <p>“Obviously, we’ve been working on a lot of <em>Starfield</em> content…I can tell everybody we are going to be talking about [the new content] really soon,” said Howard.&nbsp;“We’re moving into a phase where we’re ready to talk about <em>Starfield</em>. And really show that in the right way, and what’s coming to the game. We’ve been doing a lot of work that we like a lot.”</p>  <h2><em>Starfield 2.0</em> isn’t happening</h2> <p>However, Howard made it clear that folks shouldn’t expect some grand overhaul of <em>Starfield</em>, bluntly telling Miller and viewers that the update is “not <em>Starfield 2.0</em>.”</p>

 <p>“You know, I’ve seen some of that, so for expectation-setting, I think it’s the kind of thing where if you love <em>Starfield</em>, we think you’re going to love this,” explained Howard. “It’s updates and things that change the game, not in an isolated way, but sort of meta. Using outer space and things in ways that we haven’t.”</p>

 <p>Howard also acknowledged that for people who didn’t like <em>Starfield</em>, this update likely won’t change that, adding: “But look, if <em>Starfield</em> is something that didn’t connect with you right away, or you bounced off it, or found it boring in places, I don’t think this is going to change that fundamentally.”</p> <p>When Miller pushed again for a timeframe on when to expect news of this new <em>Starfield</em> update, Howard would only offer up “Soonish.”</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, Howard said that Bethesda is a “relatively small” studio and that balancing all of its roughly 250 employees across <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744"><em>Fallout</em>, <em>Starfield</em>, and <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls</em></a> is challenging. But he wanted to make it clear that Bethesda isn’t done with <em>Starfield</em>.</p> <p>“We are doing more <em>Starfield</em> stuff coming up,” said Howard. “It’s something we see continuing for a while.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">Maybe that includes a PS5 port?&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>In a new interview with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>, Bethesda creative director Todd Howard explained that <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em></a> is a return to the kind of games the studio is known for and will be powered by a new version of Bethesda’s Creation Engine.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/sX4rKpB97L4">In the February 18 interview livestream</a>, Howard admitted to host Greg Miller that <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Fallout 76</em> were departures from the open-world RPGs fans “expect” from them. And with <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> it sounds like they are going back to that “classic” style.</p>

 <p>“In many ways<em>, Fallout 76</em> and <em>Starfield</em> are a little bit of a creative detour from kind of that classic <em>Elder Scrolls, Fallout</em>, where you are exploring a world in a certain way,” said Howard.</p> <p>“As we come back to <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> that we are doing now, we are coming back to that classic style that we’ve missed, that we know really, really well.”</p> <p>“We have a style of game we really, really like, that people expect from us, and there is a lot of innovation to be done there still, so when you step into a world you feel like you are experiencing it for the first time,” said Howard.</p>

 <p>“We’re happy with where [<em>Elder Scrolls 6</em>] is headed right now.”</p> <p>Howard also told Miller that the studio has been working hard on updating its internal engine, which has powered its past games, to help it do more with <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and future games.</p>

 <p>“We’ve spent the last several years bringing Creation Engine 2, which powers <em>Starfield</em>, up to Creation Engine 3, which is going to power <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and beyond.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">As for when to expect <em>Elder Scrolls 6,</em> which was announced over six years ago</a>, Howard was cagey as expected, saying that while the team was close to passing a “big milestone” and development was going well, it is “going to be a while yet” before the RPG is finished.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s almost the end of another week, and hopefully you’re ending it as strong as your streak is going right now (potentially). We’ve got another slammer of an NYT Connections puzzle to grind through today, but if you want to solve it as quickly as possible, just scroll down and pick out my best NYT Connections hints.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing lineup of the New York Times titles. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on desktop devices or in</span> a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words can have double meanings, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty, from least to most.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gamers Thought China Would Save Them With Cheap RAM But It’s Not That Simple]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ram-shortage-ai-pc-gaming-china-cxmt-2000670712</link>
            <guid>1439695</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a few months now, many gamers had seemingly pinned their hopes on a company in China to help <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">alleviate rising prices on RAM</a> resulting from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-steam-deck-is-still-out-of-stock-and-valve-says-get-used-to-it-2000669487">ongoing and worsening memory shortage</a> fueled by AI hyperscalers and tech giants. But while new tests show the Chinese-developed RAM is good for gaming, it’s unlikely to be the silver bullet many had hoped.</p> <p>Over on the (sighs) PC Master Race subreddit, one of the largest PC gaming communities on the internet, people have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1pdn11s/do_you_guys_think_cxmt_will_save_us/">talking about Chinese tech company CXMT</a> with some hoping that the DRAM maker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qxw0gj/cxmt_and_ymtc_ready_to_flood_the_world_with_ram/">could help produce more consumer RAM</a> while the bigger players, like Samsung, pivot to supporting companies hungry for parts and memory to power future AI data centers. The idea being that while the big RAM makers focus on that, CXMT will be here for the little guys, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">PC gamers</a>&nbsp;looking to upgrade their rigs without taking out a loan to do so.</p>

   <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qx42x7/cxmt_priced_32g_ddr43200_ecc_at_138_link_in/">CXMT 32GB DDR4 RAM reportedly selling for less than $150 online</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tech_x/comments/1qsuwbd/chinas_new_ram_company_cxmt_is_selling_ram_at_138/">caught the attention</a> of a lot of gamers. Even though DDR4 is older and slower than DDR5, it represented a more affordable option. (And considering the fact that DDR4 is also starting to sell out and see huge price increases, there is demand for it.) Would China save gamers? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qtsijj/is_china_the_one_that_is_going_to_save_us/">Memes were created suggesting this was the case.</a> But the reality isn’t so simple.</p> <h2>CXMT RAM is good for gaming, but…</h2> <p>First, the good news: RAM using CXMT chips is comparable in gaming performance to RAM sticks created by bigger-name companies like Samsung and SK Hynix. In a new and <a href="https://www.techspot.com/review/3089-ddr5-made-in-china/">comprehensive report</a>. <em>TechSpot </em>tested Kingbank-produced RAM containing CXMT bits against G.Skill RAM using SK Hynix memory. And the results in games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> were promising, with the cheaper Kingbank RAM performing within a few percentage points of the more expensive G.Skill RAM. In the current market, cheaper RAM performing this well really is good enough.</p>

  <p>Now, the bad news:&nbsp;In the last few weeks, CXMT RAM has gone up in price, something noted by <em>TechSpot</em> and others. The company can’t produce nearly as much as its bigger competitors, and it is likely raising prices as demand increases, shattering some gamers’ hopes that CXMT would be the hero they hoped for in the ongoing memory shortage.</p>

 <p>Another thing to note is that CXMT has been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News">essentially banned in the United States</a> for a few years now. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cxmt-ymtc-removed-from-pentagon-list-opening-door-for-chinese-dram-adoption/">And while there are signs that this might be changing soon</a>, especially with rumors that <a href="https://x.com/wccftech/status/2023756672175677891">Apple wants to cut a deal with CXMT</a> to help the tech giant fill in supply gaps, for the moment, CXMT is unlikely to flood the U.S. market.</p> <p>The other big problem is that CXMT has <a href="https://www.mk.co.kr/news/business/11957166">already committed to allocating around 20 percent of its production to creating memory for AI companies</a>. That doesn’t mean <a href="https://investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-announces-exit-crucial-consumer-business">CXMT is pulling a Micron and abandoning consumer RAM</a> anytime soon, but it is yet more evidence that China’s DRAM maker will noy be some PC gaming savior. “It’s over,” posted one person on Reddit to the news of CXMT pivoting. “Not even China gives 2 hoots about the retail market.”</p>

But there's even more in store for fans: those who preorder this version of the game also get an exclusive Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card as a bonus. That's quite a nice surprise alongside the game itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you can't wait to grab the Switch 2 version (and an extra Magic: The Gathering card), head to the links below to get your preorders in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth (Nintendo Switch 2)</h2><div id="235622"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235622" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (Switch 2) + MTG - Final Fantasy Promo Card</h3></p></div></span></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a56MWO?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0GM224VBV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z64XrY?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at GameStop</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBg3g?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Od0R?object_uuid=00d0d9ef-015f-4a08-aa43-a0093b725354&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See at Walmart</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">What's included in the box is, unfortunately, a Game-Key Card, meaning the actual game isn't loaded onto the cartridge. However, putting the cart in your Switch 2 does let you download the game and is required when you want to play it. It also lets you sell the game when you're done with it, which you can't do with a digital game code.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Preorder Bonuses</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as preorder bonuses go, the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy promo card is the most exciting one of the bunch. It features variant art of Zack Fair, drawn by Tetsuya Nomura, which you can see in the image above, and has identical abilities to the Zack Fair card found in the Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy set. This card is only available while supplies last, though, so it's well worth preordering the game now to make sure you get your hands on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the card, there's also a reversible inlay that comes with the physical edition of the game, and in-game items of a Posh Chocobo Summoning Materia, Armor: Shinra Bangle Mk. II, and Armor: Midgar Bangle Mk. II.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Is Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is the second game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>.

            <guid>1439674</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has started email users of its services that it is rolling out age verification for Ubisoft accounts, with limits coming in for social features so players can only interact with people on their friends list unless the account is verified. It does not look like it is worldwide but does affect countries where laws require age verification for people to access some content, including the UK with the introduction of the Online Safety Act. This move seems to be specifically about the UK</p>
<p>In the email I received, Ubisoft wrote, <em>“To keep our community safe and ensure age‑appropriate experiences for all players, Ubisoft is introducing a new age verification step for certain communication features. This update also helps us comply with the UK Online Safety Act.</em></p>


<div>
<h4><em>What is changing</em></h4>
<p><em>If your Ubisoft chat setting was previously set to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, it has now been switched to “<b>Friends Only</b>”. You can still chat freely with people on your friends list, but you’ll need to verify that you are&nbsp;<b>18 or older</b>&nbsp;to use text or voice chat with players outside your friends list.</em></p>
<p><em>This update applies to your experience on&nbsp;<b>PC and mobile</b>. On&nbsp;<b>console</b>, nothing changes: your platform settings continue to apply.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2><em>Why this is required</em></h2>
<p><em>This step helps us maintain a safe environment for all players and offer more tailored experiences while meeting UK regulatory requirements. Your privacy stays fully protected. Age verification is handled securely and Ubisoft does not store your identity documents. They are used only to confirm your age.</em></p>

</div>
<div>
<h4><em>How to verify your age</em></h4>
<p><em>You can complete the verification at any time from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/account/privacy-center/data-protection&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0caF7g4wSNpeNsZYgNEbwO">Privacy center</a> on the Ubisoft Account website. Simply switch your Voice &amp; Text Chat setting to “<b>Friends of Friends</b>” or “<b>Everyone</b>”, then follow the verification steps. You’ll only need to do this&nbsp;<b>once</b>. More details about age verification and how it works are available on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ubisoft.com/help/article/000116275&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1771525808296000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0DHYae_AQUQ6g5hGqaKyg0">Ubisoft Help</a>. Thank you for helping us keep our community safe and enjoyable for everyone.”</em></p>
<p>If you choose to verify your age to access text and voice chat with people that are not on your friend list Ubisoft is providing four ways to do this. The first is to use the Yoti Digital ID app through which you confirm your ID and get a digital ID that can be used for different services. The second is age estimation where you take a photo and software estimates your age. Ubisoft states that these photos are not store and are encrypted. The third way is to upload a photo of your ID and scan your face to confirm it matches. Again, Ubisoft says that none of this data is stored or shared. The final way is to do a credit card check to confirm you are over 18. Ubisoft has confirmed that this only applies to voice and text chat through the Ubisoft platforms on PC and mobile, but not on consoles as those are controlled by their parent companies.</p>

<p>Revealed by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sonic-4-kristen-bell-voice-amy-rose-1236508342/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Kristen Bell, best known from <strong>Veronica Mars</strong>, <strong>Frozen</strong>, <strong>The Good Place</strong>, and <strong>Gossip Girl</strong>, will be taking up the piko piko hammer.</p>
<p>She'll be joining Ben Schwartz (Sonic), Colleen O'Shaughnessey (Tails), Idris Elba (Knuckles), and Keanu Reeves (Shadow) — assuming these all return — among many other star-studded names, when <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 4</strong> speeds onto cinema screens on 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>In fact, Schwartz shared a rather adorable photo of the pair on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DU6JVK4lBLA/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">his instagram account</a> earlier today, accompanied by this sweet little celebration: "WE HAVE OUR AMY ROSE!!! And I could not be more excited!!! Please welcome the incredible @kristenanniebell to the @sonicmovie family!!!"</p>

<p>Amy was expected to appear in fourth Sonic movie after a very brief cameo during <strong>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</strong>. Metal Sonic is also rumoured after he featured during the same cameo, but we don't have an official announcement for his return yet.</p>
<p>And it seems like everyone is coming back for the sequel: Jeff Fowler will remain in the director's chair, while Neal H. Moritz and Toby Ascher of Original Films and Toru Nakahara are also on-board as producers.</p>
<p>And the Sonic series isn't stopping at another numbered movie, either. Late last year, Variety reported that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/new-sonic-universe-movie-spin-off-announced-for-2028">a new 'Sonic Universe' spin-off is in the works for 2028</a>. So the blue blur is steadily becoming a multi-media monster.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch Fans Prove Fickle As Their Loyalty Is Bought By Cat Cosmetics]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Loyalty is a funny thing. Sometimes it’s earned, sometimes it’s bought, and sometimes it’s won over by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-competitive-ranked-hero-bans-fika-2000668681"><span>cute kitty cats in jetpacks</span></a><i><span>.</span></i><span> The latter was on full display this week as</span><i><span> Overwatch </span></i><span>fans reversed momentum to unlock new skins in the latest event.</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s current season has players siding with either the titular peace-keeping group or the terrorist organization Talon over the course of the next six weeks. At first, Talon was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-talon-sides-event-allegiance-rewards-lootbox-2000668184"><span>pulling off a decisive victory</span></a><span> against Overwatch, with fans defecting to the villainous group for laughs and lootboxes. Now that the second week is upon us, the rewards have refreshed, and players have been given the option to switch sides to win different prizes. Well, a lot of people did, and have sold out Talon for Overwatch so they can get a bunch of cute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163"><span>Jetpack Cat</span></a><span> cosmetics.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overwatch is currently winning out on the faction war with a pretty significant lead of 59.42 percent of players siding with Winston, Sojourn, and the rest of the good guys, while Vendetta’s new reign as head of Talon is only drawing 40.58 percent of the vote. I’m not judging these fickle allegiances too hard. Ideologies are ever changing and contain multitudes. What we believe in one week of February 2026 might be completely different the following week.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000670714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000670714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000670714">© Blizzard Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But you know what is forever? A profile picture of Jetpack Cat. This week’s rewards include two profile pictures, a voice line, and a profile banner, all with the prettiest girl at Watchpoint: Gibraltar. It looks like that was enough to get people to stop doing terrorism on behalf of their Italian mommy.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all comes alongside the latest </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>lore drop, which includes an audio drama of Brigitte recalling meeting Fika, the cat that would one day don a jetpack, and exploring design ideas to get her feline companion off the ground and in the air. </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> is restructuring its seasons to integrate narrative more heavily, and this week it looks like the story content we’re getting corresponds to the rewards players are getting. So if future seasons keep this Splatfest-esque battle going, we’ll probably get used to seeing people hopping back and forth between both sides to unlock cosmetics.</span></p>

  <p><span>Will we get another lore drop next week as the rewards refresh? It’s unclear at the moment, as this is the first season in which </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> has been using the story-driven format to drive in-game events. The in-game Story menu has two locked story drops left for this season, which is running until April, so we likely won’t get new lore on a weekly basis. Whatever we do get, however, will factor into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s remaining seasons in 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021.
