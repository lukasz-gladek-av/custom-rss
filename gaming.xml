			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro features a major repairability improvement that is usually not found in video game consoles.</p>
<p>Judging from a <a href="https://imgur.com/FvyBYhI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picture</a> of the system that's been making the rounds, the soon-to-be-released console features a slot that grants quick access to the CMOS battery. This battery is an extremely important component of gaming systems, as it powers the CMOS chip that stores important hardware information and may prevent a system from functioning properly, as was the case for the PlayStation 4 before Sony issued an update to fix the issues related to a bad or missing CMOS battery.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't be long before we learn more about the PlayStation 5 Pro, as the system launches next week worldwide and has already reached stores. Earlier this week, the console also got into the hands of the press and influencers, and, not being able to talk about the system just yet, some of them got rather creative and decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-review-box/">review the box</a>, which is a markedly "PlayStation" box. Developers are also ready for the system's release, launching <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-playstation-5-pro-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro patches</a> to allow their games to take advantage of the console's increased power and features, such as PSSR.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches on November 7th worldwide.</p>

            <p>
Stroll on down to Uncle Capcom's garage, girls and boys, because it's time to meddle with a cat's voicebox, ride a combat peacock and meticulously injure a vast, blubbery teddybear. By which I mean, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> beta is now live on Steam through to 4th November at 2.59am GMT. That's 2.59am sharp. If you're hurrying along at 3am on Monday absolutely desperate to polish the aesthetics of a small enslaved catperson, you can sod off and play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> instead.

To celebrate, Capcom have published <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4438953498491486386?l=english">an introductory guide on Steam</a> that goes into such detail it renders the playing of the open beta absolutely needless, ho ho, I kid, Capcom, please put the greatsword down. To recap, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-beta-launches-this-month-with-a-character-editor-and-co-op-multiplayer">open beta</a> lets you create a character and Palico assistant. It gives you access to a Story Trial, in which you'll get to experiment with 14 different weapons and visit destruction upon a helpless trainer's dummy, together with a Doshaguma Hunt, which takes you out onto the Windward Plains in search of relatively resistant furry mammals to slaughter. While you're out there, you might go Wild with one of the following new Wilds features:
</p>
<p>

- <strong>Focus Mode!</strong> This is a new magic vision ability that lets you see monster wounds. These don't look like wounds, however. They look like glowing weak points, because this is a Capcom game. Imagine if Mortal Kombat did it this way.
</p><p>

- <strong>Ride your Seikret!</strong> This is the aforesaid combat peacock. Not to mix my analogies/metaphors, but it's also a packmule with a pouch for supply items and the opportunity to switch between two loadouts while mounted. What's more, you can sharpen weapons while riding your battlebird, and it even has an auto-drive feature. They could have saved themselves some animation budget and just swapped it for a Toyota Yaris.
</p>
<p>

- <strong>Camping!</strong> You can now have your Palico acquaintance pitch a tent for you to bask inside, cooking or changing your gear or just reclining like a prince. Be warned however that Monsters may come up and sit on it. A herd of sheep did this to me once in darkest North Yorkshire. Ah, what I wouldn't have given for a Toyoto Yaris at the time.
</p>
<p>
- <strong>Slay the Rey Dau!</strong> There are a bunch of monsters in the beta. The rarest of them all is a dragon that lives in a thunderstorm. I saw an Alpha Doshaguma battle one of these back at Summer Game Fest. It did not go well for the Alpha Doshaguma. It turns out that in Mother Nature's great game of roshambo, lightning lizards &gt; furry fartboys.
</p>
<p>
- <strong>Witness the changing weather!</strong> There are several seasons in store, all of which appear to have been named by mildly religious poets. Inclemency is "an ecology-altering event that sweeps in a raging storm" - beware lightning bolts, whether ye be hunterman or monste. Fallow is "a period of scarcity, with hungry predators roaming the land for food", while Plenty is a time of abundant map resources and smaller fauna. I see no option for Wearitude, the British season that somehow combines the heat of summer with the chilliness of winter, and is abundant in wasps that refuse to die or hibernate or whatever it is they do when they're not invading my sandwiches.
</p><p>
- <strong>Possibly turn off the spiders!</strong> I'm not sure if the Wilds beta includes arachnids, but in the full version of the game, you can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-will-have-a-spider-free-mode-for-those-with-arachnophobia">transform them into slimes</a>, though they will still move like spiders, which is possibly worse.</p>
<p>
Speaking of the full version of Monster Hunter Wilds, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-releases-28th-feb-2025-which-gives-modders-enough-time-to-silence-the-uncanny-talking-palicos">out on 28th February 2025</a>, and your character and Palico from the beta will carry over. So there's no reason not to overcommit. I won't be playing, unfortunately, because my brother is in town and we'll be busy hunting the greatest prey of all: an affordable non-Dominos pizza in London. Give my regards to the Doshaguma.

He's cute, he's mighty, and he has great deck utility (and great duck utility)...it's Farfetch'd!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who aren't playing Pocket, it's essentially a card collecting/pack opening sim with the ability to play a truncated version of the Pokemon TCG. The rules are simpler, the battles are shorter, and it's a lot easier to build an interesting competitive deck due to the game being free-to-play and the availability of booster packs for players who don't spend any money.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090442-1730469929527.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: u/MacNPieces on Reddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1ggayb3/senior_discount_to_those_who_remember/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now in Pocket, there's only one "set" of cards available to collect, called Apex Evolution. It's a great idea to start everyone off with just one set, from scratch, so there's a fairly even playing field at launch and the meta is still shaking out. But as <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-deck-cards-best-farfetchd/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by ComicBook</a>, Farfetch'd specifically has been rising above the rest as a component of just about any viable deck you want to make due to its unique combination of advantages. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090630-1730470033238.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/L3M0N5_2112 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1gg56nw/i_cant_be_the_only_one/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For one, it's a Basic Pokemon, so you can play it right from the start of the game without having to evolve it. Second, like most other Basic Pokemon, it has an attack that only costs one Energy, so it can attack pretty much immediately without any build-up. But more importantly, that attack (Leek Slap) does a whopping 40 damage, which is an enormous amount for a one energy cost, Basic Pokemon move. As a common card, Farfetch'd is easy for anyone to obtain, so there's no major expense or long effort to getting one or two in your deck. And finally, because Farfetch'd is a "colorless" card, it can be included in any deck and can use any type of energy, so it's very versatile.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/01/screenshot-2024-11-01-090857-1730470158083.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: u/raysayantan07 on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g5up9f/one_little_duck_against_the_whole_world/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Farfetch'd ultimately isn't a long game winner. It's great if you want to play aggressively, as you can get it out on the board quickly, do a lot of damage, and then retreat for the cost of just the single energy it already had on it before its 60 HP gets too low. But in the Pokemon TCG, that's usually enough. Farfetch'd can keep your opponent busy while you build up your bigger monsters on your bench, and can help stall your opponent from making similar big moves as fast as you can. Truly a mighty bird, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g460w8/farfetchd_appreciation_post_best_card_of_the_set/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are praising it accordingly</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We did a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">preview of Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> back in September. As our previewer wrote, it's "mainly a card-collecting destination, and maybe that’s all it needs to be." But with Farfetch'd on the team, maybe dipping into the battles is worth it after all. Now when are we getting a full art of this guy, or an EX version?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>The exact number of PlayStation 3 consoles that were ever produced has been revealed, according to a current Sony employee.</p><p>In what started as a discussion on Twitter about the PS3's infamous boomerang controller, a Sony programmer responded that they had walked past the controller in Sony's Japan headquarters recently and that it was located on the 16th floor near a coffee machine.</p><p>The employee took a picture of the boomerang controller in the display case, and on the shelf under it, there was a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/88-159-116-units-of-playstation-3-consoles-were-produced.1024860/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS3 console marked with the words</a>, "In memory of PS3 last production.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/fake-it-til-you-make-it-faking-extended-draw-distance-in-mobile-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fake it til’ you make it - faking extended draw distance in mobile games</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Optimization is a cornerstone of mobile game development. With thousands of phone models in circulation, many of them running outdated chipsets, every game needs to target a reasonable lowest common denominator, and one of the most consistent ways to optimize performance in 3D games is to manage draw distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Drawing distance must be as short as possible to achieve stable FPS. But what about open worlds, where players need to see the entire map from any point? This is the challenge we faced in Cubic Games while developing Block City Wars, and below we will explore the solution we settled on, and the strengths of this particular approach.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The problem:"><span>The problem:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a game like Block City Wars, every player needs to see the entire map from any position or be at a disadvantage, and simply increasing the far clip plane won’t work. Increasing the draw distance raises the number of triangles that pass through all culling stages: more objects undergo bounding box checks on the CPU and more fragments are drawn on the GPU.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using another camera for the background with a different drawing distance complicates camera management and adds unnecessary overhead. Lastly, experiments with HLOD (Hierarchical Level-Of-Detail) were also found unsuitable for solving this problem. While some of these solutions might be applicable to other games, they failed to address our needs. When all else fails, shader magic saves the day.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The essence of the solution:"><span>The essence of the solution:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The solution we settled on was using a mixture of shader trickery combined with our existing simple fog effect to provide useful but largely faked detail. Using a shader, we can create the illusion that an object is far away while it is actually close to the player. This allows us to choose which objects will always be visible, regardless of distance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It makes sense to use only sufficiently tall objects so players can orient themselves on the map, allowing us to fully remove visual clutter from the final render. To ensure a seamless transition between “fake” objects and real ones, we will render silhouettes in fog color. This also allows us to significantly reduce detail. It will look like this:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Before</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>After</span></span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deceiving CPU Culling:"><span>Deceiving CPU Culling:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve this effect, we can leverage the tools that Unity provides us. For a mesh to be sent for rendering, its bounds must fall within the camera frustum. This can be easily done, for example, using this MonoBehaviour. We will do this in Start() because Unity recalculates bounds when the mesh is initialized. For our purposes, we need to set the size so that the player’s camera is always inside the bounds; thus, the mesh will always be sent for rendering on the GPU, lightening the load on older CPU models.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">void Start() 
{
	Mesh mesh = selectedMeshFilter.sharedMesh;
	Bounds bounds = mesh.bounds;
	bounds.center = newCenter;
	bounds.size = newSize;
	mesh.bounds = bounds;
}</span></pre><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Deceiving GPU Culling:"><span>Deceiving GPU Culling:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once the mesh is on the GPU, there is one more stage of frustum culling—between the vertex and fragment stages. To bypass this, we need to transform the vertex coordinates so that all vertices are within the camera’s view, while still preserving perspective.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">v2f vert (appdata v)
{
	v2f o;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	float3 worldPos = mul(unity_ObjectToWorld, v.vertex).xyz;
	float3 directionToOriginal = normalize(worldPos - _WorldSpaceCameraPos);
	float3 scaledPos = _WorldSpaceCameraPos + directionToOriginal*_ScaleDownFactor;
	float3 objectPos = mul(unity_WorldToObject, float4(scaledPos,1));	
	o.vertex =UnityObjectToClipPos(objectPos);
	return o;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</span></pre><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">_ScaleDownFactor is the distance from the camera at which all vertices will be located. It needs to be adjusted according to the fog distance to hide the transition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All we need to do in the fragment shader is simply draw the fog color, which will mask the geometry cutoff.</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">fixed4 frag (v2f i) : SV_Target
{
	return unity_FogColor;
}
</span></pre><h3 data-testid="content-text"><br><span>Example with an Island Mesh:</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This effect can be clearly seen in Blender. If you position the camera at the origin and point it at a cube, then duplicate the cube and scale it relative to 0, from the camera’s perspective, there will be no difference between these cubes. Obviously a trick that won’t work quite right in VR, but we’re developing for mobile here, so depth perception isn’t something we have to work around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our case, an additional step is added: the mesh is “squashed” to fit right at the edge of the camera’s drawing distance. This is done to avoid overlapping with the z-buffer of other objects that should be closer to the player. When dealing with ‘impostor’ detail objects like this, one little rendering glitch is all it takes to shatter the illusion and bring attention to background objects that should normally be seamless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We must also keep in mind cases where the camera might end up inside the silhouette mesh. Vertices in one triangle can end up on different sides of the camera, causing it to stretch across the entire screen. This should be taken into account when creating the silhouette mesh, ensuring the camera does not enter it or disabling meshes when the camera approaches.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this approach won’t be applicable for all games, it fits Block City Wars and its existing fog effects perfectly. This approach allows for quickly extending the effective draw distance using ‘faked’ silhouetted detail under serious performance constraints, leveraging the existing fog effects to hide the smoke-and-mirrors used. It is easy to reproduce in any render pipeline and engine, and it does not require modification of existing code.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with much of the fine detail faked and obscured behind fog effects, the distant silhouettes still provide useful gameplay information to players at minimal performance cost. A net win for players across all platforms, especially older hardware.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A quick look over on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> reddit feed shows multiple screenshots of angular, almost Nintendo 64-looking graphics. In one clip shared by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1gh0deu/graphics_be_damned_ill_hunt_them_all_the_same/">Magolich</a>, the player looks like they are trying to hunt down an animated origami creation, rather than a fully fleshed beast.</p>

</span></p><p>These images have certainly made me chuckle, but obviously are far from ideal. Thankfully, the Monster Hunter Wilds' team has said the final game is "already in a more improved state compared to the beta test". It has also shared a few <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/4175478969021690194">troubleshooting pointers</a> for those still looking to get into the beta.</p><p>"The purpose of this test is to allow players to experience a limited portion of Monster Hunter Wilds and also to verify various technical aspects such as network load and overall operation prior to the game's full release," the developer wrote on Steam.</p>
<p>"Please note that the final product is still in development. Certain aspects such as game specifications and balance may differ in the full version. We are committed to ensuring the quality of the final product."</p>

<p>Our Ed has been hands on with the game already, and came away impressed. "For the most part, Monster Hunter Wilds strikes a balance between approachability and depth of combat. It offers a familiar thrill of the hunt, of player customisation (the new armours look awesome), and of extravagant combat, but with a fresh world ripe for a bit of co-op action - even with NPCs," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-cuts-out-the-clunk-and-plays-like-the-most-streamlined-beginner-friendly-entry-yet">Eurogamer's Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in full in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-out-february-next-year">February next year</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PC version of GTA Online will be updated sometime next year with features introduced in the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/k4479kk2k9ak2a/gta-online-community-update?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;utm_campaign=gtao_announcement_community-update-20241101" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> shared online today outlining what's coming to the game in the next few weeks, Rockstar Games confirmed there are plans to bring the much-requested PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X features of the game to the PC version next year. These features include ray tracing support, texture and draw distance upgrades, increased population and traffic variety, increased vegetation density, improved lighting quality across shadows, water reflections, enhanced anti-aliasing and motion blur, improved explosions and fire, and more.</p>
<p>With GTA VI coming next year, it will be very interesting to see how Rockstar Games will handle GTA Online. Still, for the time being, it seems like updates and new content won't stop coming anytime soon, with more coming this December and beyond. The game's continued support is hardly surprising, considering it's still extremely popular, so much so that <a href="https://wccftech.com/400000-people-flood-gta-5-starting-area-for-new-event-in-gta-online/">last month</a>, over 400,000 players logged into the game to play the Ludendorff Cemetery Survival Mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fanatical-movember-charity-bundle<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fanatical has a new charity bundle up for grabs, and for just $12 (or more if you choose), you'll get a ton of pretty big games and support the Movember charity initiative into the bargain.</p>

<p>The Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle is, per Fanatical, "the first bundle to join the Movember mustache movement", and it's got a whopping 15 games to offer, including Owlcat's well-received CRPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader"><em>Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader</em></a>.</p>

<p>Other games you'll get as part of this bundle include truckin' sim&nbsp;<em>American Truck Simulator</em>, city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build</em>, and goopy action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>The Gunk</em>, among several others.</p>

<p>Additionally, 100% of the proceeds go to the Movember charity initiative, so you don't need to choose how much you want to go to Fanatical itself; you're supporting Movember all the way if you pick this one up.</p>

<p>Here's a full list of the games available as part of the Fanatical Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle. All of these games activate via Steam, and many of them are either Playable or Verified on Steam Deck as well.</p>

            <p>
Remedy's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses", CEO Tero Virtala has announced in a business review for January-September 2024. Speaking as somebody who would quite like there to be more Alan Wake games - or at least, moderately weird and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-review">pretty decent</a> blockbuster singleplayer horror games - I am both pleased by this news and a little troubled that Remedy's eldritch forest fable (which came out in October 2023) has yet to break even.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf">review</a> notes that the reporting period falls before the release of Alan Wake 2's Lake House expansion and the Physical Deluxe Edition of the game. In other words, it's possible that those releases have helped Alan Wake 2 make up the difference since today's data was gathered.
</p>
<p>
The overall financial picture for Remedy seems to be heading in the right direction, i.e. upwards. Their revenue overall for July-September 2024 is up by 129% versus the same period a year ago, at 17.9 million Euros, resulting in an operating profit of 2.4 million euros.</p>
<p>Remedy have taken certain steps to shore up their books. Half of Control 2's development is being funded by Annapurna, in return for the rights to expand the Control and Alan Wake franchises into film and television. The company have also recently taken out a 15 million euro convertible loan agreement with Tencent. They expect their numbers to improve further by the time of their next financial report. 
</p><p>
The report also has a few updates on Remedy's in-development projects. The recently revealed three-player Control spin-off shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-unveil-wacky-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-set-in-the-control-universe">FBC: Firebreak</a> will be a "mid-priced" game and is "in full production with a focus on iterating on the core loop and implementing more of the UI (user interface) for more player clarity based on playtesting feedback." The Max Payne 1 and 2 remakes they're developing with Rockstar are "making steady progress in full production". 
</p>
<p>
And then there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a>, whose plot directions are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-lake-house-expansion-trailer-hints-at-control-2-overlap-also-features-ghastly-paint-monsters">hinted at by Alan Wake 2's Lake House DLC</a>. "Control 2 has progressed well in the production readiness stage and is on track to start full production during 2025," Virtala adds. "Many of the critical features of the game have been implemented to mitigate production risk, and workflows and pipelines are being tested in preparation for full production."
</p>
<p>
The original Control appears to have been a commercial success for Remedy, with four million units sold as of February 2024. In the same month, Remedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-now-own-all-of-control-including-sequel-and-multiplayer-spin-off-after-buying-rights-from-publisher">bought the rights to self-publish future Control games</a> from the original game's publisher 505 Games. In the latest financial review, Virtala offers investors the cautionary reminder that Remedy's Control projects are going to make less money for Remedy at first, as there's no publisher chipping in, but stand to make more after release, because there's no publisher taking a cut.
</p>
<p>
Here are my blundering questions, as a financial bignoramus: 1) is Alan Wake 2's commercial showing in line with Remedy's expectations, 2) if it isn't, what steps are they taking to ensure they can carry on justifying the development of eccentric spook-a-wrangles like this?

Goku has three opponents he can perform a special throw against, but each one requires him to be in a certain form from a particular era.</p><p>Aside from some launching an opponent differently, these don’t feature any <em>major</em> gameplay differences.

Referencing their first fight on Namek, Goku grabs Frieza’s tail before swinging and throwing him off into the distance. The cinematic starts with the egotistical tyrant crossing his arms, as this moment occurred when he pompously fought Goku without using his hands.</p><p>This special can allow for alternate combos, since it launches Frieza differently.

His default grab has him use a three-hit punch combo to launch enemies away horizontally. It even has some extra flair for ending with a rocket arm punch.</p><p>The bulky android takes a little influence from Goku if he’s fighting against Cell’s 1st Form, though. While he doesn’t comically swing them around, he does grab the terrifying monster’s tail and slam him downward. Fans might remember Android 16’s fights against Cell’s evolved forms more, but he did have his moment thrashing this imperfect form.</p><p>Besides looking more brutal, it can take out additional health from the big bug if he hits the ground. If you throw him from high in the air, you can also follow up with a vanishing attack, the Hell’s Impact super, or the Self Destruct Device ultimate.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gohan’s first foray into the Super Saiyan 2 form is rife with lightning-fast attacks and slower heavy ones too.

Gohan will hit Perfect Cell with a devastating punch to the gut, and then follow up with an uppercut that launches his nemesis into the sky. A nice touch is that Cell attempts (and fails) to throw a punch of his own, which makes this one of the more dynamic throws in the game. It’s also a fun, faster representation of the first two hits Gohan lands on the villain in this form.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This version of Goku has a slightly different default throw from the one we mentioned earlier. He still swings Majin Buu around by their foot, but opts for an upward launch instead of throwing them downward. Although you’ll miss out on additional damage from a possible ground smash, there can be more potential to combo from the launch.</p><p>Super Saiyan 3 Goku doesn’t just throw Majin Buu, but grabs him by his stretchy antenna to punch him in the head first before tossing him aside. The punch certainly makes this a hilariously brutal cinematic. Otherwise, the only real difference is that this is a horizontal throw and a great reference to these two fighters’ first meeting.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ultimate Gohan spends more time hitting the enemy than his teenage self manages. His default grab uses a five-hit combo that’s paced well and looks cool. It ends with him kicking the opponent directly forward.</p><p>Gohan truly inherits his father Goku’s influence when fighting against Super Buu. He throws a punch before, you guessed it, grabbing Super Buu’s antenna and swinging him around. Aside from the total disrespect that the punch adds, which is accurate to the initial fight between these two in the anime, this will launch the hungry pink blob upward.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The blue-haired version of Vegeta, who has the unnecessarily long name of Vegeta (Super) Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, normally uses two heavy punches to launch the opponent forward. If you’re confused about it counting as three hits, it’s because the first punch counts as two. He’s just that damn cool I guess.</p><p>Vegeta is a lot more vicious against Goku Black in his Super Saiyan Rose form. After punching the latter onto the ground (which looks strange when using this throw in the air), Vegeta picks the body-stealer up by his hair and delivers a headbutt and punch. It’s mechanically identical to the default throw as both send the opponent flying forward.</p><p>Even though there isn’t a gameplay difference, and it’s unfortunately missing the entire speech the Prince of all Saiyans delivers during this <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> moment, the throw is still one of the coolest in the game. But maybe that’s my bias speaking as a Vegeta fan.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Goku’s first Ultra Instinct form is an imposing sight, and his throws back that up as some of the coolest-looking in the game.

When fighting against Frieza (Super), the angry Saiyan uses his giant feet to get in some kicks and a sick backflip, before punching him away. This exact scenario plays out in the movie <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>, albeit with Frieza being kicked into a giant rock. While it looks strange in-game, since there is no rock or wall to play off of, the backflip does add a lot to the coolness factor.</p><hr><p>It is pretty disappointing that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have more unique throws, given the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">abundance of characters</a></span>. Despite that, these are still a very welcome treat if you can trigger them in a fight. The animations are great and they do spice up your matches a little bit. Just as with the Special Finishers, we can only hope more are added through updates or DLC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-place-on-twitch-hatred-ceo-says/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98there-is-no-place-on-twitch-for-hatred%E2%80%99-says-ceo.1025364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-place-on-twitch-hatred-ceo-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch, a platform known for high levels of toxicity and scandal, is not a place for hatred of any kind, CEO Dan Clancy has insisted. In a recent blog post discussing updates to the platform’s community guidelines, the somewhat eccentric CEO stated that ‘Twitch is, and always will be, about belonging.’</p>



<p>In the last few months, Twitch has made several community-led changes to the platform’s guidelines, many of which have been well received by the wider audience. However, it’s a drop in the ocean when lined up against years of issues, struggles with hate raids and bot behaviour, and questionable content making it to the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-work-hard">‘We Work Hard’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy was fiercely outspoken against hatred in all forms in <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2024/11/01/hate-and-harassment-have-no-place-on-twitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent blog post on Twitch</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen members of the community voice concerns about how we handle potentially harmful content. There is no place on Twitch for racism, hatred, or harassment of any kind, including antisemitism and Islamophobia.</p>



<p>Twitch is, and will always be, about belonging. Each day, people come together on our service to build communities around shared interests, and to express themselves authentically. For this to be possible, we work hard to ensure that our community is a safe place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to say that <strong>some content </strong>might seem objectable to members of that worldwide community, but regardless, it’s allowed on the platform. In recent weeks, Twitch landed in hot water for ‘permitting’ Frogan, an inflammatory streamer, to wish death and suffering on soldiers in the US military.</p>



<p>This partnered Twitch streamer eventually landed a 30-day ban, but for some, that wasn’t even close to being enough. </p>



<p>For years, Twitch has been in a to-and-fro battle with what’s permitted on the site and what’s considered ‘bannable’. From hot tub streamers to those glorifying bullying and hateful behaviour, the site has edged into the realms of being a toxic cesspool at times.</p>



<p>Clancy is adamant that things are still changing for the better:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re grateful for the feedback and input from our community. Our safety approach continues to build and evolve, as our service grows. We want to ensure that anyone can find their place on Twitch, and remain committed to ensuring that hate and harassment have no place here.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> Remastered is sitting on a mixed Steam user score as players take issue with a number of things, including performance, stuttering, audio glitches, and the fact you need a PSN account despite the game being a single player adventure.</p>
<p>Not that the latter is new information, of course. Just like other notable PlayStation-flavoured Steam releases such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a>, players knew they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-will-require-a-psn-account">wouldn't be able to play Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC without a PSN account</a>. That doesn't mean they're done making their unhappiness known, though, or plan to stop warning other players of the requirement.</p>

<p>"I really wanted to play but it sucks to have to have an [PSN] account to play it, and the worst thing is that when you want to verify your account or tells you that the password is invalid or you have to repeat the procedure again, why do I have to have a playstation account if I'm going to play on a damn PC???" posited <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamdoll19/recommended/2561580/">one</a> of the 39 percent of players to have left a negative review on Steam.</p>
<p>"Game runs very poorly. Awful optimisation. Running game with 4070. Refunded," added <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051476976/recommended/2561580/">another</a> particularly succinct player.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt about it - when it comes to porting or developing for PC, Nixxes is still the best of them all!" says <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/stepasr/recommended/2561580/">one</a> more positive take. "The Complete Edition was already amazing, but now, with this Remastered, we've reached new heights, as with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p>"They've redone everything, even the benchmark, and the technical side is finally packed with features: from all upscalers to frame generation, all the way to dynamic resolution. The game's visual quality has improved tenfold, performance is excellent, they did an incredible job, and it deserves recognition. And all this for just 10 bucks! Kudos all around! Enjoy the game!"</p>
<p>On reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/1gh15wp/really_enjoying_the_remaster_but_it_def_needs_a/">this player</a> broke down some of the game's biggest issues: "Really enjoying the remaster, but it [definitely] needs a patch or two. I'm noticing small stutters or hitching during cutscenes, the audio mix in that first town area has some weird reverb with NPC chatter and sound effects… A few minor floating items or clothing graphics glitches. This is not killing my immersion or anything but would be nice if these things were sorted out."</p>
<p>Other complains report problems with controllers, freezes, and numerous crashes.</p>
<p>The issue around PSN linking all stems back to the beginning of the summer with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">Helldivers' PC PSN log-in requirement</a>. There was such a vitriolic backlash that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony backtracked on its original plans</a> and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-pc-players-are-getting-auto-refunds-if-they-cannot-legally-sign-up-for-psn">auto-refunded players who bought Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut in countries where PSN isn't available</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy has announced its financial results for the third quarter of its fiscal year, and things are looking a little rosier for the Finnish studio.</p>

<p>In Remedy's <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/1ef581e9-5f40-4a92-ab0f-0d15844717cd/remedy-q3-2024-business-review.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report</a>, the studio says its revenue has jumped 128.6% over the same period from the previous year. Between July and September this year, Remedy raked in&nbsp;€17.9 million in revenue, and its operating profit was&nbsp;€2.4 million, up from a&nbsp;€5.5 million loss in Q3 2023.</p>

<p>The studio also says that while&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">still isn't profitable</a>, the game had recouped "most of its development and marketing expenses" by the end of the quarter, which means that it may well be profitable within the next couple of quarters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VdDMC3Qy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-remedy-financials-lake-house.jpg?itok=VJ0dMg8C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>isn't profitable yet, but it seems to be getting there.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Remedy, full production on&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is scheduled to start in 2025, with the sequel currently progressing "well in the production readiness stage". Many of the game's "critical features" have been implemented, Remedy says, and it's currently testing "workflows and pipelines" for full production.</p>

<p>Similarly, the&nbsp;upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy"><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a> are "making steady progress", and Remedy says it's "gradually reaching important milestones" in development on the projects.</p>

<p>For the rest of 2024, Remedy expects its revenue to "increase from the previous year", and it also expects its "operating profit to improve", so it looks like Remedy will likely have a better time in 2024 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-financials-2023">than in 2023</a>.</p>

<p>The report also looks ahead to Remedy's upcoming projects, including the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">recently-revealed&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, a multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff set to launch sometime next year.</p>




<p>While Remedy is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies">teaming up with Annapurna</a> (even amidst that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/annapurna-interactive-staff-resign-after-company-spin-off-talks-fail">recent turmoil</a>) for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, the Finnish developer will be self-publishing the game, as it will with&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>Here's hoping Remedy's fortunes continue to improve in the coming months. Stay tuned for more on all things Remedy-related.</p>

The next Mass Effect is going to have a very tough act to follow, which is not something I ever imagined I'd be saying before I got swept away on this adventure. Enjoyable action combat, a fantastic cast of allies with sweeping story arcs all their own, top-notch cinematics, and moving, nuanced character writing are the wings on which this triumphant dragon soars, pulling out all the stops in a whirlwind tour of Northern Thedas and capping it with a terrific finale that’s built on memorably tough choices and consequences. If we never get another Dragon Age, at least it got to go out on a high note."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dayz-creator-reveals-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa.1025283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dayz-creator-kerbal-space-program-killer-ksa<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>DayZ&nbsp;</em>creator and RocketWerkz head Dean Hall has announced he and his team are working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" by the name of&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</p>

<p>Announcing the game <a href="https://x.com/rocket2guns/status/1851832821020790791" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Hall says he's working on&nbsp;<em>KSA&nbsp;</em>with RocketWerkz alongside "former members of the&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>team and amazing modders".</p>

<p>Right now, the game looks to be in its early stages; the footage Hall showed off in his post simply shows a moon's surface, then zooms out (albeit seamlessly) to reveal a galaxy of planets, all soundtracked by some appropriately moody synth music.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=d5xCeo72 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ksa-kerbal-space-program-killer-dean-hall.jpg?itok=QwKZf6qu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dean Hall and RocketWerkz are currently working on a "<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer" called&nbsp;<em>KSA</em>, or&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Academy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit post</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/1gg5106/comment/lun0vsl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener" target="_blank">accompanying comment</a>,&nbsp;Hall goes into more detail regarding RocketWerkz's new project, as well as his own efforts to pitch Private Division on a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>sequel.</p>

<p>Hall says that his studio was in "the top three bids" to work on&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em>, but that because his team's pitch focused on the technical side of things and didn't contain any art, his studio wasn't chosen.</p>

<p>However, Hall says that for&nbsp;<em>Kitten Space Agency</em>, he and RocketWerkz have employed several developers who worked on both&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>and its sequel, as well as a mystery "key person" who is a "key individual in our industry".</p>

<p>There's also a little more nerdy technical information contained within Hall's comment, including how the video footage's seamless movement is achieved, how the team deals with floating point precision loss, and more.</p>




<p>If you're wondering why exactly a&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program&nbsp;</em>killer would be needed, look no further than Take-Two's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">apparent shutdown</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games (although Take-Two itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denies closing that studio</a>).</p>

<p>Reportedly, Take-Two is also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-planning-to-close-or-sell-private-division" rel="noopener" target="_blank">looking to close down or sell</a> its indie label Private Division, so despite the company's claims to the contrary, <i>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</i>might not be a going concern for much longer.</p>

<p>There's a niche a mile wide, then, for someone like Hall to slide in with a game that's similar enough to&nbsp;<em>Kerbal&nbsp;</em>that people take interest while also being different enough to carve out a niche for itself.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether RocketWerkz achieves this, but in the meantime, you can join the project's <a href="https://discord.com/invite/aCwHR7HJ4W" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Discord server</a> if you want to keep up with things as they happen.</p>

Martin’s books, even if the project is still in the earliest stages of development. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193818" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="258" data-playlist="193818,197298,197284" data-current="193818"><div><p>The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19270.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, the studio is making at least one <em>Game of Thrones </em>movie, though the project doesn’t yet have a script, director, or cast associated with it. These “concepts of a plan” for a theatrical adaptation of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> might soon break free of its existing HBO prestige TV enclosure, something the company had resisted in the past. </p><p>While we don’t have any idea what such a movie would focus on, from entirely new events to existing portions of Martin’s world that haven’t yet been adapted to TV, it seems unlikely a project would be able to rival the previous success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> without involving that cast and characters in some way. Maybe it’s not unthinkable that we might get a complete do-over of the show’s much-maligned ending, something fans have long speculated about. </p><p>Any movie would also be coming out alongside a full suite of new <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV, from <em>House of the Dragon</em> season three and<em> A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> to a host of other spin-offs and animated adaptations. Not all of Warner’s grand plans for the fantasy IP have come to fruition, however. A direct sequel with Kit Harington reprising his role as Jon Snow was infamously abandoned, seemingly over a lack of strong ideas for where to take the character after the as-of-yet unfinished conclusion of Martin’s books. </p><p>  <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> points out that a new era of post-merger Warner Bros. seems much more comfortable with major franchises seamlessly hopping between streaming and the big screen. The <em>Harry Potter </em>movies are currently being remade as a TV series, and<em> The Batman</em> has already spawned a very successful spin-off in <em>The Penguin</em>. It’s not hard to see<em> Game of Thrones</em> going in the opposite direction five years after the conclusion of the original show. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Playdate Season 2 is set to drop in 2025.</p>
<p>Whilst no firm release date has been revealed as yet, developer Panic said it would have "a new collection of surprise games developed specifically" for its dinky handheld system next year.</p>

<p>Details on "price, the exact number of games, and the developers begins [them]" will be confirmed next year, with Panic stating that whilst the pandemic and unprecedented chip shortage up-ended plans to simultaneously release games at the exact same time the first time round, "Playdate 2 hopes to deliver on that original idea" next year.</p>
<p>Interested? Playdate owners will be able to purchase the fresh batch of games via Playdate's Catalog when it releases. All new Playdates sold will continue to have Playdate Season 1 bundled in with the price of the system itself.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning, the number one question from Playdate owners has been: 'When will there be another Season?'" says Greg Maletic, Playdate project lead.</p>
<p>"Season One was a hit - players loved games like Crankin's Time Travel Adventure and Zipper. They also loved the excitement of receiving two surprise games a week: that time-release aspect encouraged players to dive deeply into each title before the next arrived. But one thing we couldn't do with Season One was synchronize play for everyone. With Season Two, we finally can!"</p>
<p>Donlan reviewed the Playdate console back in 2022, calling it "a fascinating puzzle in itself".</p>
<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>Back in March, there was an even bigger Playdate puzzle - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">$400k worth of Playdate game consoles disappeared in Las Vegas</a>, with company co-founder Cabel Sasser calling it "a bit of a true crime drama".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
