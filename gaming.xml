		<p>Bandai Namco has announced that Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream will be released on October 4th. This upcoming game in the Sword Art Online series concentrates its main focus on multiplayer gameplay, enabling up to twenty players to collaborate and confront the formidable challenges found within Alfheim Online. Additionally, a new story trailer has been unveiled, providing a glimpse into the story that players will encounter in Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream.</p>
<p><iframe title="SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream — Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amjCHqUtIZY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The gist of the story is that the Galaxia system, which powers Alfheim Online, has become corrupted and uncontrollable. This malfunction leads to the collision of different versions of the world, creating an entirely new reality. Characters from various Sword Art Online arcs are brought together in this unique realm, causing former enemies to join forces as they strive to reset the timeline and return to their original worlds.</p>
<p>Pre-orders have gone live today for the three versions of Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream, which are the Standard, Digital Deluxe, and Digital Premium editions. The standard edition will include the game and a pre-order bonus of the Demon King costume set. The Digital Premium edition includes the game, the Character Pass Volume 1 giving access to DLC 1 and DLC 2 of Worlds Beyond, a bonus stamp set, and the Prism Heart costume set. The Digital Deluxe edition includes all of the above plus the digital artbook and soundtrack, and the Wild Joker dress. Those who pre-order the Premium or Deluxe versions will get three days early access too, along with the Demon King costume set.</p>

<p>Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>

			<p>The freshly-released GTA 5 Evil Soul mod is a horror-themed gameplay mod that aims to terrify players.</p>
<p>Created by modder 'AlexDevilish', the Evil Soul mod for Rockstar's 2013 title (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which keeps outselling more recent AAA releases</a>), is currently in beta and puts players in a nightly setting between 00:00 and 03:00 in which they need to survive the horror. The creator doesn't recommended this mod for the 'younger' players to those fainthearted. "Experience lights being cut off and watch everyone around you die and burn", the description of the mod reads. "and watch objects float around you like in the horror movies you used to watch. She is not so merciful as she watches you observing the terror around you."</p>
<p>According to the odder, "something" is watching over you when using this horror mod. And this "something" is evil, and not happy.</p>
<p>In order for this mod to work, users will need to download and install the ScriptHook V plugin.</p>
<p>Those interested can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/gta5/mods/902?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download the Evil Soul mod from Nexusmods here</a>. We've included a gameplay video of the mod in action below. As you might have guessed, this mod is only available for the PC version of GTA 5.</p>

<p>GTA V is available worldwide now across PC and consoles. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> back in May of this year, Rockstar is currently gearing up to release the highly-anticipated next entry in the series, GTA 6, in Fall 2025. GTA 6 is expected to have a map <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-map-two-times-bigger-gta-v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">size two times bigger than GTA 5's map size</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24191278/star-wars-acolyte-manny-jacinto-is-hot-episode-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="aoMxih">Manny Jacinto is hot; this is known. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24177908/star-wars-acolyte-tv-they-them-pronouns-stop-being-weird-about-it"><em>The Acolyte</em></a> is making great use of that fact by leaving the show’s demonstration of the seductive nature of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24177229/acolyte-master-who-is-answer">the Dark Side of the Force in his very capable hands</a> (and very strong biceps). And honestly? The Sith have never seemed better. </p>
<p id="7ZpQah">Episode 6 of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24176253/star-wars-acolyte-mae-osha-force-cult-witches"><em>The Acolyte</em></a><em>, “</em>Teach/Corrupt,” continues the dueling narratives of Mae and Osha (both played by Amandla Stenberg), with the twins having swapped places. Now, Mae is on a ship with Sol (Lee Jung-jae), whom she plans to kill, and Osha has been kidnapped (or “rescued”) by Qimir (Jacinto), whom she hopes to kill — or, at least, so she thinks. She follows him to his swimming hole, watches him strip down, tries to take his lightsaber (not a euphemism), almost attempts to kill him, but then... hears him out. </p>
<p id="Kj1tw6">And how can you not listen to this is man who is so calm, cool, and collected. Maybe he’s up to something — he’s a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24185141/star-wars-acolyte-master-mask-donnie-darko-design">self-proclaimed Sith</a> (basically), so, yeah, he probably is. But it’s understandable that Osha wants to get to the root of him. He keeps putting himself right up in her orbit, unbothered except when he’s intently focused on <em>her </em>and getting her to embrace her power.</p>

<p id="vzOwt5">But all this Manny Jacinto smoldering isn’t just for show; the creators know what they’re doing. Aside from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24186170/acolyte-master-sith-knights-of-ren">anything else episode 5’s use of the Kylo Ren motif might mean</a>, it most immediately calls back to the Dark Side’s most recent bad boy. Playing the song over Qimir stroking Osha’s arm while she’s passed out feels like exactly the kind of moment that fuels headcanons far beyond the run of the show — particularly with Jacinto approaching Sith reeducation the way <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22985272/gilmore-girls-best-boyfriend-logan-jess-dean">Jess Mariano</a> talks books; a true <em>seduction</em> to the Dark Side if I’ve ever seen one. </p>

<p id="pFQHoL">Heading into <em>The Acolyte</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24171289/star-wars-sith-boring">Star Wars had an issue with the Sith</a> — ostensibly representing the free-wheelin’, hedonistic (and, thus, dark) side of the Force — being pretty sexless. There was no real heat to their cause beyond “bad,” and certainly not one that seemed like it had any <em>allure</em>. </p>
<p id="jYQH75">But what makes Qimir’s seduction so potent is how he looks at and <em>sees</em> Osha, the way a romantic lead might gaze longingly at their costar. While Jacinto doesn’t play Qimir as amorous, he does come off as seemingly able to surf forever on the half-pipe of bad-boy energy, all while telling you how you’re a person so full of anger and pain that it led people to “throw you away.” He peers at Osha and seems to pierce to some inner part of her (even if that inner self is “exploitable anxiety!”), speaking truths with smooth-tongued precision. It’s an enticing sort of attention, and one that Osha’s clearly never quite received from the Jedi. </p>
<p id="zYCrTy">And while he may be a corrupting force, the scar on Qimir’s back, in conjunction with the whip lightsaber we see elsewhere in the episode, seems to suggest that he has a good reason for hating the Jedi. As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/24186178/acolyte-how-many-episodes-list"><em>The Acolyte</em> continues its dance</a> between the Light and Dark sides of the Force, it’s important that the Dark Side have a face, and that its face have as much pull as Jacinto’s — otherwise what’s the appeal of either Osha or Mae being down so bad?</p>

            <p>The tabletop equivalent of “buying books and reading them are two different hobbies” is surely the difference between buying sexy tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> manuals and actually dragging your mates on to Discord for a few hours to stumble your way through a module. It’s the dogeared Fighting Fantasy from a carboot sale kid in me, I think. Something about reading worldbuilding snippets organised into numbered tables just hits in a way a novel doesn’t. Such tantalising ephemera is the name of the game in Microprose-published <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crosssover-roll-for-initiative">CrossOver: Roll For Initiative</a>. It’s a wave defense where you play match-3 to collect dice, then spend them on fireballs and mace swings to stop tiny bastards from marauding all over your actual character sheet and attacking your stats.</p>

<p>The titular ‘roll for initiative’ is a D6 roll before the start of a round to see how many bonus seconds of prep you get, although you can pause and take stock at any time. “Hardcore match-3 RPG puzzle meets action-strategy tower defence. Far from a casual game!” is how it describes itself. This is a silly way to sell your game, since the screenshots and concept already convinced me to try the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1713080/CrossOver_Roll_For_Initiative/">Steam demo</a> anyways. You did not need to brag to me about how pendulously engorged deez D10s are. I might even suggest that using the words “Hardcore” and “not casual” in your description makes you come across like a dickhead, inanimate store page. Still, I forgive you, because CrossOver is delightfully novel, good coffee-break fun, and very easy to understand, despite its blustering.</p>
<p>You get a single move to create a line of three dice in the match-3 tray, and different abilities cost different dice. I <em><strong>think </strong></em>the tray is seeded so more powerful dice are rarer, though I can’t be sure. Seems like there’s a lot of variety too, even in the limited demo build. Some spells do damage, some slow down the tiny pixel enemies attacking you or carry other status effects. There are also different classes and species to play, so you do actually get to customise your own character sheet before choosing a module from your virtual bookshelf.</p>
<p>I am falling back on both mine and Edwin’s default stance of the Marge Simpson school of potato critique here, but despite the trademark, clut-intricate Microprosaic UI: It's neat! I especially liked the CYOA encounters, with monochrome fantasy art, that bookend main sessions as you travel across a map. These are deeply confusing in regards to what level of meta the game is operating on, but not everything can be Princess Bride I guess. So yeah! Aside from the store description making me want to actually quote Princess Bride, this one’s well worth the download click if you want some, uh, casual dice fun.</p>

        <p>The platform claims Voodoo is using bots to fix outcomes and determine how much players win</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Mobile gaming platform Skillz has filed a lawsuit against Voodoo for unlawful conduct and false advertising on its Blitz Win Cash app.</p>
<p>Filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York on Monday, the <a href="https://www.pacermonitor.com/public/case/54121175/Skillz_Platform_Inc_v_Voodoo_SAS_et_al">suit</a> alleged that Voodoo falsely advertises the app as being "fair" and "skill-based," claiming it uses bots to fix outcomes of tournaments and to determine how much players win.</p>
<p>"Voodoo's use of algorithms to determine the outcome of its tournaments turns what might be otherwise legal games of human skill into illegal games of chance or gambling in which Voodoo's participants have little to no influence on the outcome of any game," the lawsuit read.</p>
<p>"By deploying bots or algorithms to determine how much players win when their money is on the line, Voodoo can generate revenue for itself with each game played."</p>
<p>Skillz claimed that it has lost customers as a result of Voodoo's alleged false advertising and use of bots and been damaged "by way of lost market share, revenue, and profits" due to the similarities of both platforms which specialise in online multiplayer game competitions.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/skills-awarded-429m-in-patent-infringement-trial-against-aviagames">Skillz was awarded $42.9 million against AviaGames</a> following a patent infringement trial.</p>
<p>During this trial, Skillz presented evidence to the court that AviaGames was also using bots to control the outcome of games. AviaGames is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/aviagames-sued-for-use-of-bots-in-real-money-skill-based-games">currently facing a class-action lawsuit of its alleged use of bots</a>.</p>

			<p>Nearly five months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sword-art-online-fractured-daydream-is-a-large-scale-co-op-multiplayer-game-with-raids-for-up-to-20-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's announcement</a>, Bandai Namco has now confirmed the final launch date for SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream. The large-scale multiplayer action game will debut on October 4 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Digital pre-orders are already open, offering customers the choice between three editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Premium. All pre-orders (except for the Standard Edition on Switch, for some reason) will get the Demon King costume set freebie, which can be equipped on the SKIN tab of the CUSTOMIZE screen after completing the first story mission.</p>
<p>The Digital Deluxe Edition of SWORD ART ONLINE Fractured Daydream is priced at $84.99 and includes three days of early access, Character Pass Vol.1 (DLC 1 Worlds Beyond 1 and DLC 2 Worlds Beyond 2), a Bonus Stamp Set, and a Prism Heart Costume Set. Finally, the Premium Edition is priced at $99.99 and adds a Wild Joker Dress and a digital artbook + soundtrack combo to the aforementioned items.</p>
<p>Here's the official overview provided by the developers:</p>

			<p>Although there has been a relative deluge of high quality indie games released over the past few months, Crow Country has been at the top of my wishlist since I checked out the demo last year. Offering a combination of classic survival horror gameplay and PS1-influenced aesthetics, it nails both and offers a gaming experience that manages to feel innovative and nostalgic at the same time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crow Country - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YP2gQszmHM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>When you first start up Crow Country the retro aesthetic hits you with its fusion of pre-rendered backgrounds and polygonal characters. Such is the wave of nostalgia that it took me a while to realise that you can freely move the camera to examine the environments rather than being restricted to fixed angles. Once you do pick up on this full control however, you’ll quickly find that the various locations have items, secrets, and hidden details to find throughout. The visual design is excellent and interactive spots are easy to distinguish despite the initially busy artstyle.</p>


<p>You play as Special Agent Mara Forest, a mysterious investigator and firearms expert who may be more than they first seem. Mara is sent to investigate the derelict theme park, Crow Country, after a missing person’s report is filed for the park’s owner. Once Mara makes it to Crow Country, however, it soon becomes clear that there is something odd happening there. The narrative is revealed skilfully through a series of notes and newspaper articles scattered around the park, alongside conversations with the few survivors you meet along the way.</p>


<p>Beginning with a trusty pistol and a trunk full of bullets (handy for when you run out in the early game) Mara can find a range of traditional weapons to help her fight off the many strange creatures she faces. While many of these can be avoided in classic survival horror fashion, doing so can lead areas to become especially crowded and dangerous when tracking back – and tracking back is something you’ll be doing a lot of during Crow Country’s runtime. The map is relatively small but every space plays an important part with many packed with puzzles to solve and enemies to deal with.</p>
<p>Controls are smooth and responsive with classic and modern options available. Perhaps most crucially, the devs have thought to offer tank controls on the D-pad and modern on the analogue stick, a feature that I have long argued all survival horror games should have. That being said, the tank controls are less essential here than in fixed camera games and I mostly stuck with the modern ones. My only real criticism of the game is the lack of Resident Evil style snap aiming as it can sometimes be difficult to judge angles (although laser sights are hidden around the map for each of your weapons).</p>

<p>The puzzles here are refreshingly logical on the whole and offer a pleasant aspect of gameplay rather than any particular roadblock. Most revolve around finding the right item and using it in the correct spot but there are more complicated riddles which hide secrets across the map. Solving these is optional but the rewards will definitely help you out – whilst finding all of them is needed to unlock the higher completion ranks. Much like recent Resident Evil games, finishing with a better rank gives you special items to play through again, and a Hard mode is in the works for a free addition soon.</p>
<p>Crow Country isn’t an especially long game, but what’s here is so well designed that it’ll leave you wanting more without feeling short-changed. My initial playthrough took about four hours and then I ran through a second time in the no combat mode to hunt for the secrets I missed. I’ll be looking to aim for the Platinum by doing at least one more run to get the S rank as well so there’s a decent amount of content.</p>

			<p>Surgent Studios, the developer behind the recently-released Tales of Kenzera ZAU, is the next game studio hit by layoffs.</p>
<p>Following a massive way of layoffs this year at numerous studios, including both large and smaller developers, the studio founded by actor Abubakar Salim is now also hit by layoffs. Some days ago, several developers at the studio already <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raysura.bsky.social/post/3kw6b3osppn2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that layoffs <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213858949022785538/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be inbound</a>, and on X, the studio has <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now confirmed</a> that a "dozen people" will be losing their jobs.</p>
<p><em>"Unfortunately, Surgent has joined the growing number of games studios impacted by layoffs this year with over a dozen people affected"</em>, the official statement from the studio reads.</p>
<p><em>"It's a difficult time in the games industry, but we remain incredibly proud of our entire team's work on ZAU and of the praise it has received from critics and players alike. Our focus now is on supporting those affected, continuing our work on ZAU, and looking to the future with out next creative projects."<br>
</em></p>
<p>Following this dreadful news, founder Salim also <a href="https://x.com/Abzybabzy/status/1808221598983544959" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> to address the layoffs and to ask for help from the community in finding new positions for those affected. "Thank you so much to those who have checked in", he wrote. "This hurts deeply. This isn't the news I wanted to share today."</p>
<p>He added, "So to be delivering this news today really sucks. I know we're not alone here, but that doesn't make it easier. The focus now is to continue supporting those affected in anyway we can. I will be replying to this with links to posts from our affected team members."</p>
<p>We can only wish those affected by the layoffs and Surgent Studios the best going forward.</p>
<p>Published by EA under the EA Originals labels,&nbsp;Tales of Kenzera: ZAU was released back in April of this year for PC and consoles. We spoke highly of the Metroidvania our<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-spiritual-healing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> launch review</a> back then.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Kenzera: ZAU proves that innovation isn't always necessary to craft a compelling experience. With its heartfelt story, compelling protagonist, and solid metroidvania gameplay featuring excellent pacing, Zau's journey is one that resonates, especially for those grappling with similar grief to the young shaman.</em></p>

<p>NASCAR has announced a first-of-its-kind link-up with Fortnite, with the arrival of the all-new Chicago Street Course map in Rocket Racing, the fresh and popular side mode that makes up a key part of Fortnite’s ecosystem. It has been six months since Rocket Racing was released in Fortnite alongside Fortnite Festival, the Guitar Hero-like mode that has proven to be a rampant success.</p>



<p>With the recent announcement, NASCAR confirmed that further activations will make their way into the Fortnite landscape, but it all begins with the Chicago Street Course.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-perfect-blend">The Perfect Blend</h2>



<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7213931787578732546/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in a statement</a> published on LinkedIn, the Managing Director of Gaming and Esports at NASCAR, Nick Rend, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Chicago Street Course map lets players navigate multiple routes, master the art of speed, drift, and avoid obstacles in intense multiplayer races or solo time trials. This launch comes ahead of the real-life Chicago Street Race taking place in Grant Park on July 6-7, giving fans and new players alike an immersive preview of the event.</p>



<p>Looking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we have exciting plans to bring more NASCAR elements to the Fortnite platform. Stay tuned for updates on new tracks, licensed vehicles, and other immersive experiences that will connect with our fans in innovative ways.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s available on all platforms in both single-player and multiplayer formats, and it promises to blend ‘the excitement of real-world NASCAR events with Rocket Racing’s dynamic gameplay mechanics.’</p>



<p>Over time, more brands are finding their way into the Fortnite ecosystem with custom creations. The UEFN was just the start, and the 2.0 version combined with the unparalleled opportunities it presents has blown the landscape wide open. If it wasn’t enough that Fortnite has partnered with the likes of Marvel, DC, Netflix, and all manner of super-sized corporations over the years, the new model now allows brands to set up their presence in Fortnite and use the platform as a free marketing opportunity.</p>

<p>Capcom has just announced the acquisition of Minimum Studios, an animation company that has worked with Capcom extensively in the past. Minimum specialises in face and body animation and most recently contributed to the development of Dragon’s Dogma 2. The Taiwanese company was acquired through a share purchase, with Capcom paying the equivalent of just $27,000 to secure the studio. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240701.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a> published by Capcom to announce the acquisition, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Based in Taiwan, Minimum Studios’ strength lies in animation production for consumer home video game development, and the studio has carried out work on major Capcom titles in the past. Capcom decided to make the studio its subsidiary company to sustainably bolster its developmental and technological capabilities, aiming to achieve its long-term management goal of 100 million units in annual sales.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, Capcom confirmed the ongoing development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/">of a new Resident Evil game</a>, which is being led by the director of Resident Evil 7. Nothing is known about the game, but it was said that it’s going to be a substantial offering, suggesting it’ll be bigger than recent titles, including Resident Evil Village.</p>



<p>Capcom also lifted the lid on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date/">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> last week. It has been dubbed more of a remake than a remaster, and it’s coming on September 19.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s first season is officially here and players are exploring all it has to offer, from the new GSK faction to the fresh weapons introduced to bolster the already considerable line-up. However, there’s one part of the recent update that’s proving to be a sticking point with players worldwide.</p>



<p>When ushering in Season One, Ubisoft tweaked the ‘Spiderbot’ ability that’s basically the bread and butter of the DedSec faction, making it so that you can no longer instantly remove it from your face when it jumps at you and attacks.</p>



<p>This has understandably vexed fans the world over.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-impossible-to-defend">Impossible to Defend</h2>



<p>The Spiderbot has been an issue since players started unlocking and running the DedSec faction in Ubisoft’s fresh first-person shooter. It scurries along the floor almost unnoticed and then leaps at your face, stunning you for a few seconds before imploding. When it hits, you can’t see and you’re rendered almost completely immobile – and if that doesn’t sound bad enough, consider that there’s almost no way to defend against it.</p>



<p>If you see it fast enough, you can shoot it, or you can hack it if <strong>you’re </strong>playing as a DedSec faction member. The go-to defence originally was to look down and shoot, which 90% of the time would result in the Spiderbot instantly falling off. It could have been a bug, but it worked.</p>



<p>Now, Ubisoft has updated the Spiderbot and made it so that this defence tactic doesn’t work. If you don’t see it coming, it’s tough – you’re going to be stunned, and that’s that. Now, players are running the Spiderbot en-masse, with entire teams taking up the DedSec mantle to get their hands on this OP ability that can lock off a squad’s ability to fight in a matter of seconds.</p>



<p>Awkward.</p>

<h2><strong>“Ghost on the Road” by A Shell in the Pit</strong></h2>



<p>Any road trip can be boiled down to its soundtrack: what playlist you made, what podcast you downloaded, what radio station held on for most of the way. My time with <em>Pacific Drive</em> is no exception, as developer Ironwood Studios pack the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2tBP1dwFaPhamQJOuqo3nv">in-game radio</a> with 26 songs from 27 credited artists. For as familiar as I become with each individual track, hearing them countless times for more than 30 hours, I never spot an obvious order, with one specific tune always following another.</p>



<p>The first one that plays, though, is always “<a href="https://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/ghost-on-the-road">Ghost on the Road</a>” by A Shell in the Pit. The song starts right as I slide into my nameless driver’s POV for the first time and turn the key in the ignition. It’s the 90s, so I check a physical map for instructions (“Stay on the roads”) and toss it into the vacant passenger seat—only the car radio accompanies me on this trip, a delivery to the mysterious Olympic Exclusion Zone that has swallowed the northwestern United States.</p>



<p>The opening guitars are dramatic, almost ill-fitting for my unhurried tutorial journey across winding, wooded roads. It feels like a “real” radio song in that way, not created or curated for a fictional moment so much as emerging by chance out of the waves. The sky grays into rain clouds, as though rising to meet the ominous pitch of the song, which gives way to apocalyptic lyrics over a heartbeat pulse: “Sulfur and smoke” and “rivers for spines / between the dry pines / over bones unbecoming.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I start the windshield wipers to clear off the raindrops, flip on the headlights to show me the way toward the vast gray walls surrounding my destination. The music garbles into static and then silence. The terrain flickers and bubbles into a vortex that swallows me up, spitting me out on the other side of the Zone’s concrete enclosure. The car does not travel with me, but as I stumble on foot through irradiated brush, I come upon another vehicle: a station wagon shining a single headlight beam into the poison air.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>It takes me a while to start the music in the new car. At first, the airwaves are occupied by two of the Zone’s quirky residents, who direct me to shelter at an abandoned auto shop that will become my home base for the entire game. Attached to a dingy old gas station, it’s the former stomping ground of Dr. Ophelia “Oppy” Turner, a prickly old scientist who once worked for ARDA, the company at the center of whatever incident birthed the Zone. (And yes, in a happy accident of cultural synergy, we now all know that “Oppy” was also the nickname of J. Robert Oppenheimer.)</p>



<p>I never meet these characters in-person. Oppy and the others are only ever disembodied voices, not so different from the soundtrack in that way. And it’s not until after they go silent that my first-person POV brushes over the ceiling-mounted radio, while I’m fiddling with the big terminal that Oppy has me dig up and install over the passenger seat.</p>



<p>I don’t remember what played the first time I switched on that radio. The song that springs to mind, though, is “<a href="https://leonlive.com/track/2504830/doctor-juice">Doctor Juice</a>.” Even before I had heard every song several times over, I could immediately pick out this dirty, bluesy ditty from the sleazy guitar riff, the cricket chirp of the backbeat. Sound carries differently depending on how high I set the radio volume, as well as whether I’ve left a car door open and where I’m standing in relation to it. Up until I discover the garage jukebox, I tune up the station wagon with the passenger-side door ajar because it faces the workbench.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These details are everything in <em>Pacific Drive</em>. I can hit a shortcut key for the windshield wipers, but I can also click on the levers near the steering wheel to start them instead. I take slight damage if I close the trunk while standing directly beneath it. Being able to use the radio, to “skip” songs by tuning to another station, is as crucial as any of these small touches to making the car feel tangible, a physical object taking up space in front of me.</p>



<p>Out in the Zone, I get used to hearing the “Doctor Juice” chorus, the repeated croak of “Doctor Juice / Sister Squeeze,” and if I hear the volume fade, that means the car is moving away from where I left it. Sometimes, that’s because a Zone entity has gotten hold of the vehicle, dragging it away with a dangling magnet or zapping the engine to make it charge forward. Other times, it means that I forgot to set the parking brake.</p>



<h2><strong>“Forty Fives Say Six Six Six” by King Dude</strong></h2>



<p>I should say, “Doctor Juice” is not quite typical for <em>Pacific Drive</em>’s radio. There’s variety to be sure: the synth instrumentals of Eyeliner’s “<a href="https://orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/track/los-angeles">Los Angeles</a>”, the ethereal longing of Lemolo’s dream pop “<a href="https://lemolomusic.bandcamp.com/album/swansea">Swansea</a>”, the brassy gospel of Mark Crawford and Kenny Lee Young’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh9YAWkQh34">Holy Mystery</a>.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Much of the soundtrack, though, is of a piece with “Ghost on the Road”, skewing toward rock and especially downbeat folk. King Dude’s “<a href="https://kingdude.bandcamp.com/track/forty-fives-say-six-six-six">Forty Fives Say Six Six Six</a>” is the most sinister of the bunch, made up of spare acoustic guitar strums and a blasphemous gravel whisper: “Don’t believe in the crucifix” and variations on “All his 45s say 666.” These moodier moments reflect the tensions inherent to traveling the Zone, where the terrain always changes and there’s no mid-game save to fall back on. Everything I need is out there—the raw materials for all manner of upgrades to the station wagon, my own survivability, or the garage itself—and in true survival roguelike fashion, I lose much of my loot if I don’t make it back in one piece.</p>



<p>To return to Oppy’s garage, I have to tear open a portal using energy I’ve accumulated from mechanical orbs across the Zone. The catch is that these orbs act as stabilizers for the ever-shifting terrain, so removing one throws the surrounding area into flux. I’ve snatched an orb and then booked it for the station wagon only for the vehicle to shoot skyward because a geyser suddenly opened underneath.</p>



<p>Other fluctuations occur simply from sticking around too long. Radiation migrates, enemies travel, and storms of area-destroying instability begin swallowing the entire map, which is also what happens as soon as I spawn an exit portal. As careful and as thorough as I might try to be, sometimes I have no choice but to floor it, risking whatever damage may come from a frantic, off-road exit.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a game of repetition. I go out into the Zone, I scavenge materials, I hear “Doctor Juice / Sister Squeeze” again, I return to the garage, I make repairs.</p>



<p>And how the car needs repairs. Each piece takes individual damage, and deeper into the Zone, one enemy will outright remove parts and fly off with them. Every time I return to the garage, there’s something to work on (and often before that, if I have a spare moment out in the Zone). I get out and I slather on some repair putty, or I break out the blowtorch. Left unchecked, a car part can develop permanent damage, and the only thing to do at that point is find a replacement, which means crafting, which means finding the materials out in the Zone, which is painless enough (at first, anyway).</p>



<h2><strong>“The Freeze” by Worse in Person</strong></h2>



<p>I don’t recognize anything on the soundtrack, and I like it that way—most of the artists are either local to the Pacific Northwest or have roots in the area, with Spotify listener counts ranging from upwards of 90,000 to just shy of 3,000. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/consoles-pc/a-shell-in-the-pits-studio-director-talks-us-through-pacific-drives-radio-soundtrack-and-his-song-ghost-on-the-road">Apart from “Ghost on the Road”,</a> none of the songs in <em>Pacific Drive</em> were designed for it, and that’s probably why they work so well, fueling the atmosphere without calling too much attention to themselves. They are not era-accurate, but they feel broadly appropriate.</p>



<p>Worse in Person’s punky anthem “The Freeze”, for example, could slot right into a 90s playlist between trumpet blasts of ska, even though the song is modern. Its <a href="https://worseinperson.bandcamp.com/track/the-freeze-2">Bandcamp page</a> says “2020,” and there’s a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/k8i5a2/worse_in_person_the_freeze_a_song_about_the/">Reddit thread</a> from the same year soliciting feedback. The lyrics shout out Bill Nye, that most 90s of science icons, but a line like “My phone, I fuckin’ dropped it” would conjure a much different image to a pre-2000 listener.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p><em>Pacific Drive</em> isn’t meant to be an exact recreation of the 1990s—the game plays out in an alternate history, after all—but the signifiers of the era go much deeper than nostalgic window dressing. All that chunky technology is crucial to what the game is going for, a tactility that’s worlds apart from modern, Apple-esque minimalism. At the center of that sensibility is the station wagon itself, an uncool emblem of a time before car companies had so de-emphasized the owner’s capacity for home repair.</p>



<p>Oh, and a lot of the lyrics involve cars. Maybe that sounds a little on the nose, but in practice, it’s quite broad, given the prevalence of cars and driving as metaphor. To tap into world-weariness and overall powerlessness, “The Freeze” uses the imagery of driving a junker: “My tires have gone flat / I did not forget I neglected to pump them / The paint is chipped and the brakes are squeaking / I’m burning oil and something’s leaking.”</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>The car lyrics are everywhere when you start looking for them, even in the broadest possible terms. “Doctor Juice,” which the artist’s website <a href="https://leonlive.com/track/2504830/doctor-juice">alleges</a> is about an “overzealous chiropractor”, becomes about repairing your vehicle: “She said she would fix my body / in that old-fashion way.” Then, I suppose, there’s “juice” as in the car battery or the gasoline (the Zone has advanced beyond the need for oil), even though in context it’s clearly the, uh, aftermath of when the good doctor “squeezed me till I popped.”</p>



<p>On its own, the car maintenance doesn’t get on my nerves. It’s inconvenient yet still simplified, and it needs to be a bit of both so it can feel purposeful without feeling like directionless tedium. To achieve the elusive ideal of video game immersion, of tangibility and tactility, there’s a sweet spot that a menu screen option to fix everything simply does not reach.</p>



<p>The problem is everything that goes along with the maintenance, the crafting and the scavenging and the traveling in order to do the scavenging. In the early hours of <em>Pacific Drive</em>, scavenging is a simple matter of poking through rusted-out wrecks and abandoned ARDA trailers. I open their containers and hit “transfer all”, heedless of how many different material types there are because any amount of scavenging reliably gets me what I need.</p>



<p>But as the game goes on, the ingredient lists only get longer and more complex. I start needing to track down specific materials before I can proceed, some only found deep in the Zone. Others require certain tools that not only take up inventory space but have limited durability themselves. Everything needs to be replaced eventually.</p>



<h2><strong>“Puzzle Pieces” by Lemon Boy</strong></h2>



<p>Pieces, car parts. “You’re going way too slow.” You get the idea. We create meaning as much from content as we do from context, from when and where we hear something. We stitch ourselves into the middle of music that speaks to us, as though the singer IS speaking to us.</p>



<p>Lemon Boy’s “<a href="https://lemonboyband.bandcamp.com/track/puzzle-pieces">Puzzle Pieces</a>” didn’t start out as one of my favorites, but it grew on me over time. Repeated exposure will do that on occasion, fortifying something in your mind rather than wiling away at what you once liked so much. The more I paid attention to the lyrics, the more I felt the raw emotion of the relationship they describe, the desire to do everything for a person: “If you want to, I can be there for you / To pick up all of the pieces / Drag them out.” The singer pitches her voice up on the chorus, as though hedging a bit: I can, and I will, but only if you want to.</p>



<p>Only through repetition does my interaction with the station wagon become a relationship of sorts, much more authentic than the one with Oppy and the other radio folk. The game never gives me a transmitter to respond, so they’re always talking at me rather than with me.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The car, though, involves give and take. I have to maintain the thing, not just patching it up but pumping gas and charging the battery and applying my favored wood paneling to any replacement parts. In return, it gets me around the Zone while holding my scavenged items and acting as my shield, insulating my fragile human body from bolts of electricity or globs of corrosive ooze. I cringe when I ram into a tree, because I know that somebody is going to have to fix the damage, and that somebody is me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Relationships take work. Some of them take too much work.</p>



<h2><strong>“Doctor Juice” by Leon Laudenbach</strong></h2>



<p>We listen to media on a drive to occupy ourselves, to distract from how we are sitting in the same position in the same vehicle traveling through a landscape that does not change all that much. The same road cutting through similar fields. With the decline of physical media and the rise of streaming services, there’s an endless rotation of listening material to help ride out the monotony, as long as you’ve got the data plan for it (or at least the foresight to plan some downloads ahead of time).</p>



<p>It seems almost appropriate, then, that the 90s-set <em>Pacific Drive</em> is stuck without enough music to last the whole trip, like someone who forgot a binder full of CDs on a bed or a kitchen table. 26 songs sounds like a lot until that 101 minutes of music has to occupy more than 30 hours of drive time.</p>



<p>And as the soundtrack loses its luster, the monotony grows more intense. The portals I use to conveniently return to the garage are a one-way trip; if I want to get back to some deep-Zone resource hotspot, I need to drive there all over again. The terrain may change every time, but I’m no longer paying attention to the terrain, no longer even stopping—it’s nothing more than the distance between the garage and where I need to go. Road trips are novelties, a once-in-while attraction; the late game of <em>Pacific Drive</em> becomes a commute.</p>

</figure>



<p>The line between immersion and busywork is razor-thin, and here, the game shifts from one to the other with just a few adjusted variables and a dwindling distraction. I see the resource requirement on the crafting menu, and I groan that I’m missing one thing because all the details that so enraptured me are now miniature roadblocks. I know getting it means more listless cruising through the early Zone, more stopping to grab an orb, more setting the parking brake while I open the trunk to dig around for the tire patching kit.</p>



<p>I still have the radio on. It seems better than silence, but when I hear the opening chirp and swagger of “Doctor Juice”, I change the station.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming size and popularity of Genshin Impact, plenty of players (myself included) still don’t know much about the game or its studio. Now, with a second title set in a post-apocalyptic futuristic haven, players have questions. Namely, what kind of game is Zenless Zone Zero?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-zenless-zone-zero">What is Zenless Zone Zero?</h2>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero, an extremely nondescript name, is a free-to-play action role-playing game by HoYoverse, the studio behind Genshin Impact. It follows a similar gameplay style, with players assuming the role of a character known as a Proxy, who helps other characters explore alternate dimensions. Inside these dimensions, however, lies all manner of nasty creatures and begins, leading to the game’s frantic and flashy combat. </p>



<p>Zenless Zone Zero features real-time combat with roguelike elements. Additionally, to complement these features, you’ll participate in story and side quests, uncovering the mysteries of the post-apocalyptic world you explore and battle through. Furthermore, along the journey, you’ll meet interesting characters, find loot and battle creatures, and focus on the perfect team composition to win said encounters.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-zenless-zone-zero">How to Play Zenless Zone Zero</h2>



<p>There are only a few platforms and storefronts where you can play Zenless Zone Zero upon release. These include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>iOS</strong></li>



<li><strong>Android</strong></li>



<li><strong>PC (Epic Games Store)</strong></li>



<li><strong>PlayStation 5</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>There is no word about Zenless Zone Zero coming to Steam or Xbox Series X|S, unfortunately. Considering the studio’s last game, Genshin Impact didn’t launch on either, it’s doubtful ZZZ will step out as the oddball. </p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re keeping an eye on Zenless Zone Zero, then you might also want to know how to obtain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-kuiper-shards-in-the-first-descendant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kuiper Shards in The First Descendant</a>!

<p>As a free-to-play game, more of us are liable to download and try Zenless Zone Zero on a whim than if it were a full-priced title. But with more people keen on giving it a go, knowing whether to not your system can run the game proves paramount. Here are the Zenless Zone Zero PC requirements!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-are-the-zenless-zone-zero-system-requirements-on-pc">Here Are the Zenless Zone Zero System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>Overall, you’ll find the PC system requirements for Zenless Zone Zero are actually rather accommodating for old hardware. You can run the game on a laptop relatively well, but if you have a gaming desktop, don’t be afraid to push the graphical settings to their max to test out the art style to its fullest!</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or later</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 7th Gen Intel Core i5</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 57 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or later</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 10th Gen Intel Core i7</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 8 GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 57 GB (SSD Recommended)</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-where-to-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-pc">Where to Play Zenless Zone Zero on PC</h2>



<p>Currently, there is only one place to download and play Zenless Zone Zero on PC, and that’s through the Epic Games Store. The studio’s previous title, Genshin Impact, also launched exclusively on the EGS, and it never wound up launching on Steam at a later date.</p>



<p>We fully expect Zenless Zone Zero to follow suit. So, if you wish to play the action RPG, specifically on PC, then you must download the Epic Games Store!</p>

Along the way, she'll use a special power to interact with phantoms scattered through the world, enabling her to unleash unique abilities in combat. Throughout the journey, you'll meet over 50 characters and attempt to master over 300 skills--giving you plenty of ways to customize your fighting style. Toss in a tactical turn-based system that uses free movement on a gridless map, and you've got a strategic RPG that's shaping up to be a great successor to the original Phantom Brave from 2004.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Another month has dawned, and that means Humble has another bundle of PC games available for its Humble Choice subscribers ($12/month). This month, there are eight games available in the bundle, including some big-name indie sequels like A Plague Tale: Requiem and Ghostrunner 2, plus a selection of shooters, strategy games, and action games, all of which are yours to keep forever, even if you cancel your Humble Choice subscription. On top of the games, this month's bundle also includes a surprising bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which lets you read thousands of DC Comics in the DC Universe app. </p><h2>Humble Choice July 2024 games</h2><ul><li>Ghostrunner 2</li><li>A Plague Tale: Requiem</li><li>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</li><li>Sticky Business</li><li>Zoeti</li><li>Figment 2: Creed Valley</li><li>Heretic's Fork</li><li>Hyperviolent</li><li>Bonus: One-month subscription to DC Universe Infinite</li></ul><p>This month's headliner is <strong>A Plague Tale: Requiem</strong>, a steath/action sequel about a teen girl and her little brother trying to survive during the Black Death. It's a particularly fascinating sequel, because the first game came out in late 2019 just months before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Reqiuem was released in 2022--you can see in this game a bit of that shift in perspective that we all experienced over the past four years.</p><p><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong>, another glossy indie, is a parkour-based action game in which the player and their enemies alike die with a single hit from a blade--this franchise is like Mirror's Edge and Dishonored had a baby that was really intense but also fun. And it's nice to have a hardcore action game that skews away from soulslike norms.</p><p>Moving away from the action genre, we've got <strong>Starship Troopers: Terran Command</strong>, a real-time strategy title that's all about humans vs arachnids. If you've been enjoying the Starship Troopers-esque Helldivers 2 and are itching for a change of pace, Terran Command will hit the spot.</p><p>What's cool about Humble Choice is the variety you get from the bundle each month, and July's has some particularly interesting titles. Like <strong>Sticky Business</strong>, a game about designing stickers and selling them online--Etsy Simulator, basically. Then there's a pair of deck-builders--turn-based rogue-lite <strong>Zoeti</strong>, and the casually quirky <strong>Heretic's Fork</strong>. <strong>Figment 2: Creed Valley,</strong> meanwhile, is a well-timed choice, because it's a franchise that takes place in the human mind, with a player character who is an emotion--it's a game that pairs well with a viewing of Inside Out 2. And no Humble Choice would be complete without a boomer shooter, and this month it's <strong>Hyperviolent</strong>, which plays like Doom but has the atmosphere and structure of System Shock.</p><p>And, finally, a bonus: a month of DC Universe Infinite, which will give you access to thousands of digital comics from DC in the DC Universe app and on the web. A month of DC Universe usually costs $8, and a normal free trial for the service is only seven days. So this is a nice little addition.</p><p><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-14555742%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fmembership%2Fhome&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhumble-choice-july-2024-bundle-includes-a-plague-tale-ghostrunner-2-starship-troopers-and-more%2F1100-6524664%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A subscription to Humble Choice will run you $12 per month or $129 for a year</a>. As soon as you sign up, you'll be able to access Steam keys for all eight games in the bundle, as well as a code for the DC Universe Infinite trial. Since you're getting Steam codes for the games, that means you get to keep them forever. And while you're subscribed, you'll get discounts from the Humble Store, and access to a rotating library of indie PC games.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Like everything else in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">The Final Shape</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-iron-banner-guide/1100-6524661/" data-ref-id="1100-6524661">Iron Banner</a> has been altered. The PvP event now sports a two-week duration instead of one and is adding two weapons to its current pool of rewards--both of which are former Iron Banner weapons that now have new perks and rolls. The first of those, Claws of the Wolf, is an extremely deadly pulse rifle with a lot of aim assist that might help you snap some headshots over the next two weeks of competition.</p><p dir="ltr">You can get Claws of the Wolf easily enough from Iron Banner, but there are a lot of combinations you probably won't want, especially with its mixed-up perk pool. Here's how you can nab Claws of the Wolf and what perks are worth chasing on it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Claws_Of_The_Wolf">How To Get Claws Of The Wolf</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that Claws of the Wolf is back in the Iron Banner loot pool, there are a couple of ways to get ahold of one. The simplest is to just play Iron Banner matches--there's a chance that, with each match, you'll get a random weapon or armor drop, and that drop might be Claws of the Wolf. Even with only playing a handful of matches, I've already nabbed two, and since there are so many Pinnacle rewards and Iron Banner challenges to complete, odds are good that you'll get a few without any thought required.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't get a lucky drop early on, though, you're guaranteed a Claws of the Wolf for ranking up your Iron Banner reputation. The reward at reputation level 4 is one of these pulse rifles, which will add it to your Collections. At that point, you can expect it to drop from random Iron Banner engrams, and you're also able to focus those engrams to get more Claws of the Wolf from Lord Saladin.</p><p dir="ltr">Like the other reputation vendors, Saladin offers the ability to focus engrams into specific weapon drops, allowing you to choose the thing you get (although the cost is higher than if you let the engrams drop a random item instead). So once you've got Claws of the Wolf, you can burn your stocked Iron Banner engrams for new drops in an attempt to get the roll you want.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328200"></a><figcaption>Claws of the Wolf</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4328200-20240702112242_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_God_Rolls">Claws Of The Wolf God Rolls</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvP_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Arrowhead Break: +30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Ricochet Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+5 Range, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Headseeker / To The Pain  <ul><li dir="ltr">Headseeker: Body shots increase precision damage and aim assist for a short period of time. Body shots landed while the perk is active refresh the time.</li><li dir="ltr">To The Pain: While this weapon is equipped, taking damage increases handling and aim assist until this weapon is stowed. Taking more damage increases the effect.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Zen Moment / Rampage  <ul><li dir="ltr">Zen Moment: Causing damage with this weapon reduces recoil and flinch over time.</li><li dir="ltr">Rampage: Kills with this weapon temporarily grant increased damage. Stacks up to three times.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are a few good combinations for Claws of the Wolf in the Crucible, depending a bit on your playstyle and what you're going for. Generally, you want to favor stats like Range and Stability in your barrel and magazine choices, although if you really like Kill Clip, try to boost Reload Speed.</p><p dir="ltr">The main benefit of Claws of the Wolf is that, while its bullets don't hit too hard, it fires <em>extremely</em> quickly and pretty accurately. Thus, pairing Headseeker, which gives you increased precision damage when you land body shots, and Zen Moment, which increases your aim assist and decreases your flinch the more you land shots, leans into the accuracy Claws of the Wolf already sports. You're firing so many bullets so quickly that you're getting a lot of benefit out of the synergy.</p><p dir="ltr">Alternatively, To The Pain, a new perk in The Final Shape, gives you a similar benefit when you're under fire, increasing your aim assist as you duel and boosting your handling--great if you need to quickly whip out a shotgun to seal the deal. Zen Moment can also pair with To The Pain, but if you'd prefer a damage perk, Rampage gives you a 10% boost when you land a kill, which can help knock down secondary targets. Kill Clip can be even better--the damage boost is 25% when you reload within three seconds of a kill--but the reload on Claws of the Wolf can be painfully slow, so Rampage's automatic activation might be the better call.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Claws_Of_The_Wolf_PvE_God_Roll">Claws Of The Wolf PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Arrowhead Break  <ul><li dir="ltr">+30 Recoil, +10 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Flared Magwell  <ul><li dir="ltr">+15 Reload speed, +5 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Repulsor Brace  <ul><li dir="ltr">Defeating a Void-debuffed target grants an overshield.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Destabilizing Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows cause nearby targets to become Volatile.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Though it's not really a PvE weapon in most cases, Claws of the Wolf does benefit from the Void double-whammy of Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds, giving it some serious synergy with Void builds. To start, though, your choices on barrel and magazine are pretty open, but Handling and Reload Speed are good places to put your focus; Range and Stability matter a lot less when you're not fighting other Guardians.</p><p dir="ltr">Your main focus is on getting Repulsor Brace and Destabilizing Rounds together, which gives Claws of the Wolf some serious power in PvE. First, Destabilizing Rounds cause targets near any enemy you kill to become Volatile, which debuffs them and makes them explore, spreading around more Volatile. If you use Claws to kill a Volatile enemy, you'll trigger Repulsor Brace, which gives you an overshield. So especially when dealing with groups of weak enemies, the combination creates its own feedback loop that makes your killing more effective and your defense even stronger. Add this combo to a Void build that spreads around and takes advantage of more debuffs, and you'll get even more shields for your trouble.</p><p>Check out the rest of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">guides for The Final Shape</a> for god rolls and more.</p>

Numerous companies also <a href="https://x.com/Vahn16/status/1805653300433633471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">washed their hands</a> of the suddenly-radioactive streamer, including 2K Games, which said it intends to <a href="https://dexerto.com/nba-2k/nba-2k-to-remove-dr-disrespect-content-following-twitch-ban-scandal-2798463/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch Dr Disrespect out of <em>NBA 2K24</em></a>. However, a small handful of other video game companies remain conspicuously silent on the matter.</p><p>PUBG Studios, Battlestate Games, and Hi-Rez Studios – the studios behind <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Escape From Tarkov</em>, and <em>Rogue Company</em>, respectively – have yet to say what they intend to do about the presence of Dr Disrespect-themed cosmetics in their games. In the latter’s case, Hi-Rez appears to have <a href="https://x.com/BravaBackshots/status/1806461920792203736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quietly disabled <em>Rogue Company</em>’s Dr Disrespect skin</a>, but while <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/it_be_pretty_disrespectful_if_theres_not_a_refund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community chatter suggests</a> that a refund is on the way for those who purchased the skin, the company hasn’t confirmed this via any of its official channels. The game also contains a Dr Disrespect-themed level called The Arena, which players who claim to have spoken with Hi-Rez say <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RogueCompany/comments/1dq745e/comment/lanjz8l/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be removed</a>. Aftermath reached out to Hi-Rez multiple times but did not receive a response.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, there does not appear to be any motion on <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Tarkov</em>’s ends, despite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EscapefromTarkov/comments/1dog8vs/take_dr_disrespect_armor_out_of_the_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requests from <em>Tarkov </em>players</a> to remove official Dr Disrespect armor, which can be found and equipped during matches. <em>PUBG</em>, on the other hand, added Dr Disrespect weapon skins as part of a limited-time promotion <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/578080/view/4580680095902954038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the way back in 2018</a>, meaning they’re pretty hard to come by these days. Neither Battlestate Games nor PUBG Studios replied to requests for comment from Aftermath.</p><p>Scrubbing in-game items and issuing refunds where necessary is likely a more complicated process than terminating a deal with the disgraced streamer, but it’s still notable that while the likes of Mountain Dew and the San Francisco 49ers moved quickly to distance themselves from Beahm, a trio of major video game companies continue to tiptoe around the issue without even cluing players in to their future plans. Perhaps they need more time, or perhaps this is simply not a priority for them.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24191083/how-to-pronounce-scadutree-elden-ring<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="vt1KBU">Was anyone going to tell me I’ve been pronouncing “scadutree” wrong, or did I have to find out from a TikTok comment?</p>
<p id="7jSsdB"><em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC introduces consumables called Scadutree fragments. These are found at Sites of Grace in the Land of Shadow, and they’re used to power up your character.</p>
<p id="eB165C">“That’s a silly-looking word,” I thought when I first read about them, mentally pronouncing it as “skad-oo-tree.”</p>
<p id="jTDG1N">But the word “scadu” is derived from the Old English “<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sceadu">sceadu</a>,” and should be pronounced more like “shadu,” or, you know, “shadow.” Shadow-tree. This information comes from distressed linguistics majors and history enthusiasts all over the internet, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1doh93s/scadutree_pronunciation/">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1805786548887003200">X</a>, and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@polygon/video/7385239706390252842">the comments of our own TiKTok page</a>.</p>
<p id="2ObjOS">This shouldn’t exactly have come as a surprise. <em>Elden Ring</em> has long used Old and Middle English, as well as Welsh and Irish words that Americans never learned to pronounce. I certainly breathed a sigh of relief when certified Irishman Cian Maher did us yanks a service by <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333">tweeting the correct pronunciation</a> of the Lands Between’s Siofra River before I ever had to say the word out loud.</p>
<div id="MQ0TsG">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gonna blow all non-Irish Elden Ring players' minds: Siofra is pronounced Sheef-rah</p>— Cian Maher (@cianmaher0) <a href="https://twitter.com/cianmaher0/status/1501160125716963333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 8, 2022</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="JXuMSc">The devotion to including Celtic languages like Welsh and Irish in translations of FromSoft games is genuinely cool. Over decades of English colonization <a href="https://www.transceltic.com/blog/deliberate-repression-of-celtic-languages">these languages were repressed, often banned</a>, and are still considered endangered.</p>
<p id="QFLwoK">Old and Middle English words like “scadu” and “gaol” are from a different linguistic family, but it’s always exciting to learn how not to embarrass myself when I talk.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24190684/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-improvements-lidar-terrain-magic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="H4NMB0">The developers of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/8/19/21374936/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-pc"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> have a lot to be proud of. Last month, at the <a href="https://flightsimexpo.com/">FlightSimExpo 2024</a> in Las Vegas, representatives crowed about their 15 million users and one billion flight sessions logged — numbers Asobo Studio claims put them at the top of the heap as the most-played flight simulation ever published. Now the studio is back on that grind cranking out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em></a>, due out this fall. Asobo calls it “the most ambitious sim ever undertaken,” and given its track record, I’m inclined to believe them.</p>
<p id="34V1gL">The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/a6riRXgRsCU?si=YsNMzmobIUpM1vDS">lengthy talk</a>, delivered by head of Microsoft Flight Simulator <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23179045/microsoft-flight-simulator-space-shuttle-update-gliders-40th-anniversary">Jörg Neumann</a> and Asobo Studio co-founder and CEO Sebastian Wloch, stretches over an hour and a half. But those 90 minutes include lots of delicious morsels for dedicated virtual pilots — enhancements such as app-based offline flight planning, increased density of ground traffic at major airports, and the ability to actually step out of the cockpit to perform pre-flight checks in first-person. </p>
<p id="8Cbmxp">But the tidbit that should turn PC and console player’s heads the most is the invocation of a new partner, a company that Microsoft recently acquired called <a href="https://www.vexcel-imaging.com/">Vexcel Imaging</a>.</p>
<p id="RUiMdw">Vexcel is a groundbreaking imaging company known for its UltraCam line of aerial survey cameras. These multi-spectrum arrays include more traditional RGB color sensors alongside near-infrared sensors. Combined with their software, the result is a dramatic increase in the resolution of image data being shared with the team of designers at Asobo — as evidenced by <em>MSFS 2024</em>’s recent teaser trailer, shown at the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p>
<div id="BvMwti"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvzlC4iCtns?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="xMISN7">Neumann used a bit of his time on stage at FlightSimExpo to let fans peek behind the curtain, so to speak, at what was actually being shown in that trailer — specifically in its opening moments as a single-engine airplane flies over Monument Valley in Arizona. </p>
<p id="4WuLN3">“The natural environments are something that people have never seen before,” Neumann said. “Not on this scale, certainly not in this level of detail.” Then he handed the reins to Wloch to go a little bit deeper. You can watch the full segment around <a href="https://youtu.be/a6riRXgRsCU?t=848">the 14-minute mark</a>. </p>
<p id="bPgT37">What’s important to understand is that previously, <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em> had been applying three-dimensional assets — things like houses and trees — automagically on top of two-dimensional data. But there’s only so far you can take that kind of automation, which is why the first time I flew over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/30/20885197/microsoft-flight-simulator-bing-maps-hands-on-demo">Great Pyramid at Giza</a>, the complex of pyramids was surrounded by a forest of oddly brown deciduous trees instead of sand dunes. Using UltraCam data to do <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/17/11251930/star-wars-battlefront-gdc-photogrammetry-at-at-foot">photogrammetry</a> — that is, 3D reconstruction of real-world elements from nothing but image data — gives Asobo’s terrain-rendering software a lot more to work with.</p>
<p id="DxWhJr">“We now have the ground, which is all 3D, instead of [...] 2D with a texture,” Wloch said. “There’s a lot of different 3D materials [including] the grass, the rocks, and the trees. Everything is now 3D [...] and everything is procedurally generated on top of the world data.”</p>
<p id="s1awiZ">But Vexcel’s camera technology isn’t standing still. This summer, <a href="https://youtu.be/LN2vAIBb0Lo?t=415">the Austrian company is adding LIDAR to its arrays</a> as well. That will likely add <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/lidar.html">altitude and relative distance</a> to the data being shared with Asobo in addition to graphical data. And that, my friends, could enable procedurally generated environments the likes of which no one has ever seen in a commercial flight simulator.</p>
<p id="FCmC5A">Expect more on <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> ahead of its <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-release-date-announcement/">Nov. 19 launch date</a>, when it will become available for purchase and as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p>The Esports World Cup is now live in Riyadh, and from here, eight weeks of competition will unravel. This staggering, industry-leading event is set to change history, boasting a $60 million prize pool and more than twenty esports titles, covering everything from CS2 to League of Legends, and from Call of Duty to Rennsport. </p>



<p>The Esports World Cup Foundation put on an opening ceremony to open the monumental event – and what a spectacle it was. Despite some of the concerns around the EWC, there’s no doubt this was one of the most impressive moments in the history of esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-event-to-remember">An Event To Remember</h2>



<p>The Esports World Cup is an all-new tournament being held in Saudi Arabia. It’s a gargantuan effort that more than 1,500 esports competitors are supporting, representing around 400 teams from a whopping 100 countries. It’s the most diverse and valuable event ever seen in the ever-developing world of esports, and it all began with a stunning opening ceremony.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2187462186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the broadcast</a>, a grand stage was showcased in Riyadh, and before long, a group of masked dancers started laying down their moves. The EWC trophy was revealed under a sky illuminated by a plethora of fireworks, and a display of LED drones paraded around, painting the EWC logo high in the sky above Saudi Arabia. </p>



<p>Behind the scenes, a panel of superstar guests and presenters welcomed esports fans from around the world, with some taking the time to present some of the tournament stages that will play host to the world’s biggest gaming organisations, all of which are headed to Riyadh with the hope of winning millions of dollars.</p>



<p>Over the next eight weeks, the Esports World Cup will play out – which organisation will secure the grand prize in the Club Championship, which comes with a cash prize worth $7 million?</p>

While The Master's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-acolyte-showrunner-kylo-ren-easter-egg-on-purpose"><u>ties to series villains like Kylo Ren</u></a> have yet to be officially revealed, his flowy armor and yoked arms owe their inspiration to a surprising source: scantily clad Elden Ring badasses like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-beats-erdtree-final-boss"><u>Let Me Solo Her</u></a>.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/leslye-headland-acolyte-episode-5-interview-star-wars-qimir-cortosis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Inverse</u></a>, The Acolyte showrunner Leslye Headland shed some light on the early character design process of <a href="https://www.starwars.com/databank/qimir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Master</a> (AKA The Stranger AKA Qimir), played by Manny Jacinto. Speaking with Inverse, Headland revealed that Qimir's look — which ditches heavy armor for minimalistic flowing garments — took visual cues from Elden Ring player summons. </p><p>"So much of Qimir was understanding how to use your body and not just standing there in a suit or being encumbered by a suit," Headland said. "We were like, 'We have to get him in something flowy.' As soon as I said he didn’t have armor, everyone lost their mind. 'How can you not have armor?' I was like, 'Why would you wear armor if you’re not going to get hit?' It’s like the Elden Ring costume. The Elden Bling. When you summon people, you always summon the people that aren’t wearing anything, and it’s like, 'These people are fucking crazy.'"</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>A Brief History of Jedi Going Out Like Punks in The Acolyte Episode 5</h3></div></output><p>At one point in the interview, Headland responded to Qimir's arms being a huge draw for newfound and longtime fans, saying she and Jacinto anticipated the reveal to be a big moment for fans. What's more, the design almost didn't get to see the light of day. </p><p>"His character design was a long process. I mean, it was for everybody, but specifically for his character, to create a new Sith. Sith have been done so well, so it was very difficult to say 'All right, this is a guy in hiding. This is the guy that moves differently. This guy’s helmet has a different purpose…' and having to unpack that," Headland said. "I remember we were showing [Jacinto] a Qimir costume sketch, and it just showed his arms a little bit, and he was like, 'No.' He’s not a guy that says no very often. He’s very collaborative. He’ll do anything for you. I was surprised. But then I saw his first screen test with the whole outfit, and I was like, “Ha, ha, ha!”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars: The Acolyte Black Series Helmet for 'The Stranger'</h3></div></output><p>Although Headland didn't explicitly state that Qmir's design was inspired by Elden Ring community legends like Let Me Solo Her, his visual motifs and fighting style do evoke the gamer's style. Let Me Solo Her made a name for themselves in the Elden Ring community as a sword for hire of sorts who'd take on some of the game's hardest boss fights for players, like Malenia. A key component of Let Me Solo Her's lore is that they would accomplish all these feats with dual blades. Qimir doesn't go so far as to fight virtually in the nude, but his lightsaber-disabling helmet, dual-blade saber, and aggressive fighting style elicit a similar combat style to seasoned Elden Ring players. </p><p>"Yeah, you have to go in with that offensive attitude, especially with those bosses," Headland said in reference to Elden Rings's boss fights. "You can’t be getting back and panic rolling. You have to be aggressive with them. You have to roll into things."</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-acolyte-episode-5-review"><u>our review</u></a>, we gave The Acolyte Episode 5 a 9/10, writing, "In a notably exciting and brutal episode, The Master is unleashed and unmasked, leading to thrilling and shocking results that truly upend the series."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.
