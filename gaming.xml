		<p>Mirage 7 has been announced by developer Drakkar Dev, whose previous release was Blackwind, and publisher Blowfish Studios. The game is very different to the mech based brawler that Blackwind is, with Mirage 7 being an action adventure game that is set in a desert part inspired by the Arabian Nights mixed with science fiction elements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moJVAdvxOoU">YouTube</a></p>


<p>“Mirage 7&nbsp;offers an unforgettable story with dynamic, narrative-driven gameplay,” said Manlio Greco, founder, Drakkar Dev. “We’ve crafted a game where daring explorers can truly immerse themselves in the world and experience a narrative that will keep them on their toes until the very end!”</p>
<p>In Mirage 7, players take on the role of an adventurer named Nadira, who is braving the desert and its dangers to reach the Palace of the Moon. Her goal is to bring her sister back from the dead. On this journey, Nadira is accompanied by Jiji, her pet lizard, who can be used to help solve the environmental puzzles that are scattered across the world. Alongside puzzles, Nadira will get in battles with various enemies, but she can use her dagger for close combat or a slingshot to get some range. There will also be choices to make as other characters try to use Nadira for their own means. Those characters include the Vizier and the Witch of Jala.</p>

<p>Mirage 7 will be available for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC and Mac via Steam, Epic Game Store, and GOG. A release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

			<p>If you've been curious about V Rising and what it feels like to be a vampire, you can sink your fangs into the game for free during the free weekend commencing September 12 and finishing on September 16. The free weekend starts at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 12 and finishes at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM BST on September 16. These five days allow those who haven't experienced the survival open-world RPG to dive deep into the world of V Rising, customize, and create their very own vampire while gaining more and more power as they defeat powerful enemies.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aB_2ZRn9F_k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Players won't be limited during the V Rising free weekend. They will have access to all the content added in the <a href="https://playvrising.com/launch-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent 1.0 update</a> to give them a proper taste of V Rising. In this game, you can either team up with friends or strangers or go your way while choosing the difficulty of your world. Whether you want to be able to go through the world and only fight mobs, or you want the possibility to encounter other vampires and kill them, too, V Rising allows you to experience both PvE and PvP, depending on your choices.</p>
<p>If you really enjoy V Rising, the base game will also be discounted by 30%, and the DLCs will be discounted by 20% if you want to add some Castlevania spice to your game. For those who don't know much about the game, there are over 57 unique bosses for you to take down, all providing their challenges. In addition, you must avoid the sunlight, otherwise you are at risk of burning to death. To really sink your teeth into the vampiric and Gothic fantasy, you can build your very own castle where you can launch raids on others and defend your castle from towering enemies that threaten to destroy everything.</p>
<p>Currently, V Rising has a very dedicated fan base of over 4.3 million players worldwide. Since the game left Early Access, it has received overwhelmingly positive reviews <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The developers are continuing to add new content and updates to the game to make it more accessible and enjoyable for those who continue to put time into it. V Rising is available on PC as well as PlayStation 5. If you want to see what V Rising has in store for you, a launch trailer showcases some of the action you can expect from playing the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battletech-creator-unveils-new-rpg-sea-of-legends-kickstarter-coming-soon.976890/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-legends-battletech-shadowrun-jordan-weisman<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Shadowrun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BattleTech&nbsp;</em>designer Jordan Weisman has announced&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends</em>, a new open-world CRPG based on the tabletop game of the same name, and it's getting a Kickstarter campaign very soon.</p>
<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>is essentially "a new&nbsp;<em>Sid Meier's Pirates&nbsp;</em>game with the tactics and narrative of&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>'s deckbuilding mechanics". Now there's an elevator pitch for the ages.</p>
<p>You'll play as a pirate who must build their reputation "from scallywag to pirate king" in a Caribbean contested not only by political factions, but also by "the denizens of the deep, the undead, and worse".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sea-of-legends-open-world-crpg-jordan-weisman-dialogue.jpg?itok=cT-MrVfL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sea-of-legends-open-world-crpg-jordan-weisman-dialogue.jpg?itok=8LsXF5wk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>will be a pirate-themed CRPG in which you'll contend with political factions, the undead, and more (although this shot is just a mock-up).</figcaption></figure><p>The dev team on&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>consists not only of Weisman, but also, appropriately enough, of several other people who might be described as legends in their own right.</p>
<p>They include&nbsp;<em>Shadowrun: Dragonfall&nbsp;</em>lead writer Andrew McIntosh,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>narrative designer Jeffery Campbell, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/skull-and-bones">Skull &amp; Bones</a>&nbsp;</em>senior concept artist Kate Cruz, plus Weisman himself, of course.</p>
<p>Weisman and his team say you'll be plundering ships, raiding towns, discovering treasure, and vanquishing your nemeses on this pirate adventure. Perhaps&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>can provide the piratical fantasy&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't quite manage to offer.</p>
<p>Combat will be driven by deckbuilding elements, and you'll develop your deck via recruiting crew members and developing characters. We don't have too much more info yet, but it's early days, after all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pillars-of-eternity-2-ship.jpg?itok=9BDVVsO3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pillars-of-eternity-2-ship.jpg?itok=t9wlqtHi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>offer the pirate fantasy&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity 2&nbsp;</em>couldn't (for me, at least)?</figcaption></figure><p>We'll get to find out whether this is a project about which the public is just as enthused as Weisman soon, because&nbsp;<em>Sea of Legends&nbsp;</em>is opening up <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jordanweisman/sea-of-legends-open-world-crpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its crowdfunding campaign</a> at the start of next month.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter for the game starts on October 1st, so you'll get a chance to support the project if you want to see it come to fruition. We'll bring you more on this one as and when we get it.</p>

The Pocket GBC Colors Edition introduces six new colors — teal, berry, kiwi, grape, and dandelion — which were the five launch colors of the Game Boy Color in 1988, plus a gold version based on a special edition of the GBC created for <em>Pokémon Gold</em>.</p><p>The GBC Colors Edition collection will be <a href="https://store.analogue.co/">available to preorder</a> in limited quantities starting on September 12th at 8AM PT / 11AM ET for $249.99 each, with shipping expected within 24 to 48 hours.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</p><div><figcaption><em>The teal version of the new Analogue Pocket GBC Colors Edition.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Analogue</cite></p></div></div><p>To ensure the new collection was closely matched in color to Nintendo’s original hardware, the company used the highest-quality “equipment, tools, and processes to achieve accuracy,” says Analogue’s CEO and founder, Christopher Taber. Those processes included referencing Game Boy Color units from “different years of production runs” and taking measurements inside the handhelds, where the colors of the plastic housings hadn’t faded from extensive use and light exposure.</p><p>The Analogue Pocket originally launched in 2021 and has been able to play original Game Boy Color cartridges since its debut, as well as carts from other handhelds like the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and the Sega Game Gear (using an adapter). Since its debut, Analogue has introduced several special editions of the Pocket, including a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848739/analogue-pocket-glow-in-the-dark-preorders">glow-in-the-dark version</a>, several with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/25/23888931/analogue-pocket-transparent-price-release-date">transparent shells</a>, and an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197135/analogue-pocket-aluminum">aluminum version</a> with a steeper $499 price tag.</p><p>The company’s next product will be a recreation of another Nintendo console. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23915941/analogue-3d-nintendo-64">Analogue 3D</a> is expected to have “100 percent compatibility” with N64 cartridges from every region along with 4K output. In addition, it should play games more accurately than emulators can since it uses field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, allowing it to function just like the original N64 hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

	<div>
		
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-confirms-ps5-pro-reveal-thanks-to-unlisted-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">After reports</a> and rumors aplenty over the past 16 months, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony has officially</a> revealed the PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro for players. The announcement came via a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-to-be-revealed-on-tuesday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">special 9 minute event</a> on PlayStation’s YouTube channel.</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro is an all-digital console with a release date of November 7. As far as price goes, it’ll retail for $699.99. That’s a $200 increase over the base PS5 that features a disc drive.</p>



<p>The console comes with a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, and a copy of Astro’s Playroom pre-installed. Should you want to add a disc drive, you can buy the separate disc drive for the console for $80.</p>



<p>As far as the look of the console goes, the design matches what was shown via leaks and teasers. The console looks similar to the base PS5 but has three black stripes on the side plate.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Now, what’s in the console? Sony is advertising a “big three” of updates for the PS5 Pro compared to the base PS5. Those include the following, courtesy of Sony:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Upgraded GPU</strong>: With PS5 Pro, we are upgrading to a GPU<strong>&nbsp;</strong>that has 67% more Compute Units&nbsp;than the current PS5 console and 28% faster memory. Overall, this enables up to 45% faster rendering for gameplay, making the experience much smoother.</li>



<li><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</li>



<li><strong>AI-Driven Upscaling</strong>: We’re also introducing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, an AI-driven upscaling that uses a machine learning-based technology to provide super sharp image clarity by adding an extraordinary amount of detail.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other features of the console include PS5 Pro Game Boost for backward compatible PS4 games on the console. It will also feature Wi-Fi 7 as well as VRR and 8K.</p>

            <p>After five years of early access and 6m copies already sold, Satisfactory has finally launched its full 1.0 version on PC.</p>
<p>From Coffee Stain Studios, Satisfactory is a first-person game in which players construct huge factories in an open, alien world.</p>
<p>This release includes a "full narrative overhaul complete with mysteries for players to uncover", along with Tier 9 content that allows players to use advanced alien tech in their builds.</p>

<p>Coffee Stain Studios has also revealed a console edition is in development following the full PC release, though no further details have been provided.</p>
<p>So what of the story? Players will be tasked with exploiting natural resources and alien artefacts to produce and transport parts via the "Space Elevator". It's all part of a mission called the Save The Day programme, though it's all shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>On top of this very important task, there are decorative pieces too for both buildings and player outfits.</p>
<p>Satisfactory was Coffee Stain's first game since the popular <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator">Goat Simulator</a> and allows up to four players to construct complex structures.</p>
<p>It launched in early access on the Epic Games Store in March 2019, followed by a Steam release in June 2020. The full version is available now on both platforms.</p>
<p>During this time in early access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/satisfactory-upgrades-to-unreal-engine-5">Satisfactory upgraded to Unreal Engine 5</a> in November 2023 and, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/satisfactory-has-sold-55m-copies-after-five-years-of-early-access-10-is-due-this-year">hit 5.5m sales</a>.</p>
<p>"The absolute last thing I want to do when landing on a beautifully unspoilt, lush and exotic alien planet is build a clunking, grey, smog-spewing factory. But that's what Satisfactory makes you do, that's what it's about, and it's both horrid and inspired," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wrenching-pleasure-of-despoiling-alien-planets-for-factories-in-satisfactory">Eurogamer's Bertie on Satisfactory</a> back at launch in 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/writing-tests-math<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once in high school, I’d finished some unnecessary standardized test early and was staring into space when a man I’d never seen before asked me what I’d thought of the reading prompts. With the know-it-all confidence only a high schooler can muster, I tore into all the ways I thought the passages sucked. When I was done, the man informed me that <em>he</em> had written the test. Instead of feeling bad for being a jerk about it, I remember thinking how sad it was that his job was to write <em>tests</em>. Little did I know that years later, writing tests would be my job too, and it would actually be pretty cool.</p><p>In my life before journalism, I often made my money grading and creating standardized tests. I had a seasonal gig evaluating reading tests, deciphering shoddily-scanned children’s handwriting and assigning it a number score. Later, I worked for a company creating math materials for standardized test prep, which would come in handy down the line when I had a stint as a narrative designer on an educational math game that was–you’ll never believe this–ultimately cancelled. I’ve also worked in schools as a teacher’s assistant (the semester after I left, my class was in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm1OADazJH0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentary</a>) and at an online tutoring company that, now I think about it, was well ahead of its time.</p><p>The math-heavy nature of a lot of this work was ironic considering that I was absolutely <em>abysmal</em> at math when I was in school. I more or less failed math every year since third grade long division, despite getting tutors and staying after school for extra help. Math is one of those things you can get in your head that you’re just naturally not good at; when the math test prep job came along, I thought about my past and was wracked with anxiety that I couldn’t actually <em>do</em> it.&nbsp;</p><p>I stuck to elementary and middle school questions, far too afraid of and traumatized by anything higher. My mom, a middle-school English teacher, sent me a bunch of curriculum materials from one of her math colleagues, which explained how teachers taught the concepts I’d struggled with as a kid. Armed with these books, the internet, and my life experience since those grades, I was shocked to find that math wasn’t as hard as I remembered, especially when I had the logic of it laid out in front of me in a more robust way than my textbooks had provided. Stuff like geometry made more sense now that I was an adult who’d actually used some of its concepts. </p><p>It also helped that each question I wrote, pegged to the <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Common Core</a>, had to adhere to strict guidelines regarding its content, difficulty level, and where it fell on <a href="https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloom's taxonomy</a>. This turned the tangled wilds of math into discrete, specific concepts both mathematically and in terms of the cognitive skills they required. But these limitations also made writing questions challenging–what is a high difficulty, complex reasoning question about <a href="https://www.thecorestandards.org/Math/Content/2/G/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">area</a> that can only involve the basic math skill of counting squares? The work required so much more than just knowing how to do elementary school math, and I had to get creative to come up with questions that met all the requirements. It was fun to put my friends’ names into word problems, and to try to think of age-appropriate, practical situations for concepts that got around the eternal complaint about learning math you’ll never use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The questions I wrote were multiple choice, which meant that in addition to providing the right answer, I also had to provide three wrong ones. These had to be “plausibly wrong;” if the question was “what’s 10+5?” one of the answers couldn’t be “1,364.” It could, however, be “105,” because a student might just put all the numbers together instead of adding their value, or “5” in case they mixed up the plus and minus sign. Coming up with these plausibly wrong answers was my favorite part of the job. I’d put myself back in the mindset of young me and try to imagine how I’d have misunderstood a word problem or made a mistake in a multi-step question. And then I got to write a supportive little note explaining the error and guiding the student back toward the right track, the kind of thing I wished I'd had instead of a teacher frowning at me as they handed back another red pen-covered failed test.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Later, the math game I helped design took all of this to another level by trying to add fun into the mix. As a kid, I had always assumed educational games were made by boring adults who didn't actually care if a game was fun or didn't really understand what games were, but our team put so much thought into avoiding what educational games people call “<a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/serious-games-not-chocolate-broccoli-matthew-farber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chocolate-covered broccoli</a>.” It was energizing to have conversations with the other narrative designers and the content team, trying to draw out the core actions of a math skill and thinking about enjoyable–but still educational–situations they could apply to. We wrote a bunch of interesting, diverse characters to go along with the game’s story; I was especially excited about a plotline involving math anxiety, thinking back to my own struggles in childhood and the skills I wished I’d been taught or the messages I wished I’d received. While we knew we were fighting a losing battle for kids’ time against games like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, we still hoped to give them something they’d enjoy, remember, and see themselves in. Though I’d left the company before the game was cancelled, I was still sad to learn that no one would ever get to play it.</p><p>The main takeaway from my experience is probably that even if you totally suck at math in school, you can still find yourself doing it as a job–so much so that you get stuck doing it all the time if you <a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start a business</a>. But young me would have been horrified by this lesson–the thing I hate the most, <em>all the time</em>?--so instead, I like to see it as proof that your relationship to something can grow and change over your life. Difficulties in school don’t mean you’re “<a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a writer</a>” or “just bad at math;” without the pressures of grades or the restrictions of a class, you can always learn something in new ways or with new tools. I like to hope I gave kids a little bit of what I was missing and, in some small way, helped them avoid some of the struggles I went through. At the very least, I hope I never wrote anything a kid would tell me sucked to my face.</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has released&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update 1.1.2, and it's intended to address some of the more pressing concerns players have had with the game, including frustrating insta-fail stealth sections and more.</p>
<p>According to Ubisoft, highlights for this update include "tweaks and improvements on some challenging stealth moments", as well as cross-progression, PC performance improvements, and a fix for one of&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' PS5 trophies.</p>
<p>Those stealth fixes include a lowering of the likelihood you'll be detected while you're rolling, as well as an adjustment to the "level of detection" depending on where you are. Details are a little vague, but hopefully, stealth should be a bit less punishing now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=rvbuNWUq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-update-1.1.2-stealth.jpg?itok=Xobve-uG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stealth in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>should be a little easier now.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you happen to be playing&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on multiple platforms, you should now be able to access your save no matter where you are thanks to the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/cross-progression-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109498" rel="noopener" target="_blank">magic of cross-progression</a>, which has been implemented in this update.</p>
<p>In terms of performance updates, you're getting nebulous "improvements and optimizations" on PC, as well as improvements for some scenes that cause FPS drops. You're also getting "higher graphic fidelity" for ray reconstruction and frame generation tech.</p>
<p>PS5 players will be happy to learn that the Old School Cool trophy is now unlockable too, meaning that it's now possible to score the Platinum for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>. As Anakin himself might say, yippee.</p>
<p>The full list of patch notes contains a bunch of other fixes and improvements as well, so if you want to see everything that's new in this&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>update, then <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-112" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is, according to Ubisoft at least, the first open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>game. It revolves around outlaw Kay Vess, who must navigate the galaxy's seedy underbelly and decide whether she's going to stay on its gangs' good side or disrupt the status quo.</p>
<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review">read our review of it right here</a>.</p>

All of Sony’s changes point to a PS5 Pro that will be far more capable of rendering games with ray tracing enabled or hitting higher resolutions and frame rates in certain titles. Sony appears to be encouraging developers to use graphics features like ray tracing more with the PS5 Pro, with games able to use a “Trinity Enhanced” (PS5 Pro Enhanced) label if they “provide significant enhancements.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130716/sony-ps5-pro-specs-release-date-rumors">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7eb88c1b-3670-4c98-91d9-60c80e6b6745"><div><p>Go read Digital Foundry on the PS5 Pro.</p><p>The most trusted source for console analysis has just corroborated and analyzed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">the leaks</a>.</p><p>“Those hoping that PS5 Pro will turn CPU-limited 30fps titles into super-smooth 60fps experiences will be disappointed,” <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">writes Richard Leadbetter</a> — but he thinks PS5 Pro “should be able to deliver a far higher perceptual increase in resolution vs PS5 than the PS4 Pro did against its junior variant.”</p><p>Lots more nuance here, including how PS5 Pro has 1.2GB more RAM for games:</p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-c5947753-10a9-4448-a738-38e5bb7f52e0"><div><p>More rumored specs for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs-2024/">reported</a> GPU specifications and performance targets for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">a “PlayStation 5 Pro”</a> on Friday, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-more-specs/">now he says</a> that just like the recently revised PS5, the Pro will also have a detachable disc drive.</p><p>Other new details include rumors of faster memory running at 576 GB/s (a 28 percent boost over the PS5), better audio performance, and a new “High CPU Frequency Mode” that boosts performance by 10 percent over the standard PS5. </p><br></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-d46b9f16-cff2-4a48-b6e9-4578239472d1"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/15/24102378/sony-ps5-pro-leak-specs-release-date-rumor">Sony’s PS5 Pro is up to three times faster, may arrive holiday 2024</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge</cite></p></figure></div><p>Sony is reportedly working on a PlayStation 5 Pro model that may well include a far more powerful GPU that’s up to three times faster for certain tasks than the existing PS5 models. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSV7BJKnZfP8">YouTuber Moore’s Law is Dead</a> claims to have gotten access to a technical overview document for the PS5 Pro, codenamed Trinity, and now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-specs/">Tom Henderson at <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> reports that the leaked specifications are accurate and the console is currently set to release during the holiday 2024 period.</p><p>Screenshots from the technical document include a mention of 67 teraflops of 16-bit floating point calculations, which works out to around 33.5 teraflops of single-precision compute.

<p>A week after its first title update of the season, Madden 25 <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/Madden-NFL-25-Title-Update-September-10th/td-p/14030420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has received another</a> update to address various defense concerns within the game. </p>



<p>The new update fixes issues with zone coverage, speed boost when using custom stems, and more. You can check out the full notes below, courtesy of EA Sports.</p>



<h2 id="h-madden-25-title-update-details">Madden 25 Title Update Details</h2>



<ul>
<li>Addressed the issue with Smart Routed Custom Stems resulting in a Speed Boost off the line at the snap</li>



<li>Tuning to decrease the effectiveness of a specific QB-rollout speed boost exploit</li>



<li>Addressed an issue preventing the Curl Flat zone depth coach adjustment from working properly when set at less than 15 yards</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing Curl Flat defenders to continue to drift away from an eligible receiving threat in close proximity</li>



<li>Addressed an issue causing outside Deep Third defenders to get out of position when covering corner routes, or giving up too much cushion vs. corner routes.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue in Squads causing the QB control to switch to a teammate at the snap</li>
</ul>



<p>While it’s not the largest update, it is focused on multiple gameplay fixes on defense that players have expressed frustrations over since Madden 25 launched. More updates will be coming over the next few weeks and months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-giving-flame-weapons-one-hell-of-a-buff<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> developer Arrowhead is lifting the lid on the game’s hotly anticipated 01.001.007 update with an early look at the patch notes.</p><p>The explosive shooter broke records when it launched earlier this year, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time. But Arrowhead has suffered a torrid time of late as it struggles to satisfy Helldivers 2’s fanbase, with recent months in particular resulting in a ‘mostly negative’ recent user review rating on Steam. It's now up to 'mixed,' and Helldivers 2's overall Steam user review rating remains 'mostly positive.'</p><p>Most of the negativity revolves around a feeling that Arrowhead has been heavy handed in nerfing Helldivers 2’s various weapons and stratagems as it balances the game. The constant nerfs have caused some players to accuse Arrowhead of stripping all the fun out of Helldivers 2, a game that revolves around blowing alien bugs and robots to bits with over-the-top guns and bombs.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Helldivers 2 Escalation of Freedom Update Gallery</h3></div></output><p>This patch, which Arrowhead hopes will make significant changes to the PC and PlayStation 5 co-op action game and bring its disgruntled community back on-side, launches September 17. But before then, we now know Arrowhead’s plan to rebalance Flamethrowers, one of the more contentious weapons in the game.</p><p>Flamethrower damage is increased by a huge 33% with the release of the patch, Arrowhead confirmed, and flame weapon armor penetration is increased. “Flamer mechanics will be reverted to the state before the Escalation of Freedom update and flame based weapons can now damage heavier enemies like Chargers, Bile Titans, Impalers, and Hulks,” Arrowhead explained.</p><p>That last change is key: with an armor penetration increase, flame weapons will now be a viable option against some of Helldivers 2’s toughest enemies, such as the aforementioned Hulks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This Flamethrower change is just one of what is expected to be a series of buffs to Helldivers 2’s various weapons and stratagems.  Arrowhead has said it will reveal more about the patch each day running up to its release, so it won’t be long before fans find out what other buffs are coming their way. For now, here’s what Arrowhead has said about it:</p><h2><strong>Here’s what to expect from Helldivers 2's upcoming update, per Arrowhead:</strong></h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>We are reworking Armor Penetration, Anti-Tank weapons and enemy armor and health values. As a key part of the rework we have done an initial balancing pass on over 30 weapons and stratagems.</li><li>We are overhauling a number of different enemies to make them feel more rewarding to kill when you use the proper tools to handle them but ensure they still feel formidable. Enemy bots, including Hulks, will have lower armor, and the number of rockets fired by enemies like the Devastator and Gunship will be limited, making combat more balanced. The armor values of particularly tough bug enemies like the Charger, Impaler, and Bile Titan will also be reduced.</li><li>Weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, and Anti-Material Rifle will be more effective, providing greater loadout versatility. We are also working towards additional improvements for the flamethrower weapons.</li><li>We’re taking this opportunity to consider new player fantasies and design goals for these weapons and stratagems based on the feedback we’ve received and the trends we’re observing during gameplay.</li></ul><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/25-hardest-bosses-black-myth-wukong<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Much like the source novel Journey to the West, where the Monkey King Sun Wukong must overcome 81 trials to complete his adventure, the Destined Hero in Black Myth: Wukong must conquer over 80 boss fights to fulfil his destiny .</p><p>With so many boss fights to tackle – all of which you can learn the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">best strategies to beat in IGN’s Black Myth: Wukong guide</a> – we figured it was time to rank the hardest boss fights in the game. With so many to choose from it was hard to whittle down the list of 25, but ultimately these are the bosses that pushed us to nearly break our controllers.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>25 Hardest Bosses in Black Myth: Wukong Slideshow</h3></div></output><h3>25. Mad Tiger</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-59-46-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Mad_Tiger">Mad Tiger</a> is one of the easiest bosses on this list, but he’s still no cake walk if you’re not a ninja monkey ready kick ass. There’s no finesse to fighting Mad Tiger, – the big fella charges straight at you and can  take big chunks of your health if he lands a hit, so time your dodges to perfection and then attack. Simple. Well, kinda.</p><h3>24. Wandering Wight</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-23-05-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Wandering_Wight">The Wandering Wight</a> is an early optional boss that just sort of wanders (hence the name) around the first area of the game. What gives the Wandering Wight a spot on this list is not so much the fight itself but how he’s just just sort of <em>there, so much so</em> you might mistake him for a regular, tough enemy until you attack and realize he has a boss health bar. </p><p>It’s therefore likely you’ll die at the hands of the Wandering Wight on your first couple tries, but he’s a sign of things to come. Boss battles in Black Myth: Wukong are sometimes hidden but often they’re very much in plain sight and can happen at any time in the game. Don’t say we didn’t warn you!</p><h3>23. Kang Jin Star</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-58-30-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Kang-Jin_Star">Kang Jin Star</a> is an unassuming boss at first. Her glowing eyes are kinda weird but surely she can’t be <em>that</em> dangerous, right? Oh holy shit, she can turn into a giant dragon that spits lightning death from the skies! In fact all of her lightning attacks deal a ton of damage, and because she has both long- and close-range attacks it’s actually pretty tricky to land a decent hit on her.Plus, like Black Myth’s other lightning-based bosses, her attacks are rapid-fire so you better nail your timing, otherwise you’ll get hit by a thunder blast that’ll fry Monkey’s fur in a flash.</p><h3>22. Supreme Inspector</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-49-00-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>When I first saw the Supreme Inspector I mistook him for a giant rooster but the reality is much worse – he’s a winged man with a hand for a head, and it’s every bit as gross as it sounds. He – it? – is tough too, and has a bunch of attacks that slowly chip away at your health unless you’re able to quickly stun him. And watch out for his burning ring too, which by the way, you can blow away with the Plantain Fan.</p><h3>21. Zhu Bajie</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-30-51-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>This adorable warthog carries a rake and looks like something from a Disney movie, but he’s actually a ferocious little shit. He wallows in a giant pool of mud, which makes it really hard to move around and dodge his attacks. Worst still, he ditches the cuteness for the second phase of the fight, transforming into a grotesque boar that gouges with foot-long tusks. Survive that and the final part of the battle sees him melting into the mud and charging you down as a huge amorphous rhino thing that does massive damage. No thank you.</p><h3>20. Red Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-redloong-7-1725912530830.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite ditching its human form and going full dragon right from the start, Red Loong is the easiest of the dragon bosses. Like Kang Jin Star and the other dragon bosses, he wields devastating lightning attacks but it's his speed you really need to watch out for. Keep dodging and focus attacks on  the bells on its back to stun him temporarily, giving you a few seconds to tear him a new one.</p><h3>19. Black Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-blackloong-3-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What do Red Loong and <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Black_Loong">Black Loong</a> have in common? Apart from being a giant pain in the butt when it comes to fighting them not much, but one is a long slithering dragon and this guy is a chubby pig-man with a dragon head.</p><p>Dual-wielding lightning maces, Black Loong is an optional boss in Chapter 2 but trust us, you should level up before you even think about challenging him. His electrical attacks are more than just visually stunning and do heavy damage whether you’re close or far away, so dodge through his attacks, roll up behind him and stick your staff where the sun doesn’t shine.</p><h3>18. Whiteclad Noble</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-24-51-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whiteclad Noble is the first multi-stage boss in Black Myth: Wukong, so just when you think he’s down he gets right back up again. He also looks like an old man first time around, but then comes back as a crazy-looking half snake man thing. Shudder. </p><p>The key to beating Whiteclad Noble is patience – rushing head on is almost a guaranteed death wish, but dodging his attacks from afar and waiting for the right moment to strike is a sure-fire way to put him down… twice.</p><h3>17. Tiger Vanguard</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-00-53-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Whereas the last tiger boss was all brawn and not much else, this guy has bags of style. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Tiger_Vanguard">Tiger Vanguard</a> is a badass tiger martial artist who you fight in a pool of blood. Yes, it’s as cool as it sounds. Hed hits harder and faster than any of the bosses you’ve previously met too,so make sure you have strong gear and a load of buffs to help in the fight.</p><h3>16. Emerald-Armed Mantis</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-51-48-am-1725910536233.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Have you ever played against someone in a fighting game like Tekken that just button mashes and seems like they never give you a chance to actually press a button yourself? That’s kinda like what it’s like fighting the Emerald-Armed Mantis. This boss attacks extraordinarily fast and is extremely aggressive, granting you precious few opportunities to turn the tables and land hits yourself. Fortunately, all of your spells work great here: Immobilize can stop it in its tracks, giving you opportunities to stagger, most of its attacks can be reflected with Rock Solid, and Pluck of Many allows you to overwhelm it with clones that can all deal big damage. </p><h3>15. The Duskveil</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-33-39-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If The Duskveil was a member of your family, it’d be the creepy relative no one wants to sit next to. I mean, look at it. No thanks. This skeletal, Wendigo-like monster has ferocious, unrelenting attacks that make this boss fight far more challenging than it has any right to be. His wild swings and combos are difficult to read too,  making him a particularly tricky boss to get the better of. Also, every attack, particularly in the second stage, has some kind of twist to it. Dodged his swing? Doesn’t matter, the spikes that shoot out of his arms will tear you to shreds while you’re busy feeling smug.</p><h3>14. Cloudtreading Deer</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-53-10-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Honestly, it’d be great if you could just leave the Cloudtreading Deer well alone. It’s just there, minding its own business in the middle of a grassy field. But he stands in the way of the Destined One becoming a legend, and so, it must die. This four-legged giant hits like a horse — literally, its hind legs kick out with enough force to break your spine in a split second. What makes it extra challenging though is the fact that the first phase has you dealing with potentially getting frozen by its frost enhanced attacks, and the second phase switches gears to force you to handle poison, so you gotta be prepared to deal with both status ailments.</p><h3>13. Stone Monkey</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-55-03-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Unlike some bosses on this list, Stone Monkey isn’t what you would usually call a two-phase boss. Rather, it’s a boss that evolves into the Great Sage’s Broken Shell. And while its second form is the more formidable of the two, the Stone Monkey is no pushover either. For starters, he’s more than twice the size of our furry hero and is super aggressive too, but his attacks are crude and can be dodged fairly easily. He’s <em>way</em> tougher after he becomes The Great Sage’s Broken Shell, and his ranged attacks like the ring of fire are <em>nasty</em>. What is it with this game and burning rings?</p><h3>12. Yellow Wind Sage</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-yellow-71-1725912530828.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Okay, this guy looks freaking scary. He’s properly huge and carries around a Bhudda head the size of a SUV. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Yellow_Wind_Sage">Yellow Wind Sage</a> will be a proving ground for a lot of players, as it’s the first properly tough boss in Black Myth Wukong. Wandering Wight was tough for an early optional boss that just wanders around, the Whiteclad Noble was tough because it’s your first time having to pace yourself for a two phase fight, but The Yellow Wind Sage is difficult in just about every way. It hits like a truck, it varies up the timing of all of its attacks to make the difficult to dodge, and if you don’t have the Wind Tamer Vessel, you’ll have to deal with encroaching sandstorms throughout the second phase as well that make it even harder to land hits on him. </p><h3>11. Captain Wise-Voice</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-pagoda-78-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>We’d shake this guy’s hand for having such an awesome name if he wasn’t such an asshole. <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Captain_Wise-Voice">Captain Wise-Voice</a> is a weird looking thing, with horns and arms and legs sticking out in every direction. It’s insanely tough too with even your strongest attacks barely touching his health bar. </p><p>But the real thing that makes this battle difficult is the fact that he can shrink your maximum life bar by half, giving you a smaller margin of error and dramatically reducing the effectiveness of your healing gourd. Oh, and don’t forget that about the laser that shoots out of its metal-orb-brain-thing. So yeah, great name, and also one of the toughest and most annoying bosses you’ll encounter.</p><h3>10. Yellowbrow</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-03-17-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Now we’re in the top 10, things are starting to heat up. While many might mock <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Yellowbrow">Yellowbrow’s big, bushy eyebrows</a>, we’re going to give him the respect he deserves because, frankly, he’s a dick.</p><p>Armed with an electric mace and an ornate flask, Yellowbrow has hard-hitting area-of-effect attacks that send shockwaves across the entire arena. But the real challenge comes later, when Yellowbrow turns to solid gold, making him practically impervious to attacks. It’s a long and grueling battle, compounded by the fact that his attacks take chunks out of your health while it feels like you’re barely even hurting him, no matter how good your build is.</p><h3>9. Yaksha King</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-43-55-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Welcome to one of the hardest fights in the whole game. The Yaksha King wields two extremely large blades, which sprout out of his arms and grow bigger as the fight goes on. His movements are weirdly timed, which means it can be tough to build up a rhythm and timing your dodges. Even worse, a single hit is enough to take a good chunk of your health, so good luck surviving for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The Yaksha King excels at close-quarters combat, which is bad news because you have to get right in his grill to do damage. Between sharp area-of-effect attacks that force you to dodge backwards, and large swings of his sword arm, the Yaksha King is a battle that requires precision and patience to come close to beating.</p><h3>8. Cyan Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-05-29-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Do you always pick a fight with fishermen sitting peacefully by the edge of a lake, waiting for the next bite? If so then <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Cyan_Loong">Cyan Loong</a> is right up your alley. This optional boss is a large, sword-wielding dragon swordsman who can fly through the air – majestically I might add, he really is a sight to behold. His sword strike is also hard to dodge, meaning the window to land a good hit is small, so don’t waste your opportunity to hit him when the arise.</p><p>Like the other Loong fights, Cyan Loong also has electrical attacks, giving him a deadly edge both close- and long-range. Despite all that, he’s still not the toughest Loong fight in the game…</p><h3>7. Bishui Golden-Eyed Beast</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-47-57-am-1725910536232.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>But before we get to that, this fearsome Yaoguai is a fiery berserker whose nonstop attacks means you’ll be spending more time dodging than hitting. Similar to The Duskveil, Bishui incessantly comes at you with his mighty fists and fire breath, leaving you with hardly any breathing room. Honestly, this guy never gives it a rest and it genuinely feels like there’s no opening to retaliate.  But if you fancy having a little fun with this hot-headed monster, bait him into a nearby ice cave to cool him off. This changes his fire attacks to ice, which are much easier to deal with.</p><h3>6. Yellow Loong</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/wukong-yellowloong-9-1725912530829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>And here he is, the hardest Loong in Black Myth: Wukong. Like his peers, Yellow Loong has wildly tricky attacks that are tough to dodge, but that’s not the main reason you’ll struggle. During his second phase, Yellow Loong will constantly make it seem like you need to dodge, only to hold his attacks a few seconds before the real swing of his halberd comes. If you haven’t mastered dodging then you’re gonna be stuck on this brute for hours.</p><h3>5. Yin Tiger</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-11-06-32-am-1725910536234.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>If you thought Tiger Vanguard and Mad Tiger were tough, you haven’t seen anything yet. Yin Tiger is a giant tiger-headed warrior who carries a greatsword the size of a bus. No, seriously, look at that thing. </p><p>The duel that ensues is a total epic and, unsurprisingly for the number five on the list, is also one of the hardest fights in the game. Yin Tiger’s large swings are fast and hit like a truck – a common theme for Wukong’s best boss fights – but Yin Tiger’s speed is what sets him apart from similar bosses. His ability to disappear then reappear out of nowhere makes this challenging boss fight also one of the best in the entire game, and trading blows with Yin Tiger feels like pure kung-fu cinema. It’s hard but man, it’s so good.</p><h3>4. Scorpionlord</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-2-13-15-pm-1725916572893.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Scorpionlord is a giant scorpion-man. Yeah, count me out. Like the nasty little arachnid he’s based on, Scorpionlord’s giant tail, topped with a poisonous sting, is his deadliest attribute, and he’s able to swing it to hit you. He also has a single giant pincer, but while he might only have one it’s powerful enough to pop your head like pus-filled pimple, so don’t let him get a grip. </p><p>That’s easier said than done because Scorpionlord is aggressive with a capital AARGH, and if you make a single mistake you’ll be severely punished. </p><h3>3. Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-39-09-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Hey, you know what? Screw the Hundred Eyed Daoist Master. This half-centipede <em>abomination</em> not only murders a spider-mom in front of her own daughters, his second phase becomes nearly impossible without the help of a sacred side-quest item. Armed with magical abilities, poison breath, a giant sword, and a bad attitude, Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master is one of the hardest bosses in Black Myth: Wykong, and that’s saying a lot because you literally get help from giant spiders when you fight him.</p><h3>2. Great Sage’s Broken Shell</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-56-22-am-1725910536231.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Some of the best boss fights in video games are ones that tell a story through gameplay and mechanics, and that’s exactly what the final boss battle  –not counting the true ending – of Black Myth: Wukong does so effectively. It’s a passing of the torch between the empty shell of the old Sun Wukong and the Destined One. </p><p>The fight begins with you fighting what is essentially just a husk of Wukong, but as the fight continues more of the old Wukong starts to return to the Stone Monkey, until eventually you’re fighting a near carbon copy of the Monkey King, who uses all of your own abilities against you, to great  –and often amusing – effect. During our playthrough there was a moment where I tried to take a sip from my flask, only for the  boss to immobilize me  mid-drink, before slowly walking over, grabbing the flask and drinking it himself. It’s one of the coolest moments of any boss battle in recent memory, even if its appeal does wear thin after you’ve been stuck for hours on end without a way to skip the animation. </p><h3>1. Erlang, the Sacred Divinity</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/screenshot-2024-09-09-at-10-54-18-am-1725910536235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Finally, we’ve made it to the hardest boss in Black Myth: Wukong. Erlang, the Sacred Divinity, is the, <em>shh,</em> secret final boss of the entire game, but you probably also recognise him from the tutorial boss from the opening cinematic. But this isn’t a tutorial anymore. As the final, <em>final</em> boss, Erlang comes at you full power, summoning huge weapons while remaining relatively unharmed thanks to his durable shield. Since Erlang summons numerous, gigantic weapons beyond just his spear, it’s hard to predict his movements; he might summon a giant ax to pummel you into the ground, a giant lightning sword that deals massive area-of-effect damage. He can even take a swipe at you as a freaking tiger.</p><p>Erlang has a near limitless arsenal of weapons and spells, and it’ll take a level of cunning on your part to counter, dodge, and survive all of them, which is why we’ve ranked him the hardest boss in Black Myth: Wukong</p><p>That is our list of the top 25 hardest bosses in Black Myth: Wukong. Game Science went above and beyond to craft epic, and difficult fights to pit against our Destined Hero, but overcoming each fight also comes with immense satisfaction, and some really great loot. So it’s worth steeling your resolve to try and defeat all the bosses in Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p>If your favorite boss isn’t on this list, let us know which ones we missed in the comments. And be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/black-myth-wukong/Walkthrough">Black Myth: Wukong guide</a> for tips on how to defeat these enemies if you’re feeling stuck.</p><p><em>All image credit to Game Science.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-1-a-tight-squeeze-coming-to-xbox">first chapter was released on Xbox</a> back in July and now the story will continue on 20th September. The new chapters will be available to pre-order just beforehand from 13th September.</p>

<p>Poppy Playtime first released on PC in 2021, but it's taken some time for consoles to follow suit.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-is-coming-to-ps4-ps5-and-switch-heres-when-you-can-play-it">first chapter arrived on PS4, PS5, and Switch last December</a>, but the latest chapters are yet to be released on these consoles.</p>
<p>That means Xbox will be in-line with PC by the end of September, but PlayStation and Switch players are still without the complete experience.</p>
<p>The third chapter released on PC at the start of this year as the scariest and longest chapter of all. The varied pricing of all three chapters on Xbox is reflected on PC too.</p>
<p>What's more, there's plenty of speculation about a potential Poppy Playtime Chapter Four, though developer Mob Entertainment is yet to confirm any release details.</p>
<p>Poppy Playtime proved popular with Eurogamer's video team, you can check out their playthrough below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/empire-of-the-ants-preview-stirring-up-a-stunning-ants-nest/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a fascinating side to our natural world that we can only imagine. From the dark depths of the sea, to the leafy jungle canopy, and the uninhabited spaces in between, the world of Empire of the Ants might be closer to home, but it’s no less mysterious and unknown. You take control of ant 103.683e, planning, surviving and strategising in the midst of a micro-environment: the outdoors.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gayRYRZoU-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Based on the best-selling novels by Bernard Werber, Empire of the Ants charts a story set within the same world, putting you in direct command as leader of the antennaed forces.</p>


<p>What we’ve got here is fundamentally an RTS, though there’s a sleek fluidity and stripped-back feel to proceedings that should help it to be more accessible and approachable than some of the genre’s stalwarts. There are also different mission types that play with the formula, or even discard it completely, taking you away from commanding the army to go exploring the environment, collecting items, capturing creatures or even platforming, hopping from vibrant leaf to leaf.</p>


<p>There are three core troop types – Workers, Warriors and Ranged – with an ant-infused weapon triangle meaning that each is strong against one and weak against the other. That means that encounters and skirmishes require more than simply sending every ant in your nest in the same direction, placing the emphasis on choosing the correct unit to fight against the correct enemy.</p>
<p>It’s all very clearly orchestrated and organised, despite the myriad ants scurrying across the dirt. Each unit in your army and your enemy’s is indicated by a large, recognisable icon, and it’s these that you target rather than the ants that make up the units on the ground. You begin with five units, raising that number to seven once you’ve progressed, and once again there’s a focus on tight and controlled skirmishes rather than an overwhelming force. Admittedly, just one unit is made up of a multitude of ants, so it would otherwise get immediately overwhelming.</p>

<p>Perhaps it’s the garden setting, or the micro scale you’re working in, but there’s more than a hint of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/19/pikmin-4-review/">Pikmin</a> at work here. With a controller in hand and the simplified but robust controls, you can command your minuscule minions with ease, but just like in Nintendo’s exceptional but approachable series, there’s still clear tactical depth, even in our short hands-on.</p>
<p>One of Empire of the Ants clearest selling points is its incredibly lifelike visuals. Unreal Engine 5 is being used here to spectacular effect, and everything we were shown through our hands-on was in-engine. Watching the inhabitants of an ant nest scurrying to and fro, foraging for food and material, looks stunningly realistic. As part of that, the animators have meticulously observed the movement of ants and the other creatures in the game, and faithfully replicated it, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
<p>I particularly liked the way in which Tower Five has baked in the UI and menu systems into the landscape, and your ant commander must access the upgrade trees and building options for each nest by physically moving around them, highlighting the required option while doing so. It’s little touches like this that make the game more grounded and less game-like, and it feels like that’s more important here than it might be elsewhere, despite the sci-fi and fantasy leanings of its source material.</p>

<p>Empire of the Ants has the potential to be a great success this winter, appealing to fans of the book and the RTS genre, as well as insect aficionados who won’t often find this level of detail in gaming. The timing seems perfect as well, with Empires of the Undergrowth, a more faithful RTS that’s drawing on many of the same inspirations, having just had its final update, leaving its raft of players looking for the next ant-filled epic. In Empire of the Ants, they might well have found it.</p>
<p><em>Empire of the Ants releases for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 7th.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ender-magnolia-bloom-in-mist-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Binary Haze has announced the&nbsp;full&nbsp;<em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Metroidvania platformer is heading to PC and consoles for its 1.0 launch at the start of next year.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer, the game will be launching on January 22nd (or January 23rd, depending on where in the world you happen to be). It's already available for PC via Steam Early Access right now, but it'll be launching on consoles in January as well, although it's seemingly not getting an Xbox One release.</p>
<p><em>Ender Magnolia&nbsp;</em>was originally announced back in February as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a>, and was subsequently released on Steam in March, garnering an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2725260/ENDER_MAGNOLIA_Bloom_in_the_Mist/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Overwhelmingly Positive rating</a> across more than 3,700 reviews since then.</p>

<p>This time around, you're playing as Lilac, and together with the mysterious Homunculi at your side, you must explore the Land of Fumes, a kingdom which has fallen and in whose fall the Homunculi are "closely involved".</p>

                <p> Sony's ill-fated multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concord/" data-ref-id="5000-589443">Concord</a> has been removed from sale and had its servers shut down, while players across PS5 and PC are receiving refunds. Now, Concord content is being removed from consoles that had it installed. </p><p>Players who bought the digital version of Concord from the PlayStation Store are now being notified that Sony has deleted the game from their console. A message prompt reads, "Thank you for being a valued PlayStation customer. Live services for Concord went offline on [September 9, 2024). The game is no playable and as a result, we have removed this content from your account."</p><p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/playstation-deleting-concord-consoles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a> reports that physical copies of Concord continue to allow players to boot the game to the title screen, but players cannot progress further. For digital copies, though, it seems PlayStation is simply wiping the game entirely.</p><p>When Sony announced that Concord would shut down, the company signaled that this would happen. Sony told fans that once their refund went through, they would "no longer have access to the game." </p><p>Many online are pointing out how Sony's ability to wipe content from your console is yet another example of how people do not own digital content but merely license it and are beholden to the whims of a giant, multi-national company like Sony. This is nothing new, of course, but the situation surrounding Concord is reminding players of this fact. </p><p>Concord launched in late August and failed to find an audience, peaking at fewer than 700 concurrent players on PC. PS5 player data was never made available, but whatever the case, the situation was so dire that Sony made the dramatic decision to stop sales, close the servers, and refund players after less than two weeks on the market. </p><p>Concord is the debut title from Firewalk Studios, which is owned by Sony. Game director Ryan Ellis said the game's "initial" launch "didn't land the way we intended." As such, the team is now looking at "options" for how to "better reach our players." Some believe Concord could return as a free-to-play game or as part of the PlayStation Plus catalog, but one expert believes <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1831039618122174707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game is simply doomed no matter what.</a></p><p>Not long after Concord's failure, Sony found more success with its platformer Astro Bot, which is getting rave reviews, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/astro-bot-review-fly-me-to-the-moon/1900-6418277/" data-ref-id="1900-6418277">9/10 here at GameSpot. </a></p>

            <p>PlayStation is currently riding high following the release of its adorable platformer Astro Bot. Unlike the God of Wars and The Last of Us' of this world, Astro Bot is a family focused title, suitable (and definitely enjoyable) for players young and old.</p>
<p>Reflecting on Astro Bot's recent success, Hermen Hulst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-two-playstation-ceos-to-replace-jim-ryan">PlayStation's recently appointed joint CEO</a> - has now said the family market is "really important for us to focus on".</p>

<p>Hulst was speaking on the official <a href="https://soundcloud.com/playstation/official-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot?utm_source=blog.playstation.com&amp;utm_campaign=wtshare&amp;utm_medium=widget&amp;utm_content=https%253A%252F%252Fsoundcloud.com%252Fplaystation%252Fofficial-playstation-podcast-episode-493-the-joy-of-astro-bot">PlayStation podcast</a>, in a joint interview with Astro Bot's creative director Nicolas 'Nico' Doucet. During the discussion, the show's host asked if PlayStation would now consider putting more of its resources behind these games with a more family friendly feel, noting Lego Horizon is also set to release in just a few short months.</p>
<p>"I think it's massively important that PlayStations Studios develops games in various genres, and the family market I think is really important for us to focus on," Hulst replied.</p>
<p>"It's interesting that Nico and I at the beginning of [Astro Bot] talked a little bit about, you know, platformers. So many great ones have come out of Japan, and I was kind of joking with him like... some of those best games [are] coming out of the country that you operate out of - Let's see that as the bar."</p>
<p>Hulst went on to state Team Asobi has delivered a "massive" game with Astro Bot which, in his opinion, "plays like some of the best in the genre". The CEO complimented the game's accessibility, adding he believes the audience will "range from new players to young players, but also to players of my age" (Hulst is, I am going to say, in his 40s/50s).</p>
<p>"Astro is very, very important to PlayStation," the Sony executive continued. "Obviously, we had the pre-install [Astro's Playroom] on the PlayStation 5, that millions and millions and millions of people have embraced and loved, and I think that's become a little bit of a platform to launch this new game now.</p>
<p>"It's remarkable that a relatively small team - actually a very small team - is able to deliver a game that is so big now and it's really become a great game in itself."</p>
