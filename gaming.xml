			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake will require over 15 hours to complete, according to one of the game's very first reviews.</p>
<p>Japanese magazine Famitsu reviewed the highly anticipated remake launching next week on PC and PlayStation 5 in this week's issue, awarding it a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1fuez5j/famitsu_review_score_silent_hill_2_ps5_8999_3540/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35/40 score</a> (8/9/9/9), which is a little higher than the score the magazine awarded the original game (32/40). The review praised the sense of realism brought by the beautiful visuals, the game's unique atmosphere, revamped puzzles that feel more mentally taxing, and combat. The review also confirmed that it will take between 16 and 18 hours to complete the game for the first time, which is almost double the length of the original, so it will be very interesting to see how Bloober Team expanded the original.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, the Silent Hill 2 remake is about to release on PC and PlayStation 5, but a release on other platforms is not to be ruled out. <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-wont-be-available-on-other-consoles-until-10-08-2025/">Last month</a>, it was confirmed that the game developed by Bloober Team will remain a PS5 exclusive until October 8th, 2025, so there's a good chance it will eventually launch on Xbox consoles and possibly the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches on October 8th on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can check out footage from the PC version of the game by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-gets-hours-of-pc-gameplay-from-review-build/">here.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-developers-the-alters-delayed-to-2025.998595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios' upcoming "emotional sci-fi" game&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has officially been delayed to next year, with the studio citing a need to "optimize all mission-critical systems and ensure that every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601570/view/4697907940245503472" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announcement post on Steam</a>&nbsp;(which is, rather amusingly, written as though it's a message from the in-game company Ally Corp Communications), 11 bit pledges to "polish each phase of the project" with the additional development time.</p>
<p>The studio says that the initial demo phase of "Project Dolly" (referring to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>) has "already exceeded expectations", but that "good is never enough" for Ally Corp, and so the delay has been put into effect in order to deliver "results that surpass our prior projections".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=YKWTFVfG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-delayed-chasm.jpg?itok=8ZZml9gI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until next year.</figcaption></figure><p>While 11 bit doesn't go into any further detail regarding the delay to&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, we can, perhaps, find a little more context in a message <a href="https://x.com/gdansk_marcin/status/1841175005083934726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released to the studio's investors</a> recently.</p>
<p>In the message (for which we're using machine translation), 11 bit says it wants to give&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>a little room to breathe, and that the negative reception from some&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>fans blindsided the studio, so it wants to make sure that doesn't happen again for&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that 11 bit's stock <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/shares-video-game-maker-11-bit-studios-slump-after-frostpunk-2-release-2024-09-23/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plummeted recently</a>, with analysts suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s Steam numbers had come in under expectations.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, 11 bit itself appears to disagree with this assessment; the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k">announced recently</a> that&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>has already sold 350,000 copies and has already made back its development and marketing costs.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>The Alters</em>, it's a sci-fi adventure game that contains elements of survival, base-building, and "confronting your own multiverse life choices", per 11 bit.</p>
<p>The game casts you as worker Jan Dolski, who becomes trapped on a distant planet and who must confront alternate versions of himself (the "alters" of the title), each of whom "has a different personality and background".</p>
<p><em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>is due to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-alters/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-alters/9n0p25wjhm8c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> next year.

Following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208868/amd-announces-fluid-motion-frames-2-less-lag-less-jitter-when-its-faking-more-frames-for-you">its technical preview</a> in July, <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/boost-gaming-performance-by-2-5x-with-amd-software-adrenalin/ba-p/711458">Fluid Motion Frames 2 (AFMF 2) is now widely available</a> after being released on Tuesday alongside its supporting Adrenalin 24.9.1 GPU driver.</p><p>AFMF is a frame generation technology similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841148/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction-ray-tracing-quality">Nvidia’s DLSS Frame Generation</a> but operates on the driver level instead of game-specific integration. The second-gen AFMF update can be enabled in OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX 11, or DirectX 12 games — meaning FPS can now be improved in titles that don’t support FSR and DLSS — and currently works on AMD Radeon RX 6000, RX 7000, 700M, and 800M GPUs.</p><div><figcaption><em>According to AMD’s tests, AFMF 2 (alongside other optimizations) can provide an impressive frame rate boost compared to raw game performance.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AFMF 2 can increase FPS by up to 250 percent “on average,” according to AMD, but that was tested in combination with the company’s FSR 2 tech and Hypr-RX optimization suite. Actual performance will vary by GPU, game, and resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/TjAhju5VGX4?feature=shared&amp;t=3824"><em>Digital Foundry</em> reports</a> FPS was boosted “typically in the 2x range” when it tested the AFMF 2 beta in <em>Control</em>, <em>CyberPunk 2077</em>, and <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> at 4K using a Radeon RX 7900 GRE GPU.</p><p>The AFMF update notably includes fast motion optimization, which should address issues from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/24/24048904/amd-fluid-motion-frames-frame-geneation-directx-11-12-feature-support">the first generation of AFMF</a> that disabled frame generation in games displaying fast movements. AMD has also added two AI-optimized adjustable modes for AFMF 2 that allow users to control how the feature impacts game performance. Search Mode adjusts the FPS smoothness and image quality in games during fast-motion scenes, while Performance Mode can boost AFMF efficiency on low-power devices.</p><p>AFMF 2 supports borderless full-screen game modes on RX 7000 GPUs and AMD’s Radeon Chill low-latency FPS cap to limit the lag that FPS boosters can inflict. Outside of gaming, it also provides a new “geometric downscaling” feature that can reduce aliasing and other visual artifacts when videos are played in a window smaller than their native resolution. This is supported in DirectX 11 apps running on Radeon RX 7000 and integrated Radeon 800M GPUs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for all of the new game’s openness and emphasis on playing how you want, its most brilliant innovation feels like an inspired reworking of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics">2019 <em>Link’s Awakening </em>remake’s</a> clunkiest feature.</p><p>Though the recent <em>Link’s Awakening </em>was a (largely) faithful remake of its Game Boy-era predecessor, the Grezzo-produced title switched things up with a toyetic 3D design, improved controls, and a new dungeon creation mode clearly inspired by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9240795/super-mario-maker-review-nintendo-wii-u"><em>Super Mario Maker</em></a>. After fighting your way through the game’s traditional dungeons, you could build your own in a creepy little shack using chamber tiles modeled after various rooms you had already explored.&nbsp;</p><p>There was never really an element of surprise to these Chamber Dungeons because you were in charge of choosing what went inside them while following a number of rules about how chamber tiles could be arranged. And while your original dungeons could be used as a reliable way to rack up easy rupees, the game’s lack of an online component made it impossible to share your creations, which was a significant part of <em>Super Mario Maker</em>’s appeal.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Also key to the <em>Super Mario Maker</em>’s success was the simple fact that user-created courses could be a lot of <em>fun </em>to play through, and the title as a whole was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9239911/super-mario-maker-wii-u-game-design">a very clever exercise in teaching basic video game design</a>. Chamber Dungeons were a good idea, but in practice, <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-s-awakenings-chamber-dungeons-are-a-big-dis-1838038985#:~:text=This%20feels%20like%20a%20rudimentary,of%20the%20Game%20Boy%20classic.">their repetitiveness and inflexibility</a> didn’t give <em>Link’s Awakening </em>all that much replay value.</p></div><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>Dampé, who helps you create custom dungeons in the Link’s Awakening remake, returns in Echoes of Wisdom.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>While a more refined iteration of Chamber Dungeons could still make for a novel gaming experience, the mechanic — much like Link himself — is largely absent as we knew it in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the franchise’s first mainline entry to turn Zelda into the playable protagonist. But rather than completely scrap the core concepts that initially made Chamber Dungeons an intriguing proposition, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>taps into them from a different and more imaginative angle.</p><p>As <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s hero, Zelda and her companion Tri journey out into Hyrule equipped with the Tri Rod — a new magical key item that works a bit like <em>A Link to the Past</em>’s Cane of Somaria. But unlike the Cane, which gave Link the power to create single square blocks to climb on or push, the Tri Rod grants Zelda the ability to conjure multiple copies (referred to as “echoes”) of various objects and monsters she encounters on her adventure.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the game gives you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">a handful of other useful items</a>, the Tri Rod’s echoes are Zelda’s most powerful weapons to use in battle as she searches for a way to close the interdimensional rifts popping up all over Hyrule.&nbsp;</p><p>Some echoes — like the Boomerang Boarblin and Bombfish — basically give you a quick way of whipping up the classic <em>Zelda </em>weapon their names reference. But far more of them are just glowing replicas of the hostile creatures like ReDeads and Darknuts that you commonly find in <em>Zelda </em>overworlds and dungeons.</p><p>When Nintendo first revealed <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, echoes — which disappear after receiving a certain amount of damage — seemed like a riff on <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>’s approaches to providing players with weapons. But in <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-1%2F">a recent interview about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s development process</a>, director Tomomi Sano and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23721063/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-interview-aonuma-fujibayashi">series producer Eiji Aonuma</a> explained that the idea for a <em>Zelda</em> title built around the concept of copying / pasting objects actually began as part of a plan for a game focused on Link creating custom dungeons.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</p><div><figcaption>An early test build of a Zelda game focused on dungeon building.</figcaption> <p><cite>Nintendo</cite></p></div></div><p>As Aonuma played through an early demo, he started thinking that “while it’s fun to create your own dungeon and let other people play it, it’s also not so bad to place items that can be copied and pasted in the game field, and create gameplay where they can be used to fight enemies.” And while the team was already about a year into building an “edit dungeon”-style game, Anonuma felt that the copy / paste mechanic “had significant potential to be developed into a new way of playing the <em>Legend of Zelda</em> games if the gameplay was changed to use ‘echoes’ instead.”</p><p>Coming after <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears of the Kingdom, </em>which some fans knocked for their relative lack of traditional <em>Zelda </em>dungeons, <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>feels like a return to the basics in some ways. Individual, themed dungeons filled with small keys and minibosses abound and call on you to solve puzzles to unlock their hidden secrets. Though Zelda can move things around using bind, there’s only so much she can change about the way the new game’s literal dungeons are designed. But the brilliant trick baked into <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>is how it turns the whole of Hyrule into a new kind of dungeon, conceptually, and makes you its intrepid master.</p><p>When I first started playing <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the focus on learning echoes of ordinary inanimate objects to help Zelda made the game feel like a standard top-down dungeon crawler that was trying to make me think more about how to move through space vertically. Table echoes could be used to give the short princess a boost, and stacks of heart-restoring beds could be fashioned into makeshift staircases. Those kinds of echoes all gave me different ways of navigating Zelda out of a jail cell, which felt like a crash course in the game’s stealth missions. But once I was out in the open world and learned my first monster echoes, it was surprising to see that I had to be familiar with a creature’s behavioral patterns to wield it effectively in combat.</p><p><em>Zelda </em>dungeons aren’t just elaborate buildings filled with puzzles and locked doors; they’re places where monsters live, and those monsters’ actions play a significant role in shaping a dungeon’s identity. The same goes for environmental hazards like fire, water, and ice, which can all help or harm you depending on how you interact with them. <em>Echoes of Wisdom </em>doesn’t allow you to create your own bespoke dungeons per se, but it does give Zelda many of a dungeon’s fundamental building blocks to play with. And the deeper you get into the game’s literal dungeons, the more it pushes you to fight by sending monsters into battle — almost as if Zelda herself was thinking the way a dungeon designer would.</p><p>There’s a narrative poetry to the way Zelda’s first mainline outing in her own ongoing legend is one in which her power is reshaping the world and using its rules to her advantage. It’s a framing that presents her as both a princess and a kind of dungeon master — and shows how, 40 years in, Nintendo is still finding fantastic ways to make <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>’s old ideas feel new.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One blemish on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne and Liberty</a>’s barnstorming release – one day in and it’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazons-new-free-to-play-mmorpg-throne-and-liberty-is-coming-for-the-banana-games-crown">so far up the Steam charts</a> it’s only visible by telescope – has been some unexpected Steam Deck trouble. Despite the fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMORPG</a> having worked fine on the Deck in previous betas, a celebrating Amazon employee must have drunkenly nudged the 'Break game on Linux' lever at the office launch party, as reports began <a href="https://twitter.com/SteamDeckGaming/status/1841107699036979648">trickling in</a> of handheld players being kicked from servers. The cause: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-compatibility-conundrum-partially-solved-with-easy-anti-cheat-support">Easy Anti-Cheat</a>, Throne and Liberty’s hacker thwarter of choice, declaring an error.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as of right now (October 2nd), all seems well again – I’ve got Throne and Liberty running on a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> as I type this, and can mosey around next to fellow online players without issues. A lot of them are turning into wolves. Most of them, in fact. Maybe too many.</p>

<p>As for what <em>actually</em> happened with Easy Anti-Cheat, it sounds like either developers NCSoft or publishers Amazon Games simply neglected to enable Easy Anti-Cheat support for the Linux-powered SteamOS in the final release build. Judging by <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/steamdeck/proton">Valve’s documentation</a>, this isn’t a complicated process – perhaps hence why it was overlooked – but it does require a dash of manual input. Without this, the game assumes that EAC is missing, and blocks off online play completely rather than potentially let any do-badders in while its guard is down.</p><p>No-one seems to have been outright banned as a result of attempting to play on a Steam Deck, so this could be considered a happy ending. Definitely more so than other recent cases we’ve seen where anti-cheat has proven a stumbling block to portable compatibility: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-was-unleashed-on-the-steam-deck-but-only-for-one-day">Wuthering Waves</a> was only briefly playable on the Deck before an update blocked it off again, and despite how the BattlEye anti-cheat software can easily be made compatible with SteamOS, its addition to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> last month involved Rockstar just... <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-online-is-no-longer-supported-by-steam-deck-thanks-to-a-slightly-baffling-rockstar-anti-cheat-update">choosing not to</a>? I guess? And the less said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fortnite-wont-get-steam-deck-support-epic-ceo-blames-cheaters">Fortnite</a>, the better.</p>
<p>Throne and Liberty, at least, is now having an easier time of it. I’m prodigiously bad at guessing how games will fare in Valve’s Steam Deck Verified ranking system, but if I were to simply ignore that and speculate anyway, I’d go for 'Playable': some of the UI text is absolutely microscopic on the 7in screen, but it controls fine, and typically runs above 30fps on Low settings. I’d swap FSR upscaling from Balanced to Quality mode, though, just to make character models look less like they’re disintegrating into sand when they move.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The spooky month is often bursting with new games to play ahead of the end of the year, and 2024's buffet of releases is keeping the tradition alive. From PC to Nintendo Switch, from <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> to <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, here are 34 games you should have on your radar this October, in order of release. </p><p>There’s been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1837556368100020614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1837556368100020614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some debate</a></span> about whether October 2024 feels a bit light compared to the peak years of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, at least when it comes to weekly blockbusters with flush marketing budgets. This year is probably a slower one overall when it comes to those types of games, providing a bit of a lull between 2023's unprecedented hit parade and the list of big games that are already stacking up in 2025. </p><p>But in other ways, it’s a perfect snapshot of how the release calendar has changed. There are Early Access PC releases, cult-hit indies getting new life with console ports, and expansions to forever games that people can spend years playing and still find new ways to enjoy. And if you’re an RPG nerd like me who doesn’t have 200 hours to spare, you’re facing some tough choices about how to allocate your scarcest resource of all this month. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S <br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Asymmetrical multiplayer shooter</p><p>Four years after it’s original launch on PS4 and PC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a></span> is back with a PS5 version and its debut on Xbox Series X/S. IllFonic Inc. is publishing the game now and promising to bring new content to the multiplayer game this year and next. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> MMORPG</p><p>NCSoft’s free-to-play MMO <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/throne-and-liberty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/throne-and-liberty"><em>Throne and Liberty</em></a></span> has been brought stateside by Amazon Games and it features a lot of wild stuff, from massive battles with shifting environments to characters who transform into animals to become their own fast-traveling mounts. It sounds big, beautiful, and messy. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Top-down bullet hell</p><p>Imagine <em>Vampire Survivors</em> except you can actually control the attacks of your little demon-slaying character as they blow away mobs of eldritch horrors. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/kill-knight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/kill-knight"><em>Kill Knight</em></a></span><em> </em>is pitched as an arcade bullet hell game predicated upon the simple pleasure of shooting lots of stuff very fast. It looks neat and, somewhat refreshingly, it’s not a roguelike. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC (Steam Early Access)<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action roguelike</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wizard-of-legend-lets-you-play-as-a-magical-jedi-1826238042&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wizard-of-legend-lets-you-play-as-a-magical-jedi-1826238042">Six years after the first game blew up</a></span> on Steam, <em>Wizard of Legend 2</em> will bring a new aesthetic and overhauled combat to PC this month with an Early Access launch. The art style looks amazing. We’ll see how much it feels like the rest of the game is breaking new ground or rebuilding from scratch. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Interactive horror movie</p><p>The slasher movie-inspired <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1726108417?_gl=1*sjxb72*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzg3NDM1OC4xMTYuMS4xNzI3ODc2ODMxLjE0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/until-dawn-the-kotaku-review-1726108417?_gl=1*sjxb72*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzg3NDM1OC4xMTYuMS4xNzI3ODc2ODMxLjE0LjAuMA.."><em>Until Dawn</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>gets a visual overhaul nearly a decade later. Originally a PS4 exclusive, the game has been remade in Unreal Engine 5 for a release on PS5 and PC. The game stars  Rami Malek, Hayden Panettiere, and a bunch of others as players make various choices to guide the teens through a horror-filled night. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Noir detective mystery</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297"><em>Phoenix Springs</em></a></span> is a point-and-click adventure about a reporter searching for her long-lost brother. It’s also one of the most visually evocative games I’ve ever seen. You rummage around the world collecting phrases and observations and then combine them in the right way to advance the story. I played it at Summer Game Fest earlier this year came away intrigued. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure</p><p><em>Diablo IV</em>’s main campaign gets its next chapter this month. While technically an expansion,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-mercenaries-dark-citadel-1851630602"><em>Vessel of Hatred</em></a></span><em> </em>brings alongside it a wealth of changes to the base game that will streamline the leveling system and further improve upon the late-game paragon upgrade board. We’ll also finally get to confront Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred and one of the series three main Prime Evils. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival horror</p><p><em>The Silent Hill 2 </em>remake <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-preview-pyramid-head-eddie-1851625962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-preview-pyramid-head-eddie-1851625962">promises a faithful recreation</a></span> of the original survival horror game alongside additional content and new secrets to discover. The game’s developers at Bloober Team said it will run approximately twice as long as the PS2 classic. It also includes some new tweaks to combat to help modernize the action a bit. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Platformer adventure </p><p>Puzzle platformer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/europa&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/europa"><em>Europa</em></a></span> was first revealed a couple of years ago. It’s now almost here following an initial delay. The world looks lush and the puzzles seem whimsical enough. Much of the exploration seems to revolve around a jetpack that you can upgrade over the course of the game to reach farther and higher. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Anime sim and fighting game </p><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is shaping up to be the biggest <em>DBZ</em> game ever and a solid revival of the 3D anime arena fighter.

The turn-based RPG combines medieval political turmoil with new real-time action dungeon crawling elements as well as a more tactical flavor of combat. You can try before you buy thanks to a free demo on consoles and PC. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Shooter sim</p><p>Give a squirrel a nut and it will eat for a day.

There’s some combat but the main pull seems to be the incredible artwork and melancholy vibes. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Survival horror </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-game-road-ahead-release-date-trailer-ps5-1851614631&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-game-road-ahead-release-date-trailer-ps5-1851614631"><em> A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em></a></span> is an adaptation of the sci-fi horror series featuring a new story set in the same world as the hit movie. The aliens with super good hearing that only show their weakness upon being subjected to certain high-pitched frequencies are perfect fodder for a game. We’ll see if Saber Interactive, hot off shipping <em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em>, can pull off the concept in a way that feels satisfying. <br></p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Switch<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> multiplayer party game</p><p><em>Super Mario Party</em> had character-specific dice blocks but was light on content. <em>Mario Party Superstars</em> had tons of mini-games but very limited board selection.

I’m not expecting it to hang as one of the best <em>TMNT</em> games ever, but it’s been a while since we got a big 3D licensed adaptation to dig into. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/unknown-9-awakening&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/unknown-9-awakening"><em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em></a></span> looks like a third-person <em>Dishonored</em> that takes inspiration from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-style historical fiction worldbuilding. The game stars Anya Chalotra, who plays Yennefer in Netflix’s <em>The Witcher,</em> and supplies her with a bunch of paranormal powers to fuel the game’s stealth set-pieces. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Factory sim</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/factorio-space-age&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/factorio-space-age"><em>Factorio: Space Age</em></a></span> is another update masquerading as a game, but I’m putting it on this list because the expansion is the same price as the base game and appears to be packing nearly as much content. It looks like <em>Mass Effect:</em> <em>The Factory Sim</em>, with players able to travel to new planets, discover new secrets, and take on hordes of aliens with their resource-harvesting prowess. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Meta Quest 3<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Action-adventure</p><p>It’s not the<em> Batman: Arkham s</em>equel some fans have been pining for, but it is another Batman game set in the Arkham universe.

It’s kind of like a D&amp;D campaign by way of<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The visual novel-esque storytelling is the focus but the grid-based RPG gameplay is also rock solid.

The sequel aims to mash together <em>Stardew Valley</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> into a top-down immersive RPG sandbox fully of carnage. It sports a mission to take back the nation from a corrupt president and a massive procedurally generated map. Console ports are due out sometime after the initial PC release. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Platform fighter</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/rivals-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/rivals-2"><em>Rivals of Aether II</em></a></span> will attempt to build on the foundation of its predecessor with a bigger roster, more mechanics, and a 3D art style versus the 2D animated look of the original (RIP). Like the <em>Smash Bros.</em> platform fighters that inspired it, the sequel is adding shields and the ability to pummel opponents caught in a throw, while the parry system returns from the first game. </p></div><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC<br></p><p><strong>Genre:</strong> Choose your own adventure dating sim</p><p>As it says on the tin, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-august-2024-everything-announced-1851632968"><em>Date Everything</em></a></span><em> </em>is a game in which you can romance whatever you want.

In 2019, head of publishing Andrey Tsvetkov&nbsp;joined the company to build up a self-publishing arm, and after 5 years and the acquisition of publisher Meta Publishing, the company's ready share its success with other developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Launching a new game publisher in 2024 is a bold choice. The last year hasn't just seen thousands of developer layoffs, it's seen a number of games dramatically undersell and put publishers and developers out of business. In an interview with Game Developer, Tsvetkov seemed keenly aware of that fact, telling us that the company is working hard to prepare its signed games for success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main goal, he said, is to help signed developers "walk the path we have already walked." "We know the challenges that await them in this process, so we want to make sure they are avoiding them. After creating three games in a row, we actually know what kinds of pipelines, what kinds of budgets, and what kinds of efforts one needs to create these kinds of experiences."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A creative vision and backing from an experience publisher aren't enough to succeed on their own—which is why Tsvetkov believes the number one thing developers pitching him should prepare for is to explain how their game can stand out in a given market.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/owlcat-games-opens-third-party-narrative-game-focused-publishing-label" target="_self">Owlcat Games opens third-party, narrative game-focused publishing label</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)">Owlcat Games' publishing terms favor developers (but it can only help so many teams)</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers interested in pitching a narrative title to Owlcat Games can expect what Tsvetkov described as favorable terms if they make it all the way to the end. The company isn't interested in taking ownership over intellectual property, and it favors revenue splits that give developers a greater chunk of the change.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He couldn't give specifics on signed contracts, but said revenue splits at Owlcat might start at "around 20-25 percent" (for the publisher), then change for "later stages of the product lifecycle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Owlcat apparently isn't just looking for interesting-looking games, but also a sense that there's a core team behind them who can maintain focus on their pitched product even while scaling up the team. If a game doesn't make the cut, Tsvetkov said he's happy to give feedback so developers can pitch themselves better elsewhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The label's first two published games are both striking. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2126190/Rue_Valley/">Rue Valley</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a narrative RPG in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disco Elysium</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that uses RPG-like systems to explore a character's inner psyche, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173980/Shadow_of_the_Road/">Shadow of the Road</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an isometric RPG akin to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> set in an alternate history Japan. But what, it's worth asking, made these games stand out from other pitched titles?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer, Tsvetkov said, has to do with how well they can compete with similar games—even ones a decade old. "Right now you're competing with games that are seven, eight, ten years old and are in good shape," he said. "They still look great and you can buy them for $5 on sale."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In isolation that can be a depressing fact, but Tsvetkov seemed to see it as an opportunity. "If you approach with a pitch, we evaluate on our side [and ask] 'what is the market share for this game?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here "market share" refers to the genre a game operates in. Some games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might birth a whole new "genre" that captures player interest, other polished titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> might knock down the competition that previously dominated the field.

			<p>Xbox Live went down today following an outage reported at PlayStation, with a huge outage that started on Monday night. The PSN services were only reported back to being online yesterday, although it's claimed that the outage ended after several hours. While the official PSN Service Status page said all services were up and running on Tuesday morning, it quickly slipped back into the red at 8.25 AM ET / 5.25 AM PT / 1.25 PM BST. Overall, it's said that the outage lasted for roughly eight hours and impacted every PlayStation system, including PS Vita and PlayStation 3, all the way up to PS5. Today, Xbox Live has reported an outage. As of 2.33 PM BST / 9.33 ET / 6.33 PT, it was reported on their <a href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1841471647531803028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official X page that the outage</a> was resolved. However, as seen by the image below, there are still significant outages in sections of Xbox, with there being no guarantee that players will be able to access their games during the outage.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>PlayStation and Xbox weren't the only companies to experience recent outages. Yesterday, Steam was also down for a while in parts of the world.&nbsp; Although, it seems that the Steam outages were very brief, and only required those using the app to restart it.</p>
<p>With the PlayStation outage, it seems it took them quite a while to resolve the issue, as those trying to use their console weren't even able to play single-player games that needed to sign-in online, as well as multiplayer games being off of the table. Offline games were reportedly safe to play and caused no issues.</p>
<p>Compared to Xbox, Sony didn't acknowledge the outage on social media accounts, and the only post that was made was a statement on a<a href="https://x.com/AskPS_JP/status/1840930118379970616" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Japanese PlayStation support page</a> telling users and game developers to notify players that the servers were offline. Additionally, Sony hasn't announced what caused the outage, so it is up in the air as too what was the reason for the outage happening in the first place.</p>
<p>Although Xbox is still suffering outages in some of the places on their overall network, they have handled the situation much faster than <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-class-lawsuit-against-sony-set-to-go-to-trial-in-march-2026/">Sony</a>, as well as able to inform the consumers about what is going on retroactively, compared to Sony, who decided to stay completely silent on the issue, despite people not having access to any online features for over eight hours.</p>

It is him who created the story of Yanus—a private investigator with a troubled past, now trying to solve an unexpected case revolving around a stolen data carrier, all this while fighting his own inner demons, the urban gangs and a nigh-omnipotent corporation responsible for the downfall of the city he used to call his own.</p><p>The game offers solid combat and movement systems, as well as a modular weapon upgrade system, thanks to which the players striding through the dark corners of the city may make every encounter feel and look different. <a title="Genres > Action [2,220 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>-packed levels with <a title="Genres > Stealth [70 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a> elements, hacking, and environmental puzzle solving are intertwined with more slow-paced sequences of city exploration, side quests, and storytelling.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>A unique, inherently Slavic take on the cyberpunk world is sure to leave none indifferent thanks to its sharp, caustic sense of humor and a slightly pessimistic outlook at the neon-grey shades of the surrounding reality, at the same time providing a much needed breath of fresh air to the genre itself.</p><p>As a team, the question we asked ourselves was: what was the world going to look like in a couple of decades? How would a hypothetical Central and Eastern European city and its inhabitants differ from, say, <em>Blade Runner</em>‘s Los Angeles or <em>Akira</em>‘s Neo Tokyo?</p><p>The attempts to answer this puzzle has had a tremendous deal of influence upon the game’s artistic choices, including a mix of futuristic-esque and overly outdated technologies, the grim, brutalist architecture typical of the post-communist countries, the character’s not-so-obvious moral choices and the often crudely makeshift, yank-and-tuck character and atmosphere of an environment overpacked with people forced to cope with the uneven distribution of goods and wealth, often relying on their wits and sheer luck to make it to the next paycheck without losing their minds.</p><p>The <em>SlavicPunk: Oldtimer</em> story goes to show that there is more than meets the eye to this dystopian version of the future is, and it is only up to the players to discover what lies beneath the neon glow and the concrete streets – helping Yanus unravel his last case and find out just how brutal and ugly the truth may actually be.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Alters - the upcoming release from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/this-war-of-mine">This War of Mine</a> team 11 bit Studios, described as an "emotional" sci-fi game featuring plenty of cloning action - has been delayed.</p>
<p>In a post on social media, which has been laid out like a letter to the game's main character Jan Dolski, the studio said this delay will allow time to "optimise all mission-critical systems", while ensuring "every aspect of your journey is as seamless as possible" on the game's release.</p>
<p>This note added that reception to the game so far had been positive, but "good" is "never enough" for Ally Corp, the company coordinating Jan's rescue from the hostile planet he is trying to escape from within the narrative of The Alters.</p>

<p>"This additional time will allow us to polish each phase of the project, delivering results that surpass our prior projections - an outcome that benefits both Ally Corp and, naturally, yourself," the delay announcement reads.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience and ongoing commitment to Ally Corp's mission."</p>
<p>The Alters is currently slated to release on an unspecified date during the first quarter of 2025, having previously been pegged to debut this year.</p>

<p>"It's a glimpse of a game that intrigues me but also leaves me slightly confused," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-devs-clone-survival-game-the-alters-is-a-curious-blend">Eurogamer's The Alters preview from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"This War of Mine had a much clearer idea - living as a civilian through war - whereas The Alters seems more speculative and fragmented. Is it a mining game? Is it a survival game? Is it a game about clones? I think it's trying to be all three, but I'm not yet convinced it's managed. But like I say, I've only seen a glimpse, and if it turns out to be anything like This War of Mine, I'll be happy."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Your first new car is the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII MR GSR '04, which...well, to be honest, that's a mighty fine bunch of numbers and letters, but I'm not enough of a car enthusiast to know what they mean. I'm sure it's fast, though!</p>
<p>You're also getting the Nissan GT-R Premium Edition T-spec '24, a speedy-looking sports car with a pretty beautiful dashboard, as well as the Toyota Hiace Van DX '16, which won't be winning any races but which looks like a sturdy and reliable enough little vehicle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.52-toyota-hiace.jpg?itok=mPYgkw6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-7-update-1.52-toyota-hiace.jpg?itok=tVFgBCUW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Toyota Hiace is a sweet little van you're getting as part of&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.52.</figcaption></figure><p>Other new features in this update include a brand new Cafe menu, which shows off an Audi collection and features some fun info about the German car industry.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new World Circuit events, including the Sunday Cup, which takes place on the Tokyo Expressway, as well as the Circuit de Sainte-Croix's Nissan GT-R Cup and the Kyoto Driving Park's Evolution Meeting.</p>
<p>More tracks have also been made compatible with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s Sophy AI, so you've got more places to test your skills against this advanced driving intelligence. Just don't be ashamed if you lose; that's what it's built for, after all.</p>

<p>This update is the latest in a long string of content drops for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, which have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-physics-new-cars">brought plenty</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-144">new cars</a> to the game since it launched back in March 2022, as well as new tracks and more.</p>
<p>Hopefully, some of these updates have been able to take the sting out of Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted">delisting&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em>without warning</a> back in January, which probably left a fair few racing fans in the lurch.</p>
<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation consoles</a>. Update 1.52 is due to arrive tomorrow, so make sure you're ready for it when it's up for download!</p>

<p>Nintendo has taken down another popular Nintendo Switch emulator as its war on emulation continues on all fronts. According to the social media accounts for the platform, the Ryujinx emulator has been shut down after the developer was “offered an agreement” by Nintendo.</p>



<p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” developer riperiperi said in the <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">software’s Discord server</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p>







<p>As of writing, all of the emulators files have been removed from GitHub, the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download page</a> on the Ryujinx website is empty,  and there are no more official updates coming to the software.</p>



<p>Ryujinx shutting down is the latest in a long line of Nintendo going after emulators and emulation in general. Earlier this year they had Switch emulator <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/yuzu-nintendo-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yuzu shut down</a>. They also have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-going-after-more-people-with-lawsuits/">multiple lawsuits</a> going regarding emulation and piracy.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment.</p>

After so many years of production, the risk that the game will have any shortcomings is unnecessary for us.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters Screenshots - Steam Next Fest 2024</h3></div></output><p>The Alters is a survival video game set for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, with a day-one launch on Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription service. You play Jan, a space miner who must create alternate versions of himself in order to survive on an inhospitable planet.</p><p>Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Inspired by the critically acclaimed title This War of Mine, The Alters thrusts players into a heart-pounding battle for survival that Jan can't conquer alone. After crash landing on a desolate planet with a scorching star, Jan must avoid the murderous conditions by taking refuge in a cutting-edge mobile base. The only issue? It’s meant to be operated by a skilled team and he’s just Jan.</blockquote><blockquote>Thankfully, fate takes a turn with the discovery of Rapidium, a mysterious substance exclusive to this perilous world. Interacting with the Quantum Computer on board the mobile base allows Jan to manipulate pivotal decisions from his past—creating alternate versions of himself known as Alters—that have the potential to change everything.</blockquote><p>The announcement of the delay comes hot on the heels of 11 bit studios’ release of city-building survival sequel Frostpunk 2, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-hits-350000-copies-sold-which-is-enough-for-the-dev-to-break-even-but-not-enough-to-prevent-a-share-price-collapse">which sold enough copies to break even but not enough to prevent a share price collapse</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Human bodies are frail and quickly fall to enemy attacks or suffer enough damage.

Even Rarities have trouble defeating enemies alone, so use humans in the area aggressively.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_028.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_029.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Deflect and Evade</strong></p><p>Enemy attacks can be repelled and neutralized with “Deflect”—A guide will display in the direction just before an enemy attacks. While in a defensive stance (guard), it will activate if the camera is shifted in that direction right when the guide lights up. When Deflect is successful, it will throw the enemy off balance and allow for a counterattack, as well as restoring Blood Weapon durability. Attacks that do not display a guide cannot be deflected. Use evasion or possession to deal with them.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_032.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_034.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Blood-Time_2024_10-02-24_035.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Blood Time</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [89 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully executing consecutive Deflects will activate Blood Time.

<p>
As ever, Choice membership fees include a five percent donation to charity. This month, the company's cause of choice is <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>, a global mental health service that offers confidential support via text message, rather than requiring people talk on the phone. 
</p>
<p>
(And the ususal full disclosure note here, that as of this year Eurogamer now shares a parent company with Humble in IGN Entertainment.)
</p>
<p>
"A gorgeous fantasy journey enlivened by some thrilling rock-climbing," is how Christian Donlan described Don't Nod's excellent puzzle platformer in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jusant-review">Eurogamer's Jusant review</a>. Sadly, the project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-bets-on-lost-records-bloom-rage-as-multiple-projects-fail-to-meet-expectations">did not go on to set tills ringing</a>.
</p>
<p>
"An ambitious sequel stuffed with delightful - and deadly - surprises," is how Vikki Blake described Gunfire Games' third-person shooter RPG in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remnant-2-review-an-eclectic-but-ever-rewarding-third-person-shooter">Eurogamer's Remnant 2 review</a>.
</p>
<p>
"A full-on sequel that tells an engrossing new story, even if its combat doesn't quite have the same wow factor," is how Malindy Hetfeld described Atlus' action role-player in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-strikers-review-an-impressive-sequel-that-inherits-some-of-the-originals-flaws">Eurogamer's Persona 5 Strikers review</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has issued a copyright strike against a YouTube channel that reviews emulation handhelds.</p>
<p>The channel in question, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RetroGameCorps">Retro Game Corps</a>, describes itself as offering "in-depth reviews and showcases" as well as "emulation setup guides". One of its more recent videos has received a copyright strike from Nintendo, marking a second strike for the channel.</p>
<p>"My Wii U video was taken down and I received another copyright strike, even though this showcase video was no different than all of the tech demos and reviews I have made on this channel previously," Retro Game Corps owner Russ wrote in a statement on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoZQiN0o7f36H7PaW4fVhFw/community?lb=UgkxqDniEBASvWOChP2-WYysGcwkCDwSMD9k">YouTube</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-is-now-going-after-youtube-accounts-which-show-its-games-being-emulated">TimeExtension</a>).</p>
<p>Russ is now considering filing a counterclaim as he believes the video "was for educational use, transformative in nature, and had no effect on the market".</p>

<p>"It was a demonstration of a console no longer for sale (even the Wii U eShop is closed, so the company itself has no means of earning revenue from Wii U sales)," Russ said. "However, I am reluctant to open that can of worms with a multi-billion dollar corporation, as their next step would be to file legal action."</p><p>The YouTube channel said it will now need to adapt the way it approaches future videos. "I will no longer show any Nintendo games on-screen, which is a shame because I love using those games for my hardware demonstrations," Russ wrote.</p>
<p>The channel is also going to blur out "any Nintendo game content" on its previous videos as a precaution. That includes "even innocuous content like NES games".</p>
<p>"Unfortunately this is going to delay some video releases - my latest video should be up right now, but instead I have to re-edit and re-upload the video first," Russ closed. "I know this is disappointing news, but with now two strikes on my channel, I don't really have any other choice except to adjust accordingly. Thanks for your understanding."</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-our-company-is-now-financially-sound-gamers-gravitate-towards-live-service-multiplayer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> some big announcements for game developers at Unreal Fest Seattle 2024, revealing the new features of Unreal Engine 5 and reducing the royalty fee for games that launch on the Epic Games Store at the same time as other stores.</p>
<p>However, before all these announcements, Epic founder, CEO, and main stakeholder Tim Sweeney <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYGEfQJPqW8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressed</a> the viewers with an interesting speech. First, he remarked that following <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-founder-explains-massive-layoffs-says-development-and-core-initiatives-are-unaffected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year's layoffs</a>, Epic is now solid from a financial standpoint and has registered record numbers for Fortnite and the store. Secondly, Sweeney discussed the growing importance of live service multiplayer in an increasingly complex gaming market where even big games may struggle.</p>
<p><em>I'm happy to tell you now that Epic&nbsp;is financially sound and that Fortnite and the Epic Game Store have hit new records in concurrency and success. Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users last holiday, an all-time peak. And this is all happening in the context of a game business that's rapidly changing in a way that we've only seen a few times in our lifetimes as game developers. It's a generational change. One of the manifestations we're seeing right now is a lot of games are released with high budgets and they're not selling nearly as well as expected, whereas other games are growing incredibly strong.</em></p>
<p><em>What we're seeing, the real trend here is that players are gravitating towards the really big games where they can play with more of their friends. This is a manifestation of Metcalfe's Law, the idea that the value of a network, a game, or a social experience grows in proportion to the number of friends that you can connect to. In the world of gaming, that means you and your friends getting together and playing games, chatting by voice, attending concerts, and doing all other kinds of cool virtual things online.</em></p>
<p><em>This trend, some people will call it the metaverse. We're not all in agreement on what this means. Some people, when they hear the word metaverse, think of what Facebook is doing with VR and now AR. Some people use the metaverse to describe everything they don't like about the current Fortnite season. But when you look at what's happening in the world of Fortnite, it's new and it's exciting and it's something that's never happened at this scale in the history of entertainment, with an original story that's evolving with original content and also all the world's brands participating. Musicians reaching users, Disney and Star Wars, and others all coming together to create a world-class entertainment experience that's ever-evolving and live, and that's that's really what we think that the future of gaming is about.</em></p>
<p>While Sweeney has a point when he says that an increasing number of players value the live multiplayer experience, it's equally true that several big live service multiplayer games have disappointed badly. Examples include the likes of Crucible, Babylon's Fall, Anthem, Marvel's Avengers, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, and most recently, Concord. Not even IPs as powerful as Marvel's and DC's were enough to prevent these failures.&nbsp;As such, while Epic may not be interested in making another single player game for the time being, many other developers certainly are, and they are bound to find success if they create a quality experience.</p>
<p>In other Epic news, Sweeney's company has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> Google and Samsung because of their auto blocker feature.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-mobile-version-in-development-at-pubg-studio.998469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has announced that it's working on a&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation, and that said adaptation will be handled by one of its most prominent studios.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-%ed%8c%b0%ec%9b%94%eb%93%9c-%eb%aa%a8%eb%b0%94%ec%9d%bc-%ea%b2%8c%ec%9e%84-%ea%b8%80%eb%a1%9c%eb%b2%8c-%eb%9d%bc%ec%9d%b4%ec%84%a0%ec%8a%a4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official Krafton website (which is in Korean; we're using machine translation), Krafton's mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>will be handled by PUBG Studios, the division responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em>.</p>
<p>Krafton says its&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>mobile adaptation will "faithfully reinterpret and implement the original's main fun elements to fit the mobile environment" (again, the actual wording is likely to be a touch different, since we're using machine translation).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=-f6w-90o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-mobile-announcement-player-riding-pal.jpg?itok=eMf81_b5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is making its way to mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot we don't yet know about&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s mobile version. It sounds like Krafton will be creating a brand new version of the game rather than just porting the existing version, but beyond that, we're not sure exactly what form&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile will take.</p>
<p>We also don't know when the game will launch for mobiles, nor do we know whether it'll make it out of Krafton's native Korea or not.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it will; after all,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-finally-dethrones-baldurs-gate-3-as-most-played-game-on-steam-deck-in-february">hugely popular game</a>, so it would seem rather foolish to restrict its mobile version to one region. Still, the game technically hasn't been announced in the West yet, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on mobile is a pretty timely one, though. Last week, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">surprise-launched on PS5</a> following a State of Play presentation (although not in Japan, where a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">patent infringement lawsuit</a> is currently ongoing between&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair and Nintendo).</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is a creature-collecting survival game in which the goal is to survive in a world populated by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-unleash-more-unspeakable-quasi-pokemon-brutality-and-cuddles"><em>Pokemon</em>-esque creatures</a> called Pals.</p>
<p>Although the designs are certainly reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, the gameplay is more akin to something like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>; you must build a base, battle hostile Pals, and decide whether you're going to enslave your Pals to help you build or to treat them as friends.</p>
<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is currently available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6360-PPSA23126_00-0112788005082769" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and we now know that a version of the game is also coming to mobile at some point.

                <p>Until late last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> was slated to be released in November of this year. Ubisoft subsequently made the surprise announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">the game has been delayed to early next year</a>. But according to a new report, this was far from a surprise to Ubisoft Quebec, the studio behind Shadows. The developers have reportedly been pushing for a delay for months.</p><p>Ubisoft's announcement stated that Shadows' new release date was implemented to give the developers more time to polish the gameplay, and because the company wanted to apply the lessons it learned from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review-missing-the-mark/1900-6418273/" data-ref-id="1900-6418273">Star Wars Outlaws</a>' disappointing rollout--the game has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-sales-were-worse-than-expected-ubisoft-admits-full-mobilized-to-fix-it/1100-6526702/" data-ref-id="1100-6526702">only around 1 million copies thus far</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inside Gaming</a>'s report states that both of those reasons are true, but adds further context by stating that, "[Assassin's Creed Shadow] is currently not at the stage it needs to be for release."</p><p>There are still adjustments to be made to fix the remaining bugs. However, the larger issues apparently revolve around the desire to shore up the historically accurate aspects of the story. One of the stated reasons for these 11th hour changes is that "historical experts were brought onto the project much later than usual for a project of this magnitude." </p><p>At least one silver lining from Ubisoft's latest moves was the decision to reverse the company's stance about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-reverses-its-steam-policy-will-launch-new-games-there-on-day-one/1100-6526711/" data-ref-id="1100-6526711">releasing new games on consoles and Steam</a> on day one. That was apparently a frequently requested change from some of Ubisoft's employees.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit consoles and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

                <p>A mobile version of the popular game Palworld is in the works, with PUBG company Krafton working out a licensing deal with Pocketpair to bring the game to phones.</p><p>PUBG Studios is developing the mobile version of Palworld, though additional details were not provided in the <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%86%A4-%ED%8C%B0%EC%9B%94%EB%93%9C-%EB%AA%A8%EB%B0%94%EC%9D%BC-%EA%B2%8C%EC%9E%84-%EA%B8%80%EB%A1%9C%EB%B2%8C-%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%EC%84%A0%EC%8A%A4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a>. Following Palworld's release in January 2024, scammers quickly created fake versions of Palworld for mobile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-dev-warns-of-mobile-game-scams/1100-6520728/" data-ref-id="1100-6520728">prompting Pocketpair to warn fans to remain vigilant. </a></p><p>The deal between Krafton and Pocketpair was announced not long after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">Nintendo sued Pocketpair over patent infringement claims.</a> Palworld had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-reaches-25-million-players-in-one-month/1100-6521294/" data-ref-id="1100-6521294">enormous success</a> when it launched on PC and Xbox earlier this year, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-launching-on-ps5-today-despite-nintendo-lawsuit/1100-6526675/" data-ref-id="1100-6526675">PS5 edition was released at the end of September.</a></p><p>Mobile is just the latest extension of Palworld, and Pocketpair doesn't plan to stop there.

One analyst believes Nintendo will prevail in its lawsuit against Pocketpair, saying he believes that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-vs-palworld-why-nintendo-will-probably-win-according-to-analyst/1100-6526608/" data-ref-id="1100-6526608">because Nintendo can't stop Palworld on the basis of copyright</a>, it intends to "screw them with other things," like technical patents.</p><p>If you're just getting started with the game, be sure to read <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/guides/">GameSpot's Palworld guides to hit the ground running.</a></p>
