			<p>Once Human is a brand-new free-to-play <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-the-new-weird-survival-game-is-out-now-and-already-in-steams-top-10/">survival game</a> set in a post-apocalyptic world. You must survive in a world completely transformed by a cataclysmic event. You wake up in the unknown world and fight against the hundreds and thousands of alien-like creatures named the Aberrant, now infesting the planet. This game took off upon release on July 9, reaching over 230,000 peak players. With a number so significant as 230,000, it puts Once Human in fifth place on Steam's official charts for the most played games.</p>
<p>With the market of post-apocalyptic and survival games being heavily saturated, the unique art style and weird aesthetic of Once Human played into its favor. Alongside the fun combat and gameplay, these features helped boost Once Human to the top.</p>
<p>In addition to hitting 230,000 peak players in-game for Once Human, they have also reached 500,000 members in the game's official Discord server.</p>
<p>As the game has been highly successful so far, the developers for Once Human have shared their road map and shown what updates they plan on bringing to the game over the coming seasons. The first major update is due in September, and Starry Studios has begun to tease what players can expect from the upcoming update.</p>
<p>Players have already had a busy month in July. Not only was the game fully released, but players got to be introduced to the Manibus, an eldritch entity that is terrorizing the world, where you have to team up with others to fight against it in the Prime War.</p>
<p>The latest update for Once Human will introduce a new PvP gameplay scenario in which a battle breaks out between the world's major factions, Mayflies and Rosetta. Along with the PvP scenario, those who prefer to stick to the story and explore the world in solitude can look forward to a PvE scenario. Within the PvE scenario, a new region will be explored, where players can climb mountains in the north, fend for themselves against new monsters, and experience brand-new challenges as they navigate the rocky terrain.</p>
<p>While all of this information is available to learn more about on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Once Human website</a>, a release date for the updates has not yet been released; however, the PvP scenario, at the very least, will be released relatively soon, with the website giving an estimated release date of September. As for the new PvE scenario, it is marked as "coming soon."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-prime-video-is-fixing-its-absolute-worst-feature.934458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-video-ui-subscriptions-fallout-1851602153<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a subscriber to Amazon Prime and watch its streamer offshoot Prime Video, you’ll know what an absolutely ghastly nightmare it can be to use. Shows and movies that you can watch for “free” as a Prime member are muddled with those that you need to buy or rent, <em>and </em>with those that come with add-on subscription packages; it’s a confusing and frustrating experience. It seems, fingers crossed, Amazon is about to fix this.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As spotted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>, the god-awful interface is going to receive a new tab that will exclusively contain programs and films that are included in the subscription. Yes, of course you would think it already had that, but no, it didn’t.</p><p>Rather brilliantly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon boasts this new feature on its own site</a></span> as “bringing clarity and simplicity back to streaming,” as if it’s leading the charge in the streaming wars. It is, of course, the only service on the entire planet that had obfuscated its offerings in such a way.  It’s uniquely Amazon that has, so very deliberately, blurred the lines between what’s included and what’s just a purchase from the Amazon store.</p><p>It’s worth adding, it’s generally a <em>good thing</em> that Prime doesn’t limit its offerings to what’s “free” within the deal. (Although that deal recently got a whole lot worse, with the addition of lengthy, randomly interruptive adverts for those who don’t increase their monthly tithe.) If I’m enormously in the mood to watch <em>Die Hard</em>, and I can’t find it on any of the 37 streaming services I’m subscribed to, then having the option to pay a couple of bucks to rent it for the evening is a boon. The issue is having it appear front-and-centre on the Prime Video app that I pay a stupid amount of money for, and then finding out it was a trick.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900">MrBeast’s Amazon Game Show Makes History With $5 Million Prize</a></span></p><p>It’s hard not to imagine this confusion was also hurting Amazon. Too often I’ll entirely miss a Prime-made show because it’s so mired in their menus beneath the nickel-and-diming that I’ll entirely forget it was available. I <em>still</em> haven’t watched <em>Invincible </em>or <em>The Wheel of Time</em>, because Prime’s algorithm is so botched for me that they’re impossibly buried. It doesn’t bode too well that the same Amazon update boasts of its “generative AI” that will help me “discover content.” (Companies! Stop calling things “content”! No one watching ever uses this word!) That just leads to more of the same blinkered funnelling that has Amazon’s web store recommending you nothing but vacuum cleaners because you recently bought a vacuum cleaner.</p><p> “We’re always listening to customers and reviewing feedback,” says Kam Keshmiri, the VP of design at Prime Video, “and it’s clear that many are in search of a more intuitive streaming experience.” Which is bullshit for, “People just want to be able to find the stuff they’re paying for.” So, well, I’m glad that’s going to be possible.</p><p>There will also now be tabs for add-ons you’ve bought, like Max, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll, singling out their shows and films too, along with the ability to manage those subscriptions within. Which, again, sounds like a huge blessing. I hate realizing I forgot to cancel the MGM+ sub that was cheaper than renting that one film last month, and then not being able to find what it actually offers thanks to the combination of awful UI and algorithmic blind spots. (Also, everyone on Earth, add the MGM+ sub so you can watch the best thing on TV right now, <em>From. </em>Set a calendar reminder to cancel it.)</p><p>Now perhaps Amazon, who <em>love</em> listening to their customers’ feedback so much, could listen to everyone screaming at them to pay their employees properly, allow unions, and provide proper safety measures in their facilities. That’d be great!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, PlayStation announced that a new Escalation of Freedom update is coming to Helldivers 2 on August 6, 2024.</p>



<p>The update will introduce brand-new enemies, objective variety, and more. That includes a CR 10: Super Helldive, adding another difficulty level with greater challenges and rewards to match.</p>



<p>There will also be “new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs.” These offer Super Sample rewards, but “many” of the new mission objectives will be available in the existing difficulty levels too.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Escalation of Freedom Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new enemies will include the Spore Charger, which uses fog for cover, a Terminid Alpha Commander, and a Rocket Tank Automaton. However, the blog also teases “some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.”</p>



<p>The environments are also getting a new update, with new fog and flora turning swamps into unpredictable areas that limit visibility.</p>



<p>The Escalation of Freedom update also brings a range of quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>It will address grief kicking, where kicked players “spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session.” Meanwhile, the previous squad’s loot will remain unchanged.</p>



<p>There will also be “major fixes to the social menu,” as well as “a ton of surprises to discover.” Most recently, Helldivers 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-hotfix-for-infinite-drop-in-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a hotfix</a> for the infinite drop-in glitch.</p>

Described as the game’s “biggest update yet,” it will add new enemies, mission objectives, difficulty levels, and more. <span id="more-900800"></span></p><p>Get the details below, via Arrowhead Game Studios social media and community manager Katherine Baskin.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to the Escalation of Freedom, Helldivers. We’ve taken the time to gather feedback from our players on the front lines, and we’re bringing greater variety to our content. From missions and objectives to enemies and planets, we’re delivering lots of new content for both our veteran players and brand-new Helldivers on the battlefield. Get ready for our biggest update yet!</p><p>Our community continues to show us how strong we all are when united against the mindless Automatons and the scourge of the Terminid. As we stand here, on the eve of the Escalation of Freedom, we reflect on the six months since launch. We could never have predicted how far this game would go and how many Citizens would answer Super Earth’s call to arms!</p><p>We’ve watched our forces expertly handle every conflict and challenge we’ve thrown their way, from flying enemies to the Terminid Control System, to saving the children of Super Citizen Anne’s Hospital. Now for this major update, it’s time for us to give back something big to the community and welcome in even more players to the <em>Helldivers</em> universe.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Helldivers, this is escalating quickly.</p><p><strong>Go on a Super Helldive</strong></p><p><em>—Go up against the new supersized bot fortresses.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Something that continues to amaze us is our players’ insatiable desire for more bugs, more bots, more liberation, and more destruction. We thought nine levels of Helldiving difficulties would be enough, but in the Escalation of Freedom we’re turning it up to 10… Combat Rating 10 that is.</p><p>CR 10: Super Helldive is our most challenging, most relentless dive difficulty level yet, and we hope that this is going to give players the intensity they’re looking for on the battlefield. And with a great challenge comes greater rewards.</p><p><em>—The larva retrieval mission has the Helldivers babysitting a bug.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>But a new difficulty level isn’t the only thing the community wanted. We’ve also heard your desire for mission variation, which is why we’re bringing you new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs that offer brand new Super Sample rewards. These outposts will be heavily fortified, and require players to coordinate and strategize in order to take them out.</p><p>And if you’re new to <em>Helldivers II</em>, you don’t have to worry about missing out on all the fun until you unlock Super Helldive, because many of our new mission objectives will be playable on other difficulty levels.</p><p><strong>New Enemies and Dangerous Swamps</strong></p><p><em>—The Impaler returns!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Escalation of Freedom is unleashing some new threats to our liberty that will take some serious strategizing from the Helldivers to take down.</p><p>Back by popular demand: the Impaler! This big guy from the original Helldivers creates some new challenges. No longer can you run from the bugs when the Impaler is around–big, imposing, and destructive, it demands to be dealt with.</p><p>Also new among the Terminid ranks is the Spore Charger. As if the regular old Charger wasn’t scary enough, the Spore Charger is shrouded in fog to obscure its location until it’s right up on you, Helldiver.</p><p><em>—The new Spore Charger in the fog.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Lastly, the Terminid Alpha Commander, which is a supercharged Brood Commander that’s bigger, meaner, and doesn’t hesitate to call in other bugs for backup.</p><p><em>—You thought the regular old Brood Commander was bad? Think again.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Don’t think we forgot about the Automatons. Their ranks are growing, too, with the addition of the formidable Rocket Tank, as well as some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.</p><p><em>—The Automaton uprising continues.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Explore the swamps but not as you know them, with rolling fog and the untamed flora, the blackened trees obscure the light and the air itself feels haunted. Keep your flashlight handy, as visibility is limited and light is key. The enemy could be hiding anywhere amongst the undergrowth.</p><p><em>—Get spooked, Helldivers.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Under the Hood</strong></p><p>The last addition I want to highlight about the Escalation of Freedom update is that we’re making changes to mitigate the problem of grief kicking in <em>Helldivers II</em>. While it’s our hope that players engage with the game in good faith and sportsmanship, we do recognize that some players are using the team kicking to grief others.</p><p>To help improve this we have implemented a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.</p><p>With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with no one Helldiver losing out. We’re committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play.</p><p>Along with this, we’re also releasing other quality of life upgrades with Escalation of Freedom, including major fixes to the social menu to make diving with your friends easier.</p><p>Overall, we think this escalation is going to be packed full of awesome additions, long-awaited improvements, and a ton of surprises to discover! <em>Helldivers II: Escalation of Freedom</em> is launching on August 6!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>CAPCOM's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, NetEase's Marvel Rivals beta, and Final Fantasy XIV Online are among the latest games to support NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess was released last week, complete with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and Reflex support, which deliver a high framerate experience with limited input delay, something I did highlight in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">review</a>. Despite not being a fast-paced game, higher framerates definitely improve the experience as a whole.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Marvel Rivals definitely benefits from the higher framerate offered by NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and reduced input delay offered by Reflex. The game's closed beta, which will be available until August 5th, also supports both for a superior experience.</p>
<p>Joining the NVIDIA DLSS family of supported titles is the upcoming open-world RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">Neverness to Everness</a>, F1 Manager, and Dark and Darker. The last two, however, only support DLSS 2, so no Frame Generation is available. Supporting NVIDIA DLSS 2 are also the Bladekisser DLC for Trepang 2 and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/"> Final Fantasy XIV Online</a>, which received support for the upscaler with the update 7.0 introducing support for the Dawntrail expansion. A new <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a> was also launched to allow players to test their machine's ability to run the game. A free trial is also available for the game, allowing users to play up to level 70 with no restriction for free.</p>
<p>Since the release of its second version, NVIDIA DLSS has become a real game changer. You can learn more about the technology and supported games by going <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, the Fortnite team confirmed key details about the anticipated Fall Guys collaboration, which is finally available after its delay.</p>



<p>The crossover allows players to create Fall Guys-themed islands with UEFN and Fortnite Creative. Fans will have access to assets from both games, and outfits will automatically turn into beans. Naturally, non-Fortnite skins will be turned into default beans instead.</p>



<p>Today’s post adds that “you will be able to publish your Fall Guys islands starting August 6 via the Creator Portal.” Players need to publish their creations manually. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to the new blog, islands must have an ESRB rating of E for United States, and a PEGI rating of 7 or less for Europe.</p>



<p>Further, any islands that players build with the Fall Guys template also have a chance to end up in a “limited time Fall Guys row.” This should give the new islands a chance to shine, and help build the community in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Fortnite team originally intended to release the Fall Guys crossover in May 2024. They later <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1783148869150248988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed it</a> until Summer 2024, with no concrete release window.</p>



<p>Today’s Fall Guys collaboration comes via Fortnite’s anticipated v30.30 update. The major patch also adds the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla Cybertruck vehicle</a>, which drew some fan criticism. A recent leak also teased some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-6-will-introduce-new-movement-mechanics-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential new mechanics</a> coming to Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-team-addresses-criticisms-in-new-message-for-the-japanese-community/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Since its announcement, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been heavily criticized. Players have raised concerns about historical accuracy, mainly around the game’s new protagonist, Yasuke. Recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japanese-petition-ac-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition</a> was launched in Japan to cancel the game entirely. The Assassin’s Creed Shadows dev team has addressed these criticisms in a new message for the Japanese community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message underscores the team’s profound respect for the Japanese community and their rich heritage. The developers want to ensure that the Japanese community understands the depth of their respect and passion for the ‘historical and cultural integrity’ of their ‘rich heritage.’ This is why they have laid out a series of points to clarify their ‘intentions and creative decisions.’&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-authenticity-efforts">Authenticity Efforts&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The message first talks about their authenticity efforts and how they have put “significant effort into ensuring an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal Japan”. However, they want to clarify that they have never wanted Assassin’s Creed games, including Shadows, to become “factual representations of history, or historical characters”. On the other hand, they only wish to create intrigue and want players to learn and explore these historical settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs expand, stating that the team has “extensively collaborated with external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan to inform our creative choices.” At the same time, they understand that some “promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community,” and they sincerely wish to apologize for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the constructive criticism they have received, the developers have clarified that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will ‘keep evolving till launch’ and the development will continue until it is delivered. They want the community to know that they are listening and learning from their feedback, and they request the community not to criticise their collaborators, as the creative teams have made all the decisions “in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.’&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Official World Premiere Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vovkzbtYBC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-address-yasuke-s-concerns">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Address Yasuke’s Concerns</h2>



<p>The message further explains that the Assassin’s Creed games are works of fiction inspired by actual historical events, and the representation of Yasuke “is an illustration of this.” Yasuke’s mysterious and unique life made the character “an ideal candidate” for their Feudal Japan setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they acknowledge that Yasuke’s depiction as a samurai has become a matter of debate and discussion. They have incorporated this aspect into the narrative of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The developers concluded by stating that they value the player feedback and encourage them to continue respectfully sharing their thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the comments section, there has been a division of opinions regarding Ubisoft’s message on Assassin’s Creed Shadows. While some gamers empathize with Ubisoft, recognizing the game as fiction, others advocate for alterations or removing the protagonist. We are eager to hear your insights on the main character of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Share your perspectives with us in the comments.</p>

<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-facing-exploitation-accusations-for-new-ac-shadows-dubbing-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of exploitation</a> for its AC Shadows content. Also, AC Infinity has been renamed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animus-hub-ac-infinity-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animus Hub</a>,” and it might appear with the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> EA Sports College Football 25 | Official Gameplay First Look Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>As an additional complication, the game is launching at the same time as the "summer roster movement that is natural to college football," EA says in its update. "For our very passionate Dynasty fans, you can hop in and play this week or wait for a roster update around college football kickoff for the most up to date experience."</p><p>Other than these visual and roster inaccuracies, EA lists a number of issues with the game's Dynasty mode that are high on the list for fixes and tuning. One particularly disruptive bug is impacting players when trying to load a previously established online dynasty, which EA has listed as high-priority for a fix. As well as bug fixes, EA is also looking at tuning the Super Sim Logic that drives the dynamic, long-term Dynasty mode, in line with player feedback.</p><p>EA has said that most of these issues will require a console-side update, which it refers to as a Title Update. You can check out the full list of known issues below.</p><h2>EA Sports College Football 25 Known Issues</h2><p><strong>AUDIO</strong></p><ul><li>Incorrect commentary when playing as the first game of the season in Dynasty at Utah</li><li>Florida State’s War Chant and Tennessee's “Rocky Top” are not audible when playing only on Xbox Series S</li></ul><p><strong>LOGOS</strong></p><ul><li>The following teams/conferences have incorrect logos: Stanford, UMass, Western Michigan, Jacksonville State, FIU, New Mexico, SEC, Conference USA, and the Sun Belt</li><li>UTEP and Wyoming display incorrect athletic branding on their equipment in Dynasty</li><li>Visual issue with conference patches when changing a small subset of teams Conference in Dynasty</li></ul><p><strong>DYNASTY</strong></p><ul><li>Super Sim Logic Tuning: The team is looking into tuning of the Super Sim Logic, including FCS schools upsetting too many Power 5 schools  <ul><li>Note: As we continue internal testing on the tuning of Super Sim Logic, Top 25 Polls &amp; the College Football Playoff seedings will also see an improvement.</li></ul></li><li>Issue when adding additional teams to the PAC-12 conference when using custom conferences does not generate a new conference schedule as intended.  <ul><li>Workaround: After adding teams to the PAC-12, open the Conference Rules and set Divisions to ON.

			<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess starts, as many games do, with disaster. Mt. Kafuku has fallen to the Seethe, a collection of monstrous creatures who serve the Mountain Goddess. We shouldn’t be surprised that it’s all humanity’s fault, with the local populace growing greedy and taking all of the mountain’s wealth. You take on the role of Soh, a samurai called upon to assist the Maiden Yoshiro, and together you must purify the mountain, and return it to its natural state.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GiOLpNtcNNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While there’s plenty of hack-and-slash action here, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess">Kunitsu-Gami</a> brings in elements of Pikmin and tower defence titles to create an invigorating amalgam of the three. As you enter each village you come across its inhabitants that have been petrified, and once you release them you can add them to your group, assigning them roles to help defend against the Seethe that will attack at night.</p>


<p>While these villagers are an essential part of your fighting force, it’s Soh that stands resolutely at the front, holding back the Seethe with pirouetting dance moves that send his blade swinging in all directions. You can upgrade Soh’s loadout with different Tsuba Guards containing unique and extremely handy powers, as well as a series of different skills which further augment your abilities. Soh’s controls are relatively familiar, and at times you may be underwhelmed by the limited number of combos, but you’ve got rather a lot to deal with elsewhere.</p>


<p>Each level sees you guiding the Maiden Yoshiro along the spirit path, leading her to a corrupted Torii gate, the source of blight on the area. Once you’ve laid the path, she dances along very, very slowly, meaning that she won’t generally make it to the gate during the first day. With the arrival of night, monsters start spewing from the gate, and you have to protect Yoshiro from them.</p>
<p>If you’ve played games like Hellwardens, Dungeon Defenders or Orcs Must Die, you’ll understand how this plays out. The monsters travel along different routes towards Yoshiro and your recruited villagers can be assigned roles to help fend them off. You empower them via different masks you unlock as you progress, starting with straightforward jobs like the Woodcutter with his axe and moving up to more unusual roles like the Thief who searches for hidden treasure before running away at the first sign of danger.</p>
<p>You have to carefully position your villagers along the route in order to maximise their usefulness, from where they’ll attack anything that comes into range. Each mask can be levelled up as well, improving their abilities as the monstrous foes become ever more challenging.</p>

<p>The enemy designs here are grotesque and thoroughly hateful, all based upon Japanese mythology. You’ll marvel at how otherworldly they are, with claws, tentacles and tongues that are often in places that those things shouldn’t be. While they start off as pure sword fodder for Soh and his compatriots, they become larger and more dangerous, punctuated at different points by huge boss battles that change the narrative further.</p>
<p>This is where elements of Capcom’s Monster Hunter series bleed in, with Soh facing off against immense enemies that require different tactics to take down. I have to admit that I found the opening of Kunitsu-Gami unbelievably easy, and worried that it would put up little resistance, but the arrival of a huge centipede creature in the third level put those fears away, as it thoroughly kicked my arse.</p>
<p>The answer, unsurprisingly, was that I needed to make better use of my villagers, and you need to call on them frequently in these encounters, moving them around, and having them rush back to defend Yoshiro when the boss comes too close. You cannot switch off for a moment here, and the ongoing bouts become steadily tougher, pushing you to constantly revise and update your tactics.</p>

<p>There are quieter moments, though. During the daytime dance through the village you have the chance to purify the area of corruption, collecting orbs which you can use to assign roles to your villagers, all the while Yoshiro dances along the spirit path. You can speed up time if you’ve done everything you need to, but as levels become larger, with multiple routes and gates, you’ll still find yourself rushing to be ready for the oncoming horde.</p>
<p>Once you’ve cleared a level, you can set up a base, repairing and rebuilding the monuments and buildings, and earning further upgrades and currency in the process. These offer a pleasant bit of downtime, reminding me of the older Monster Hunter villages, though occasionally it does just feel like busy work rather than something truly integral. It’s nice to see each area steadily coming back to life though.</p>

<p>While there are plenty of similarities, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is shorter and smaller in scale than Monster Hunter, but rather than being a negative, it’s refreshing to find something that’s going to take less than 20 hours to thoroughly make you way through. The pace feels just right, and it doesn’t overstay its welcome, coming to an end just when you might be starting to tire of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Themed after Kagura, a style of Japanese theatre, there’s very little like Kunistu-Gami. The entire narrative is told without words, with action and dance sequences the main storytelling devices. It works incredibly well, and you’re never unsure of what’s happening, despite the lack of exposition. It does feel like a sister project to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, but one that delves even further into Japanese mythology and culture, retaining and exploring an element of gaming that’s been sidelined by expanding Western tastes.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess offers a stunning and memorable aesthetic that matches well with its unusual, but compelling mix of different genres. Capcom has proven why they’re one of the most successful and long-running developers and publishers out there, and that they’re still willing to push the boundaries once in a while.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-confirmed-despite-negative-reactions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>IGN recently published a ten minute preview of Star Wars Outlaws and the reaction has been rather negative. Comments about frame rate drops, low quality explosions and the graphics of the game have all been posted. While it does look good in certain places there are other areas where it clearly needs a bit of polish, check the sequence around 5m50s where Kay Vess walks through a puddle, those are some PS2 era ripples in the water.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws: 10 Minutes of Exclusive Gameplay - IGN First" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U-M1Lu6iVhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The reactions have led to a Bank of America analyst discussing the game in an earnings call and asking Ubisoft if it would be delayed.</p>
<p>“The game has gone gold, so the date is well confirmed for August 30,” Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet commented. “We’ll shortly be seeing more content of very high quality and multiple hours that will really show the depths of the open world that is a key element of the promise to enjoy the exploration of the galaxy with multiple planets, so that should bode well for the game in terms of high-quality delivery.”</p>
<p>“As we’ve said also for Star Wars, the level of quality of the world and the experience is really very high,” adds Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. “We are really leveraging our engine, and I think people will love it.”</p>

<p>Set between the events of Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, you’ll play as outlaw Kay Vess who’s trying to pull off one of the biggest heists ever in the Outer Rim. That journey will take you across several planets that&nbsp;<em>obviously</em> includes Tatooine, but also has less familiar settings and brand new ones, like the moon of Toshara.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws will be released on August 30th for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, will you be buying the game?</p>

        <p>Will it give the map a boost?</p>

            <p>I've not played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter- Strike 2</a> in yonks, but I know a big update when I see one. That's right: Valve have added some new crates just outside of counter-terrorist spawn, near bombsite A. This means that players can now use these boxes to hop from CT up to catwalk with little fuss, where previously you'd need to use your teammates' heads as a springboard. What does this mean as a layperson who sort of plays the game sometimes? More than you might think!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Just outside CT spawn then, you'll find some new crates tucked just below the catwalk above. Here's a clip of the new boost in action:</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1e9u7bu/new_dust2_short_boost_route_july_22_2024_patch/">New Dust2 short boost route [July 22 2024 Patch]</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/super_shogun/">u/super_shogun</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/">GlobalOffensive</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Before, as either a terrorist or counter-terrorist, you wouldn't have been able to get up to catwalk without: 1) help; 2) circling around the bombsite in a laborious fashion. With the latter made tougher when you add in the possibility of the exact smoke grenade shown in the clip above, alongside possible players on Long A (after you've crossed the smoke), or on the catwalk, or on the bombsite itself.</p>
<p>It seems like Valve's popped these new crates in as a means to even the balance. Dust 2 has historically been a terrorist-sided map (easier positional play for attackers, basically) and it now only requires one smoke grenade to block CT vision, whereas before it was two. With these crates, it means that CTs are less likely to get caught between their spawn and the smoke, letting them rotate and defend a bit easier. </p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I'm no CS strat-head. But the introduction of these crates almost certainly makes things easier for CTs and will likely manufacture a tonne of new plays - possibly, a new meta. A ten-years younger Ed would've taken to Twitch to watch how the pros adapt to these crates in an effort to climb the ranks. Now, those days are behind me and I think my stress levels thank me for that.</p>
<p>Other things of note in the update? No not, really. You can check them out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/4363508865823029428?l=english">here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Cataclismo is the next game from Moonlighter developer Digital Sun and it's out now in early access.
</p>
<p>
The game was previously shown at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">2023's Humble Games showcase</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">Triple-i showcase</a> back in April to generate plenty of interest. It's also published by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> publisher Hooded Horse.
</p>
<p>
Cataclismo is a twist on real-time strategy and tower defence, where players are tasked with building a fortress and defending it from endless hordes of demonic enemies, all with a unique moonlit art style.

<p>

In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1422440/view/4372516065076900932">notice on Steam</a>, the developer highlights how involving the game's community during the later stages of development has "invaluable potential". It parallels the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a>, No Rest for the Wicked, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> in launching first into early access.
</p>
<p>
For now, the game includes a fully-voiced campaign of eleven levels, with more to come before the launch of 1.0, as well as a Skirmish Mode, Endless mode, a comprehensive Level Editor, and Steam Workshop compatibility to share maps.
</p>
<p>
"Over the course of Early Access, more biomes, features, and modes will be added, including additional content for the Endless game mode and new levels for the main campaign," reads the Steam notice. "Even though it's too early to say when our 1.0 launch will happen, we expect to be in Early Access at least through the first months of 2025."
</p>
<p>
It continues: "It's been more than five years since we released Moonlighter, and we owe every bit of success to our players' support. Whether Cataclismo is your first Digital Sun game, or you've stuck around since Will's grand adventure, we're grateful you've joined us on this journey."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Christian Donlan went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cataclismo-is-a-game-of-castle-walls-and-terrible-mistakes">hands-on with Cataclismo</a> a few months back and came away impressed. "But the key, I think, lies with two things: the simple things are very satisfying, and you are never far from disaster," he wrote.

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus.934359/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-lego-sets-leak-including-99-battle-bus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Photos showing Lego's first wave of official Fortnite sets have popped up online, and feature a $99/€120 (roughly £76) Battle Bus set featuring an array of fan favourite characters as Lego minifigures.
</p>
<p>
Physical Fortnite Lego sets had been widely expected ever since the launch of last year's Lego Fortnite mode, which acts as the centrepiece of the two brands' deep integration. Fortnite now hosts an array of Lego minigames made both by fans and Lego itself, while almost every in-game character skin now has a digital minifigure version. 
</p>
<p>
Four Lego sets will reportedly arrive on 1st October this year, including the aforementioned Battle Bus, plus large models featuring a Supply Llama ($39/€39, about £30), the Durr Burger ($15/€15, about £12) and the Halloween-themed Peely Bone ($99/€99, about £76).
</p>
<p>
It's not the first time these sets have been detailed in leaks, although it is the first time we're seeing them in photos. 
</p>
<p>
Lego sets invariably leak long before their official announcement due to the long manufacturing and marketing process that sees production begin years before sets actually arrive (the recently-confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Legend of Zelda Deku Tree set</a> is another <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-lego-zelda-set-seemingly-confirmed-by-copyright-removals">good example of this</a>).
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Eurogamer previously asked Epic Games about the likelihood of physical Fortnite Lego sets appearing - and they sounded a fair bet.
</p>
<p>
"Clearly there's appetite," Lego's chief product and marketing officer Julia Goldin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-feels-a-minecraft-for-the-metaverse-era">told me last December</a>. "Anything is possible. We plan our portfolio over the years to come - and again, it's just the beginning."
</p>
<p>
So, the Lego <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-own-developers-dont-seem-thrilled-at-elon-musks-cybertruck-being-added-to-the-game">Fortnite Cybertruck</a> next? Too soon.

            <p>
As players continue to struggle with the final boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree, one savvy <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> streamer has destroyed the boss in just one hit.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, this was only a matter of time. While reactions to the DLC initially focused on its high difficulty - particularly the final boss - players have slowly found various methods of getting through the encounter. And this might be the most impressive (and convoluted) yet.

<p>

The boss in question is Promised Consort Radahn who, in the second phase, is mounted by Miquella to become Radahn, Consort of Miquella. His high speed attacks become infused with golden light and it's this phase in particular that's caused players problems.
</p>
<p>
One answer is to skip the phase altogether by simply beating the entire boss fight in one hit.
</p>
<p>
That's what Twitch streamer Ainrun managed, dealing 93,000 points of damage with just one melee weapon hit. The streamer shared a clip of the win on social media site X, which has since garnered plenty of attention.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
So how is it done? Good question. Much of the clip sees Ainrun standing outside the boss door inflicting a whole string of buffs and debuffs to maximise damage output and decrease enemy defence.
</p>
<p>
Ainrun swaps between consumables, talismans, weapon skills, and armours extremely quickly, which inflict status effects sleep, madness, and poison, but with talismans to offer attack power buffs. The likes of Seppuku, Rallying Standard, and Royal Knight's Resolve are weapon skills to improve damage output, while the Rakasha armour set increases damage dealt and taken - thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streamer-manages-to-one-shot-elden-ring-dlcs-final-and-most-difficult-boss">IGN</a> for listing out the items and effects used.

</p>
<p>
Then, in one hit, Radahn's health bar is completely wiped. And once the cutscene ends to introduce the second phase, he immediately falls dead. God slain.
</p>
<p>
What's even more impressive is Ainrun not only achieved this feat a second time, but upped his damage output to destroy Radahn with 105,000 points of damage in just one hit.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-respectful-representation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has put significant effort into ensuring Assassin's Creed Shadows is an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal Japan, but the game was never meant to be a factual representation of history or historical characters.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft shared a new message on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a> addressed to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-cancel-assassins-creed-shadows/">Japanese community</a>, which doesn't seem to be taking some of the developer's decisions too well, going over some of the controversies surrounding the next entry in the series set in Feudal Japan. As mentioned above, Ubisoft said that the entirety of the series isn't meant to be a factual representation of history, but it is aimed at sparking curiosity and encouraging players to learn more about the historical settings the developers are inspired by. As such, Assassin's Creed Shadows is designed, first and foremost, to be an entertaining game that tells a compelling fiction set in Feudal Japan.</p>
<p>Despite their sustained efforts, Ubisoft recognizes that some of the Assassin's Creed Shadows marketing caused concerns within the Japanese community, and for that, they apologize. At the same time, the development team reminded fans how the series has always taken creative license and incorporated fantasy elements to craft engaging experiences. It was the same in the new entry in the series with Yasuke, who's represented as a samurai despite this status being a matter of debate and discussion. This is woven into the narrative and with the other lead character, Naoe, to provide players with different gameplay styles.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows launches on November 15th for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>A glance at comedy medieval medic sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stretcher-men">Stretcher Men</a> might have you believe it is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op game</a> about co-ordination and teamwork. Not so! It's a singleplayer game in which you control not one but both carriers of a stretcher. You have to ferry a sick man over the hilly countryside, past muddy lake banks and over snowy mountains, all without dropping him on the ground. I can only imagine it controls a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/brothers-a-tale-of-two-sons">Brothers: A Tale Of Two Sons</a>, but with added ragdoll jollity. We'll know next week, when it releases <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2884650/STRETCHER_MEN/">on Steam</a>.

<p>I enjoy the shots of the two peasant lads navigating snow-covered peaks and marching against the light of the full moon. It's like some deleted scene from Lord of the Rings in which Merry and Pippin have to carry a hungover Gimli to the nearest elven refuge for a rest. 

</p><p>"Players control two characters," say developers Chraph, "one at the front and one at the back of the stretcher, and must navigate through various obstacles while maintaining balance. With simple yet deep gameplay, your attention and coordination skills will be put to the test."

</p><p>Does this constitute a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/bennett-foddy">Foddylike</a>? Perhaps. It's got the clumsiness, the basic challenge, the absurdist set-up. There's nothing from the Steam blurb to suggest you'll have to restart from the beginning every time you drop the ill dude. But maybe? We'll know more when it comes out next week on July 28th.

</p><p>Games about clumsiness and co-ordination often appeal to me. I'm looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>, for instance, and this looks like a more bare bones version of that, set in a vague, uncomplicated landscape. I suspect we can file it next to "games that will be played by Twitch streamers for a whole day and then probably forgotten about". But that's okay. Some games are there as snacks to gobble up, get your laughs, and move on. I fully digested the humour of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a> after just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">an hour of wonderful torture with Nic and Edwin</a>, and I don't regret it.</p>

            <p>
The development team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has apologised for elements in the game's marketing campaign so far that have jarred with some Japanese fans - and said the game will "keep evolving" as it heads towards launch in November. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's statement, released via social media today in both English and Japanese, is fairly unspecific about what exactly it is apologising for - other than noting that "some elements in our promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community". 
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sorry-assassins-creed-shadows-artwork-features-real-life-historical-re-enactment-group-logo">Ubisoft apologised for artwork featured in the game's Collector's Edition</a> that included the logo of a modern day re-enactment group.

<p>
Perhaps surprisingly, the statement goes on to specifically highlight the character of Yasuke, a lightning rod for controversy from some quarters who are unhappy at the portrayal of the historical Black samurai and his inclusion as one of Shadows' two protagonists. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-condemns-malicious-developer-abuse-after-assassins-creed-shadows-reveal">Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot spoke out to condemn "malicious and personal online attacks" directed at Assassin's Creed Shadows' development team</a> in the wake of the game's reveal. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté has also addressed the matter, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-boss-explains-why-he-ignored-elon-musk-after-backlash-over-african-samurai-yasuke">how he reacted to a tweet from billionaire X and Tesla owner Elon Musk</a> criticising diversity in game design. 
</p>
<p>
"While we strive for authenticity in everything we do, Assassin's Creed games are works of fiction inspired by real historical events and figures," Ubisoft's statement today reads. 
</p>
<p>
"From its inception, the series has taken creative license and incorporated fantasy elements to craft engaging and immersive experiences. The representation of Yasuke in our game is an illustration of this. His unique and mysterious life made him an ideal candidate to tell an Assassin's Creed story with the setting of Feudal Japan as a backdrop. 
</p>
<p>
"While Yasuke is depicted as a samurai in Assassin's Creed Shadows, we acknowledge this is a matter of debate and discussion. We have woven this carefully into our narrative and with our other lead character, the Japanese shinobi Naoe, who is equally important in the game, our dual protagonists provide players with different gameplay styles."

<p>
The statement notes that Ubisoft has collaborated with numerous "external consultants, historians, researches and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan", but says anyone external to the company was "in no way responsible for the decisions that are taken by the creative teams in the interests of gameplay and entertainment". 
</p>
<p>
Criticism therefore should not be directed at "collaborators, both internal and external", the statement requests. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft closes by encouraging fans to continue sharing their feedback "respectfully".

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12pm UK:</strong> Fortnite has now formally detailed how players can get their hands on the Cybertruck, and as suspected (below) the vehicle has ultimately been revealed as a free reward. 
</p>
<p>Players can add the Cybertruck to their in-game garage without paying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> a penny by completing a series of in-game quests between now and 7th August. The vehicle will also be available in Rocket League via a similar manner, and is a cross-game unlock.
</p>
<divider></divider>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11am UK:</strong> 
Reaction to yesterday's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elon-musks-tesla-cybertruck-will-be-available-to-buy-in-fortnite">reveal of the Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite</a> has been swift from players and Epic Games' own developers alike. 
</p>
<p>
In a rare show of public disapproval, several Epic Games staff have taken to social media to give their personal takes on the addition of Elon Musk's car to the game. 
</p>
<p>
"Reminder that 1) Voting with your wallet works and sentiment on social media is a tangible factor," Fortnite Festival producer Kyle Wynn <a href="https://x.com/KyleTheWynner/status/1815427055158263840">wrote</a>. "2) Companies are composed of lots of different people with their own unique opinions. 3) That truck looks fucking silly and the CEO of that company is a piece of shit."
</p>
<p>
"Reminder that opinions are mine and mine alone," another Epic Games developer who has since locked their X account wrote. "Destroy on sight [middle finger emoji]."
</p>
<p>
On reddit and X, numerous fans have said they will indeed actively hunt out players using the Cybertruck on sight, and have called upon other battle royale players to put aside their usual gameplay and team up against anyone seen driving the vehicle.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
Fortnite is, at the time of writing, currently in downtime as the game's latest patch is pumped out. But dataminers peering into the update's files have discovered that the Cybertruck appears to be a free reward, given away upon completion of a new questline. 
</p>
<p>
The Cybertruck being made free to acquire would be a curious move from Epic Games, as yesterday's trailer gave no suggestion it would be given away. But in doing so, Epic would sidestep the matter of asking players to pay up for the in-game vehicle, with some portion of the proceeds presumably going to Musk himself. 
</p>
<p>
We'll update again when the Cybertruck's method of acquisition is formally announced.
</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4, also known as the "Polaris" project, will be the first entry in the series to be powered by the Unreal Engine 5. While this was definitely disappointing to learn for a lot of fans due to the known stuttering issues of the engine, the move could lead to some improvements that could benefit all of the games powered by the ending.</p>
<p>According to the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a>, if there is one development team that could solve the stuttering issues plaguing the engine, it is CD Projekt Red. Also, the team is well aware of them, as shown in a photo shared by Alex Battaglia in the video below taken during an Unreal Fest presentation by CD Projekt Red. As such, there's no doubt that the developer will try their best to solve the issues, and whatever they are able to come up with, it's extremely likely it will be integrated into the engine, thus improving every game powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><iframe title="If The Witcher 4 Is On Unreal Engine 5, Will It Stutter?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cp_pd92iqWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Very little is currently known about <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-polaris-development-cdpr-acquired/">The Witcher 4 "Polaris"</a>, other than the fact that it is the game in the works at CDPR in the most advanced state of development, and that it will mark the beginning of a new saga. Geralt of Rivia, however, will return to our screens at some point, as a remake of the first entry in the series is also in the works. Little is known about this remake as well, but it has been said that it will do away with parts of the original that are<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-bad-parts/"> outdated and bad.</a></p>

According to the latest announcement, Baldur’s Gate 3 Patch 7’s closed beta has been delayed due to an issue with Dice Rolls; learn more details below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>

<p>Through a post on their official X account, Larian Studios has announced that the Patch 7 closed beta for Baldur’s Gate 3 has been delayed. The developers explained that the “passive dice rolls literally stopped working” while they were fixing other bugs. They are currently trying to resolve the issue, which is why the closed beta has been pushed to “later this week.” Conversely, the delay allows more players to sign up for the closed beta.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Readers, something actually magical has happened! I’ve spent a non-zero amount of time this week compiling a wishlist for potential <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>-likes that also let me keep pets. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to play, but I knew I was burnt out on both stabbing and shooting, and wanted something light and colourful with a solid loop that I could veg out (pun intended) with at the end of the day. I even went to so far as to create a chap named Karrot King in Stardew before quitting in disgust because I couldn’t easily access carrot seeds.</p>
<p>I cannot in good conscious claim that I manifested such a videogame - that was the work of Skyreach Studio. However, this is the internet, so I will both take credit for it <em>and</em> offer you an <em>exclusive</em> discount on my course. While I’m waiting for your membership fee to arrive, I’ll be playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/critter-crops">Critter Crops</a>. It’s a witchy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> in which you grow odd pets and cast spells from flesh-bound grimoires. One of the verbs it offers on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1641120/Critter_Crops/">Steam page</a> is 'noodle'. Apologies to all the other games on my wishlist.</p>

When she arrives on Mutter Island she discovers she is capable of growing magical Critter Crops that will aid her in restoring the island to its former glory," readeth Steam. Might I one day be able to return to the village and bathe my traitorous kin in eldritch flame? No, sorry. Sorry. I’m trying to escape the cyclical violence that led me to such soothing games in the first place. Maybe just a little immolation? We’ll see. Right now, I’ve got pets to grow.</p>
<p>"Uncover the secrets of the island by growing magical critters in this isometric role-playing/management game! Farm, Noodle, Mine, Gather, and Explore the island in order to level up your abilities and uncover more of the mysteries of Mutter Island." Sounds rad, honestly. There’s a total of 24 critters to collect, once you’ve discovered each one’s growing conditions. You’ll level them up, accessing new areas of the island with their abilities.</p>
<p>As well as the usual trailers and screens, there’s a short clip on the Steam page in which a dev talks through some of Critter Crops' development history. The game started as a college project, which then evolved through inspiration from Skyreach’s favourite indies. The dev mentions the challenges of working combat into the traditional framework of a 'cosy' game - but ultimately, their goal was "to make the game that (they) wanted to play." As is often the way of such things, the result is a game that <em>I</em> now want to play. Everybody wins - with the notable exception of my former village, who will not even have time to rue the day before I reduce them to ash with an army of anthropomorphic vegetables at my side. Cosy!</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Patch 7 Closed Beta has been delayed until later this week.
</p>
<p>
The patch was due to launch yesterday, but the development team at Larian noticed a last-minute bug causing passive rolls to stop working.
</p>
<p>
"We're trying to figure out how we got here, so while we do that, we'll be pushing the Closed Beta back to later this week," reads a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4366886565633587231">notice on Steam</a>.

<p>

As previously reported, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-seventh-patch-amends-split-screen-adds-mod-support-wont-be-final-update">seventh patch will amend split-screen play and add mod support</a>, but won't be the final update from Larian.

</p>
<p>
In the latest notice, Larian stated there are over 1000 fixes and improvements in this patch and reiterated the highlights, which also includes new Evil Ending cinematics, adding Honour Mode mechanics to a Custom Mode playthrough, and "making the way you use soap a bit clearer".
</p>
<p>
Other changes include tweaks to UI, artistic and animation fixes, writing and flow amendments, and improved performance - including areas with large numbers of NPCs like the Lower City.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>’s latest patch was due to launch in closed beta yesterday, but Larian have decided to give it a bit more time in the oven due to bugs. Namely, a bug that caused passive rolls - like those that detect traps - to stop working.</p>
<p>Happily, if you hadn’t already registered to take part in the beta, you now have more time to sign up. Scroll down a bit on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/">Steam page</a> and click the ‘Request Access’ button.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The other upside is that they’ve have taken the opportunity to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/4366886565633587231">post a blog</a> dangling the details of some tantalising changes, much like a delicious bar of soap-on-a-rope. Wait. What. No. Soap is not for eating, say spoilsports Larian. As such, they’ve made some ablutionary items more idiot-proof. “We noticed some of you hiccoughing bubbles, so the action for washing yourself with soap and sponges is now called 'Use' instead of 'Consume'.”</p>
<p>All in all, patch 7 boasts "over 1,000 fixes and improvements," with the blog itself detailing just a few select highlights. The big ticket items here are extra evil ending cinematics, split-screen tweaks, and the modding toolkit. Aside from these, here’s some personal picks. (I say 'picks' - my actual preference would be that Larian call it quits and go have a Milky Way and a nap so I can start a new playthrough.)</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXzktDnbI2Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p>Honour Mode systems - the game’s ultra-tough, single-save beef gauntlet - will now be selectable in a custom game. In terms of specifics, boss hobgobbo Dror Ragzlin will now try and befriend the spider pit’s inhabitants with a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion, if you happen to knock him in.</p>
<p>For your companions, Karlach "will no longer brush the shaved side of her head," and Astarion might occasionally do something at camp besides reading books. If you’re too busy being extremely evil to care about friendship, they’ll be more Dark Urge reactivity dialogue and narrator lines. But I already did a Dark Urge playthrough! I moan, before realising that I haven’t done a Dark Urge that turns good playthrough. <em>Or </em>a Dark Urge that specifically tries to make Minsc’s life as miserable as possible playthrough. Larian plz.</p>
<p>There’s also some more help for the final battle. I can understand anyone being a bit bored of the 'alliances you’ve made across your adventure join in for a big dramatic scrap later on' thing, but I’m not sure anyone has yet come up with a better solution for letting you cash in on your side-excursions in a reactive and satisfying way? I’m a fan, anyway. Now, the Kuo-Toa fishfolk can get involved (unless they all died in act one), and the Gondians will throw in a hefty Steel Watcher.</p>
<p>There’s some coming optimisation on the performance front, too. "This will have a more noticeable impact in areas with large numbers of NPCs (like the Lower City) and will reduce peak memory usage when loading levels for the first time," reads the blog. "It will also be noticeable when managing lots of loot (e.g. when transferring everything from a camp chest to a character's inventory)."</p>
<p>Finally, and most bollocks-ly, you’ll no longer be able to cheese the Leap Of Faith trial of Shar by "by just clicking the final platform and letting your character pathfind their way there." Booooo. Boooooo. Boooooooo (boo).</p>
<p>No word on when the patch will be available for everyone, but as mentioned, you can sign up for the beta on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>’s Steam page. I am very serious about Larian chilling out so I can finally play the game again, but it’s no doubt impressive to see the game still getting such substantial updates, especially as they’re also working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two more games at the moment</a>.</p>
