              <p>A faster router means faster online gaming — that’s simple. But what would you call the effect that <strong>the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router</strong> will have on your gaming when it opens up the data floodgates with three bands delivering 19Gbps and the Wi-Fi 7 top speed of 320MHz, all driven by a quad-core processor with 2GB of RAM for ultimate capacity and strength of connections? You’ll have to come up with your own superlatives after you <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">head to Amazon and grab this elite-level gaming router for just $370 — a limited-time 38% price drop from its regular $600.</a></p>
<p>What do all of those features translate to? Wi-Fi 7 is nearly 5x faster than even Wi-Fi 6E, and the main 6Hz band has double the width of a 5Hz band and thus allows double the speed — think of the speeds you can reach on an 8-lane highway as opposed to a 4-lane road. (Although we would never, ever advocate that you try something so illegal.) And the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is compatible with EasyMesh routers and range extenders, so its incredible speed and capacity are equally accessible throughout your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultimate Lag Killer</h2>
<p>Latency, for the uninitiated, is what drags your online speed into the gutter, causing your game to lag and stutter and tear. Anyone who’s ever been in the middle of a FPS or other intense action game where speed and reaction time are critical and suddenly been frozen just long enough to get killed off is all too familiar with latency. The TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router is one of the best lag eradicators around, with 4x lower latency than even a fast Wi-Fi 6/6E router.</p>
<p>As if that’s not enough to ensure a blistering-fast, nearly flawless connection for games, the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router can automatically detect and optimize gaming streams and give them a boost with QoS (Quality of Service). There is also a dedicated Gaming Port at the rear of the router to give you the option of hardwiring for absolute max performance, and an accelerated search for game servers to find the shortest, fastest path.</p>



<h2>Future-Proofed</h2>
<p>There’s always a natural reluctance to go big on the “latest and greatest” tech device, because they evolve at such speed that there will be a new “latest and greatest” before you know it. But the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router has included two 10Gbps WAN ports for that faster-than-fiber connection. There’s nothing on the horizon that’s going to outgun the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router for a long time.</p>
<p>If you’re still slugging it out with a slow router and practically crushing your controller with your bare hands out of frustration when your game freezes or glitches right in the middle of an intense battle, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3839/">this Amazon limited-time deal dropping the price of the TP-Link Tri-Band BE19000 Wi-Fi 7 Gaming Router to just $370 is tailor-made for you.</a> Years of the fastest possible no-lag gaming connection is just a click away.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-glimpse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-productions-celebrating-10th-anniversary-with-%E2%80%98future-projects%E2%80%99-glimpse.1285674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kojima Productions has announced an upcoming showcase poised to celebrate the company’s tenth anniversary. The ‘Beyond the Strand’ event will offer a ‘glimpse into future projects’ and pay tribute to everything the studio has accomplished thus far.</p>



<p>Beyond the Strand will be both a digital and in-person event, with the live portion taking place at TOHO Cinemas in Roppongi Hills, Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-ten-years-of-kojima-productions">Ten Years of Kojima Productions</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima will host the Beyond the Strand event in Japan on September 23, and the showcase is set to feature a hefty assortment of special guest appearances. It’s easy to predict who will show up, and I’m willing to bet hard cash that Norman Reedus will appear.</p>



<p>Kojima Productions <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/kjp10th_beyond_the_strand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unveiled the event</a> earlier today, revealing that tickets for Beyond the Strand will go on sale from tomorrow, September 2.</p>



<p>In the most recent Hideo Kojima space, the iconic game creator revealed that he’s effectively <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working ‘all by himself’</a> on Physint, the tactical espionage game set to be a spiritual successor to Metal Gear Solid.</p>



<p>Before that, he stressed in a somewhat bizarre way during an interview that, while making games, he has learned many ways in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-learned-many-ways-kill-people-bags-studios/">which to kill people</a>. It was his opinion that more developers need to understand these elements of development if they want to make better games.</p>



<p> Looking forward to Beyond the Strand, it’s easy to see a heavy focus on OD, one of Hideo Kojima’s next big games. There might even be talk of an expansion for Death Stranding 2. As for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-written-concept-death-stranding-3-wont-make/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 3</a>, the man himself recently admitted that it might not be him who makes the game, if it does ever surface.</p>



<p>What do you want to see at Beyond the Strand? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Semiwork is hard at work on the next big REPO update. The indie sensation horror game retains a healthy player base, and loyal gamers are going to have their passion and playtime rewarded with many new monsters, likely to require your toilet to be on standby.</p>



<p>While not quite as lively as it was in its early weeks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/repo-is-the-best-selling-steam-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REPO</a> remains very popular. Over 20,000 people are still logging in each month, and the game’s peak hovers around the 40-45K mark. Semiwork understands this, which is why a new update is in development.</p>



<h2 id="h-repo-receiving-more-monsters-in-big-october-30-update">REPO Receiving More Monsters In Big October 30 Update</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Yeah, I’d have that face too. Credit to semiwork</figcaption></figure>



<p>A fun new video was released on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@semiwork" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">semiwork</a> YouTube channel on August 29. It’s titled “REVEALING THE NEXT R.E.P.O. UPDATE,” and it did exactly what it promised.</p>



<p>“The next update will be all monsters,” we are told by the narrator. Now, only one of the new creatures was revealed as semiwork wants to keep the remaining designs a secret.</p>



<p>But a special spotlight is given to one of the new monsters. It’s described by the host as an “innocent goblin-looking thing” and looks small in stature, but horrific in design.</p>



<p>It has two large tusks alongside its set of teeth, a long tongue, a large protruding nose sticking out the top of its head, and, while I can’t see any eyes, I have a feeling they could be on its body.</p>



<p>REPO’s ‘The Monster Update’ drops on October 30—just in time for Halloween—and comes with new gameplay features, and much more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee%E2%80%99s-evangelion-gaming-wall-light-sinks-to-a-new-low-for-labor-day-outshining-black-friday-pricing.1285644/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It only makes sense that the first room lighting system inspired by the world’s top anime franchise would be created by the world’s fastest-growing consumer electronics company. Govee has teamed up with Evangelion to create a visually stunning, deeply immersive gaming wall light setup inspired by <em>Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition</em>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/">it’s available at Amazon in a must-see Labor Day deal for just $120 — 40% off its regular price.</a> The easily installed Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set is easy to set up and even easier to control, and the effect it has on your gaming room is staggering.</p>
<p>The kit comes with six translucent dual-layer RGBIC wall lights and two connectors, all of which can be customized and controlled with the Govee Home smartphone app, and the system works with Matter, Alexa, and Google Assistant for hands-free control. The EVA-themed faceplaces and diffusion lines can be individually controlled to create amazing lighting effects that evoke the intense, fast-moving combat scenes from the <em>Evangelion</em> anime franchise. This $200 Govee light set is just $120 while this limited-time Amazon deal is in effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete Customization</h2>
<p>The shapes and patterns of the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set are entirely up to you, and there are even expansion packs with more lights, connectors, and swappable faceplates available at Amazon, so your EVA-themed light show is only limited by your imagination and the size of your walls. The Govee app has 8 <em>Evangelion</em>-inspired lighting effects that replicate the battles and high points from the ultra-popular reboot series&nbsp;<em>Evangelion: New Theatrical Edition</em>. With an enormous menu of customizable colors and effects, you can create light show that evoke empowering your battlefield forces, elevating your defensive force auras, and intense battle ambience.</p>
<p>While it may sound like a huge undertaking to create a space like this, it’s actually exceptionally easy. Like all of Govee’s groundbreaking lighting setups, it’s remarkably easy to set up the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set, and once it’s in place and connected, it stays there thanks to Govee’s superior construction and quality of both the lights and connectors. Once you decide on your pattern and have it in place, just pair the Govee Home App to your setup so it can recognize your spliced shape and set up the menu for you to customize, program, and control.</p>



<h2>Everything’s Included</h2>
<p>The Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set includes six light sections, one square connector, one triangle connector, a power adapter, nine connecting pieces, the control box, user manual, pre-installation cleaning cloth for your walls, and the EVA special lighting effects activation card that adds the&nbsp;<em>Evangelion</em> theme to the Govee Home App. The expansion kits and swappable faceplates are also available at Amazon.</p>
<p>Govee has only been around since 2017, but in those 8 short years they have transformed the home lighting space with well-priced, easily customizable kits that have thousands of colors and patterns and effects that deliver a truly transformational effect wherever you place them. Their collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Evangelion</em> is their latest brand extension, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3838/">anime fans won’t want to miss this 40% off limited-time Amazon deal that makes the Govee x Evangelion Gaming Wall Light set a total steal at just $120.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-technically-feasible-says-ceo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-co-op-split-screen-is-%E2%80%9Ctechnically-feasible-%E2%80%9D-says-ceo.1285641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Helldivers 2’s CEO has stated that the split-screen co-op feature is technically possible and is on the developers’ list of features to investigate.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 is experiencing its best time since launch, with the game releasing for a brand new platform, the Xbox Series consoles, and hitting its highest concurrent player count on Steam since April 2024. Moreover, the game has also received the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-halo-odst-warbond-release-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legendary HALO ODST Warbond</a> recently.</p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-devs-have-co-op-splitscreen-on-their-to-investigate-list">Helldivers 2 Devs Have Co-Op Splitscreen on their ‘To Investigate’ List</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-split-screen-co-op-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, a player recently asked about Helldivers 2 getting split-screen support on the game’s official Discord. The CEO of Arrowhead Studios, Shams Jorjani, responded, stating that co-op split-screen for Helldivers 2 is “technically feasible”, but isn’t sure whether this is a feature players really want. However, the feature has been placed on their “to investigate” list, so there’s a chance we may hear something about it, but players shouldn’t get their hopes too high.</p>



<p>Since the advent of online co-op, offline split-screen co-op has begun to disappear from games, with almost no recent games offering this feature anymore. Split-screen co-op could be a great addition for Helldivers 2, but it all depends on the execution. However, as it is a PvE title, a local co-op option might be something players might be genuinely interested in. Regardless, we will have to wait and see if Arrowhead takes action.</p>



<p>In other news, Helldivers 2 devs thought Fortnite’s new season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-new-season-feels-like-we-have-helldivers-at-home-arrowhead-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">felt like</a> “we have Helldivers at home”. What are your thoughts on Helldivers 2 receiving split-screen co-op? Is that a feature you might be interested in? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/operation-night-strikers</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-operation-night-strikers-switch-m2-does-it-again-with-this-taito-themed-collection.1285629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158417/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Taito may be famous for creating the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/bubble_bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>, but for a brief period at the close of the 1980s, it became the hottest name in arcades thanks to the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/operation_wolf">Operation Wolf</a>, a <strong>Rambo</strong>-inspired military shooter with a realistic Uzi strapped to its cabinet.</p>
<p>Ported to pretty much every home system of the era, the game was followed by sequels that expanded on the core gameplay but never <em>quite</em> achieved the same degree of fame. Fast forward to the present, and emulation specialist M2 has bundled up Wolf with <strong>Operation Thunderbolt</strong> and <strong>Space Gun</strong> — and thrown in the utterly superb <strong>Night Striker</strong>, a Super Scaler-style shooter inspired by the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sega_ages_space_harrier">Space Harrier</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/3d_after_burner_ii">After Burner</a> for good measure — to create <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>.</p>
<p>Mindless shooting is the backbone of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/operation_night_strikers">Operation Night Strikers</a>, then, and in lieu of proper light gun support, M2 has opted for a trio of potential control methods. You can use the analogue stick — which works well enough — or opt for using the Joy-Con's gyro controls. The third option involves a USB mouse.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158409/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The gyro-aiming approach has been used in titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">House of the Dead: Remake</a>, and it works better than you might imagine, thanks to the presence of an on-screen crosshair. This tends to drift as you play, but thankfully, you can recalibrate with a single button press during the action. Using a USB mouse will feel a <em>little</em> like cheating for light gun purists, but it is perhaps the best interface method of the ones available, assuming you've got a flat surface handy to rest it on.</p>
<p>All three light gun offerings here are excellent, with Operation Wolf giving you plenty to shoot at while its direct sequel spruces things up with more dynamic environments, all made possible by 2D scaling tech. Space Gun takes this to the next level, swapping out hostile military juntas for xenomorphs and cleverly simulating smoothly-scrolling 3D-style corridor sections with angled 2D sprites.</p>
<p>Night Striker is the outlier, as it's not a light gun game but one where you control a futuristic car which can instantly take to the air. It feels like a fusion of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/out_run">OutRun</a> (thanks to the branching pathways – although to be fair to Taito, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/darius">Darius</a> features those, too) and Space Harrier, combined with some amazing <strong>Blade Runner</strong>-style locations and a wonderful Zuntata soundtrack.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158405/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>It's arguably the best game in this collection, and this pixel-perfect port even surpasses the one released on the Saturn and PS1 in Japan back in the '90s. It might be pushing it slightly to say the Night Strikers is worth the cost of purchase on its own, but it's certainly close – <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/m2s-night-striker-gear-gets-new-story-and-gameplay-trailer">and sets us up nicely for M2's forthcoming sequel.</a></p>
<p>Because this is an M2 release, you get the traditionally spot-on emulation as well as various CRT filters and other options, including online leaderboards and in-game achievements. There's also a selection of information arrayed around the screen, which makes things like health and remaining bombs easier to parse; all of this can be toggled on and off at will. It's also possible to select between the US and Japanese versions of each game.</p>
<p>Also impressive is the fact that M2 has gone the extra mile and included the home ports that followed these coin-op releases (on my physical import copy, at least - they're available as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/operation-night-strikers-cs-pack-70050000060617-switch/">DLC</a> <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Operation-Night-Strikers-2890005.html">on the eShop</a>). For Operation Wolf, the Famicom, NES and Master System versions are present, but sadly, the PC Engine port isn't. Operation Thunderbolt's SNES conversion also makes the cut, but it's a pale imitation of the original game, despite offering six different characters to play as.</p>
<figure><a title="Operation ﻿Night Strikers Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158412/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Not all of the ports allow you to use gyro aiming, and there's often quite a notable gulf in quality between them and the arcade originals, but they're still interesting to play. For many of you, the nostalgic pull might be stronger with these versions, as they may well have been your first experiences of these notable arcade releases.</p>
<p>Night Striker's Mega CD port is included, too, and while it looks like a blocky mess when compared to the coin-op, the sense of speed is impressive, and the arranged soundtrack is fantastic.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The notion of picking up a collection featuring three light gun shooters and a relatively obscure Super Scaler-style game might be a little too esoteric for some Switch owners, but hardcore Taito fans will have a blast (no pun intended) with Operation Night Strikers. The emulation is perfect, the control methods are decent, and there's plenty of customisation on offer, making this another highly recommended M2 offering.</p>
<p>Longevity is going to be an issue for some — even with the online leaderboards in place — and some of the included home ports are a little rough around the edges, but players of a certain age will find a lot to like here, given the legendary status of Operation Wolf and the quality of the other titles included.</p></section>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>It initially came out in alpha a matter of days before No Man's Sky debuted</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> is finally emerging from an early access period that will have lasted nearly a decade, when its full release on November 15th rolls around, and you'll soon be able to grab it on Steam.</p>
<p>Yep, it's taken yeaaaaarrrssss. Tarkov's initial alpha release came on August 4th, 2016, just a few days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> arrived for the first time, and just after a little game called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> dropped. Think about what you were doing back then. I was a teenager, still far from the job-having husk I've since morphed into.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, old feeling aside, Tarkov's Steam page looks like it'll drop any day now, after Battlestate Games studio head Nikita Buyanov decided to tweet some things. First there was a <a href="https://x.com/nikgeneburn/status/1961830502928724363">gif of an old bloke</a> holding a steaming iron on August 30th, which everyone took as a tease rather than an endorsement for getting the creases out of your favourite top from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> developerman. Said FPS developerman was also, er, rather forthright in his reply to someone who responded to that post with accusations of scamming.</p>
<p>Then, the next day, Buyanov dispensed with the pagentry. "Yes! The page on Steam will be available soon. All the details later," he posted, alongside a picture of said Steam page that'd be easier to dissect if it didn't have a great big Steam logo slapped on top of it. You know, just in case you don't know what a Steam page looks like, or had missed him saying that's where Tarkov's heading.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>Will existing players who want to switch to Steam have to buy it again and start from scratch? That's what folks in Buyanov's replies wondered, and he doesn't look to have provided an answer. Don't worry, I'm sure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-escape-from-tarkov-pve-mode-exclusive-to-pricey-unheard-edition-despite-promises-of-free-dlc">everything'll work out ok</a>.</p>
<p>If it's been a while since you've escaped to Tarkov, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-is-offering-players-in-game-currency-as-a-bounty-for-reporting-cheaters">cheaters</a> have remained an issue in it over recent years, but it's still on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">our top survival games list</a>. Also here's an excerpt from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/escape-from-tarkov-has-sent-me-on-a-long-quest-for-some-toilet-roll">an article</a> about Craig Pearson hunting down some toilet roll in it:</p>
<blockquote>I stalked the corridors, cracking doors and checking rooms, closing them as I went, because I was taught to be respectful even during an apocalypse. I found piles of crap and burnt-out detritus, but no loo roll. When I discovered a body pile on the roof it was full of worthless military doodads. This is a world with more shotguns than sponge soft shitter sheets.</blockquote>
<p>Here's hoping he's located some loo paper in the years since 2020.</p>

              <p>Building your own custom gaming PC is a good way to save some money versus just outright buying a pre-built, but that doesn’t exactly mean it’s cheap. PC parts can be expensive and as you start adding CPUs, graphics cards, SSDs, and more to your cart, that number skyrockets pretty fast. If you can find any of those parts at a discount, it isn’t such a bad idea to pay them some attention. For instance, this ASUS TUF gaming motherboard is on sale over at Amazon as part of a limited time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">The Z790-Plus WiFi normally goes for $250, but right now you can grab one for 24% off. That saves you $64, bringing the price down to just $186.</a></p>
<p>With the ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi, you’re getting onboard WiFi 6 as the name implies. Expect ultra-fast wireless networking speeds and improved capacity. The motherboard is also Windows 11-ready right out of the box.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>You’ll find your connection options are highly versatile. The TUF-Gaming Z790-Plus WiFi packs three different USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C ports on it with two in the rear and one in the front. You also have support for Thunderbolt 4.</p>
<p>There are four PCLe 4.0 M.2 slots which support up to two 22110 devices along with NVMe SSD RAID. The PCLe slots are reinforced with a metal sheath which keeps your cards firmly in place to ensure you don’t have issues with anything disconnecting, even when moving around your PC.</p>
<p>The PCLe slots are equipped with a quick release physical button. Custom PCs are sort of your own little Ship of Theseus in that you’ll find yourself making incremental upgrades throughout its life. Those quick release buttons will make upgrading your storage or graphics card much easier down the line.</p>



<h2>Cooler by Design</h2>
<p>Keeping your gaming PC cool can be an uphill battle. The ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard has been engineered to help keep temperatures down. It’s armed with an enlarged VRM heatsink. Plus three M.2 slots along with the PCH feature heatsinks which help provide enough mass and surface area so heat can dissipate. The multi-layered circuit board allows it to spread out around the voltage regulators which improvs system stability.</p>
<p>So if you’ve been putting together a list of PC parts to consider for your custom gaming tower, this ASUS TUF Z790-Plus WiFi motherboard might just fit the bill. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3837/">It’s currently $64 off with that 26% discount. Instead of paying $250, you can get it for just $190 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <p>A PlayStation State of Play is coming later this week. This livestreamed event will be focused on 007: First Light.</p>
<p>The livestream is set to take place this Wednesday, 3rd September. In terms of exact times, it's scheduled to start at 11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BST / 8pm CEST on the official PlayStation YouTube channel.</p>
<p>During this livestream, we'll get the world first reveal of gameplay for 007: First Light. According to developer IO, this will including car chases, stealth sequences, and some shootouts, so it should be a fairly comprehensive spread.</p>

<p>007: First Light <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">was first revealed during the June State of Play</a>, and has since been a hotly anticipated game from the creators of the Hitman series. How it'll actually play is something that should hopefully be answered in a matter of days.</p>

			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hell-is-us">Hell Is Us</a> is a pretty fascinating game, but one that has me struggling to figure out if I really like it. I mean, I do fundamentally like it, and I think it does a good job of letting you explore and discover things on your own while offering puzzles that are simple enough that you’ll get all of the important ones done with very little issue. I also think it’s a game that respects your time by not being too long, but it then fails to respect your time by making some parts of the interface needlessly clunky. It’s a game that you’ll absolutely want to play with a notepad and pen nearby, and one where you’ll rapidly overcome the initial feeling of horror in favour of something closer to monotony at times.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_8JCpFj2qM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hell Is Us has you exploring the country of Haldea, which is currently in the midst of a brutal civil war, resulting in overwhelming brutality to all sorts of people. Children are not safe from the horrors of mankind, nor are the pious or the kind. People die in wars, and Hell Is Us wants to constantly remind you of that fact. A big part of the game is dedicated to the evil of mankind, which does a good job of balancing out the horrors of the unkown calamity that’s also descending upon the country.</p>


<p>The calamity brings with it some wonderfully unsettling creatures that contain geometric infinites within them, along with the distilled feelings of grief and beyond. The combat is fairly standard stuff, although if you’re good at it you’ll never need to use healing items because you can actually heal after finishing a combo, sort of like in Nioh. I have no idea how that fits in, but it’s definitely very convenient. It’s probably because combat just doesn’t feel like the point of Hell Is Us. Instead it’s the investigation, exploration, and basic human kindness that are at its core.</p>


<p>You’re meant to wander around the beautiful and haunted landscapes, finding mysteries, people to help, and the odd dungeon to explore. I initially found all of this pretty exhilarating, and the game does a great job of making you feel like you’re clever enough to work all of this stuff out as well. However, a lot of the exploration ends up being restricted because of a knee-high obstacle you can’t cross, and a lot of the puzzles just turn into “where is the key I need for this specific door?” It loses its lustre pretty rapidly, and after only a handful of hours, I found myself more aggravated by each mystery instead of being excited to solve it.</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that a lot of the clues you get just get chucked into your inventory, which takes longer than it should to open up, and then you’ll need to find the specific bit of paper you were looking for, take a picture of it on your actual phone and then use that to solve the puzzle from there. I really want to like the design here, and sometimes I do, but it feels like a punishment for not having an eidetic memory. I have ADHD, which is pretty close to being the opposite of that, unless you’re asking me to recall how to perform a Hadouken or some D&amp;D-related fact.</p>

		
		

<p>You’ll note that this means I’m a bit unconvinced by the two main ways the game lets you interact with it: both the combat and the puzzles. So, uh, you can see why I don’t love it. The characters and story are fairly interesting for the most part, and I do really like the general message of the game. I’m a sucker for anything telling us that the best way to save the world is to just help people out, and Hell Is Us does that a fair bit. I just wish it were less antagonistic towards the player.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Hell Is Us is a genuinely interesting game that many will adore for its commitment to letting you spend your time exploring mysteries and unlocking lore. The fact that you'll want a notepad near you will send some of you rabid, and that's great. For me though, Hell Is Us is a game that looks beautiful in every respect, but ends up feeling a little bit too paint-by-numbers when it comes to the actual mechanics at play. I like Hell Is Us well enough, but I don't know that I'll remember it.	</p></div>

<figure><a title="LEGO Pokémon Logo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d0d78db27735/lego-pokemon-logo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: LEGO / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're still waiting for the official word on what next year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/its-official-lego-pokemon-sets-are-finally-coming-our-way-next-year">Pokémon LEGO collection</a> will look like, but a recent leak suggests that something <em>big</em> might be on the horizon (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/one-of-the-first-lego-pokemon-sets-will-reportedly-cost-650-and-be-the-seventh-biggest-lego-build-ever/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a new post appeared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/">r/Legoleak</a> Reddit forum from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/CarterBricks04/">CarterBricks04</a>, claiming to have information about the upcoming collection's first three sets. According to the post, these sets will go on general release on 1st March, with LEGO Insiders getting early dibs from 27th February (which just so happens to be the series' 30th anniversary). What's more, they're all apparently 18+ builds.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjquihr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>The real juicy part of this 'leak', however, is in the sets' supposed prices and piece counts. The post claims that one set will measure in at 587 pieces with a $59.99 price tag, another will cost $199.99 and will contain 2,050 pieces, while the last will feature... wait for it... 6,838 pieces for the eye-watering sum of $649.99.</p>
<p>There's no indication of what these sets will be, but for reference, that last one's piece count would make it the seventh-largest LEGO set released to date, putting it between the Star Wars AT-AT (6,785 pieces) and Millennium Falcon (7,541 pieces) sets. For those wondering, the largest is the World Map build, which measures in at 11,695 pieces.</p>

<p>But wait, there's more! In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47ptf/promopokemon_february_gwp_insiders_reward_source/">follow-up post</a>, CarterBricks04 shared that an 18+ Pokémon-themed gift with purchase (GWP) would also be arriving on 27th February, with a 12+ "Nintendo-related" Insiders Reward going live on the same day for 2,500 Insiders Points.</p>
<p>It's a very exciting prospect (even if our wallets are already judging us at the mere suggestion of that price), but let's try to stay realistic here. This is still nothing more than a rumour for the time being, and while the Legoleak group has been on the money about the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/08/rumour-animal-crossing-lego-it-may-be-coming-next-year-according-to-leaks">Animal Crossing</a> LEGO sets in the past, the official details for the Pokémon collection go no further than the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/its-official-lego-pokemon-sets-are-finally-coming-our-way-next-year">initial announcement</a>.</p>
<p>We'll be keeping our eyes peeled for an <em>official</em> first look in the coming months, but until then, we'll cautiously start saving our pennies — heck, whatever form the collection takes, you know it's going to be a pricy one...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-already-shared-its-pc-requirements.1285602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Lords of the Fallen II developer and publisher CI Games has already shared the game's PC system requirements, even though it may well be several months—if not a full year—before it actually launches. The specs have been listed <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-58d924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Epic Games Store page</a>, although they do not include any target resolution, frame rate, or graphics preset, making them quite vague.</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i5 8400 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>Memory: 12 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Recommended Requirements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Operating System: Windows 11</li>



<li>CPU: Intel i7 8700 / AMD Ryzen 5 3600</li>



<li>Memory: 16 GB</li>



<li>GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li>
</ul>



<p>The store page also lists the languages in which the game will be subtitled: English, French, German, Italian, Spanish (Spain), Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), Japanese, Polish, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), and Russian.</p>



<p>Like the previous game, Lords of the Fallen II will run on Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Hopefully, it will perform better than its predecessor did at its launch, taking advantage of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-declares-great-hitch-hunt-rid-games-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UE5's latest improvements to combat stuttering</a>.</p>



<p>Lords of the Fallen II was formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-ii-debut-trailer-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> at Gamescom 2025 with a cinematic trailer and the confirmation of the 2026 target release window. The game will take place several centuries after the previous installment, retaining the dual-world mechanics. The world of the dead, Umbral, is said to be encroaching on Axiom, the world of the living, and players will have to find a way to stop it from consuming all existence.</p>



<p>The developers also vowed to take into account the community's feedback for this sequel, implementing several highly requested features and improving the combat balance, as already glimpsed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lords of the Fallen version 2.0</a>. Overall, CI Games hopes for Lords of the Fallen II to pull off <a href="https://wccftech.com/ci-games-lords-of-the-fallen-2-empire-strikes-back-dark-knight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an “Empire Strikes Back” moment for the fantasy action RPG franchise</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lego-pokemon-prices-have-possibly-leaked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-pok%C3%A9mon-date-prices-have-possibly-leaked-and-include-649-99-set-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The idea of LEGO Pokémon prices allegedly being expensive is as shocking as being unable to catch Mewtwo first go with a Poké Ball—it’s not. A new leak claims to have gotten wind of the first LEGO Pokémon date and prices, and while not official, it seems there will be at least one monstrous set.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-mario-kart-spiny-shell-set-promo-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO</a> acquiring the right to use the Pokémon license is a win for all. MEGA has done a great job with its range of products over the years—my house proudly displays a giant Gyarados, Eevee, and a Poke Ball! But it’s certainly exciting to see what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-x-pokemon-partnership-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Pokémon</a> is in the works.</p>



<h2 id="h-lego-pokemon-reportedly-arrives-in-2026-and-will-be-expensive">LEGO Pokémon Reportedly Arrives in 2026 And Will Be Expensive</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Welcome changes. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to the popular and reliable <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LegoLeak</a> subreddit, the new LEGO Pokémon sets are releasing on March 1, 2026.</p>



<p>Three sets have been outed: 72151, 72152, and 72153. The first one reportedly has 587 pieces and will cost $59.99. The second set contains 2050 pieces and costs $199.99. The third and final set (72153) apparently features a whopping 6838 pieces and will set you back $649.99.</p>



<p>Again, this is a rumored leak, so take this information at face value for what it is. The fun part is now speculating what the sets could be. LEGO tends to have different versions of the same theme. The Millennium Falcon, for example, has three variations, and the main difference between them is size and price.</p>



<p>The three models mentioned in the leak could be Pikachu, but getting progressively bigger and more expensive. Either way, I can’t wait to see what LEGO Pokémon sets are in development.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Which LEGO Pokémon sets are you keen to see? Who’s your favorite Pokémon? I am desperate for a Gastly, Haunter, and Gengar set, personally. Let me know what you hope to see through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blizzard-had-filed-a-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-turtle-wow-server.1285581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-wow-2-0-server-will-bring-azeroth-to-unreal-engine-5-with-dlss-and-fsr-support/">Turtle WoW server</a>, highlighting in the suit how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing infringement of the company's intellectual property.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/08/30/blizzard-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-rogue-server-turtle-wow/">Massively Overpowered</a>, Blizzard finally took action against the rogue World of Warcraft server with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">lawsuit</a> that details how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing intellectual property infringement, profiting from the immense popularity of the popular MMORPG using protected vode and game assets.</p>



<p><em>"In the two decades since WoW first was released, Blizzard has invested an enormous amount of time and money into creating, maintaining, and updating the game,"</em> the legal complaint reads. <em>"But when unscrupulous actors such as Defendants seek to profit from Blizzard’s valuable intellectual property (including protected code and game assets) they undermine Blizzard’s own efforts to deliver classic and community-driven content, devalue the WoW experience, and cause serious harm to Blizzard and the many artists, programmers, game designers, and other creative professionals who have worked (and continue to work) tirelessly to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience for both new and longtime players."</em></p>



<p>Everything considered, it's unlikely that the operators of the Turtle WoW servers will be able to prevent the complete shutdown of the server, all copies of the data from the project, a full account of the money earned by the project and the relinquishing of the domain to Blizzard as the company is demanding in the lawsuit, leaving players with no other choice but to play World of Warcraft classic to enjoy the vanilla WoW experience, although without the custom content the Turtle WoW server offered. The server operators, however, don't want to go down without a fight and have promised on the server's official Discord that Turtle WoW is here to stay and that they are prepared to take on the challenges ahead of them.</p>



<p>Speaking about the modern World of Warcraft experience, the long-running MMORPG will be expanded next year with the Midnight expansion. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">interview</a> conducted during last month's Gamescom.</p>

<p>Approximately 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay, running on the Nintendo Switch 2, has leaked online.</p>



<p>The gameplay was uploaded by the YouTuber mataleao, who has managed to get the game early on the Switch 2 ahead of its September 4, 2025, release date. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>As pointed out by some users in the YouTube comments, the gameplay appears surprisingly good, with some users noting that it even looks and seems to run better than Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>“This runs amazing. It’s not 60fps and 1080p but it looks really smooth. The people complaining are just holding these ports to extremely high standards” says YouTube user Selfbaptized. “Looks way better than I anticipated,” says another user.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-run-poorly">Does Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 Run Poorly?</h2>



<p>According to some media outlets, though, who were given the opportunity to play the game on the Switch 2 at PAX West 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-reportedly-performed-poorly-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws didn’t have great performance</a>. According to those in attendance, the game’s framerate dropped below 30 FPS on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Media outlets were apparently not allowed to record gameplay, with those getting hands-on saying that the game was “king of rough”. </p>



<p>Whether the game runs well or not remains to be seen, but the 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay uploaded to YouTube do look like it runs rather well.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancelled-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a>, which Insider Gaming understands was in the very early stages of development, was canceled due to the game not meeting internal expectations. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025. Will you be giving it a play? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Nintendo and Lego are back with yet another enticing collaboration; this time presenting a 421-piece replica of the iconic Game Boy.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>1st October 2025</strong> at <strong>£54.99 / $59.99</strong>, the new set will come with the Game Boy itself, two cartridges for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, and lenticular 'screens' that make it look like you're actually playing a game. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino/videos">Tiago Catarino</a> over on YouTube, we've got our best look yet at the upcoming set. The 9-minute review provides a solid overview of the components, noting how the size of the console and cartridges is remarkably close to the real deal.</p>
<p>We also get a glimpse at how the lenticular sleeves are inserted into the main device, along with a demonstration of how the face buttons and d-pad work – yes, you can press them. We reckon it's only a matter of time until someone mods this thing to play real Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Lego really knocked it out of the park with their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/nintendo_officially_unveils_the_lego_nes_console_launches_next_month">NES replica set</a>, so we've got high hopes for this one. It's also, dare we say, quite affordable compared to some of the stuff Lego has put out over the years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-handles-star-wars-outlaws-surprisingly-well-in-docked-mode.1285560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems to handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-6-rtxdi/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> surprisingly well, delivering a solid experience in docked mode.</p>



<p>Early docked footage of the open-world game released last year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S surfaced online, providing a good look at how the console handles the game in both its linear and open-world segments. While the footage makes it clear plenty of compromises had to be made to get the game running on the new generation Nintendo console, Star Wars Outlaws seems to keep to its 30 FPS cap, resulting in a decent enough performance in docked mode. No handheld footage was shared, however, so it remains to be seen if the system will be able to deliver a decent experience on the go.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhNIf6ZWTwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In its launch window, the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to receive plenty of third-party ports, and some of them, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077 port</a>, have shown the level of image quality and performance the system can achieve with proper optimization. In the coming months, the next-generation system by Nintendo will receive a few other ports, and some of them are seemingly set to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, in terms of quality. The Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port will likely be among the best ports, achieving a higher level of quality than the original PlayStation 4 version, which is definitely impressive for a handheld system. On the other hand, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition already doesn't seem to be faring well, possibly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">CPU limitations</a> and the fact that the game's engine will effectively be its first port for the ARM platform.</p>



<p>Though port quality may differ, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a lot of improvements over its predecessor. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> will get at least one more significant game update, says Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, mere months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eric-barone-the-guy-who-cant-stop-updating-stardew-valley-says-the-words-i-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2">stating</a> that he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy." It'll be called update 1.7, and the trimness of the numbering implies that it'll be a large one. For context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">Stardew Valley update 1.6</a> brought eight player PC co-op, new crops, a lot more NPC dialogue, a mastery system, new pets, and the ability to give those pets hats (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-putting-hats-on-your-pets-asks-stardew-valley-creator">caused a few problems</a>). 
</p>
<p>"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">wrote on Xitter</a> over the weekend. "No release date, no estimate. But it's happening."

</p><p>Barone is theoretically also working on a brand new game, the more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">combat-focussed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, but Stardew Valley keeps luring him back, for there is always something else to fix or introduce, however daft. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," he said in May. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas." 
</p>
<p>In Barone's defence, if I had made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games">fourth best-selling premium PC game of all time</a>, I would feel in no great rush to move on from it. I would tinker for years. Well, I mean, I would actually take a lot of holidays. But in between all those trips to Alton Towers and when not playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> in my bedroom-sized caramel fondue, I would do plenty of tinkering. Ah, I imagine George R. R. Martin wishes he could be updating the old GOT novels instead of writing The Winds Of Winter.

Amidst layoffs at Microsoft in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled</a> and a number of employees at the British studio lost their jobs.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> creator Mike Booth has announced he is working on a new four-player co-op shooter.</p>
<p>In a post shared on reddit over the weekend, Booth said the upcoming game will be "built on the foundations of what made [Left 4 Dead] special", though he stopped short of giving his new project a name or indeed any concept art.</p>
<p>However, in the words of the developer, "if you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting".</p>

<p>Booth added this shooter will expand on the co-op gameplay formula in "ways I've wanted to explore for a long time". Curious.</p>
<p>Booth currently works for Bad Robot Games, which is a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jj-abrams-production-company-bad-robot-now-has-a-games-division">subdivision of JJ Abrams' film and TV production company announced in 2018</a>. In his reddit post, Booth said the team is still in the "early stages" of the shooter's development. There are, however, going to be playtests for a limited number of participants.

<p>Ah, a blockade</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are mere days away from the Switch 2's next big port, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> gearing up for a hyperspace exit on <strong>4th September</strong>. Ubisoft has been pretty shy with Switch 2 footage so far (bar a sizzle reel appearance in the console's reveal Direct, and another brief look back in July), and if initial impressions are to be believed, there might be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Outlaws' Switch 2 port has arrived at PAX West, giving all those in attendance the first chance to see how Kay Vess' planet-hopping adventure fares on the new Nintendo hardware. One such person to go hands-on with the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">GVG</a>'s Steve Bowling, who, despite revealing that Ubisoft allowed no direct-feed capture or over-the-shoulder recording during the preview, assembled his thoughts into a YouTube video. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't sound great.</p>
<p>According to Bowling, Outlaws runs "pretty poorly" on Switch 2, with both the game's resolution and framerate taking a hit to account for the scope of the open world and the technology under the hood. What's all the more concerning is that this comes despite the majority of the demo taking place in a relatively enclosed area — the early Imperial ship escape.</p>
<p>Even in these smaller environments, Bowling noted the "unstable, uncapped framerate", which apparently dropped below 30fps at several points during the demo. In a larger dogfight section, Bowling notes that the game simply "didn't look very remarkable", despite the ray-traced lighting and DLSS providing some neat visuals in more intimate moments.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like we might be in for a bumpy ride when this one arrives on Switch 2 later this week — heck, we have to assume that the PAX West demo is the finished version of the game with that tight of a turnaround. We'll be able to see it for ourselves soon enough, though we're getting those expectations tempered.</p>

        <p>Team Cherry confirm final release timings and pricepoints</p>

            <p>Team Cherry have confirmed release times and price points for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. It'll cost $19.99, €19.99 and ¥2300 at launch on Thursday 4th September, with pricing for other regions such as the UK to follow. As an indication, the above pricepoints equate to around £17, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged £19.99 for it, purely for the sake of symmetry.
</p>
<p>It's traditional among games journalists to illustrate pricepoints in terms of high street chain cups of coffee. But this is Silksong, a game anticipated as fervently as the ancient Mayans once anticipated the coming of an eclipse, so I will resort to more ornate means of comparison: Silksong will cost you 4200000th as much as a B-52 Stratofortress. It will cost you three-sixteenths of your soul on a rainy Friday, or two-sixteenths if the sun is out. It will cost you considerably less than they could probably charge for it. I'm not saying we should be grateful, mind, but we can breathe a sigh of a relief that this isn't being published by EA, Take-Two or Microsoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The game will launch on 7am PT, 10am ET, 3pm BST, and 4pm CEST this Thursday. This means that North American players can take the whole day off so as to rise and shove their gloating faces into Hornet's adventure, very first thing. You won't even have to shower first, you bastards. Seething Brits and Europeans must twiddle their thumbs in apoplexy till mid-afternoon, while the poor, sleepless Japanese seemingly won't get access till 11pm Tokyo time, if I'm converting the timezones correctly.
</p>
<p>James was recently able to actually play Silksong at Gamescom, finding it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">both enjoyable and familiar</a>. "The upside of playing it safe is that absolutely nothing has compromised what made the first game's action a tactile pleasure: its abnormally fine-tuned controls and pin-sharp audio/visual feedback on hits and jumps," James wrote.
</p><p>We had a bit of a ride with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Back in 2017, John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-review">recommended that people play Ori and the Blind Forest</a> instead. This caused quite the hullabaloo over the subsequent eight years. My sage and considered verdict in hindsight is that they're both mid and you should play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>. Here's to another eight years!</p>
