<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160661/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> is a tactical RPG that follows a demon hunter named Faye and her collected companions as members of the Black Magic Club at a poorly-ranked university on a peculiar island by the same name.</p>
<p>The school element of Demonschool should be taken with a big grain of salt, as Faye and her group of weirdos find out for themselves after arriving on the island. They’re given an assignment each week that has little to do with education and everything to do with the mysteries of the university and the impending apocalypse. Characters can 'study' techniques to unlock equipable abilities for the squad, and there is a weekly quiz on the weekends. Outside of furthering the main plot, time is spent building relationships, pursuing side quests, and playing minigames at various locations around town.</p>
<p>Combat is suitably at the heart of gameplay and employs what developer Necrosoft Games describes as "new-style tactics", which draws inspiration from the first two <strong>Persona</strong> games. Each battle begins with choosing your party, where you select which character goes in each starting slot. There are four slots available, and Faye always needs to be in the first. If the fight is connected to a personal quest, sometimes other characters are also locked into a slot.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160663/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>During the planning phase, you can expend action points to navigate each character around the grid-based map. Moving into an enemy constitutes an attack, and different characters apply their own abilities, sometimes pushing enemies into those behind them or pulling and stunning enemies as they pass through.</p>
<p>There are eight action points available for use each round. The first time a character completes an action, they use only one point, and for each subsequent action they use an additional point. For example, it costs two action points for Faye's second movement and three points for her third movement. The balance of point cost, character abilities, and positioning relative to enemies on the map makes for an engaging puzzle each time combat rolls around.</p>
<p>Throughout the planning phase, there’s plenty of room for trial and error. Moves can be rewound and characters can act in any order. Once the movements for the round are locked in, the action phase unfolds, showing all of the piecemeal movements and attacks in full concert with one another. It makes for a satisfying visual, with characters zipping through lines of enemies, activating combos, and sending fountains of blood into the air for each downed combatant. Any remaining enemies then make their moves and attacks before the start of the next round.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160659/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Successfully completed fights are graded as an A, B, or C and confer a corresponding amount of opals (the in-game currency), trophies, and class credits. In order to get a top mark, you need to kill a certain number of demons within the specified number of rounds and get at least one character to the back end of the map to seal the portal. If a team member dies or if you don’t meet the round goal, the grade for the combat goes down. The range of successful outcomes is nice, since a perfectionist player can aim for As, but imperfectly executed bouts don’t stop you from proceeding forward in the game.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of combat in Demonschool does mean that fighting becomes a little tedious at times. Especially in the early game when you only have access to a few characters and abilities, getting through fight after fight against the same demons feels like a slog. Thankfully, the tactical complexity begins to build momentum after the first couple of in-game weeks when new enemy types grace the battlefield and new teammates join the club.</p>
<p>At the start of the game, Faye and Namako are the only two playable characters, followed shortly after by the first two additions to the Black Magic Club, Destin and Knute. A total of 15 characters can be recruited and utilised in combat by the end.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160669/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also build Faye’s relationship with the other club members by choosing dialogue options they approve of, singing karaoke with them, cooking them meals, and pursuing their side quests. Relationships are a secondary focus of the game, and Faye herself is irreverent and action-fixated. Still, the cast is varied and interesting enough to entertain.</p>
<p>Demonschool’s plot doesn’t take itself too seriously despite its penchant for horrifying scenarios. Character dialogue leans heavily on jokes and '90s tech references, lending an air of levity to all the gore and death. The art style also seems referential to the era of its setting, but still manages to feel suitable for contemporary gaming. The majority of gameplay is from an isometric view, but the camera does occasionally pan to different angles for important scenes, showing off a mix of 2D and 3D art.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is chock-full of synthy beats that set the mood well. Sound effects punctuate everything from UI navigation to character interactions. There's even a snazzy jingle for when time passes and a new day begins.</p>
<figure><a title="Demonschool Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160666/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From a technical perspective, I didn’t experience any lag or issues while playing on Switch. There was a short loading time before the start of each battle, which was generally unobtrusive.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Demonschool is a lot of fun and provides a challenging, yet accessible strategic landscape. The mild horror elements pair well with the relaxed and somewhat goofy tone of the story, and the art style is well-suited to the late '90s setting.</p>
<p>On the whole, Demonschool feels well-polished and thoughtfully constructed: a huge relief after the game’s multiple delays!</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Krafton <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-owner-krafton-outlines-plans-to-transform-into-an-ai-first-company">affirmed its commitment to becoming an "<em>AI-first</em>" company</a>, the latest pre-trial document in the legal dispute between the co-founders of Subnautica developer Unknown Worlds alleges that Krafton's chief executive officer, Changham Kim, looked to ChatGPT to see if there was a way out of paying developers at Unknown Worlds their <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus</a> that started this whole debacle.</p>



<p>The saga between the co-founders of Unknown Worlds (Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max McGuire) and Krafton is one of 2025's longer and more surprising stories. It's doubtful that anyone could have predicted that we'd get the most legal drama from a case that has everything an onlooker could ask for; high financial stakes, the concept of a big company versus a small band of creators, and a fandom caught in the middle, unsure of which side to believe.</p>



<p>Krafton has made several claims about the co-founders, including that they abandoned their roles at Unknown Worlds, that they had stolen from Krafton and from Unknown Worlds, that they would have willingly sabotaged the reputation of the studio they founded just to receive a big payout.</p>



<p>The co-founders have hit Krafton with allegations of their own, like alleging that Krafton management was purposely sabotaging Unknown Worlds to delay Subnautica 2's early access launch in the hopes of Unknown Worlds missing its window to earn the $250 million bonus, and that CEO Changham Kim even admitted to the co-founders that it would be "<em>disastrous</em>" and <em>"hugely embarrassing</em>" for Krafton if it were to pay Unknown Worlds the massive bonus.</p>



<p>There's a full recap of events at the bottom of this article, with bullet points listing everything that has happened so far, with links to our coverage of it all if you want to catch up. For now, we'll stick with what's new, which deals in particular with that last allegation from the co-founders about Krafton CEO Changham Kim.</p>



<p>Though Krafton denies that Kim admitted it would be a financial disaster for Krafton should it have to pay the bonus, the pre-trial brief (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-accused-of-forming-secret-taskforce-project-x-to-seize-control-of-unknown-worlds">publicly available via Game Developer</a>) alleges that Krafton took direct steps to avoid paying the bonus not just for financial reasons, but because Kim felt it would be "<em>a professional embarrassment</em>" and that he and Krafton would be seen as "<em>a pushover</em>" if it paid the bonus. </p>



<p>The attempt to avoid the bonus was allegedly called "<em>Project X,"</em> and the brief also alleges that firing the co-founders was part of Kim's attempts to avoid paying the bonus. Kim even went so far as to ask ChatGPT if there was a way out of paying the bonus, which tracks considering Krafton is trying to front itself as an AI and Generative AI-forward company.</p>



<p>"<em>Desperate to avoid such a professional embarrassment</em>," the pre-trial brief reads, "<em>Kim obsessed over finding a way to avoid Krafton's obligation to pay the earnout. [Maria] Park told Kim that 'it seems to be highly likely that the earn-out will still be paid if the sales goal is achieved regardless of the dismissal with cause.'"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Kim turned to artificial intelligence to help him brainstorm ways to avoid paying the earnout. ChatGPT likewise advised that it would be 'difficult to cancel the earn-out.' But Kim was undeterred</em>."</p>



<p>The brief goes on to list Krafton's milestone check-ins with Unknown Worlds as the first step in what Kim believed to be the solution to his alleged problem, delaying the launch of Subnautica 2. Krafton would allegedly use the check-ins as the foundation to start its campaign that the game should be delayed.</p>



<p>That was only the beginning of 'Project X,' though, as the brief further alleges that Krafton's executive class was essentially planning a coordinated campaign to avoid paying the earnout by any and all means available to them, including seizing control of Unknown Worlds' website and social media channels and embarking on a "<em>Take-Over Scenario</em>" backup plan if the co-founders did not agree to Krafton's attempts to alter the earnout deal.</p>



<p>The brief also goes after one of Krafton's main claims about the co-founders, which is that they were allegedly abandoning their posts. Krafton has tried to use Charlie Cleveland's involvement in filmmaking as proof that he wasn't doing his job, but the pre-trial brief includes Slack messages that allegedly prove Krafton was fully aware of Cleveland's filmmaking efforts and was even considering making them an official part of his role <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/subnautica-2-could-be-getting-a-tv-show-or-movie/">as the potential for a Subnautica film grew</a>.</p>



<p>Suffice to say, nothing in this pre-trial brief from the co-founders' legal team looks good for Krafton, though that's also what it's supposed to do. For Krafton's part, <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-chatgpt-2000644792">in a statement shared with Kotaku</a>, the company denies the claims in the pre-trial brief and claims that its first commitment has always been to deliver "<em>the best possible game to Subnautica fans</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>At the heart of every decision Krafton makes are the fans who deserve the best possible experience. Krafton made leadership changes at Unknown Worlds when the now-former executives focused on other priorities rather than </em><em>Subnautica 2</em>," the statement reads<em>. "Despite Krafton offering to extend the former executives’ earnout period if they returned to their positions, the former executives refused to return to work, and improperly retained hundreds of thousands of Unknown Worlds and Krafton confidential documents both just before and after they were terminated." </em></p>



<p>"<em>Additionally, they failed to preserve certain files after their employment ended. Through this court process, Krafton remains focused on what matters: delivering the best possible game to </em><em>Subnautica</em>’s fans. Krafton will continue to present the evidence proving that the former executives did not comply with their duties as the legal proceedings move forward."</p>



<p>Needless to say, this will be an extremely interesting case to follow once it gets to trial. We'll keep you updated on it as it continues to evolve.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you need a recap on this whole saga, here's a timeline with everything save for today's news to catch you up:</p>



<ul>
<li>On July 2, it was reported that the founders of Unknown Worlds, Ted Gill, Max McGuire, and Charlie Cleveland, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were fired</a> and replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head Steve Papoutsis. No concrete explanation for their dismissal was offered at the time, with Krafton instead emphasizing its commitment to delivering a game that players deserved.</li>



<li>On July 3, a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement from the Unknown Worlds website</a> did its best to calm concerns from fans about the fact that the three original core creatives behind Subnautica were suddenly not at the studio.</li>



<li>The next day, on July 4, the situation began to grow even more confusing, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Cleveland claims</a> Subnautica 2 was "<em>ready for early access release</em>" and that his and his fellow co-founders' dismissals were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</li>



<li>Five days later, on July 9, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">report from Bloomberg</a> adds a shocking allegation to the mix: that Krafton was delaying Subnautica 2 to avoid paying Unknown Worlds a $250 million bonus the studio would have been owed if they hit particular sales goals, which they would have done with Subnautica 2's launch. The delay was <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">confirmed</a> hours after the report went live, and Krafton held that the delay was due to Subnautica 2 not being ready, citing feedback from internal playtesting.</li>



<li>On July 10, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-blames-founders-subnautica-2-delay/">went on the offensive</a>, blaming co-founders Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire, claiming they had "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles to pursue personal interests. Krafton also clarified that 90% of the aforementioned $250 million bonus would go directly to the co-founders, with the rest to be split among the employees. Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire held that they always intended to distribute the bonus to other employees.</li>



<li>Also on July 10, Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath">filed a lawsuit</a> against Krafton.</li>



<li>On July 11, an<a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-leaked-document-shows-krafton-delay/"> internal document from a milestone review of Subnautica 2's progress leaked</a> on Reddit, seemingly showing further support to Krafton's claims that the game wasn't ready, citing a lack of content on top of previously mentioned internal playtest feedback.</li>



<li>Over the following weekend on July 13, Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-confirms-subnautica-2-leaked-documents-are-real/">confirmed the documents to be real</a>.</li>



<li>A few days later, on July 17, when the co-founders' suit against Krafton became publicly available, we discovered allegations that Krafton had <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-allegedly-sabotaged-subnautica-2-to-delay-avoid-paying-250-million-bonus/">been sabotaging</a> Subnautica 2 to ensure it would be delayed. There was even a claim that the CEO of Krafton met with the co-founders and admitted that having to pay out the $250 million bonus "<em>could be disastrous financially and hugely embarrassing for Krafton</em>." It also attacks every other claim Krafton had made up to this point, and that the feedback received on Subnautica 2 playtesting "<em>unequivocally proved</em>" the game was ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Jumping ahead to August 12, Krafton<a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-fires-back-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-subnautica-2/"> shoots back</a> at Gill, Cleveland, and McGuire's lawsuit, again arguing that the co-founders were absentee leaders who abandoned their roles, and continued to hold that the game wasn't ready for an early access launch.</li>



<li>Eight days later, Unknown Worlds <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-legal-battle-unknown-worlds-files-lawsuit-against-co-founders-krafton/">files its own separate lawsuit</a> against its co-founders, telling Wccftech in an email that this suit "<em>is a direct response to their misconduct, including the theft of confidential information and attempts to pursue personal financial gain to the detriment of the company's interest</em>s<em>."</em></li>



<li>On September 19, a report revealed that the court denied two of Krafton's motions, and Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-founders-lawsuit-krafton-u-turn/">seemingly U-turned on one of its key arguments</a> regarding why the co-founders were fired in the first place.</li>



<li>On September 24, new motions from Krafton alleged that <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-accuses-unknown-worlds-founders-of-stealing-subnautica-blueprint/">the founders stole what Krafton called "<em>effectively, a blueprint</em>"</a> for Subnautica in an attempt to further its argument that the co-founders intended to release Subnautica 2 on their own.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve developed a sixth sense for old video game cartridges. I can spot them at flea markets and thrift stores, spy them hidden behind stacks in used book stores. It happened after I first bought <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">an Analogue Pocket</a>, when the hunt for new and interesting Game Boy games became as important as actually playing them. Now my attention has turned to the Nintendo 64. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">Analogue’s long-delayed take on the console</a> — dubbed the Analogue 3D — might just be the most premium way there is to play N64 games, making it ideal for collectors.</p><p>After playing with the Analogue 3D over the last week, I’ve found a new appreciation for Nintendo’s oft-neglected console. I’ve played through games for the first time and revisited old favorites, all with the benefit of modern conveniences like wireless controllers and 4K visuals.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODIyODk0"><p><span>$<!-- -->250</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Old games look great</li><li>Compatible with a huge number of games</li><li>Lots of customization options</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>No controller in the box</li><li>Early 3D games don’t always age very well</li></ul></div></div></div><p>Analogue first made waves in 2015 with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/26/8850397/analogue-nt-premium-nes-nintendo-console">the Analogue NT</a>, a modern re-creation of the NES. Since then, it has done the same for platforms like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date">Sega Genesis</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review">SNES</a>, all of which are designed to play old cartridges — which can cost anywhere from a few bucks to a few hundred, depending what you’re buying — on modern televisions. The consoles use field-programmable gate array, or FPGA, technology to function just as the original hardware did.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->6</strong><span><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>The Analogue 3D takes this concept and applies it to the N64. There are easier and cheaper ways to play many of these games, such as with the Nintendo Switch Online subscription or through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132984/delta-free-emulator-nintendo-gba-n64-iphone-app-store-us">emulators on the App Store</a>. But, much like how a high-end record player preserves the physical element of listening to music, a console like the Analogue 3D offers a different and more tactile experience. It’s one that I’ve found creates a deeper connection with what I’m playing.</p><p>The $249.99 console looks like a slightly streamlined N64 — it’s available in both black and white — complete with a cartridge slot on top and four controller ports on the front, along with “power” and “reset” buttons. On the back there’s an SD card slot, two USB-A ports, and an HDMI port, which allows you to play it on a modern TV, unlike the original N64 hardware. It comes with an HDMI cable, USB cable, power supply, and a 16GB SD card preinstalled with the console’s operating system. It doesn’t come with a controller, but it supports the original wired N64 gamepads if you have some lying around, and various wireless options. I tested it using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/716292/8bitdo-64-wireless-controller-nintendo-analogue-3d">8bitdo’s $39.99 Bluetooth option</a>, which crams the three-prong N64 controller into something resembling an Xbox pad.</p><p>The console outputs at up to 4K, and is region-free, meaning you can play games originally released in any territory, and the company says that it has “100 percent compatibility” with every N64 game. I obviously wasn’t able to test that, but I did throw a few oddballs at it — like a Japan-only J.League soccer game that I snagged for $10 — and didn’t run into any issues. In fact, one of the best parts of the system’s barebones interface is that it recognizes cartridges you pop in, so you can build up a digital list of your library. You can then use this function to customize aspects like the visual output for each game. Analogue says other features are coming in a future update, including quick save states and screenshots.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>But it’s those visual settings that really show the power of the Analogue 3D. Over the years, the N64 has proven to be a difficult console to emulate; even Nintendo messes it up sometimes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad">with games that have ugly textures or are missing effects like fog</a> with few customization options. The Analogue 3D goes in the opposite direction with five different output modes, and I’ve found myself swapping between them depending on the kind of game I’m playing.</p><p>For instance, one of the visual modes is called “clean,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like: the original game rendered in high resolution with bright colors and sharp edges. This became my go-to for bright and colorful games like <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, which really popped with life on my TV. But for other games, this more pure and clean output ruined the vibe. Titles like <em>Star Wars: Shadows</em> <em>of the Empire</em> and <em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>, for instance, use a lot of muted colors and effects like fog to create a darker, moodier tone. That energy was lost with the “clean” option. But as soon as I swapped over to BVM mode — or Broadcast Video Monitor, which Analogue calls “reference-grade for N64” — all those elements flooded back in. There I was, in the bleak Ord Mantell Junkyard, hunting down Boba Fett just like I did three decades ago, trying to spy drones flying through the fog.</p><div><p><cite>Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>There are other modes, which you can swap on the fly, including one that mimics the look of a CRT monitor, along with further customization options with names like “gamma transfer” and “beam convergence,” which I admit are a bit beyond me. I had no problem finding the best output for each particular game. You have a lot more control here than when playing the same games with Nintendo’s subscription, which offers one solitary CRT filter.</p><p>The one caveat I’ll make here has little to do with the Analogue 3D hardware and more to do with the platform it’s tied to. The company’s previous consoles all focused on 2D games, which typically age a lot better than early 3D titles. Even though I played many of these N64 games when they first came out, I still found myself struggling with some of the 3D platforming segments<em>, </em>and, boy, did I miss the lack of a free camera to help me look around these three-dimensional worlds. It was even harder for games that were completely new to me. Again, this isn’t the Analogue 3D’s fault, but it is something to consider if you’re looking to invest in a library of cartridges.</p><p>But, for me at least, this has also made those cartridge hunts all the more satisfying. Finding something cool and surprising, and then spending time learning how to play it, gives me a chance to engage with these games on a deeper level. Unlike when I’m choosing from dozens or more games on a digital platform, where I can quickly swap to something else if I’m bored, a device like the Analogue 3D and the cartridges it plays force a level of focus that I often feel is missing from my life, as so many things vie for my attention.</p><p>I doubt I’d have given <em>Jikkyo J. League: Perfect Striker</em> a second thought through Nintendo Switch Online. But now that I have the cartridge, it’s become a multiplayer favorite in this house.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64]]></content:encoded>

A grim and insanitary management game about absolutely abysmal cars? One for you, Brendy! Oh sod it, he's not here anymore. That's what we get for letting him learn how to drive - and letting him have a cell with a window. I don't know how to drive, and I have played neither <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a> nor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a>, but I do know how to be a dishonest piece of shit, so I am at least 25% of the way towards writing an informed appraisal of Totally Legit Wheeler Seller.

Created by Polish developers Sombrero Labs, it's about making old, broken, patently unsafe cars look like new-ish, sellable ones by means of myriad methods. You can, for example, cut cars in half and solder the least rusty bits together, or paint tyres to look fresher, or photoshop some sparkle into your carefully angled phone pictures, or use an electric screwdriver to wind back the miles-counting... thingy. The best part from my perspective is that prior knowledge of actual car functioning appears inessential, to the point of being frowned upon. After all, the more you know about cars, the more you will understand why you shouldn't let anybody drive <em>these</em> cars.
</p>
<p>
If you do drive, I imagine you might enjoy this because it kindles memories of cars you shouldn't have bought as a foolish youth. Cars with suspiciously placed floor mats, and a raccoon nesting under the hood which the seller persuaded you was merely an atypically rabid and flea-ridden intake manifold. He probably charged you an extra £50 for that raccoon. Read more about Totally Legit Wheeler Seller on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3875690/Totally_Legit_Wheeler_Seller/">Steam</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-airtag-4-pack-deal-makes-each-tag-feel-practically-free-apple%E2%80%99s-clearing-stock-early-to-avoid-the-black-friday-rush.1356994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing track of your items, especially when you’re on the go, is never fun. AirTags are a great way to always keep an eye on the whereabouts of your essentials. But since most of us have more than one thing worth keeping tabs on, getting just a single AirTag might not cut it. Thankfully, Amazon is making it easier to snap a few without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Right now, the retailer is offering the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $65, which is a 34% discount from its original price.</a> That brings it down to around $16 per AirTag, which is practically a steal considering the peace of mind these bring. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but we can’t say how long it will last. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track Your Essentials</h2>
<p>An AirTag is a coin-like gadget that you can attach to your essentials in multiple ways. You can use an AirTag accessory (like a keychain or loop) to hook it onto your keys or luggage, and even just slide one in your wallet or backpack. Activating these is quite straightforward; just remove the battery tab from the AirTag, bring it closer to your iPhone or iPad, and tap Connect on the prompt that appears. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the AirTag to your Apple ID, and you will be all set!</p>
<p>Once you’re done setting things up, you can use the Find My app to locate your essentials. The Precision Finding features lead you right to your nearby AirTag, and the app even lets you trigger a sound from the built-in speaker to help you find it. For items that are further away, the Find My network can help pinpoint their location anonymously.</p>



<p>Still can’t seem to find your valuables? You can also put an AirTag in Lost Mode, which sends you a notification as soon as it detects the AirTag. You can even share the tag with up to five people, or provide its details to a third party (like an airline) to help recover lost luggage.</p>
<p>The replaceable battery lasts up to a year. AirTags are also IP67 water and dust-resistant, meaning these tiny but mighty gadgets can survive not-so-ideal weather conditions well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This deal brings the price down of this 4-pack bundle to just $65, after a nice $34 discount, which makes the purchase much more affordable.</a></p>

                <p>The developers behind the newly launched episodic game Dispatch have weighed in with their thoughts on artificial intelligence in gaming, saying it might help with production but not creativity.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dispatch-is-on-course-to-beat-its-three-year-sales-target-in-three-months-heres-how" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to GI.biz</a>, AdHoc boss Nick Herman said AI cannot achieve what actors Jeffrey Wright and Aaron Paul did in Dispatch. "He brought something to that character that we weren't expecting. I mean, his performance and Aaron's performance and our whole cast are bringing performances and elevating the material in a way that you're just not going to get [with AI]."</p><p>He added: "AI feels like a production solution, not a creative one. Maybe it's a creative one if you <em>aren't </em>creative."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTVgX7b1N8E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fTVgX7b1N8E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Executive producer Michael Choung went on to say that whatever AdHoc creates, it's "got to be made by people." The studio is "looking at AI" and "monitoring" what it can do to help the studio, but right now the results are not convincing AdHoc to push into AI like other studios are.</p><p>"It seems to be having a lot of trouble trying to get to a 'good enough' spot. And 'good enough' for us is the enemy," he said. "Also we're not getting up every morning and talking to ourselves like, 'Hey, what if we did this with less people? What's the lowest number of people we can use to make this thing?' This is like not anything that we're too concerned with."</p><p>Choung added that he does not judge people and studios for using AI in their processes, but for AdHoc, "It just doesn't make a ton of sense" to use AI right now.</p><p>In other news, PUBG creator Brendan Greene recently made headlines when he said he felt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-says-he-is-really-heartened-about-the-backlash-to-ai-in-gaming/1100-6536304/" data-ref-id="1100-6536304">"really heartened" to see the backlash to AI in gaming.</a> He's not the only person speaking out against the further adoption of AI in gaming, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/us-congressman-calls-for-ai-regulations-after-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-debate/1100-6536263/" data-ref-id="1100-6536263">a US lawmaker recently called out Call of Duty over AI.</a> One of 2025's most successful games, Arc Raiders, has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-use-of-ai-is-good-for-gaming-helldivers-boss-says/1100-6536274/" data-ref-id="1100-6536274">embraced AI.</a></p><p>Dispatch is a $30 episodic adventure game for PS5 and PC developed by a team of people who formerly worked at Telltale and Ubisoft. It released in late October and sold more than 1 million copies in its first 10 days. Choung told GI.biz that Dispatch is on track to reach the games lifetime sales projection in three months, though he did not provide any specific numbers.</p>

Even the <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1990559747221913975" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peely-fied Professor Frink showed up</a> for the stunt.</p><p>The Simpsons mini-season of Fortnite has been a real treat for fans of the long-running cartoon, though it took until last week for the battle royale to include a good number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-added-a-pile-of-absurd-new-simpsons-guns-this-week/1100-6536155/" data-ref-id="1100-6536155">Simpsons-themed weapons like Moe's 5 Gun</a>.</p><p>For those who aren't into the animated sitcom, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-battle-royale-will-have-100-players-on-a-big-map-again-in-chapter-7/1100-6536060/" data-ref-id="1100-6536060">Fortnite will go back to normal</a> (whatever "normal" means for this game) when Chapter 7 begins on November 29.

            <p>The team behind Netflix anime Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft has given us a peek at what's in store for season two.</p>
<p>The new trailer features Lara along with Sam - a character first introduced by Rhianna Pratchett in 2013's Tomb Raider reboot - getting into all sorts of japes. This includes Lara punching a shark on the nose, much like she did in the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider film Cradle of Life. They also take some time to drink coffee, because who wants to raid a tomb without a hit of caffeine to grease the axels?</p>
<p>Speaking of axels, we also see Lara using her twin climbing axes, another key piece of equipment from the rebooted Survivor timeline. You can check out the trailer for Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft below.</p>

<p>"Lara races across the globe to uncover ancient African relics before a techno-visionary bent on playing god uses them to unleash worldwide destruction," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>Hayley Atwell returns for the second season as the voice of Lara Croft, as does Earl Baylon as Jonah. Joining the cast this season is Karen Fukuhara (The Boys, Suicide Squad) as Sam.</p>
<p>Season two of Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft will be available on Netflix on 11th December. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">season will be the series' last</a>.</p>

            <p>Cheers have been heard across the internet, with jubilations that, yes, Hytale has been saved from cancellation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">Development on Hytale started back in 2015</a>, and the game soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">gaining investment by Riot Games and eventually getting acquired</a> by the gaming giant, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">the game was cancelled in June of this year</a>.</p>
<p>Thankfully, though, that wasn't the end of the story, and last night, original Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that he had acquired Hytale from Riot Games, calling it "a new and exciting chapter" for those involved.</p>

<p>"Huge thanks to Riot for working with me to make this happen. They wanted what's best for players, and that's for us to eventually play the game," Collins-Laflamme wrote. "This game has always been close to my heart, and I'm excited to bring it back home.</p><p>"Real talk: Hytale isn't some polished AAA release waiting in the wings. It's messy. It's janky. And there's a lot of work to be done. My plan? Get it out to you as soon as possible. No more waiting. You'll get to play it, rough edges and all. It won't be perfect on day one. My hope is that together, we'll shape it into something truly special.</p>
<p>"Thanks for believing in Hytale. Time to get to work."</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved">game's website</a>, Collins-Laflamme again thanked Riot, adding the team was now "going back to the original vision" for Hytale. "We are fully independent and personally committed to funding Hytale for the next 10 years," the developer said. He added an early access date for Hytale will be announced in the "coming days", so stay tuned.</p>

<p>In its own statement regarding Hytale's sale, <a href="https://x.com/riotgames/status/1990480588797849881">Riot said</a>: "After evaluating multiple offers, we've reached an agreement to return Hytale to @simon_hypixel, giving this community its best shot at experiencing a revised version of the game.</p>
<p>"Wishing the team the best of luck for what's ahead."</p>
<p>When news of the game's cancellation first made the rounds, a gigantic art piece with "#Save Hytale" was painted on WPlace over Santa Monica. A community effort by fans of the cancelled sandbox game, this <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-fans-paint-savehytale-art-over-riot-games-office-on-wplace-protesting-its-cancellation">digital display happened to hover over the Riot Games office</a>.</p>

Additionally, this is the first Black Friday for PS5 Pro discounts, bringing it down to £610. Still very pricey, but it’s the best price we’ve seen for it so far.</p>
<p>Also at this pricing is the PS5 Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle, which chucks in some exclusive in-game content and currency.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> Reforged, a big update to 2005 MMORPG Guild Wars that's designed to make it a lot more convenient to play on modern hardware, is set to hit Steam on December 3rd. Steam Deck verification, modern controller support, and an interface revamp are among the tweaks developers ArenaNet and 2weeks have made, with the possibility of further "improvements" down the road being teased.</p>

<p>"We believe that even with all the advancements and innovations of the last two decades, Guild Wars has a lot to offer: an enchanted world of limitless adventure, a deep and flexible skill-based combat system, PvE and PvP challenges of all types, and more," ArenaNet wrote in Reforged's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284210/view/634572213702362037?l=english">Steam announcement</a>. "Guild Wars Reforged begins with a series of updates to Guild Wars that will be completely free to existing players and make it easier than ever for new players to experience it all firsthand."</p>
<p>Reforged, which'll be free to folks who already own the original Guild Wars, lumps Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall together into one package at the new price of $19.99 / whatever the your currency equivalent turns out to be. The aforementioned Steam Deck verification, an interface with larger text options, plus support for controller and high DPI displays come in that revamped box. There's a new quest tracking system and on-screen guide to the controls.</p><p>It's also had a bit of a visual facelift with "dynamic sky bloom effects, new ambient occlusion, and lighting updates" designed to take advantage of modern graphics cards, while some revamped textures and positional audio support round things out. Well, for now at least. "Guild Wars Reforged isn't about a one-time update", ArenaNet wrote, adding that they see this as a "renewing our commitment to the game" with help from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-studio-2weeks-to-focus-on-prototyping-and-bite-sized-games">2weeks</a>, a small studio some former ArenaNet staff formed last year.</p>
<p>"Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria," said 2weeks co-founder Brandon Dillon, who spent 11 years at ArenaNet and has since worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-fandango-remastered">Grim Fandango Remastered</a> at Double Fine. "Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come."</p>
<p>It's nice to see Guild Wars getting some TLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-1-development-to-be-halted-automated">all these years on</a>, especially since sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>'s in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">top MMOs list</a>. Plus, it's an excuse to go back and read some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-4th-birthday-eric-flannum-interview">retro Guild Wars writings</a> from the founderfolk if you fancy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-chase-card-in-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-including-that-charizard.1356928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest set in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">controversy-embroiled</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, Phantasmal Flames, is now out. And, as is becoming traditional for a November release, contains a brand new Charizard card that’s going to drive even more people (and scalpers) to the hobby. In this case, it’s the beloved Mega Charizard X, the gigantic blue variant appearing in both a stunning Special Illustration Rare <em>and</em> in one of the new-fangled gold foils. And yes, both are already fetching ridiculous prices. But in a stark change, they’re the only two that are.</p> <p>I’m pleased to report that once again, if you’re actually able to find any packs to buy, Phantasmal Flames <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">continues Mega Evolution’s new-found generosity</a> when it comes to pull rates. Of the 55 packs we were kindly sent by The Pokémon Company, I pulled an extraordinary 24 ex or better cards, of which 13 were full art or better. Compared to the three year run of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets, this is a dramatic improvement, with pretty much a 50:50 chance of not getting what is derogatively known as a “dud pack.” (For those wanting to play the game, there’s no such thing as a dud pack, and of course it’s these people who are most hurt by the current <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">year-long period of scarcity</a>.)</p>

 <p>However, the cost of this does very much appear to be the pull rates on Special Illustration Rares. As with Mega Evolution, Phantasmal Flames has made these most desirable cards extraordinarily unlikely to appear, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">the new iteration of gold foils proving farcically rare</a>. With Mega Evolutions, this drove prices to new, all-time highs, but in the first few days of Phantasmal Flames things don’t appear to be nearly so out of control. The Charizards are, of course, outrageously priced at $600 and $800 each, but we then see a <em>massive</em> drop for third place, with Dawn’s SIR going for $60. That’s a&nbsp;<em>very</em> normal price for an SIR, and in a pretty small set with only five of them to find, it suggests that people are simply ripping packs for the Zards and caring about little else.</p>

 <p>That becomes even more stark when you notice that fourth place goes to Mega Charizard X ex again, but this time in its much more common Ultra Rare form (I pulled one of these, as it happens) at around $57, the other four SIRs following for as little as $30. (Yes, $30 for a piece of cardboard remains ridiculous, but then I just spent&nbsp;<em>way</em> more than that on the Crown Zenith Leafeon VSTAR, so who am I to talk?)</p>

 <p>Is this a good sign that cards like the Mega Sharpedo ex and Rotom ex SIRs aren’t going for megabucks? Or is it, and I do worry it’s this, that the SIRs in Phantasmal Flames just aren’t that appealing? The art is wonderful on both of those examples, but Sharpedo is rarely at the top of anyone’s favorite Pokémon list, and there really are a lot of pretty Rotom cards already. Then there’s the complete mess of the Mega Lopunny ex (see the card in the gallery), and, well, that’s all of them. The more common (and thus always cheaper) Illustration Rares are where the truly wonderful art appears in this set, with a stunning Zacian, Piplup, Flygon, Wooper, Togedemaru, Ludicolo and Ambipom to find, most of them selling during the peak price of the opening week for under $10! Meowth is the only one of the IRs that’s caught on at around $30 (with Piplup managing an impressive $19).</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-price-mega-lucario-gardevoir-hyper-rare-2000633650">Compare this with Mega Evolution</a>, where the tenth highest priced card was going for $50, and the SIRs fetching around $300 each, and it’s a striking shift. So, with all that said, click on for the cards you want to chase if you’re looking for value in Phantasmal Flames, but know that if you’re after the cards to play in a deck, most can be picked up in their basic form for under a dollar. (Even Mega Charizard X ex’s regular form “only” fetches about $5.) Again,&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can actually find packs to open.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sandisk-2tb-ssd-falls-to-new-all-time-low-amazon-wants-all-stock-gone-for-black-friday-2000645154</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sandisk-2tb-ssd-falls-to-new-all-time-low-amazon-wants-all-stock-gone-for-black-friday.1356925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>External hard drives (HDD) crawl along at speeds that turn simple file transfers into boring experiences, maxing out around 120MB/s for spinning platters. Solid-state drives (SSDs) eliminate mechanical parts entirely, using flash memory that reads and writes data at speeds ten times faster than traditional HDDs.</p>
<p>The SanDisk 2TB Extreme portable SSD delivers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">NVMe performance in a pocket-sized package, now sitting at $162 instead of the usual $209 price tag.</a> This marks an <strong>all-time low</strong> for this capacity, with Amazon wanting to clear inventory before Black Friday ends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1,050MB/s Read Speeds</h2>
<p>This SanDisk SSD pushes <strong>read speeds up to 1,050MB/s and write speeds of about 1,000MB/s over its USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection</strong>. These numbers are indicative of real performance you can expect to see in the real world when transferring files, not some theoretical maximum that never materializes. A 4K movie file of roughly 25GB copies in about 25 seconds and that same transfer takes over three minutes on external hard drives.</p>
<p>Inside the drive,<strong> NVMe technology delivers this performance by using direct PCIe lanes</strong> rather than the SATA bottleneck that constrains older SSDs. The controller manages data efficiently, maintaining consistent speeds even during sustained transfers that would cause cheaper drives to throttle. This you’ll notice most when backing up large folders or copying entire game libraries, as the speeds keep steady rather than starting fast and degrading over time.</p>



<p>Two terabytes stores around <strong>500 hours of 1080p video, 200,000 high-resolution photos, or 20 modern AAA game installs</strong>. This tier makes sense for video editors who are working with 4K footage, photographers who have large RAW libraries they’re managing, and gamers who simply refuse to uninstall old titles. The drive serves as a Time Machine backup target for Mac users or a Windows backup destination and SSD speeds mean your automated backups will finish faster without stressing your system. External game storage works flawlessly with both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, from storing games on the drive to <strong>playing titles directly from it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IP65 water and dust resistance</strong> means complete dust ingress protection and protection against water jets from any direction. The rating means the drive survives rain exposure, dusty environments, or even an accidental spill without immediately destroying your data. You can casually throw it in a backpack with water bottles, do shoots outdoors, or work in construction sites without constant anxiety about the environmental damage it may cause.</p>



<p>The USB-C connectivity works with modern laptops, tablets, and phones via the<strong> provided USB-C to USB-C cable</strong>. A USB-C to USB-A adapter is included in the box to connect to older computers that have traditional USB ports. The drive pulls its power directly from the USB connection with no need for separate power adapters, which keeps true plug-and-play simplicity across devices.</p>
<p>The drives come formatted as exFAT, which works<strong> universally across Windows, Mac, and Linux without reformatting</strong>. You can reformat to NTFS for Windows-specific use or APFS for Mac-optimized performance if the need calls for it. Operating temperature ranges from 0°C to 45°C during active use, covering most environments you’d realistically use the drive in. Non-operating storage tolerance goes from -20°C to 85°C.</p>
<p>You’re paying here about $0.08 per gigabyte at $162 for real NVMe speeds and a rugged build. Samsung, Crucial, and WD portable SSDs with similar specifications often sell between $200 and $300.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4-biggest-goty-contenders-that-missed-out-the-game-awards-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/4-biggest-goty-contenders-that-cruelly-missed-out-on-the-game-awards-2025.1356916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We approach the end of 2025, and the year has seen another ridiculous haul of great games. The Game Awards 2025 showcase will announce one winner from six glorious nominees, but we simply can’t overlook the four games that easily could’ve been included in the pool.</p>



<p>Awards and ceremonies are all subjective at the end of the day. Just like a review, the verdict is reached by either one person or a select panel of people. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> will congratulate its own GOTY winner, but you might have had your own favorite. Games like Hades 2 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserve their place on the nominee list.</p>



<p>In our opinion, some mentions go beyond the tag of being ‘honorable,’ and we’ve identified four prime candidates.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-not-included">Best The Game Awards 2025 GOTY Nominees Not Included</h2>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Blueprints, get it? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The roguelike and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelite</a> genres have been on fire the last few years. Games like Hades and Balatro have not only been nominated for awards, but they’ve won many of them. It feels like a bizarre oversight to have not included Blue Prince. <strong>It was the highest-rated game of the year for a while</strong>, and won over critics and fans with its unique hunt for the 46th room in an inherited house. The trick is that the house’s floors and plans reset every night.</p>



<p>You only have so many steps and resources to move around, and if you don’t do it in time, you start from scratch. But you uncover new items, the game opens up, more locations and secrets are discovered, and it’s a masterful roguelike. According to Metacritic, it’s the <strong>third-best new game in 2025</strong> (discounting the Switch 2 Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom ports) with a collective score of 92/100, so why wasn’t it included?</p>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Super in more ways than one. Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>A ‘Superhero&nbsp;workplace comedy’ sounds like a strange concept without context. It’s all the more impressive that AdHoc Studio’s new IP not only works, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> crashed onto all screens with a triumphant superhero landing. The episodic title features an all-star cast of video game voice-over royalty, streamers, and even renowned stars, including <strong>Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright</strong>.</p>



<p>The intertwining narrative changes across all eight episodes. Your decision-making skills impact the story beats—similar to the Telltale Games formula—and there are also mini-games and other QTEs to break up the conversation and plot development. It’s also fun seeing the fun and different side of superheroes, with The Boys and Watchmen springing to mind. The late addition to 2025 has been instantly revered, but did it come too late for The Game Awards 2025?</p>

<p>Josef Fares masterminded another co-op-only classic with Split Fiction. It carries on the immaculate work of It Takes Two by placing you and a friend into the shoes of Zoe and Mio. You experience a series of mini-games and creative gameplay mechanics at breakneck speed, giving you more variety than a family-sized picnic fruit basket.</p>







<p>It’s meticulously crafted, it looks gorgeous, and highlights the unbelievable work that Hazelight Studios continues to produce with each new game. It Takes Two won The Game Awards GOTY category in 2021, but Split Fiction—<strong>despite being the fourth-highest-rated game of 2025</strong>, according to Metacritic, with a score of 91 based on 100 critic reviews—doesn’t even get into the final 6 games. Go figure.</p>

<p>It’s only fitting to finish off with a roguelite. The irresistible gameplay loop of ‘rogue’ games is none more evident than in Ball X Pit. Its curious name might confuse you, but there’s nothing ambiguous about its gameplay. Block-breaking games aren’t new, but not many try to build a full game around the concept, and to such an overt degree.</p>



<p>Each Ball X Pit game lasts 5-15 minutes. You move along the stage in semi-on-rails fashion, and you earn XP and power-ups as you play. Pickups give you choices, which determine your build for each run, and it leads to this great chase for OP playthroughs where you destroy enemies, crush bosses, and earn lots of resources toward your next effort. <strong>It’s been labeled as the ‘Balatro of 2025,’</strong> and this would be doing a disservice to Ball X Pit in some ways—it’s that good!</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 is sure to be another interesting ceremony with opinions, shocks, and much post-show discussion. Do you agree with any of our GOTY nominees who missed out?

<p>Xbox exclusives haven’t been a part of Game of the Year (GOTY) nominations since 2010, making it 15 years since one was nominated. </p>



<p>The latest list of nominees for The Game Awards 2025 is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live</a>, with winners announced on December 11. However, as we wait for the award show to take place and a new GOTY to be crowned, players should know that no Xbox exclusives are making it to nominations, leaving them out of the running to win the prestigious award. </p>







<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-haven-t-been-nominated-for-goty-for-15-years">Xbox Exclusives Haven’t Been Nominated for GOTY for 15 Years</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/xbox-exclusives-not-nominated-game-awards-game-of-the-year-since-2010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Nick Marseil’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/Nick_Marseil/status/1990481258615353466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals every GOTY nominee for The Game Awards from 2013 to today, categorising them as PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox Exclusives. PlayStation has had 15 games nominated, including titles like The Last of Us, Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Death Stranding 2, and more. Nintendo has had 12 exclusives nominated, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more. Xbox, as mentioned above, has had none. </p>



<p>The answer to when Xbox Exclusives were nominated for GOTY will not make the fans happy, as it was before The Game Awards ceremony even began. The last time Xbox exclusives were nominated for this award was through the Spike Video Game Awards, where Halo: Reach and Mass Effect 2 were nominated. However, none of these games won the award. </p>



<p>If you are wondering about the latest GOTY nominees for TGA 2025, the list includes: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and Hades 2. Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken a record</a> at TGA 2025. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/barkour-preview-a-mostly-doggone-good-stealth-time-so-far.1356907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Who isn’t a sucker for a dog game? Walking the show floor at the Games Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, I immediately did a double take when I saw Barkour, a game about a dog secret agent. He’s not just cute and cuddling, he also has a gun and a grappling hook: I had to take this dog for a walk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You, of course, play as a dog in Barkour. You’re Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R. (don’t ask me what it stands for, dogs can’t spell anyway), an all-around Good Boy who’s recruited off the streets into a secret dog spy organization, and trained to help them take down nefarious, cat-themed villains. He’s got a pretty robust kit to help him out: his nose can sense enemy locations and interactable items, he can overhear enemy conversations to get important intel, he can bark to lure enemies, pounce on them to knock them out, and drag their bodies into hiding with his teeth. He also has gadgets, including a back-mounted gun that can either use sleep darts to incapacitate or actual bullets to kill anyone who tries to fight him. The gadget wheel had loads of room for other tools, too, so I’m sure there’s more to come to turn Agent THUNDER into a full-blown spydog.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Barkour - Concept Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy tutorial that introduces the new Agent (and the player) to his gadgets and spy abilities, the demo threw me into an early game mission, which sees our dog hero infiltrate a massive, overgrown, abandoned maze of a medieval castle to take down someone named “Van der Meow” who, with a name like that, clearly must be stopped. Van der Meow is located in the deepest inner sanctum of the castle, and is guarded by various locked doors, security cameras, and scary men with guns. I could sneak my way through, using my sniffer to track enemy locations, seeking cover in bushes, and quietly incapacitating guards with sleep darts before dragging their bodies into alcoves. Or, I could go in guns blazing, alerting the whole room to my presence and starting a proper firefight.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was quickly impressed with how much license Barkour gave me to find my own way and mess around within the world, to an almost sandboxy degree.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mostly, I chose stealth, and I was quickly impressed with how much license Barkour gave me to find my own way and mess around within the world, to an almost sandboxy degree. The castle started out fairly linear, but quickly opened up into a winding maze of a place with multiple rooms and floors and a number of hidden pathways outside the castle walls, underground, up towers, in ceiling rafters above the dining hall, and behind locked doors. Barkour’s demo offered a surprising amount of freedom to simply figure things out, experiment, and seek out secrets. Instead of beelining it to my objective, I felt encouraged to puzzle out stealth pathways through multiple unnecessary rooms that were hiding secrets, like new treats or gadgets, on the other side. Diving down wells, digging holes, or trying out tricky little platforming sections that took me on narrow pathways up high towers generally rewarded me with with either a shortcut to somewhere I wanted to go or a prize of some kind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, I can smell a lot of heavily-armed guards standing between me and that exploration, so I make an effort to take them out one by one to afford myself safe passage. It would be trivial enough to just fire off sleep darts at every single guard and call it a day, but those are a limited resource that I can only recharge by physically tackling guards – a move that’s far more likely to set off alarms. So I spend a lot of the beginning of the demo skulking in shrubbery, waiting for a guard to wander by, barking to lure him close to me, sneak attacking to knock him out cold, and then dragging his body into the bushes before anyone can notice. That gives me a charge of the sleep dart, which I can then use to knock out the next guy, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also seems like puzzles will play a part in Barkour, too, though most of what I ran into in the opening level was pretty simple. A lot of the puzzles involved listening in on guard conversations or exploring an area to get a code to unlock a door, or using my sniffer to find hidden buttons I needed to press. Several locations seemed to want me to bring specific items to them to activate something, like a fireplace wanting some logs that I never managed to track down. There was one puzzle later in the demo that involved identifying and tracking down several pieces of medieval weaponry all around the castle, but I struggled with this one a bit: it wanted a sword, and even though I could see swords all over the place, none of them were the exact interactable sword the puzzle wanted me to bring. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t quite as impressed with the combat, which still needs some fine tuning. I prefer playing games like this in full stealth-mode, but a few times I did slip up and alert guards to my presence. What followed was what feels like it should have been a challenging combat situation as guards surrounded me from all sides, alarms blared, and shots rang out. What actually happened is I ran literal circles around the guards, pouncing on top of them one after another to stun them and keep them from shooting me, all while infinitely firing my own back-mounted gun to whittle down their health. Rinse and repeat until they’re all dead. I can definitely see what Barkour is going for: the equal emphasis placed on both combat and stealth in the tutorial and gadgets you’re given suggests it wants either method to feel like a viable option. But just in the level I played, the combat was missing something, and I had far more fun with both the challenge and mechanics of stealth.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the level I played, the combat was missing something, and I had far more fun with both the challenge and mechanics of stealth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One note, just to preempt some concerns: Barkour’s free demo on Steam, which is the same one I played, was criticized when it first dropped due to the inclusion of AI voice acting. Following the criticisms, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1920290?emclan=103582791474668669&amp;emgid=506216199297696056" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>developers announced</u></a> that they had removed the AI voices, which they said were only temporary, with plans to hire professionals for the full release. I mention this just because the version I played was the one with the AI voices removed, and thus it didn’t detract from my experience at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Barkour seems extremely promising, it just needs polish – especially the combat. I really enjoyed the openness of the level I played, with all the hidden puzzles and collectibles, and the wide variety of potential strategies to reach my objectives. A stealth game that also functions as a sandbox is a really neat idea, especially paired with such a silly, pup-based premise, and Barkour’s bones are looking real good. With a bit more time and testing, I’m feeling optimistic that the final release will be a doggone treat.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/barkour-preview-a-mostly-doggone-good-stealth-time-so-far]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where Winds Meet has seen two million players jump into the Wuxia fantasy in the first 24 hours of its global launch.</p>
<p>The news was shared by developer Everstone Studio and publisher NetEase Games, following the Chinese action-RPG's release earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Steam, the game has a peak concurrent player count of almost 194k. For comparison with other recent releases, this is far behind the all-time peaks of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> (481,966) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> (747,440), but remains incredibly impressive for a game of this genre.</p>

<p>And while Where Winds Meet so far pales in comparison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> on Steam (2.4 million concurrent player peak), it's already surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> from earlier this year (131,518 concurrent player peak).</p>
<p>Where Winds Meet is also available on PS5 and mobile - on PS5, the game is among the best-sellers in the US, France, South Korea, and other countries.</p>
<p>The game is free-to-play, which usually attracts an initial surge of players, but there's also a sizable online multiplayer component to the game too that acts like an MMO, further contributing to those concurrent player numbers.</p>

<p>"We are thrilled to see such a positive reception for Where Winds Meet from players around the world," said Beralt Lyu, lead producer of Where Winds Meet.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, our team is committed to listening to feedback from our global player community and continuously improving the game. We will also continue to deliver high-quality seasonal updates, bringing more captivating narrative, fresh game modes and new exploration content to the exciting Jianghu."</p>
<p>The game has been available in China since December last year, but this week marks its global release. Indeed, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/believe-it-or-not-upcoming-open-world-rpg-where-winds-meet-has-over-10-million-pre-registrations-heres-why-you-should-care">game had 10 million pre-registered players</a> ahead of that global release.</p>
<p>Where Winds Meet is one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">many Chinese action-RPGs releasing in the wake of the immensely popular Black Myth: Wukong</a>, with developers seeking similar success.</p>

Much like the last news drop, this announcement will <em>only</em> be a trailer, but we’re sure that there will be plenty of reveals in store.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt2LcP6TZzqhM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59trvymq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-and-more-head-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month.1356868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/">announced the remaining games</a> heading to Xbox Game Pass for the back half of November 2025, and paired with the games that already joined the service this month, it makes November arguably the most stacked month Xbox Game Pass has had in 2025. An additional nine games are joining the service between today and December 1, including Marvel Cosmic Invasion and The Crew Motorfest.</p>



<p>Two of the nine games are day one arrivals into Game Pass, including the aforementioned Cosmic Invasion and Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which is finally set to launch in early access after it was delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-officially-set-to-launch-in-summer-2025/">from its initial summer 2025 release window</a>. The sequel to the action-adventure game that lets you lead a double life as a shopkeeper and a dangerous explorer is looking to build on the momentum of the original, which sold more than two million copies overall.</p>



<p>Besides the two-day-one launches, two of the other notable titles entering the service this month are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">latest entry in Ubisoft's popular driving series, The Crew Motorfest</a> and last year's action game from DON'T NOD, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</a> There are also two more releases from this year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>.</p>



<p>Under Xbox's new tiered system for Game Pass, we know that most day-one releases will only be available to those at the top-tier Ultimate level subscription, but it's worth pointing out that in this batch of Game Pass additions, seven out of nine are only available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>In fact, it's worth noting that none of the games entering the service today will be available to players at the lowest tier, Game Pass Essential. At least those players at the bottom tier aren't losing any games with the titles leaving the service this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service for the rest of November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo - November 19 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet - November 19 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest - November 20 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - November 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Kill It With Fire! 2 - November 25 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Marvel Cosmic Invasion - December 1 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - December 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This month, on November 30, Game Pass subscribers will no longer have access to the following five games through their subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship</li>



<li>Lords of the Fallen</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler 2</li>



<li>SteamWorld Build</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NCSOFT subsidiary ArenaNet delivered a surprise announcement with Guild Wars Reforged, an updated version of the classic MMORPG that will be released on December 3.</p>



<p>The original game launched in April 2005 and established the studio originally founded by former Blizzard developers. Over the years, Guild Wars was played by more than nine million users, who spent over a billion hours in the fantasy world of Tyria. ArenaNet eventually released the sequel seven years later and has focused mainly on <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-expansion-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2</a> ever since, but a small fanbase remained loyal to the original.</p>



<p>Guild Wars Reforged is being co-developed with 2weeks, a small studio founded last year by former ArenaNet developers. Brandon Dillon, co-founder of 2weeks, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s a real treat to revisit the original Guild Wars. Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria. Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come.</em></p>



<p>Game Director Stephen Clarke-Willson added:</p>



<p><em>Even after two decades, we’re still passionate about improving the experience of the original Guild Wars for players. The game has a dedicated group of fans, and with this update to modernize the experience, we hope players new and old will find a reason to continue adventuring through Tyria together.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Guild Wars Reforged will deliver controller support, make the game Steam Deck verified, and also bring a host of graphic enhancements, such as high-DPI support for modern high-resolution monitors, new HD skill icons, rendering improvements including new antialiasing options, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom, more font size options for game text, enhanced 3D environmental audio, and a new quest-tracker.</p>
