            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead have revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond for next week, and if you've ever wished you could spray the Terminid hordes with lethal gas, then this one's for you.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">Warbonds</a>, The Chemical Agents doesn't contain any new primary or secondary weapons. Rather, it offers two new Stratagems, one of which is a weapon, while the other is a new drone to help you clear out the hordes more effectively.</p>
<p>First up, the TX-41 Sterilizer is a new Stratagem weapon that you can use to spray your enemies with chemical gas. Drop this one if you think you're going to be facing off against innumerable swarms of bugs or bots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=_ovD5qKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=6jOtdltB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s The Chemical Agents Warbond does exactly what it says on the tin.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new weapon of choice is the AX/TX-13 "Guard Dog" Dog Breath, a drone rover that uses a corrosive gas sprayer weapon to deal damage. Between that and the Sterilizer, you'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>If, however, some of the Terminids should happen to break through your gaseous assault, you can use the new G-4 Gas Grenade to seal the deal. Why not go all gas, all the time with your next loadout?</p>
<p>Two new armor sets are also being released: the lightweight AF-50 Noxious Ranger and the medium AF-02 Haz-Master, both of which come with passives that help you resist the gas clouds you'll be spewing.</p>
<p>You'll also find new emotes, new patterns for your vehicles, and more in this Warbond, so get stuck in if you're thinking it's time for a change of strategy (or a change of aesthetic!).</p>

<p>News of the new Warbond arrives after&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339866697736692015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pledged sweeping changes for the game</a> last month, including big balance changes, reworked primary weapons and combat, and improved performance, plus more.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed it was hard at work</a> on this initiative, further promising to rework Armor Penetration and Anti-Tank weaponry, as well as "more effective" Autocannons and Heavy Machine Guns.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see how these efforts pan out. For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its new The Chemical Agents Warbond launches on September 19th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/transformers-one-review-prequel-optimus-prime-megatron-1851646612<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe ten minutes into <em>Transformers One</em>, the computer-animated prequel to the entire existing saga of Hasbro’s robots in disguise, Scarlett Johansson’s focused mining manager Elita says to Chris Hemsworth’s idealistic worker Orion Pax, “You don’t have the touch <em>or </em>the power.” It’s a clunky, forced reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/A52--FKUQgU?si=tscQte1X15tCs0zJ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/A52--FKUQgU?si=tscQte1X15tCs0zJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cheesy power ballad</a></span> from the original 1986 animated <em>Transformers </em>movie, and it seemed like a bad sign that <em>Transformers One </em>was going to be the kind of film more concerned with winking bits of fan service than with telling a compelling story of its own. Thankfully, however, while it’s ultimately uneven and lacking the inventiveness or visual splendor it would have needed to be truly great, <em>T1 </em>manages to have more smarts and depth than it first lets on. It could serve as a setup for better films to follow, now that all the “origin story” table setting is out of the way.<br></p><p>And make no mistake, this is an origin story top to bottom, and we know how it’s going to end even before it starts. Chris Hemsworth’s character may be called Orion Pax by everyone around him, but we know from the moment we first see him, already sporting that iconic blue and red, that he will be Optimus Prime before all is said and done. This is a movie that, you might say, exists in the context of all that came before it, so your own investment in <em>Transformers </em>will inevitably color your experience. For my part, I was already of moviegoing age when that 1986 cartoon hit theaters, and if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027">the late, great James Earl Jones’</a></span> incredible performance as Darth Vader defined malice and evil for me as a child, Peter Cullen’s work as Optimus Prime defined goodness and virtue just as much. In his acting, he conveyed so much: warmth, compassion, decency, thoughtfulness, a concern with the greater good, a reluctant willingness to sacrifice if that’s what was necessary to do what was right.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When we first meet Orion Pax as he recklessly sneaks into a facility where classified archives are kept, in the hopes of learning something he can use to help end the shortage of precious energon plaguing the robots of Cybertron, it’s hard to imagine him growing into the measured, thoughtful leader we know him to be. He wants to make the world better, sure, but he’s also a bit of a goofball, a bit impulsive. To Hemsworth’s credit, however, he finds a path with his voice performance that reflects how the experiences Orion endures over the course of the film change him. And the screenplay smartly takes him through such galvanizing, radicalizing experiences that we believe he would be forever changed.<br></p><p>The origin story ultimately works because it all feels deeply personal for Orion, and it feels personal because of the relationship at its center. Orion’s best friend is his fellow mining bot D-16, voiced by Brian Tyree Henry, one of the most exciting actors working today. And as surely as we know that Orion will be Optimus before the credits roll, we know that D-16, at first his fast friend, will become his eternal nemesis, Megatron. Together, the two of them—along with Elita and Keegan-Michael Key’s B-127 (who someday will be Bumblebee but for now prefers to refer to himself as Badassatron)—go on a journey, discovering truths that will shake Cybertronian society to its core. It helps that some of those truths come from the wonderful voice of Laurence Fishburne, a welcome presence as a robot named Alpha Trion. In one moment, as he’s illuminating long-lost realities of Cybertron’s past, he suggests that the true meaning of “Transformer” may have less to do with being able to change one’s shape and more with being able to change the world. That’s a pretty cool idea.</p><figure id="" data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But how do we go about trying to create that change? How do we react when we learn difficult truths, when we learn that the things we believed in were a lie? It’s natural, sometimes even good, to be angry. Anger can fuel us in our desire to fight for something better. But it can also consume us. The most fascinating thing about the plot of <em>Transformers One </em>isn’t the deep, dark secrets that Orion and his friends discover. It’s the way that Orion learns what kind of leader he wants to be by watching what D-16’s anger over those discoveries does to him, and deciding what kind of leader he <em>doesn’t </em>want to be.</p><p>It’s heartbreaking and a little horrifying seeing how D-16 is changed by the truths he learns and the injustices he discovers. He’s all the more compelling as a villain because we understand why he’s so outraged, and we feel the pain Orion feels in watching his friend lose his way. Near the end of the film, his simmering rage leads him to commit a shocking act of public brutality against another robot, and it’s tragic to see him become a demagogue who uses the rhetoric of dominance and violence to appeal to the basest impulses of those who end up following him–those who become the Decepticons. While Optimus becomes something like a labor organizer, using solidarity to encourage oppressed robots to toss off their chains and arguing that “freedom and autonomy are the rights of all sentient beings,” Steve Buscemi’s Starscream expresses the opposing ideology like this: “The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth. The only thing that matters is the strength of one bot to dominate all.” It’s an idea that many find seductive at times, but it offers nothing but rot. (I feel like there’s something relevant in this kids’ cartoon to current events but I can’t quite put my finger on it.)</p><figure id="" data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anyway, the film’s climax is strong, a showdown which crystallizes the identities of these two friends-turned-adversaries and left me eager to see more of them, now that they are the Optimus Prime and Megatron we’ve known for so long. (It even, to my delight, nods to Optimus’ long history as a kind of Christ figure.) But that’s not quite enough to make <em>Transformers One </em>a great film in its own right. For most of its runtime it’s passably enjoyable, but sorely lacking the kind of ingenuity a film like this needs to establish itself as more than just another piece of corporate entertainment. There are no sequences here on par with the awe-inspiring action of the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films, for instance, nor any imagery as memorable as the unforgettable planet-sized robot Unicron from the 1986 <em>Transformers </em>movie.<br></p><p>I saw the film in 3D, which definitely enhances the film’s visuals, giving the central setting of Iacon City a wonderfully layered depth, but <em>Transformers One </em>never figures out how to make the most of its vistas in its action scenes, which often feel like arbitrary diversions from the story rather than involving sequences that contribute to the film or our understanding of the characters in a meaningful way. An early racing scene, for instance, just kind of happens, offering lots of sensory diversion with plenty of robots zooming really fast, but it’s hard to feel invested in it because it’s not shot in a particularly exciting way and Orion and D-16 just kind of fumble their way through it. It’s not until that final showdown, when the characters are each fighting desperately for what they believe in and the stakes feel truly high, that the action really starts to land. In this emotionally heightened context, a callback (or, I guess, call forward, since this is a prequel) to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous line from another <em>Transformers </em>movie</a></span> feels not like the clunky reference-dropping that <em>Transformers One </em>indulges in a bit too often, but like a real, defining moment in the relationship between these two, and man, it hurts.</p><figure id="" data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like a number of origin stories, <em>Transformers One </em>has the problem of ending right when it feels like things are really getting underway. Now that the dynamic is established and we understand that Optimus Prime and Megatron are two leaders with fundamentally different ideologies and approaches to the idea of making things better for those who’ve been wronged, I can see stronger films following in its wake, direct sequels that continue the story on Cybertron long before the robots make their way to Earth. And if and when those films come, <em>Transformers One </em>may feel more vital and necessary in retrospect, the setup we had to get through so that those films could dig deeper into the versions of these characters that are established here. But for now, at least, <em>Transformers One </em>is good but not great, a film with an involving relationship arc at its core that spends too much time taking jabs at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoBots&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoBots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rival toy GoBots</a></span> and explaining <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/HherR2qUwI0?si=qmoDKETtzcuoYYU0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/HherR2qUwI0?si=qmoDKETtzcuoYYU0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why Starscream’s voice has always been so annoying</a></span>, rather than giving us great action sequences or truly inventive visuals. But, then again, this is only the beginning.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hoyoverse has confirmed Xbox players will not need to purchase a Game Pass subscription in order to access <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s online multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>The confusion began soon after Hoyoverse announced Genshin Impact would be making its way to Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass. Initially, the game's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/genshin-impact/9N7TFFRRZCC9/0010">Xbox store page listing</a> stated: "Online multiplayer on console requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Xbox Game Pass Core (sold separately)."</p>
<p>Those on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-will-seemingly-require-a-subscription-to-game-pass-to-play-multiplayer-online-update-hoyoverse-confirm-that-it-wont-need-any-subs.970548/">ResetEra</a> pointed out this is a different approach to other free-to-play games on the platform, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>

<p>Now, Hoyoverse has removed the wording from Xbox's store page. "Genshin Impact is a free-to-play game. You do not need to purchase Game Pass Ultimate or Core to play the game in Co-Op Mode,"  Hoyoverse shared in a statement with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Players with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription can receive in-game bundles upon the game's launch and after subsequent version updates, as well as play Genshin Impact on Xbox Cloud Gaming."</p>
<p>Genshin Impact is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-gets-xbox-release-date-but-still-no-word-on-switch">make its debut on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass later this year</a>, on 20th November.</p>
<p>Genshin Impact was previously released across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS, and Android. Despite being announced for Nintendo Switch, we are still to hear any more on that elusive release date - it was first revealed back in January 2020. Another one being held back for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, perhaps?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-pc-specs-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>PC specs you're going to need to play the game on your machine ahead of its October 4th release, and it looks like a fairly broad range of specs will be supported.</p>
<p>As with many of Sony's other PC releases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>will feature advanced customization compared to the console version, so you'll be able to tweak it to your heart's content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=yRZ42DvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=66YYU3YR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>should be a pretty nice-looking game on PC, if you've got the hardware for it.</figcaption></figure><p>All of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s presets will require either Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they'll also require 70GB of free space on an SSD, although Sony's High and Ultra presets require an NVMe SSD for best results.</p>
<p>Here are the specs you'll need to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>across its several presets!</p>
<h3>Minimum (720p, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 470</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1080p, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>High (1440p, 60fps or 4K, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 11700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on a lower-spec PC, you should be able to do so, although you're going to be making some sacrifices in terms of graphical fidelity and frame rate.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this is a remake of the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>rather than a PC port of that game. It's landing on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> simultaneously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">on October 4th</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">parted with around 1900 employees in January</a>, and the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023</a>, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As with the previous round of cuts, this latest bout of belt-tightening is the result of Microsoft needing to recover some of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">that money they spent inhaling Activision-Blizzard in 2023</a> - a $69 billion deal that has necessitated the departure of about 2,550 staff to date.
</p>
<p>
"For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work," Xbox chief Phil Spencer explained to Microsoft employees in an internal memo, sent this week and obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>. "As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming - mostly corporate and supporting functions - to organize our business for long term success." US people let go will be supported "with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition" while the layoff terms will vary outside the US according to location.
</p>
<p>
"With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs," the memo continues. "Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games." Spencer doesn't specify which games have been "impacted", but he does add that "no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today." 
</p>
<p>
The Acti-Blizz merger appears to have done reasonably well for Microsoft as a whole. According to the company's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">most recent quarterly results</a>, gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, albeit with "48 points of net impact" from the acquisition. I don't quite understand what a "point of net impact" is, and I'm not convinced anybody else reporting on this story does either. But the upshot is that Microsoft executives continue to feel the need to trim the books. Back in May, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced the closures</a> of Prey developers Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developers Tango Gameworks, though Tango and Hi-Fi Rush were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">rescued by Krafton</a> in an 11th hour deal.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">one unofficial tracker</a>, there have been over 11,000 games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> in 2024 so far. If you're one of the people affected by this week's reductions, best of luck with it all.

Episode five is one of the more potent examples of the prequel series setting the stage for events that take place in both <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, weaving together plot threads that felt like they were blowing in the breeze for the last few weeks. <strong>Spoilers to follow!</strong><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Episode five begins with dwarf king Durin using the ring bestowed upon him by the elves to find where to dig in order to restore the sun shafts to Khazad-dûm, which collapsed a few episodes back, threatening the city’s livelihood. He doggedly insists that the dwarves dig into a foundational wall, which immediately gives way to a massive ray of sunlight, justifying what his own son believed to be an act of folly. As the episode progresses, it becomes more and more clear that the ring is negatively affecting Durin, causing him to become angrier and more paranoid, and to enact a city-wide tax called, simply, the Ring Tax. His son, concerned with how much his father has changed, heads to Eregion to ask Celebrimbor what the hell kinda demon shit he put into this ring, but not before we see how Durin’s doggedness will lead to Khazad-dûm’s, well, doom. </p><p>You see, years ago, Durin set restrictions on how far down the dwarves could dig for a variety of structural and logical reasons. But thanks to the ring’s dark urges, he wants to ignore those restrictions and dig deeper into the mountain’s rock. Any self-respecting <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan knows what happens soon after, and the episode gifts us with ominous growls just in case you forgot: The dwarves will soon awaken a Balrog that will destroy the kingdom of Khazad-dûm, also known as Moria. The same Balrog that the Fellowship of the Ring encounters when cutting through those mines to get to Mordor. </p><p>In another bit of foreshadowing, soon after Durin demands the dwarves dig wherever he says, we see the elves putting the finishing touches on a magical door that will be installed at one of the entryways to Khazad-dûm. Known as “Durin’s Door,” it can only be visible in the light of the moon, and can only be opened with a password told “to friends.” These are the very same glowing doors that the Fellowship struggles to get past in the first <em>Lord of the Rings</em>—though they eventually open after Frodo (or, in the books, Gandalf) figures out the password. </p><p>Along with the imminent demise of the dwarves of Khazad-dûm, episode 5 also lays out a path for the fall of Middle-earth’s men to the allure of Sauron’s rings. Still disguised as an elf, Sauron convinces Celebrimbor (after much deception and gaslighting) to create nine more rings for men, despite the latter’s concerns about the quality of their character. We know that men will not be able to resist the dark allure of the rings (Isildur fell victim to their power, and Boromir nearly did as well), and as the episode flits back and forth between the elves, dwarves, and humans of Númenor, we see why—many Numenorians, still reeling from the recent coup against Queen Miriel, are being persecuted by the new king’s men, who are callous and careless of the people’s religious beliefs. A surprise death hammers a message home: Men are capable of great cruelty, but so are dwarves, and so are elves, despite their holier-than-thou stance. <em>The Rings of Power</em> finally feels like it’s crafting a cogent tale of how Middle-earth came to be so broken. </p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season two episode six airs September 19 on Amazon Prime. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Xbox Game Pass Ultimate has risen from $16.99 to $19.99 a month and still includes all the typical benefits, but the Xbox Game Pass Standard tier is quite different from its predecessor.</p><p>It replaces Game Pass for Console (though those already subscribed don't have to upgrade) and includes significantly less benefits. Subscribers no longer gain access to day one titles or access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library. Microsoft said players would also be denied access to "specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library," and that list has now been revealed to be fairly extensive.</p><p>A total of 41 games are now available only through Game Pass Ultimate for new subscribers, including the aforementioned <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-single-player-campaign-review">Modern Warfare 3</a>, Starfield, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-review">Diablo 4</a> but also Forza Motorsport, MLB: The Show 24, Octopath Traveler 2, Payday 3, Age of Mythology: Retold, and more. The full list is available below, courtesy of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-standard-for-console-players-now-available-day-1-games-excluded-listed-in-op.977379/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a> user vixolus who collated the list.</p><p>Players subcscribing to Game Pass Standard therefore have access to 370 games instead of 508, according to the Xbox <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games?msockid=249860a8b69c69cd04507476b72a6813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. The remaining 96 titles belong to the EA Play library, which is not included in Xbox Game Pass Standard. Players looking to access this additional library of heavy hitters will need to pay $19.99 a month for Ultimate instead of $14.99 a month for Standard.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/microsoft-announces-xbox-games-pass-subscription-service">Xbox Game Pass arrived in 2017 at just $9.99 a month</a> with all features included, though in 2024 it does have significantly more games, not to mention <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-zenimax-acquisition-officially-complete-bethesda-now-a-part-of-xbox">access to Bethesda</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-just-bought-activision-blizzard-for-69-billion-so-whats-next">Activision Blizzard titles</a> such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review">the incoming Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p><h2>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Games Not on Xbox Game Pass Standard (Not Including the EA Play Library)</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Age of Mythology: Retold Standard Edition</li><li>Another Crab's Treasure</li><li>Botany Manor</li><li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</li><li>Core Keeper</li><li>Creatures of Ava</li><li>Diablo 4</li><li>Dungeons Of Hinterberg</li><li>Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes</li><li>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</li><li>Flock</li><li>Forza Motorsport</li><li>Galacticare</li><li>Go Mecha Ball</li><li>Harold Halibut</li><li>Hauntii</li><li>Heavy Weapon</li><li>Humanity</li><li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</li><li>Little Kitty, Big City</li><li>Magical Delicacy</li><li>MLB: The Show 24</li><li>Neon White</li><li>Octopath Traveler 2</li><li>Open Roads</li><li>Payday 3</li><li>PlateUp!</li><li>Robin Hood - Sherwood Builders</li><li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends</li><li>Sea of Solitude</li><li>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</li><li>Slime Rancher 2</li><li>SpiderHeck</li><li>Star Trucker</li><li>Starfield</li><li>Still Wakes the Deep</li><li>Tchia</li><li>The Case of the Golden Idol</li><li>The Rewinder</li><li>Turnip Boy Robs a Bank</li><li>You Suck at Parking Complete Edition</li></ul><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

In his memo, below, Spencer makes it clear that the cuts are related to the acquisition.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/spencer-1724249575303-1726137427625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox boss Phil Spencer speaking at gamescom 2024.

As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming — mostly corporate and supporting functions — to organize our business for long term success.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is difficult news to hear.  We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the U.S., we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the U.S. packages will differ according to location.</blockquote><blockquote>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</blockquote><blockquote>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><p>These cuts follow the already eye-watering <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 layoffs Microsoft made to its gaming business</a> earlier this year, and continue the video game industry's torrid time of late. Microsoft closed Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin as part of those cuts. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">Speaking to IGN in June</a>, Spencer said: "I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>While Spencer has insisted Microsoft's video game franchise "are getting stronger", and Xbox console players "are as high this year as they’ve ever been,” the gaming business is now bringing a number of its games to rival platforms, including PlayStation 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up). Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said that Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is rolling out a new PS5 system software update that adds a "new personalized space" to the console's UI in the form of the Welcome Hub, plus more besides.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub replaces the Explore tab, which was previously exclusive to US PlayStation users. Sony says it's rolling out "globally over the next few weeks", and select players in the US will get the new hub today.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub lets you customize your home screen with widgets including accessory battery levels, trophies, and online friends, plus "many more". It comes with a range of presets you can use to quickly switch your widget layout, and you can arrange and resize widgets, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=iOTcJgmC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=TVCa62KY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new PS5 update brings with it a brand new Welcome Hub that's packed with widgets.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hankering for a return to the old days of PS4 wallpaper, you'll be pleased to know you can also change your Welcome Screen's background, and you can even use one of your own screenshots if you want.</p>
<p>According to Sony, US players will get the Welcome Hub update first, followed by Japanese players, then European gamers, and finally everyone else around the world. Hold tight, it's coming!</p>
<p>It's not just the Welcome Hub, though. The new Party Share feature is also getting a phased release with this update, and it'll let you send PS5 party chat links via any social media or messaging app thanks to the magic of QR codes.</p>
<p>Other new features rolling out as part of this PS5 update include personalized headphone and earbud 3D audio profiles, Remote Play settings for individual users, and adaptive controller charging (although only for selected models).</p>

<p>News of this update comes just a couple of days after Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">announced</a> the PS5 Pro, a mid-generation refresh console that features improved technical performance and increased storage capacity.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is one of two PS5 models that can take advantage of adaptive controller charging, alongside the Slim models that were introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season">towards the end of last year</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a full breakdown of everything that's coming with the new PS5 system software update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>. Elements of the update roll out today, and a phased global rollout will take place over the next few weeks. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft to Lay Off Hundreds More Staff From Gaming Division]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-to-lay-off-hundreds-more-staff-from-gaming-division.978837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has announced that it will lay off around 650 more employees from its gaming division, with those affected mostly working in "corporate and supporting functions" across Microsoft Gaming.</p>
<p>According to an internal email sent to Microsoft employees by gaming head Phil Spencer (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via Game File</a>), the cuts are part of Microsoft's strategy of "aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business".</p>
<p>Game File cites "a source familiar with the matter" as saying that the cuts will mostly be focused on Activision Blizzard. According to Game File's Stephen Totilo, Spencer framed news of the layoffs in the context of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">last year's record-breaking Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=UYesjG-j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-microsoft-layoffs.jpg?itok=rKeQtMji 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The most recent Microsoft layoffs are apparently focused on Activision Blizzard.</figcaption></figure><p>In his email, Spencer says this round of layoffs won't result in any "games, devices, or experiences" being cut, which puts it in direct contrast to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">January's</a> Microsoft layoffs. That wave of cuts apparently resulted in "at least one game project at Blizzard" being cut, per Totilo.</p>
<p>According to another of Totilo's sources, no Xbox business unit leaders or gaming teams will be cut as part of these layoffs either. That means we won't be seeing any further studio closures akin to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shock shutdown of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a>, at least not for now.</p>
<p>Spencer closes his email by saying that while news of the layoffs may be "challenging", he has faith that Microsoft can "come together and show one another care and kindness".</p>
<p>These layoffs are part of an industry trend that has spanned the last couple of years, and it's not just Microsoft that's been affected, either. Companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">Sony</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">Take-Two</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">EA</a> have been affected, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">smaller indie studios</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-layoffs-immortals-of-aveum.jpg?itok=4YAn1X3J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-layoffs-immortals-of-aveum.jpg?itok=Dw7GoMVX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft isn't the only company to be hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>The layoff wave has also seen a number of major studios closed, including&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition">Volition</a> and (reportedly)&nbsp;<em>Elex&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Gothic&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report">Piranha Bytes</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Since the majority of today's Microsoft cuts appear to be focused on Activision Blizzard's corporate division, it's unlikely this will affect the company's plans for upcoming games, but I'm sure that's small comfort for the employees being let go. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Normally in gaming, a weapon getting Nerfed means that it will no longer be as useful or fun as it once was. But Bungie's new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-review/1900-6416758/" data-ref-id="1900-6416758">Destiny 2</a> Ace of Spades replica gun <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-ace-of-spades-hand-cannon-has-been-nerfed-but-not-that-way/1100-6526386/" data-ref-id="1100-6526386">is an actual working Nerf hand cannon</a>. Now, a Destiny 2 fan has come forward to accuse the company of using a design that lifted from their original artwork for the Ace of Spades Nerf gun that was posted online nearly a decade ago.</p><p>On social media, a user who goes by Tofu Bunny posted a link to their original artwork for the Ace of Spades Nerf gun from 2015 and placed images of that artwork side-by-side with the upcoming release. There are definitely some strong similarities between the two, almost on a one-to-one basis.</p><p>Tofu Bunny <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833861584424177681" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">later clarified their belief</a> that a third-party contractor may be responsible for the alleged design theft, rather than Bungie itself. Regardless, Tofu Bunny adds that the entire situation "feels like a punch in the gut. I've been playing this game for a decade and this just sucks."</p><p>Similar accusations have been leveled at Bungie before, but the company was quick to respond to Tofu Bunny in the message below. A Bungie spokesperson said that the studio is "investigating internally and with our partner" before noting that the company has reached out to Tofu Bunny as well.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Destiny2Team/status/1833988238912155813" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We are currently investigating internally and with our partner.

                <p>Microsoft has implemented another round of heavy cuts to its Xbox gaming team following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. In this latest round of layoffs, Microsoft is eliminating about 650 positions from its gaming team, but no additional studios have closed and no other games are canceled as a result of the move, which Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer confirmed on September 12. In January, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">Microsoft cut 1,900 gaming positions</a>, bringing the number of cuts to the company to about 2,550 since the $75.4 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed in October 2023.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff obtained by IGN</a>, Spencer said the cuts came as part of Microsoft's effort to align the company's "post-acquisition team structure and managing our business."</p><p>The approximately 650 layoffs from Microsoft Gaming "mostly" impact the "corporate and supporting" functions of the business, the company said. Affected staffers in the US are getting severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services. Packages for those outside of the US are available, too, and vary by location.</p><p>"With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs," Spencer said. "Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices, or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today."</p><p>In March, Spencer said the initial round of job cuts announced in January were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">necessary to help Xbox become a profitable business</a> following the blockbuster buyout of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In addition to laying off staff, Microsoft closed some of its studios entirely earlier this year, including Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, Roundhouse Games, and Alpha Dog Studios.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-families-officially-launches-out-of-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-launches-new-steam-families-household-game-sharing-tools">stint in beta</a>, Valve has opened up Steam Families to the wider public.</p>
<p>Steam Families replaces both Steam Family Sharing and Steam Family View, giving users a one stop shop to manage who can access what and when.</p>
<p>Up to five family members can be added to a user's Steam Family account, making for a total group of six maximum. These members can be managed from the Steam Client, mobile device or browser. Alas, it can't help you manage your children enough to get them to brush their teeth before bed, though.</p>

<p>Once a family group has been set up, members will then get access to the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family Sharing</li>
<li>Parental Controls</li>
<li>Child Purchase Requests</li>
</ul>
<p>"When you join a Steam Family, you automatically gain access to the shareable games that your family members own and they will also be able to access the shareable titles in your library," Valve explained. "The next time you log in to Steam, this new 'family library' will appear in the left column as a subsection of your games list. You maintain ownership of your current titles and when you purchase a new game it will still show up in your collection."</p>
<p>Users can still play games from the shared library even if another member is online playing another game. If there are multiple copies of the same game in the library, more than one member can play that game at one time.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The parental controls, meanwhile, will allow adults (Steam Family members are categorised as either an 'adult' or a 'child') to set limits for their small ones, such as what games they can play and when they can play them. Adults will also be able to monitor their children's activity (see image below).</p>
<p>These new parental control features let adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow access to appropriate games</li>
<li>Restrict access to the Steam Store, Community or Friends Chat</li>
<li>Set playtime limits (hourly/daily)</li>
<li>View playtime reports</li>
<li>Approve or deny requests from child accounts for additional playtime or feature access (temporary or permanent)</li>
<li>Recover a child's account if they lost their password</li>
</ul>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The last main feature arriving with Steam Families is a new payment option.</p>
<p>This option allows a child account within the family group to request an adult pays for their shopping basket of games. Once the adult approves their request, the purchase will be added to the child's account.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/purchase-approval-on-Steam.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a general point, if an adult leaves a Steam Family, they will need to wait for at least one year from when they joined the previous family to create or join a new family. Adults can, however, "kick any family member out of the Steam Family".</p>

            <p>Game studio Odyssey Interactive is launching a playtest for its latest "crazy" project but it may not even release if players aren't into it.</p>
<p>Byte Breakers, as it's currently known, is a 40-player Smash Bros-style Battle Royale. The studio shared a look at gameplay on social media alongside the playtest announcement.</p>
<p>However, this is one of many prototypes the studio has developed as it aims to "find a blend of genres that you haven't seen before, because as a studio we'd rather try something crazy and fail than just make a game that you feel that you've already played".</p>

<p>The game tease features colourful cartoon characters battling it out on floating platforms, but the camera eventually pans out to show huge arenas with tonnes of players fighting together.</p>
<p>"We hope you can see the potential," said the studio, admitting the footage is still early days. "We envision that by taking aspects of the multi-team environment, big open map, power progression, information asymmetry and just general strategic decision making of BRs, smashing those together with solid fundamentals from Smash, we can let players have wild experiences that they'd never find in a straight-up platform fighter.</p>
<p>"Parts of it will feel familiar, but we hope that as a whole it's a new experience."</p>
<p>The studio concluded: "We trust you and we trust your feedback".</p>

<p>The prototype follows the previous game from Odyssey Interactive, the "footbrawl" game Omega Strikers, but now it aims to develop the platform fighter genre and welcomes comparisons to Nintendo's iconic series.</p>
<p>It's certainly a bold move to launch a prototype that may never receive a full release, but more and more developers are looking to early access to gather feedback from players.</p>
<p>And when releases like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Sony's Concord are removed from sale weeks after release</a>, perhaps an initial playtest before fully committing is a wise idea.</p>
<p>Byte Breakers is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/">available to playtest now over on Steam</a>. Will you be checking it out?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Another set of sweeping layoffs are hitting Microsoft’s gaming business, with 650 employees being made redundant across Xbox, Bethesda and Activision Blizzard. The news comes via an internal memo sent by Xbox boss Phil Spencer to staff.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Made public by IGN</a>, Spencer explains that the impact will mainly be felt in the corporate and support function positions, “to organize our business for long term success.” He also stated that “No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.”</p>


<p>All those being laid off in the US will receive severance pay, extended healthcare and outplacement services. The package will differ in other countries.</p>
<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">layoffs at the start of 2024</a>, Microsoft has now cut 2,550 jobs since it acquired Activision Blizzard in late 2023. That acquisition had led to the company’s gaming workforce suddenly ballooning up to around 22,000 people at the end of last year, and with years of acquisitions that had brought multiple separate publishing arms and labels together, some kind of layoffs and restructuring were pretty much inevitable. Those earlier layoffs, however, saw the announced closure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Tango Gameworks</a> – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">since rescued</a> – and Arkane Austin, and the spin off of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>.</p>
<p>There’s been a terrible toll taken on the staff of the games industry over the last couple years, as economic sands have shifted and company leadership decide to make job cuts. We wish all those affected by this latest round of layoffs all the best in finding new work.</p>

<p>Here’s Spencer’s full email to staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming — mostly corporate and supporting functions — to organize our business for long term success.</p>
<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the U.S., we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the U.S. packages will differ according to location.</p>
<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>
<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>
<p>Phil</p></blockquote>

			<p>Microsoft is cutting another 650 jobs in its gaming division, Stephen Totilo <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=148802913&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=5eh0e&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in today's Game File newsletter. The article includes a quote from an internal email sent this morning to employees by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer:</p>
<p><em>As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</em></p>
<p>This time around, no games, devices, or experiences will be affected by the job cuts. That wasn't the case with the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mass layoffs of 1,900 employees</a> across Xbox, Activision Blizzard, and Bethesda, which resulted in the cancellation of Odyssey, Blizzard's survival game based on a brand new IP.</p>
<p>It has been a year of layoffs across the whole industry. On January 22, Riot Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that 530 staff members had been laid off. <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-lays-off-8-of-playstation-workforce-london-studio-closed-guerrilla-naughty-dog-insomniac-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-lays-off-5-of-its-employees-cancels-star-wars-respawn-fps-and-seeks-to-move-away-from-licensed-ips/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electronic Arts</a> followed suit in late February, removing 900 and 670 employees, respectively. On the occasion, Sony also shut down the London studio that was making a modern fantasy online cooperative action game.</p>
<p>In March, SEGA <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> Relic Entertainment and laid off around 240 employees across its European teams. The following month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-lays-off-5-of-its-workforce-cancels-some-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Take-Two's turn</a> to reduce its workforce by 5% and shut down OlliOlli developer Roll7 and Intercept Games, canceling some unannounced games in the process.</p>
<p>The bad news kept coming with Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shutting down</a> three studios in May, including Arkane Austin (Dishonored, Prey, Redfall) and Tango Gameworks (The Evil Within, Ghostwire: Tokyo, and Hi-Fi Rush), while Roundhouse Studios got folded into ZeniMax Online. Tango Gameworks (or what was left of it anyway, since about half of the employees had already found employment elsewhere) was subsequently <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> by Krafton in August alongside the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>
<p>We would like to believe this latest round of Microsoft layoffs will be the final news of this kind we report this year, but there's a solid chance that won't be the case.</p>

            <p>
Sometimes we play video games to plunder the silty depths of our emotions, sometimes we play them to sharpen our wits and try the alchemy of engrossing systems, sometimes we play them to mud-wrestle with questions of power and responsibility, and sometimes we just want to wear cool sunglasses, have big arms, and fly around hitting stuff very hard.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Undefeated is a free open world homage to Superman and superheroes at large, created by three students from Vantan Game Academy, Osaka. Released on Steam in 2019, it's just received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1116960/view/4585315413748320015?l=english">a chunky-ish update</a> alongside a surprise launch on PS5.
</p>
<p>
If you missed it back in 2019, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116960/UNDEFEATED/">Steam store page</a>, and here's a quick list of things you can do in Undefeated:
</p>
<p>
- Fly real fast with streaky lines and break the sound barrier
</p>
<p>
- Do a superhero one-knee landing 
</p>
<p>
- Ricochet between big mechy things, punching them
</p>
<p>
- Lift up big rocks
</p>
<p>
- Put out fires by clapping your hands (you don't have a copyright on the concept of wind, Dr Banner!)
</p>
<p>
- Do QTE counters on supervillains, then combo them like in Dragon Ball
</p>
<p>
- Chop your hands to do energy attacks while strafing
</p>
<p>
- Pose magnificently while soldiers shoot their wimpy little bullets at you
</p>
<p>
- Fly through hoops, Superman's greatest nemesis
</p>
<p>
- Rank up and get new powers, a bit
</p>
<p>
As of the update, it looks like you can also do heat rays from your eyes. There's also a new map event to experience, possibly related to those heat rays. Undefeated Man might have all the visual flavour and idiosyncracy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz8ssH7LiB0">the square hole</a>, but he certainly has a few tricks up his sleeve. On the technical side, the update adds support for 4K resolution (3840x2160) and WQHD resolution (2560x1440).
</p>
<p>
I doubt Undefeated will keep you occupied for longer than, oh, let's say 10 minutes, but it's well-made for what it is, and importantly, doesn't pretend to be anything more. Those who pine for noughties superpower fantasies like Prototype might get a real kick out of it. Also, people who pine for an actually decent official Superman game, which will absolutely never happen. Sorry, Clarkies and Kenters, but this particular comicbook property is clearly cursed. The best we'll ever get is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/injustice-2">Injustice</a>.
</p>
<p>
The developers are working on a paid sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088020/">Undefeated: Genesis</a>, which transports the proceedings to a big alien world full of mutants. In a scandalous flourish, the new incarnation of the protagonist has a spiky fringe and doesn't wear sunglasses. Beyond that, it looks a bit like an early prototype for BioWare's Anthem.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ps5s-latest-system-update-introduces-welcome-hub-party-share-and-more-features/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PS5 has just announced a new software update that will introduce a host of new features for the console. These include the Welcome Hub, Party Share, Personalized 3D Audio Profiles, Adaptive Charging and Remote Play for individual users.&nbsp;</p>







<p>Welcome Hub is a new way players can personalize their home screen on the PS5. In the United States, this Hub will replace the current Explore Tab. Players can customize the Hub with various widgets, including console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and more. Additionally, the size and layout of the widgets are adjustable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can also set custom backgrounds for the Welcome Hub, which can be from various in-house designs or the console’s media gallery. Welcome Hub will roll out globally through a PS5 software update in the coming weeks. It is available for limited players in the United States <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting today</a>.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Party Share is another feature that will be phased in and released globally in the coming weeks. This feature allows players to share party voice chat links on any messaging or social media app, allowing them to invite friends from whichever platform they are chatting on. The friend can use the link even if they aren’t on your friends list on the PlayStation Network.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players can create a party link through the Control Center on the PS5, generating a QR code that can be sent to friends. Along with the PS5, the PlayStation App will receive an update in the coming weeks, allowing players to create a party link from their phones.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-unlikely-to-run-at-60-fps-on-the-playstation-5-pro-if-rockstar-is-targeting-30-fps-on-the-base-model.978780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite its increased power over the original mode, the PlayStation 5 Pro may not be able to run the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI at 60 frames per second for a few reasons.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts">IGN</a>, Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter revealed that the new console's CPU, which is the same one that powers the base PS5, could prevent the system from running the game at 60 frames per second if Rockstar Games is targeting 30 FPS on the base model. Most entries in the series have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, and this is why each one of them initially ran at 30 FPS or lower.</p>
<p>This is not to say that Grand Theft Auto VI won't look better on the PlayStation 5 Pro than on the base model. According to the Digital Foundry expert, the console will offer higher-quality visuals thanks to its considerable GPU improvements over the base model and could definitely deliver more stable performance, as the console's CPU, while the same as that of the regular PlayStation 5, received a 10% bump to clock speeds.</p>
<p>As Rockstar Games has only briefly discussed Grand Theft Auto VI and shown it off in only one trailer, it's definitely too early to say if the game will target 30 FPS on the base PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, and it may be a while before we hear more about the matter. As of now,<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-not-delayed/"> the game hasn't been delayed</a>, but its scale and complexity may cause a delay down the line and make it slip to 2026, something that could delay future reveals as well.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches late next year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

<p>Xbox’s Phil Spencer has announced in an internal email to staff that Microsoft will lay off approximately 650 people from its gaming team.</p>



<p>The news comes from Stephen Totilo from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a>, which Insider Gaming has been able to independently verify.</p>



<p>The full email reads,</p>



<p><strong>Subject: Changes to Microsoft Gaming</strong></p>



<p>“For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming—mostly corporate and supporting functions—to organize our business for long term success.</p>



<p>I know that this is difficult news to hear. We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the US, we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the US packages will differ according to location.</p>



<p>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</p>



<p>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</p>
