		<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone is getting a new Enhanced Edition, taking the 2024 console port and further enhancing it to take advantage of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and modern PC hardware. STALKER: Legends of the Zone – Enhanced Edition is launching next week on 20th May.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone – Enhanced Edition gives the original trilogy of STALKER games – Shadow of Chornobyl (2007), Clear Sky(2008), and Call of Prypiat (2009) – a visual spruce with upgraded visuals, optimisations specific to newer consoles and mod support. The 2024 Legends of the Zone port previously ran in backward compatibility on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles, so this is GSC Game Worlds spreading their wings with more specific support.&nbsp;Additionally, where Legends of the Zone wasn’t released on PC last year, it is now getting a PC version with these same enhancements.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, and global illumination for a more immersive atmosphere.</li>
<li>Upscaled textures and detailed 3D models for NPCs, weapons, and environments.</li>
<li>Advanced shaders for water and wetness effects, paired with upgraded skyboxes for a more dynamic world.</li>
<li>4K pre-rendered cinematics for dramatic storytelling and improved weapon FOV for better combat visibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>On consoles, you now have the following graphics modes.</p>

<p>Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 5 Pro:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality (native 4K/30 FPS)</li>
<li>Balanced (upscaled 4K/40 FPS)</li>
<li>Performance (upscaled 4K/60 FPS)</li>
<li>Ultra Performance (upscaled 2K/120 FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p>Xbox Series S:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality (native 2K/30 FPS)</li>
<li>Balanced (upscaled 2K/40 FPS)</li>
<li>Performance (1080p/60 FPS)</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(“2K” seemingly refers to 1440p)</em></p>
<p>There’s also keyboard and mouse support, and Mod.io integration to allow for mod sharing across both PC and consoles.</p>
<p>On PC, the trilogy is now Steam Deck optimised, there’s Steam Workshop integration, cloud saves and gamepad support.</p>
<p>For all existing owners, you’ll get a free upgrade. From the PS4 and Xbox One Legends of the Zone release last year, the Enhanced Edition on the respective current gen consoles will be free. Additionally, owners of the original STALKER games on PC get the Enhance Editions for free, and the same works in reverse as well – handy in case there’s any mod incompatibility that is introduced here.</p>
<p>STALKER: Legends of the Zone was a great way for console gamers to experience the original late noughties trilogy for the first time, ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2’s</a> release at the end of 2024. This Enhanced Edition looks to go further as a remaster, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/">we originally said of the console release</a>, “On the sliding scale of remasters, the Legends of the Zone Trilogy is more of a port rather than an attempt to give these games a total makeover. […] As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it-looks-like-a-riders-republic-movie-is-happening-for-some-reason.1189071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riders-republic-movie-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a movie based on Ubisoft's extreme sports racer&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and I'd love to meet literally anyone who asked for such a project.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie will be a co-production between French movie house Gaumont and Ubisoft, and it'll be directed by&nbsp;<em>Bad Boys: Ride or Die&nbsp;</em>helmsmen Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, colloquially known as Adil &amp; Bilall.</p>

<p>Writing duties on the project will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Stillwater&nbsp;</em>scribe&nbsp;Noé Debré, although it's not clear whether there will be any other writers on the movie or whether Debré will be the sole writer.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=bcAQTRwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riders-republic-movie-racing.jpg?itok=nBQyJQs3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Was a&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie in the cards for 2025 as far as you're concerned?</figcaption></figure><p>This won't be Ubisoft's first foray into multimedia; the company is currently gearing up for the release of Netflix animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em>, which is set to launch sometime later this year. Lest we forget, there's also 2023's Netflix series&nbsp;<em>Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</em>.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of video game movies in the works right now. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow">a movie</a> based on EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">hit multiplayer game</a>&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, as well as a movie based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow">horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>&nbsp;and an adaptation of Sega's racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow"><em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>Video games are also proving ripe territory for series adaptations. Amazon's wildly successful&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series, for instance, is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december" rel="nofollow">set to air its second season later this year</a>, and a third season has already been greenlit. HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, meanwhile, is partway through its second season at time of writing.</p>

<p>These shows join animated fare like Netflix's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">Devil May Cry</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>shows, as well as Prime Video's&nbsp;<em>Secret Level</em>, an anthology series with shorts based on properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Armored Core</em>, and, er,&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>.</p>




<p>Naturally, the&nbsp;<em>Riders Republic&nbsp;</em>movie doesn't have a release date yet, and we don't know who's attached to star in it either. It's likely we'll learn more about the project in the coming months, but don't expect it to arrive in cinemas for a while.</p>

These include two of the most critically acclaimed titles of the year so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/boundary-pushing-co-op-adventure-split-fiction-nears-4-million-sales"><u>Split Fiction</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-2-million-copies-sold-after-12-days-on-sale"><u>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</u></a>, which have sold over 4 million and 2 million copies respectively so far this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a pattern that both Mafia: The Old Country – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-tells-a-story-that-doesnt-require-a-massive-time-commitment-publisher-sets-price-at-50-and-announces-release-date"><u>recently revealed to cost $50 when it launches on August 8</u></a> – and FBC: Firebreak will be hoping to continue.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">FBC: Firebreak - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Launching on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-remedys-co-op-fps-set-in-the-world-of-control-has-a-release-date"><u>June 17, 2025 and costing $39.99/£32.99</u></a> (as well as on both Game Pass and PS Plus), Firebreak is looking towards this newly emerging mid-tier space between wildly budgeted AAA games and indies to find its success. It’s a notion that Kayatta explained to IGN:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>I read somebody describe this recently in a very eloquent way as game developers building cathedrals competing to build these more and more complex, beautiful, expensive things," Kayatta said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And it's gotten to the point where you've got a lot of games that cost half a billion dollars to make. And then, of course, when you get into marketing and promotion, I mean, the amount of money involved is staggering. And that can produce some incredible, incredible experiences that I am very thankful exist, but only some of those can exist, and everyone can't compete in that space."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kayatta continued: “And then on the other side, you've got all of these incredible indie developers. Everything from Inscryption to Stardew Valley to Blue Prince feel like they come out of nowhere and light the world on fire. But then I do think we're seeing that emergence of that middle ground now of, it's messy to call it AA, right? But it is something kind of new. It’s not quite God of War Ragnarok or GTA 6, but it's also something more than a Slay the Spire. And that's not a comment on either end of those spectrums. Those are fantastic games, but it does feel like there is something kind of emerging in the middle, at least to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If it's the future, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say in the sense that it implies that that's where all games need to go, but this idea of a responsible team size, a responsible budget, a responsible amount of time to develop a game, just get it out there, make something that respects player time and don't try to overcharge and don't try to be greedy with time. I do think there's a space for it, and we're trying to touch on it with this game.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That respect for players’ time and money goes hand-in-hand with Remedy’s all-in-one approach to Firebreak. This is a game you pay once for and get everything for that $40. The idea of a free-to-play model was something never even entertained by the team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of that has to do with reducing FOMO (the fear of missing out), which I think has kind of infected a lot of modern games," stated Kayatta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And by the way, that's not a blanket statement. I think a lot of games are able to use FOMO to be exciting. So I'm just saying that for this game in particular, it didn't work for us, but it's not just about monetization, I think it's about the value that the game has. So one example would be, I don't know if you've ever played Path of Exile, for example, and you open up that skill tree and you see 10,000 things that you're going to be able to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And for a type of person, they're really excited, like look at that depth and look how many hours I've got, all these other things. And then for another type of person, they're looking at that saying, 'I will never extract the value from this game even if I want to.' And even if those devs, and this is no longer a comment about Path of Exile, which I love by the way, even if you say, 'Well, but you don't have to interact with those systems, you can still have fun.' That may be true, but the minute you see those systems exist, you're instantly put into that frame of reference where you say, 'There is something that I'm not getting from this, and that just feels bad.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So for us, we wanted to make sure that the game, both from the way we monetize it, we don't do daily check-ins, timed battle passes, all that other stuff that dictates your time. There's that side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But the other side, too, is that we don't want to present a game that feels so complex, like, oh, if you don't come back and do six more sessions, you're not going to be able to do this, and progression's important. You feel like you're accomplishing something over time. So we definitely have that, and we definitely wanted to have a strong meta game, but we also just wanted to keep things feeling like, you know what? I get as much out of this as I want at any given time, and at any given moment, I have the complete experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firebreak will be hoping to capture both fans of Remedy’s uniquely weird work and fans of co-op shooters alike when it launches on June 17.

Today, those aspirations went up in digital smoke, as Square Enix has announced that Missing Link will no longer be released.</p><p dir="ltr">Official Kingdom Hearts Missing Link social media accounts announced the cancellation of the game, which was first announced in 2022 as a "GPS-based action RPG for iOS and Android." The official statement also offered "heartfelt apologies to everyone who has been looking forward to the release."</p><p dir="ltr">"Although we worked hard on developing and adjusting the game in the hope that it would be enjoyed by lots of players," the statement reads, "we determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development."</p><p dir="ltr">The announcement also confirmed that "the Kingdom Hearts series will continue," while also mentioning that "the team is hard at work on Kingdom Hearts 4."

			<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most successful games to launch this year. Despite being available on Game Pass from day one, the JRPG developed by Sandfall Interactive has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-bored-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">managed to sell more than two million units</a>. Considering that its budget was certainly not as large as a regular triple-A game, its success is already guaranteed.</p>
<p>It may even get bigger by adding a new platform like the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 console. In a video interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M14dRaYeAHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with French YouTuber mistermtv</a>, as translated by MP1st, Sandfall Interactive CEO and Game Director Guillaume Broche said that the great sales have changed the perspective, and that the idea was 'interesting'.</p>
<p><em>Well, at this point, considering the success of the game, it kind of changes everything. So clearly, it’s too early to say, but we’re kind of in a situation where… let’s say there are a lot of opportunities showing up — way too many at once — and we’re figuring out what we’ll go for and what we won’t. But yeah, it’s definitely something that could be interesting.</em></p>
<p>A turn-based JRPG like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 could indeed resonate very well with the Nintendo audience, which would get access to a fantastic game, as outlined <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</em></p>
<p>The game is powered by Unreal Engine 5, but it's not one of the heaviest titles made with Epic's technology. The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware could likely run it. Whether that means Sandfall Interactive and publisher Kepler Interactive actually make the port remains to be seen.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-enhanced-edition-comes-to-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>GSC Game World has announced STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy - Enhanced Edition, an updated version of the first three STALKER games it previously released on <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-leaked-will-bring-the-series-to-consoles-in-june/">PS4 and Xbox One,</a> now coming to PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC next week on <strong>May 20, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>The new current-gen version of the remasters includes better lighting with godrays, screen space reflections, upscaled textures and environments, advanced shaders, and cutscenes that have been pre-rendered in 4K to add to the storytelling. For console players, though, the catch to all that is you'll see as much of these upgrades as the graphics mode you pick will allow.</p>
<p>Playing on PS5, PS5 Pro, or Xbox Series X consoles, players can select between four graphics modes. Quality, Balanced, Performance and Ultra Performance. The first three are all set at a 4K resolution, with the frame rate caps being the only variable. Quality runs at 4K/30fps, Balanced runs at 4K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 4K/60fps. Ultra Performance sets the resolution down to 2K to reach 120fps.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Legends of the Zone — Enhanced Edition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVWkOx4Cj6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Xbox Series S players have Quality, Balanced, and Performance modes to choose from, though none of those modes have any of the three STALKER games running at 4K. Quality mode on Series S runs at 2K/30fps, Balanced runs at 2K/40fps, and Performance mode runs at 1080p/60fps.</p>
<p>Obviously, PC players don't have to deal with all of that and can more manually adjust graphical settings based on the hardware they have available to them, but there are still a few improvements PC players can look forward to. Such as the games now being optimized for Steam Deck, and support for cloud saves.</p>
<p>Current-gen console players will also be able to plug in a keyboard and mouse, if they want, with KBM support coming in this new version. GSC Game World has also confirmed that the PS5 and Xbox Series versions will have Mod.io support, so they can enjoy some of the modding fun that is usually only accessible on PC.</p>
<p>The best part about this new Enhanced Edition is that anyone who has already purchased any of the remasters in the STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy will get the corresponding enhanced edition for <strong>free</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>release date, with the updated versions of all three classic shooters coming to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</p>

<p>Back in December, it was revealed that the long-awaited next-gen update for&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-roadmap-legends-of-zone-next-gen-2025" rel="nofollow">would arrive in 2025</a>, and now we have a concrete release date: May 20th.</p>

<p>All three games will receive significant enhancements across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, including visual and performance improvements, gameplay tweaks to bring the games "more in line with current game practices", and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=iJEWmIrK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date-gameplay.jpg?itok=dESfbHaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>comes to PC and current-gen consoles next week.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, GSC Game World has also <a href="https://www.stalker-game.com/en/faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed the PC specs</a> you're going to need if you want to run the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>trilogy, and they're significantly beefed up compared to the original games, as you'd expect.</p>

<p>Running the games at 1440p and 60fps will require a GTX 1070 Ti and a Core i5-6600K or equivalent, while 4K at 60fps will need an RTX 2080 Ti and Core i7-6700K or AMD's version of the same.</p>

<p>On the plus side, if you already happen to own the original three&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games on PC, you will receive the&nbsp;<em>Legends of the Zone&nbsp;</em>enhancements as a free upgrade. It's not just visual updates, either; you're also getting extras like controller support and Steam achievements.</p>

<p>However, it's worth bearing in mind that the new versions of the game won't support mods created for the old versions. Still, these enhanced versions won't be replacing the originals in storefronts, and there's every chance modders will create new mods for the enhanced editions.</p>




<p><em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone - Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on May 20th. You can buy all three games separately or together as a bundle, and console players also won't have to pay for the upgrade.</p>

            <p>Surreal first-person medical sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> will be different from its plague-ridden predecessor in a lot of ways. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> you played a roaming surgeon rooting around in bins for sustenance, and this time you play as the Bachelor, a well-fed doctor who diagnoses patients by inspecting their bodies and investigating their homes for signs of disease. But one of the biggest changes regards the open world. You won't freely explore the remote steppe town this time, but instead dander through isolated pockets, with lots of loading screens, map plotting, and fast travel. That's made a few fans grumpy, but developers Ice-Pick Lodge are sticking to their plans, as they've stated in a development update.</p>

<p>You'll know how town traversal works if you've played the demo for this sequel, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3389330/Pathologic_3_Quarantine/?curator_clanid=7802587">Pathologic 3: Quarantine</a> (or if you've read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">our hands-on impressions</a> of the demo). Basically, you walk through particular archways and get confronted with a map screen. From here, you select a route and watch as your little dot makes its way through the city. In certain dangerous neighbourhoods, you're kicked out of this map screen and forced to make your way through the streets in the usual first-person mode once more, a handy revolver at your side to keep desperate muggers at bay. Once you get clear of that zone and find the exit arch, it's back to the map screen. </p>
<p>This is obviously very different from the freestyle wandering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and its recent spiritual successor Pathologic 2. Enough players of the demo left negative or skeptical feedback about it to prompt Ice-Pick Lodge to respond with a post that explains their reasoning.  </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"The main question after Quarantine: what’s up with the city?" said the devs in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3389330/view/521964845255362377">the post on Steam</a>. "Why couldn’t you move through it without loading screens? And how will that change in the full game? Why change a game where everything 'worked'?</p>
<p>"We know some players would’ve liked that just fine. But for us that wouldn’t be enough. Not creatively (there’s already a game about digging through Gorkhon’s trash cans), and not commercially: sequels to indie games statistically sell much worse than the originals, and we’re making a sequel to a sequel. Just repeating ourselves? That’s a dead end.</p>
<p>"But trying new things is in the studio’s DNA. And that led us to the idea of a new kind of game — about a person lost in time, with narrative structure and space-time torn to shreds. That presentation will stay. It’s a core part of the concept — it can’t be changed. (And technically, it can’t be reversed at this point.)"</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / HypeTrain Digital</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Essentially, they didn't want to simply make the same game again, and it'd be too much work to change direction now from a technical perspective. The studio also asked players of the prologue to remember it was just a demo, and that this railroaded tutorialised journey was only a "parade alley". The street-stalking segments will have more to them, they promise. For example, the player will see the effects of decrees and laws they make during the quarantine at street level. Ordering everyone to wash regularly will mean you really see some NPCs washing their hands as you pass by.  </p>
<p>Although the studio isn't budging on the splintering of that open world, they are looking into other changes. They admit that the survival meter of the hero's mental state is not well-balanced or well-explained (it's a meter that runs from apathy to mania and must be balanced by slurping drugs). And when it comes to some choppy performance issues, they're "planning for things to get much better". </p>
<p>The demo will be taken down at some point shortly before release, they say, with the team now moving all their attention to the full game. It's due to come out some time this year. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/665752/fbc-firebreak-preview-interview-remedy-control-ps5-xbox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Finnish studio Remedy is best known for its single-player action games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc">the survival horror of <em>Alan Wake</em></a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20832997/control-review-creators-thriller-ps4-xbox-pc">supernatural thriller<em> Control</em></a>. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/654718/fbc-firebreak-release-date-remedy-control"><em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, the developer is going in a different direction. It’s the studio’s first multiplayer release: a three-player co-op shooter set in the universe of <em>Control</em>. But while it won’t have the more traditional cinematic storytelling the studio has become known for, that doesn’t mean Remedy is abandoning its narrative roots. Instead, it is trying to explore them in a new genre. “This game actually has quite a bit of narrative design thinking in it, especially because there is not a lot of room for direct storytelling,” says game director Mike Kayatta.</p><p><em>Firebreak</em> is set a few years after the events of <em>Control</em>, after which a building known as the Oldest House — the NYC headquarters of the Federal Bureau of Control, a government organization that investigates the supernatural — was sealed off to prevent a deadly force called the Hiss from getting out. But there were still people inside. While many of them were FBC bureaucrats and office workers, <em>Firebreak</em> follows members of the titular emergency unit, who serve as the first responders keeping everyone else (relatively) safe. That means venturing out into the Oldest House to fix machinery, eradicate the Hiss, and investigate other paranormal situations. Also, there are a lot of sticky notes, and you have to shower quite a bit.</p><p>I was able to play through a few missions of <em>Firebreak</em> at Remedy’s offices, and the game feels very different from the studio’s previous work. It’s a first-person shooter that relies heavily on cooperation. In each mission, you and two other players are let loose in the Oldest House to complete specific goals; in one of them, we had to repair the machinery that controlled the building’s ventilation, and in another we had to clear away a growing wave of sticky notes that covered every surface. In some cases, the missions had multiple layers to them. After clearing out the sticky notes, for instance, we eventually fought our way to a gigantic boss monster made of even more stickies.</p><p>In some ways, <em>Firebreak</em> seems like a traditional multiplayer shooter. You can equip different types of guns, toss grenades, and you’re often up against hordes of the Hiss, which behave a lot like swarming zombies. As you progress, you earn currency to put toward upgrading your gear, and you can purchase new skins and sprays like in <em>Fortnite</em>. Each player also has to select a “crisis kit,” which includes both special abilities — like letting you jump high in the air — as well as specific tools. One has a wrench for repairing machines, while another has a hose for putting out fires.</p><p>In my brief experience, the game’s structure necessitated coordination. You can’t just run into the Oldest House, guns blazing, and expect to survive. Over voice chat, my team was constantly yelling directions and warnings at each other, giving a heads up that a fresh wave of Hiss was coming or sending the person with the right tool to repair something. Often, these repairs were life-or-death necessities. Scattered around each level were facilities to refill your ammo or shower (which removes status ailments and also replenishes your health), but they often lacked power, meaning you couldn’t get bullets or health until you got them up and running.</p><p>It was a chaotic mess (in a good way), but as with <em>Control</em>, what struck me most about <em>Firebreak</em> was the world itself. It’s just so delightfully weird, infusing a bland office space with a sinister tone. Office cubicles become cover in shootouts, while those sticky notes are like an invasive species, smothering everything — including you, if you can’t make it to a shower in time. Unlike <em>Control</em>, however, <em>Firebreak</em> is reliant almost entirely on its world to tell the story. There are no cutscenes to watch or audio logs to uncover. Instead, you sort out what’s happening by being in this place, and both listening to the little bits of chatter between characters and observing the state of the Oldest House. Or you can try to suss it out anyways, but I’m still not sure why a giant rubber duck started following me in one level.</p><p>Kayatta likens this storytelling technique to hearing stories from firefighters in the field. “We’re not telling a beginning to end story,” he explains. “A lot of that is because the people inside the game are talking to themselves, and they’re filling that narrative space for us.” The decision was made in part so as not to interrupt a bunch of friends playing together, letting you and your co-op partners fill in the space with your own chatter. But the structure is also designed to help <em>Firebreak</em> work for two audiences simultaneously: <em>Control</em> fans and newcomers.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Remedy Entertainment</cite></p></div><p>“The important thing for us is that if you played <em>Control</em>, you signed up for a single-player, exploration, character- and story-focused experience,” Kayatta says. “It was super important that we didn’t say, ‘Ha ha, curve ball, now you need to go find two friends and play a cooperative game that is a totally different genre from a different perspective.’ That feels terrible. Those people need to be protected so that they can go from <em>Control 1</em> to<em> Control 2</em> and experience the journey that we promised them. And we are absolutely going to make that happen. On the other hand, we also want this to be rewarding and fulfilling for them [if they do play <em>Firebreak</em>].”</p><p>Meanwhile, he says that “then you have what we hope is a large audience who actually has never played <em>Control</em>… we wanted to make sure that they could understand the world and didn’t feel the constant pressure to go back and play <em>Control</em>.” That means a balancing act between having enough narrative to be interesting to new players and feel distinctly Remedy, but without so much direct storytelling that<em> Firebreak</em> becomes required reading for anyone waiting to jump into <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300511/control-2-action-rpg"><em>Control</em>’s sequel</a>. And if you do want to dig further into things like the Hiss or what an Altered Item is, you can always play the original <em>Control</em> or dig into a Wiki (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">or maybe one day watch a movie or show</a>). When it comes to how much you want to dig into <em>Firebreak</em>’s narrative, Kayatta says that they “want it to be up to you.”</p><p>No matter which way you look at it, <em>Firebreak</em> is a big departure for Remedy. It’s a new genre, an expansion into multiplayer, and the studio’s first self-published game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/28/24085807/remedy-is-now-in-control">as it attempts to take more ownership of its own franchises</a>. It’s an opportunity to expand in a new direction while still attempting to stay true to what a Remedy game is. “Forever we have had these very controlled single-player experiences, and we will continue to do that,” Kayatta says. “But we ask the question with <em>Firebreak</em>: what is it like to share one of those spaces with your friends?”</p><p><sub>FBC: Firebreak <em>launches June 17th on PC, PS5, and Xbox. It’ll also be available for Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscribers.</em></sub> <em><sub>It will have<a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1922290737648894263"> a closed technical test starting on May 15th</a>.</sub></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a golden rule for pretty much all video games that let you indiscriminately kill NPCs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">Look at what happened with The Sims competitor inZoi earlier this year</a>, when players found they were able to run over children (the developer quickly patched it out and called it a bug).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, you can understand why a seemingly innocuous screenshot released for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> that looks like it shows a kid in-game has sparked so much speculation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The screenshot in question is of the Grassrivers section of GTA 6 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/gta-6/Grassrivers">we’ve got a whole page devoted to the area if you want to know more</a>). If you look closely at the bottom right-hand corner of the image, below, you can make out a few people sitting at an outside table. One of these people looks a lot smaller than the other two, so much so that observers are saying it’s a child.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/14/grassrivers-02-1747219300699.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Time to play Where's Waldo? with this GTA 6 screenshot.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This detail was picked up by X / Twitter account TheGTAVerse and their post has since gone viral, picking up over 1.5 million views.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">A kid spotted in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTAVI?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#GTAVI</a> screenshot 👀 <a href="https://t.co/pGjSuNn9yt" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/pGjSuNn9yt</a></p>— TheGTAVerse (@TheGTAVerse) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGTAVerse/status/1922008313551606253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that there is a <em>zero</em> chance that kids will be out and about in the GTA 6 game world, because that would mean you would be able to kill them, and that is a big no-no. GTA games are famous for letting you kill pretty much anyone in all manner of over-the-top ways. From simply beating a poor NPC to death with your bare hands to landing a plane on their head, GTA 6 will no-doubt ramp up the reckless NPC destruction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So no, this screenshot does not confirm you can kill children in GTA 6. It is a screenshot of GTA 6 over a year away from the game’s release date. It is a snapshot of the game at this moment, and nothing more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it is… odd to see what could be a child in a GTA 6 screenshot. If it is indeed a child. While most people do think it is a child, it could be a small adult, or there could be some sort of graphics effect at play here that makes what is an adult look smaller in this situation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of GTA 6 Trailer 2 and Rockstar's accompanying info-dump has sparked all sorts of speculation about what to expect from what is sure to be the biggest video game of all time. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-some-grand-theft-auto-fans-think-liberty-city-is-a-secret-location-in-gta-6">Some GTA fans even think Liberty  City may end up in GTA 6 either at launch or as post-launch DLC</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on GTA 6, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2">all the details we’ve discovered so far</a>, a roundup of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-70-brand-new-screenshots-reveal-the-characters-and-places-of-leonida">70 brand new screenshots</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-look-even-better-on-ps5-pro-experts-give-their-verdict">the expert opinion on how GTA 6 will look on PS5 Pro</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fbc-firebreak/" data-ref-id="5000-647734">FBC: Firebreak</a> is Remedy's first multiplayer game, and it's jumping into the well-occupied space of co-op PvE shooters. That means it has the benefit of looking to predecessors in the genre to understand what works, what doesn't, and in what ways Firebreak can stand out from the pack. I always love learning about which games developers looked to when making theirs, so I recently asked Remedy's Mike Kayetta, game director on FBC: Firebreak, to talk about the games the team looked at to help guide the scope and style of Remedy's upcoming shooter.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/" data-ref-id="5000-589428">Helldivers 2</a> was a big help, which makes sense given its popularity. Remedy observed how the team at Arrowhead was able to navigate the ups and downs of the ludicrous third-person shooter to somewhat inform best practices for a game like FBC: Firebreak. Kayetta told me that it helped when Remedy asked, "What's working for them, what's not working for them?". But it was far from the only such game the team looked at. Kayetta name-dropped several games that the team would play together for "analysis" in the studio. Many of them make perfect sense as soon as you learn them.</p><p dir="ltr">"If it's a session-based co-op shooter, we've played it into the ground," he said, listing off a parade of recent co-op games including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547394">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deep-rock-galactic/" data-ref-id="5000-460551">Deep Rock Galactic</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aliens-fireteam-elite/" data-ref-id="5000-527726">Aliens: Fireteam Elite</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-end-times-vermintide/" data-ref-id="5000-394441">Vermintide</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide/" data-ref-id="5000-516156">Darktide</a>. Like Helldivers 2, none of those were all that surprising, but one immediately stuck out the moment Kayetta said it. "We had some interesting additional reference points, too. We looked at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overcooked/" data-ref-id="5000-453001">Overcooked</a> quite a bit, because we wanted to see--like, that is such a fun type of chaos, where things get out of hand, but you still feel like you have meaningful agency despite things feeling out of hand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4492663"></a><figcaption>Remedy looked to the past of co-op successes and struggles to help shape its first multiplayer game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4492663-fbc_firebreak_hotfix_ess_20.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">His comments came after I'd played the game for quite a while that morning already, so I could see firsthand the shared DNA between Overcooked and Firebreak, but it was still surprising to hear the comparison out loud. Firebreak's elemental combat and class-based systems meant everyone had a role to play, and it was apparent when anyone in the group had broken that chain of responsibility--as apparent as leaving the burgers on the stove too long and starting a kitchen fire.</p><p dir="ltr">Funny enough, though the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/left-4-dead/" data-ref-id="5000-29417">Left 4 Dead</a>-like beats are clear, Kayetta said he doesn't recall the team ever playing that one together--for good reason, however. "Interestingly, it's one of those games that's so big and so famous that I don't feel like we actually played it as a team very often, because everyone just felt like they were already bringing the full wealth of experience and knowledge about it. And so I literally can't think of one time I played Left 4 Dead with anybody on the team. It's one of those games that's just in the DNA of gaming."</p><p dir="ltr">FBC: Firebreak arrives on June 17 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. It'll launch right on Game Pass Ultimate and PlayStation Plus Premium, too. Free updates will follow later this year, bringing more missions and cosmetics into the game, though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/" data-ref-id="1100-6531475">the game has taken some anti-FOMO steps</a> to keep players from feeling like the game is asking too much of their time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're coming to Remedy's multiplayer game as a lore chaser, here's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-fbc-firebreak-fits-into-the-remedy-connected-universe/1100-6531477/" data-ref-id="1100-6531477">how FBC: Firebreak fits into the Remedy Connected Universe.</a></p>
