                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2's launch this week</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reflected on the first Switch console in a new video. As Huang explained, Nintendo had an ambitious goal to create a gaming device that was "powerful enough" to run first-party games at home and still be small enough to be used while on the go.</p><p>"We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade, drawn together by a shared belief that technology should serve creativity, and that joy is worth engineering for," Huang said in a Nintendo Creator's Voice video, while also reflecting on late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's vision for the system.</p><p>"I still remember the day Iwata shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day."</p><p>According to Huang, the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip for the Switch took over "500 engineer years" to develop, and the company had to "reinvent everything" for the Switch 2. Huang added that it achieved three major breakthroughs on the Switch 2: full-hardware ray tracing, dedicated AI processors, and "ultra low power" through optimized semiconductor process technology for high performance. The Nvidia CEO claims that this has led to the most advanced graphics ever seen in a portable device.</p><p>The Switch 2 represents a major step forward for Nintendo in terms of graphics, as the hybrid console is capable of rendering games at up to 4K resolution and 60fps when docked. This means that some good-looking games will be coming to the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">like Cyberpunk 2077</a>. CD Projekt Red recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-cyberpunk-2077-to-run-on-switch-2-wasnt-as-challenging-as-cd-projekt-red-thought/1100-6531992/">bringing the game to Switch 2 wasn't actually as much of a challenge</a> as anticipated, as modern technologies like Nvidia's DLSS helped make the port easier.</p><p>While other graphically impressive third-party games like Elden Ring and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/" data-ref-id="1100-6531363">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> are headed to Switch 2, several first-party Nintendo titles will also be upgraded on the system. These include paid-for upgrades in titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>, while smaller <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-switch-2-footage-shows-the-game-looking-much-smoother-in-action/1100-6531995/" data-ref-id="1100-6531995">free updates for games like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> will also be available.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">CD Projekt Red has unveiled some truly gorgeous new footage of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/">The Witcher 4</a> running on PS5. But it's important to note that even though this looked like a gameplay video, the studio specifically noted this was a "technical showcase" for the RPG.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-to-state-of-unreal-event-tomorrow-heres-how-to-watch/1100-6531983/">The Witcher 4 was featured at Epic's State of Unreal event</a> in Orlando earlier today, with CD Projekt Red previewing the game on PS5--not PS5 Pro, to be clear. That distinction is necessary since the developer stated the footage was running at 60fps on the Sony console with ray tracing. The tech demo for The Witcher 4 starts with Ciri standing on a cliff, peering out at snow-capped mountains and forested valleys.</p><p data-embed-type="html"><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AjikvaR0i34?si=curvr5-uR8nON2Zc&amp;start=2028" height="315" width="560"></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">From there, The Witcher 4 protagonist walks along a path before meeting up with her buddy, Kelpie. She saddles the horse and takes off at a gallop. CD Projekt Red uses this moment to demonstrate the black mare's muscle movement and fluidity with Unreal Engine 5. The developer transitions from this fauna to highlight <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/nanite-virtualized-geometry-in-unreal-engine" rel="nofollow ">nanite foliage</a> in the open-world game.</p><p dir="ltr">Meeting back up with Ciri (and Kelpie), The Witcher 4 tech demo introduces the port town of Valdrest. After jumping off her horse, Ciri takes down her hood to walk around the market. CD Projekt Red is proud of how when she bumps into a person carrying a crate of apples, the fallen fruit leads to a boy and pigs running toward the food organically.</p><p dir="ltr">While this footage of The Witcher 4 might bring back bad memories of Cyberpunk 2077 promises, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-dev-say-it-has-learned-from-its-cyberpunk-2077-mistakes/1100-6528468/">CD Projekt Red has previously mentioned it's learned from its past mistakes</a>. Another key difference is The Witcher 4 is made in Unreal Engine 5; Cyberpunk 2077 utilized the studio's internal RED Engine.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/">The Witcher 4 isn't arriving anytime soon</a>. CD Projekt Red has noted it won't launch until after 2026, but that's all for specifics regarding a release window. And yes, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-was-always-planned-to-have-ciri-as-the-new-lead/1100-6531815/">Ciri was always planned to be the lead</a> in this new RPG.

			<p>The Fortnite Unreal Editor will soon be expanded with new tools and IPs, including Squid Game and Star Wars.</p>
<p>During today's State of Unreal presentation, Epic provided an overview of what is coming to UEFN, which has proven to be extremely popular, with players having spent over 11.2 billion hours across 260,000 live creator-made islands since its release two years ago. To make the Editor even more enticing for developers, new tools and IPs are coming soon, starting with the LEGO Brick Editor coming on June 17th, creation elements inspired by Squid Game on June 27th, the same day the third and final season of the show debuts on Netflix worldwide, and Avatar: The Last Airbender and Star Wars, both launching on yet to be confirmed release dates.</p>
<p>Based on the technology that powered the AI-powered Darth Vader seen during the latest Season of Fortnite Battle Royale: GALACTIC BATTLE, new tools for the creation of similar NPCs will be coming to the Fortnite Unreal Editor later this year. Creators will be able to use the new Persona Device to create characters with full-blown personalities that players can interact with. Another AI tool coming to UEFN is the Epic Developer Assistant, which is actually already available in beta on the Epic Developer Community. The AI-powered assistant will help creators write Verse code that can be used in UEFN projects while also providing ideas, workflow guidance, and more to speed up the Fortnite island development process.</p>
<p>The last new Fortnite Unreal Editor feature coming soon is Scene Graph, which is launching in beta on June 7th, and is setting out to become the new foundational layer for UEFN. More information on Scene Graph and every other addition outlined above can be found<a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/state-of-unreal-2025-highlights-for-fortnite-creators?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> here.</a></p>
<p>Besides providing updates on the future of the Fortnite Unreal Editor, today's State of Unreal also provided a first in-game look at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Witcher IV</a> and confirmed the core features of <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">Unreal Engine 5.6</a>, which is now available.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date-set-for-this-week.1205820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-1-0-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 1047 Games has announced the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the full version of the portal-hopping FPS is coming sooner than you might think.</p>

<p>In a press release, 1047 Games reveals that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s full release is coming on June 6th. Given that the game only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-open-beta-release-date" rel="nofollow">entered its open beta period in late May</a>, that's a pretty rapid turnaround.</p>

<p>The full version of the game will boast several new modes and improvements over the beta release, including new modes, new weapons, and a full map creator to allow you to make your very own<i>&nbsp;Splitgate 2&nbsp;</i>maps.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-1.0-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=7U8-v-pE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-1.0-release-date-shooting.jpg?itok=JqFpLGTV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>is launching in full later this week. Surprise!</figcaption></figure><p>Excitingly, 1047 Games says that there's still a "massive surprise" in store for the full release of&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, describing said surprise as "the biggest part" of the game. It'll be revealed during the Summer Game Fest show, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">airs on the same day</a> as&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s release.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, it's a multiplayer first-person shooter that essentially marries the arena-focused FPS action of games like&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with the portal-jumping of, er,&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>.</p>

<p>You'll head into a variety of maps and use portals to traverse them, getting the drop on your enemies or setting up tactical ambushes with your portals to achieve victory. Alternatively, if you're me, you'll be firing portals anywhere you can in a frantic attempt to escape players way better than you at the game.</p>

<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>'s 1.0 release, described by 1047 Games as "surprisingly emotional", right here. Tissues at the ready.</p>




<p>Since launching into open beta in May,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>has attracted a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 7,000 reviews, with some players comparing it unfavorably to the original&nbsp;<em>Splitgate</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the full release remedies those issues remains to be seen, but at any rate,&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2__Beta/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in full on June 6th.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Epic Games is going to allow <em>Fortnite</em> creators to make AI-powered NPCs that work similar to the recently-launched AI Darth Vader. The company showed off the tech at its State of Unreal show on Tuesday.</p><p>Using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN), creators can make characters with personalities that they can voice chat with. Creators will be able to set the type of voice, their delivery, and the AI NPC’s characteristics when the feature is available later this year.</p><p>In a live demo shown onstage at the event, two Epic staffers showed a conversation with an AI character, “Mr. Buttons,” whose sole purpose was to try and get the player to press a big red button in the room. For example, one Epic staffer asked a question about the screens in the room saying not to press the button, and the AI wanted the player to push the rules and press the button.</p><p>In May, Epic added a Darth Vader NPC to <em>Fortnite</em> that could speak to players using an AI-powered version of James Earl Jones’ voice. Jones’ estate approved of the use of his voice. However, Epic had to issue a hotfix after players got the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/668349/fortnite-star-wars-james-earl-jones-vader-ai-voice">to swear</a>.</p><p>The AI NPCs aren’t the only AI-focused news for <em>Fortnite</em> creators. Epic is also beta testing the Epic Developer Assistant, an AI chatbot that can help UEFN creators write code in UEFN’s Verse programming language. The beta test is live today.</p><p>Epic also announced that new franchises will be available for UEFN creators to make experiences with. <em>Squid Game</em> assets will be available <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1929912150786453683">starting June 27th</a> — the same day as the premiere of the show’s third and final season — and creators will be able to publish <em>Squid Game</em> experiences later this summer. <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, which appeared in <em>Fortnite</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24093527/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-greek-gods-battle-royale">last year</a>, will be available for creators to build with in 2026. <em>Star Wars</em> assets will be available at some point in the future.</p><p>And on June 17th, creators will also be able to build LEGO experiences brick by brick, which should allow for more customizable LEGO experiences.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Saruhashi notes that although making sequels is the easier and safer option, NIS does things differently. "In our case, we’re more driven by whether our fans want a sequel. If there’s demand for it, we’ll make it.”</p><p>In regards to making new IP, he said that it's imperative for a mid-sized company to dare to do things big companies can't risk in order to survive. He added, "If we were to stop taking on new challenges, we would be like a fish out of water--I think we’d die.”</p><p>These new and experimental titles are however being given limited budgets, which means developers need to come up with creative solutions. But in the interview, Mizokami commented that she prefers the thrill of problem-solving within a tight budget, saying that she'd "probably get bored halfway through" if suddenly given a multi-million budget. Saruhashi and Mizokami instead liken NIS's approach to "speedrun/real-time attack-style game development.”</p><p>NIS nonetheless still has some notable franchises it continues to release, including the Disgaea series, while its Western counterpart NIS America publishes the international release of the Trails series.</p>

		<p>Portal-filled arena shooter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is getting its full 1.0 launch this week on 6th June across PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. If you don’t want to wait, the game is already available to play in open beta across all platforms.</p>
<p>1047 Games announced the game’s launch in the run up to Summer Game Fest, during which a “massive surprise” is still set to be revealed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Something to Fight For | Launch Announcement | Splitgate 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AdpTm9qfCGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, while Friday will be the 1.0 launch, the game is already playable in its current open beta, which will continue through to launch and track all player stats and progression through to the full game as well.</p>
<p>The open beta doesn’t have all of the game’s maps and modes just yet, but it does have the core of the game and the fully featured level editor, The Lab, which allows up to 16 people to collaborate on a custom map.</p>

<p>Another thing that the beta has had over the past couple weeks is server issues. 1047 Games has battled to get on top of these, which have blocked player progression from being awarded in real-time, and forced them to scramble to find fixes. That’s always the way for online multiplayer games, it seems.</p>
<p>Still, the game has had over 1 million downloads already, and anyone that has donwloaded and logged in during the beta will receive some poo-themed cosmetics by way of apology for server issues. So that’s… nice?</p>

<p>Splitgate 2 has been on the cards since 2022, when <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/05/splitgate-development-to-end-so-1047-games-can-work-on-aaa-sequel/">1047 halted production on content for the original game</a>. While the original release into beta had quickly raced to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/20/splitgate-beta-will-continue-as-shooter-hits-10-million-downloads/">over 10 million players</a>, satiating some of the appetite for a tight arena shooter and drawing comparisons to the Halo series as it did so, 1047 quickly realised that they needed to revamp many aspects of the game, and not just produce more content for it. A few years on and they’re now on the cusp of realising that vision.</p>

		<p>Sony has announced that the next State of Play stream will take place tomorrow, 4th June, at 10PM UK time (2pm PT / 5pm ET / 11pm CEST).</p>
<p>The show will last around 40 minutes and will have the usual mix of news, updates, reveals and trailers for games coming to PlayStation 5.</p>


<p>You can find the stream embedded here:</p>
<p><iframe title="State of Play | June 4, 2025 [English]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1bYaEtALe00?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, we’re taking our first steps into the faux-E3 season wrapped up around Summer Game Fest. The main SGF stream will take place on Friday, 6th June at 10PM UK time, with Day of the Devs coming right after at midnight. We’ve then got Xbox Games Showcase with Outwer Worlds 2 Direct on 8th June, as well as the PC Gaming Show and Death Stranding 2 Game Premier a little behind, and there’s Devolver, Wholesome Direct, and a variety of other curated showcases for specific groups of the indsutry, including Black Voices, Southeast Asian, Latin American and Women-Led games.</p>

<p>While a State of Play stream had been rumoured and expected for this time of year, Sony decided to wait until just about the last possible moment before confirming the date and time of the showcase. No idea why, but there we go.</p>

            <p>The State of Unreal 2025 showcase has just offered us a first glimpse at what playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> might look like, via an Unreal Engine 5 demo build that featured Ciri exploring the wilds and a village in Kovir. Kovir was also confirmed to be a location you'll visit in the final game, so start packing your bags.</p>
<p>In this tech demo, which you can watch below, CD Projekt and Epic showed off some of the Unreal Engine 5 tech that'll be aiming to make The Witcher 4 feel even more immersive than its already impressive predecessor when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">it drops</a>.</p>

<p>The demo kicked off with a merchant in a cart having his day entirely ruined by a monster, with Ciri then swooping in to quite literally pick up the pieces, as she embarks on a contract to hunt the monster that just killed the poor peddler. Things then properly transitioned into a Ciri-following build running on a PlayStation 5 at 60 frames per second with all the raytracing bells and whistles at play.</p>
<p>We got a look at Ciri's horse Kelpie, whom you'll be riding about and if they're anything like Roach, crashing into something every five minutes. The devs even peeled back Kelpie's skin to show the engine simulating horse muscles as they run, which wasn't at all freaky.</p>
<p>Ciri then wandered from the countryside of Kovir - a mountainous region that forms part of the Kingdom of Kovir and Poviss located in the northwest of The Continent - into one of the area's villages, Valdrest. CD Projekt and Epic really played up all the immersive details that make up the likes of bustling marketplaces, with details like an innkeeper dynamically lobbing a Gwent cheat out of an inn's front door being highlighted.</p>
<p>It seems that may well be what happens to you too if you try to con some cardplayers, so you've been warned. After showing off some varying crowd density at a circus, the demo concluded by showing Ciri looking out at the city of Lan Exeter in the distance. According to the lore, that's Kovir's winter capital and a Venice-style major port city filled with canals, so getting to explore it for the first time in a Witcher game will no doubt be prime screenshot material.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 had the very Elven and French-feeling Beauclair and Novigrad could be just as breathtaking in a more grungy fashion, so it'll be interesting to see how Lan Exeter stacks up. I'm really keen to explore Kovir full-stop, since it's one of the fringe regions we've not heard too much about as The Witcher games have generally concentrated more centrally, aside from trips to Kaer Morhen. Regardless, it looks like we'll be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">waiting until about 2027</a> to set foot there.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sequel will be the Polish studio’s first after ditching its in-house game engine tools for UE5, and CDPR shared a taste of those early results running at 60fps on a base PS5 with fans during the conference, including the player’s new horse pal called Kelpie. </p><p>A new cinematic trailer showed crooked elites getting their just desserts when a dragon flies down in the night and rips their wagon to shreds. A mysterious wanderer emerges the next day to investigate the remnants of the crime scene, eventually revealing herself to be Ciri, the former princess and Geralt of Rivia’s mentee all grown up. Observing for clues as if her mind had shifted into detective mode, it’s clear she looks a little different from her appearance in <em>The Witcher 4</em>'s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-cdpr-ciri-open-world-rpg-release-date-trailer-1851720322">initial reveal at The Game Awards 2025</a></span>. Is that emblematic of a shift moving forward?</p><p>While she’s supposed to be much older now, her new model looked different than what fans may have expected from playing <em>The Witcher 3</em>. CD Projekt Red later revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGJ-B7v5tYI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a behind-the-scenes video</a></span> about the making the of the 2024 cinematic trailer and noted that character models naturally look different depending on the rendering-style and medium. “At this point, any character’s appearance may vary depending on the medium—whether it’s in a trailer, a 3D model, or in-game,” game director Sebastian Kalemba wrote at the time.</p><p>A spokesperson for CD Projekt Red told <em>Kotaku</em> that only two changes were made to Ciri in the new trailer, one of which has already been changed again. “It’s the same character model used in the [2024] trailer,” they said. “Ciri’s face is a direct copy of <em>The Witcher 3</em> model, adapted to work with the latest MetaHuman technology. Two subtle changes were made to improve animation quality: slightly raised eyebrows, and a more relaxed eye area—the latter was present in the trailer but has since been removed.”</p><p>The real treat today was nearly 10 minutes of seeing Ciri wander around a new open world. A gameplay tech demo showed the monster slayer wandering through sprawling sections of wilderness and village streets lined with NPCs. There’s even a bear that pops out at one point, and a knocked-over fruit crate that sends apples tumbling down a cobblestone path. It’s a UE5 showcase intended to wow and amaze with its extensive detail, hyper-realistic movement, and seamless transitions. Gently falling snowflakes and icy river currents all add to the effect. More immersive! More visceral! Video Games!</p><p>The spokesperson for CDPR stressed to <em>Kotaku</em> that today’s footage is a tech demo for Unreal, not the game itself. Ciri’s look, the open world, all continue to evolve throughout development. “It showcases the powerful foundation we’re building in close collaboration with Epic Games to push open-world design further than ever before and the core systems and features we’re developing using Unreal Engine 5. We’re really proud of this early milestone and excited to give you a sneak peek at some of the cool tech like UAF, Nanite Foliage, Smart Objects, ML Deformer and FastGeo Streaming that are helping shape the future of <em>The Witcher</em>.”</p><p>I don’t need to remind <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-downgrade-controversy-sucks-1705882405?_gl=1*168moj4*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDg5NTgwNTUkbzExNSRnMSR0MTc0ODk1OTMxNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA."><em>Witcher </em>fans of E3 “downgrade”-gate</a></span>, which saw players poring over preview footage and showing how it looked better than what eventually launched in <em>The Witcher 3</em> in 20215. As then-CD-Projekt-Red visual effects artist José Teixeira explained at the time, you can’t downgrade a game that doesn’t exist, and what’s really happening in these situations is that trade-offs are made to keep a game performant while also making it look as good as possible. </p><p>The takeaway from Unreal Fest is that CDPR feels confident it’ll be able to do that using UE5 in a way that makes the wait worth it for all the Witcher-heads out there. It looks like it’s working so far! The in-game footage is even better-looking than the cinematic. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Eight years ago, just before the release of the Nintendo Switch, we <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/nintendo-switch-review/">provided an in-depth review of the hardware</a> thanks to early production units provided by Nintendo. This year, Nintendo has opted not to provide such unrestricted early press access to the Switch 2 hardware, citing a "day-one update" to the system software and some launch games that would supposedly make pre-release evaluation more difficult.</p>
<p>As such, we won't be able to provide our full thoughts on the Switch 2 until well after the system is in players' hands. While that's not an ideal situation for readers looking to make an early purchase decision, we'll do our best to give you our hands-on impressions as soon as possible after launch day.</p>
<p>In lieu of review access, though, we were able to get some extended hands-on time with the final Switch 2 hardware at a daylong preview event held by Nintendo last week. This event provided our first look at the console's system-level menu and settings, as well as features like GameChat (which was hard to fully evaluate in an extremely controlled environment).</p>
<p>While this access was far from sufficient for a full review, it did let us discover a few interesting features that we weren't aware of beforehand. Here are some of the new tidbits we stumbled across during our day with the Switch 2 hardware.</p>
<h2>GameChat can generate captions for live speech</h2>
<p>One of the most unexpected accessibility features of the Switch 2 is the system's ability to automatically generate on-screen captions for what friends are saying during a GameChat session. These captions appear in their own box that can be set to the side of the main gameplay. The captioning system seemed pretty fast and accurate in our test and could even update captions from multiple speakers at the same time.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

      </figure>

<p>While this is obviously useful for hard-of-hearing players, we could also see the feature being a boon for managing crosstalk among rowdy GameChat parties or for quickly referring back to something someone said a few seconds ago.</p>
<h2>You can generate spoken speech from text messages</h2>
<p>In a reverse of the auto-captioning system discussed above, GameChat also has a feature buried deep in its menus that lets you type a message on the on-screen keyboard and have it spoken aloud to the other participants in a slightly robotic voice. This could come in handy when you're playing in an environment where you have to be quiet but still want to quickly convey detailed information to your fellow players.</p>
<h2>The camera has built-in head-tracking</h2>
<p>During GameChat sessions, you can make the connected camera show only your face instead of your entire body and/or the background behind it. This mode keeps your face centered in a small, circular frame even as you move around during gameplay, though there is a slight delay in the tracking if you move your head too quickly.</p>
<p>While you can also activate a similar face display during local multiplayer sessions of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the game doesn't seem to track your movements, meaning you can easily fall out of frame if you don't hold your body still.</p>

<h2>The system can detect the angle of the kickstand</h2>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Wonderful!
                          </p>
          </div>
          <figcaption>

    <p>
      Wonderful!

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>This was a cute little surprise I discovered in a <em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em> mini-game that asks you to set the kickstand as close as possible to a given angle. This mini-game works even if the Joy-Cons are not attached, suggesting that there is a sensor in the kickstand or tablet itself that measures the angle. It did take a few seconds of stillness for the game to fully confirm the system's resting angle, though, so don't expect to be tilting the kickstand rapidly to control action games or anything.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>You can use mouse mode to navigate system menus</h2>
<p>I stumbled on this feature when I was holding the Joy-Cons normally and one of my fingers accidentally passed over the mouse sensor, activating a mouse pointer on the system menu screen. When I put the controller down on its edge, I found that the pointer could scroll and click through those menus, often much more quickly than flicking a joystick.</p>
<p>Mouse mode also lets you zoom in on specific areas of the screen with a quick double-click, which should be useful for both vision-impaired players and those playing on tiny and/or far-off screens.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the mouse mode sensitivity</h2>
<p>The system menu lets you adjust the mouse sensor's sensitivity between "low," "medium," and "high." While that's a lot less precise than the fully adjustable DPI settings you might be used to with a computer mouse, it's still a welcome option.</p>
<p>In some quick testing, I found the high-sensitivity mode to be especially useful when using the mouse on a small surface, such as the top of my thigh. At this setting, the pointer could move from one end of the screen to the other with the slightest wrist adjustment. Low sensitivity mode, on the other hand, proved useful in more precise situations, such as in a <em>Welcome Tour</em> mini-game where I had to move a ball quickly and precisely through a large, electrified maze.</p>
<h2>You can play sounds to find lost controllers</h2>
<figure>
    <div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Lose a Joy-Con somewhere in the depths of your couch? Not to worry—a new menu option on the Switch 2 lets you play a distinctive sound through that Joy-Con's improved HD Rumble 2 motor to help you find its precise location. While we confirmed that this feature also works with the new Pro Controller 2, we were unable to determine whether it can be used for original Switch controllers that are synced with a Switch 2.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<h2>You can set a system-wide security PIN</h2>
<p>Your unique PIN code must be entered any time the system comes out of sleep mode, making the hardware functionally useless to anyone who doesn't have the PIN. This should be great for kids who want to keep siblings away and parents who are worried about their kids sneaking in extra Switch 2 time when they shouldn't be.</p>
<h2>You can limit the battery charging level</h2>
<p>A new system-level option will prevent the Switch 2 from charging as soon as it hits 90 percent of capacity, a move intended to increase the longevity of the internal battery. This is already a common feature on many smartphones and portable gaming devices, so it's nice to see Nintendo joining the bandwagon here. Thus far, though, it appears that the 90 percent battery capacity is the only cutoff point available, with no further options for customization.</p>
<h2>You can adjust the size of menu text</h2>
<figure>
    <div id="caption-2098404"><p>
              MAXIMUM TEXT SIZE.

      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>As you can see in the photo above, setting the system text size to "MAXIMUM" lets menu options be seen easily from roughly the moon. You can set the system text to bold and high-contrast for even more legibility, and there's also an option to make the system menu text smaller than the default, for whatever reason.</p>
<h2>You can swap the A and B buttons at the system level</h2>
<p>With this menu option activated, the B button is used to "confirm" and the A button is used to "cancel" in system menus. This should be welcome news for players more used to the button layout on Xbox, PlayStation, and Steam Deck controllers, which all have the "confirm" and "cancel" options in reversed positions from the Nintendo default.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/free-roam-mode-is-mario-kart-worlds-killer-app/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When tried out <em>Mario Kart World</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/hands-on-with-the-switch-2-its-the-switch-too/">at April's Switch 2 premiere hands-on event</a>, the short demos focused on more-or-less standard races in the game's Grand Prix and Knockout modes. So when Nintendo invited us back for more time previewing the near-final version of the game before the Switch 2's release, we decided to focus most of our time on the game's mysterious (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/what-do-you-actually-do-in-mario-kart-worlds-vast-open-world/">previously teased</a>) "Free Roam" mode.</p>
<p>We're glad we did, because the mode feels like the hidden gem of <em>Mario Kart World</em> and maybe of the Switch 2 launch as a whole. Combining elements of games like <em>Diddy Kong Racing</em>, <em>Forza Horizon</em>, and even the <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> series, Free Roam provides a unique mixture of racing challenges, exploration, and collectibles that should keep new Switch 2 owners busy for a while.</p>
<h2>Switch hunt</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, Free Roam mode isn't actually listed as one of the main options when you launch a new game of <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Instead, a tiny note in the corner of the screen tells you to hit the plus button to get dropped into a completely untimed and free-wheeling version of the vast <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p>

<p>Exploring in Free Roam mode really provides the best sense of scale for the game's massive, muti-ecosystem island in a way individual races just can't. Sure, other race modes sometimes let you travel between the individual race courses along pre-set paths from one finish line to another starting line. But Free Roam mode lets you fully explore the vast spaces between those paths, encouraging you to go off-roading in the mountains, valleys, rivers, oceans, volcanoes, snowdrifts, and landmarks that dot the countryside.</p>
<p>Your main explicit goal when exploring all this varied expanse is to look for large, blue P-Switches, each of which activates a short, timed challenge mission in the immediate vicinity. In many cases, simply reaching the P-Switch is half the challenge, requiring some inventive wall-riding or item use to get to a particularly out-of-the-way corner of the map.</p>

Producer Kosuke Yabuki has now reacted to the excitement about the Cow, and re-confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">the Cow does in fact eat burgers</a>, but they may not be real-beef burgers.</p><p>"The decision to include Cow was something that we considered in terms of if we added that, I think people would be really happy about it. And so we did," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/does-cow-eat-beef-we-asked-the-mario-kart-world-producer" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yabuki told IGN</a>. "But honestly, the reaction to that by the public was much bigger than we possibly could have anticipated. So that was a wonderful surprise."</p><p>As discussed previously, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">a "silly sketch" led to the creation of the Cow</a>, who has become one of the game's most popular characters in the lead up to release.</p><p>Yabuki went on to say that the Cow "really opened the floodgates" for Nintendo because it inspired the developers to wonder, "'Well, maybe we should just add who we can.'" Thinking this way, the developers also chose to add the Penguin and Pokey.</p><p>"Because all of these characters came in such a rush as the designers were getting kind of carried away, it's actually a little hard for me to remember which specific character would've come immediately next in the sequence after Cow," Yabuki said. "Because honestly, I have this memory of approving the concept for Cow, and then maybe the next day I had 10 proposals for other characters on my desk."</p><p>Given that Mario Kart World has a new mechanic that lets players stop at roadside restaurants and grab a bite to eat, many have been wondering if the Cow can stop for a burger or steak. The creature can, but that doesn't mean it's necessarily eating its own kind. Asked if the Cow specifically consumers beef or veggie burgers, Kabuki said, "Sorry that's top secret. I can't say."</p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> will be set in the far northern region of Kovir, not yet seen in the previous games.</p>
<p>Earlier today, we saw a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-unreal-tech-demo-was-running-on-a-standard-ps5-at-60fps-with-ray-tracing">first in-game look at CD Projekt Red's forthcoming Ciri-starring sequel</a> at the State of Unreal livestream. It showed off how the studio is using Unreal's technology, but also hinted at the game's location.</p>
<p>The end of the trailer shows a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital of the Kovir region. In a press release, the studio has confirmed the sequel will take place in Kovir.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Kovir and Poviss is to the far north of the world, beyond the Dragon Mountains. It's fitting, then, that as Ciri peers out to the city beyond snow-capped mountains, a dragon flies overhead.</p>
<p>Earlier, the tech demo showed the city of Valdrest, which appears to be a new creation by the studio.</p>
<p>If Kovir sounds familiar, it's referenced in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> by Triss as she's asked to be court advisor to King Tancred in Kovir. Geralt is less keen to settle down in the region, though.</p>

<p>But perhaps he does ahead of The Witcher 4? Fans have speculated he may be the leader of the new Lynx Witcher school, from which Ciri learns her skills. And when that lynx medallion was first revealed it was in the snow, perhaps foreshadowing the cold northern region in which the game will take place.</p>
<p>The trailer also revealed Ciri's horse Kelpie, just like in the books.</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red stated the game was running on a base PS5 at 60fps with ray tracing turned on. Here's a look at some screenshots:</p>

<p>The demo will offer access to the full prologue of the game, the central player hub, the Wanderer Pass and five unique quests. Players will also be able to take part in multiplayer activities, including a cooperative raid.</p>
<p>We've been covering Pioner for several years now and also <a href="https://wccftech.com/pioner-qa-2-devs-reveal-pve-pvp-mechanics-of-this-stalker-like-mmofps-confirm-beta-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> the developers twice.

Even if you can't play next week, GFA Games confirmed that an Open Beta will take place later this Summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="PIONER - Steam Next Fest Open Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr2yutiQBwE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here's an overview of Pioner from the latest official fact sheet:</p>
<p>Pioner is a post-apocalyptic MMO shooter set on the mysterious Soviet-era island of Tartarus, offering a vast open world spanning over 50 square kilometers. Blending intense PvE and PvP action with player-driven storytelling, the game features faction missions, hidden dungeons, and dynamic environments. Realism takes center stage, replacing traditional health bars and levels with immersive mechanics. High-risk zones like the "Shadowlands" push PvP to the extreme, allowing for chaotic, high-reward battles where alliances are key — or optional.</p>

At its State of Unreal show on Tuesday, Epic announced that the MetaHuman Creator is now embedded within Unreal Engine as part of Unreal Engine 5.6.</p><p>The company is also bringing its face-authoring tools for MetaHumans’ faces to bodies, meaning developers will be able to create faces and bodies with fine-tuned parameters for their games or applications. Developers will be able to sell their MetaHumans on Epic’s Fab marketplace for digital assets, too, so they can be used in other games or projects.</p><p>Onstage, Epic showed how the MetaHuman tools could be used to animate a character in real time — and using just a consumer webcam to capture the actor’s facial movements. It was pretty cool.</p><p>Epic also has new licensing options that allow MetaHumans to be used with other game development engines or creative software. That means that creators will be able to use MetaHumans in rival development platforms like Unity and Godot and in creative software such as Maya, Houdini, and Blender.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
