		<p>A new gameplay overview video has been released by Rebellion for its upcoming survival action game Atomfall. Set after the real Windscale nuclear accident in British history, Atomfall is an alternate take on what happened after the events, with much more having gone wrong. Players are held within a quarantine zone where soldiers, bandits, and other dangers lurk.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Atomfall | Official Gameplay Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCGyfXGPSvc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Atomfall gameplay video gives us a look at the world, including the village where you will spend a lot of time, plus the wilds and bunkers nearby. The start of the game will be quite Fallout-esque, in the sense you wake up and are unfamiliar with the world outside. The player character is a complete amnesiac, which gives a large amount of freedom in how you survive in this world. You could try and help everyone or be a menace to different groups. One of the groups present is the British military, who were sent in to establish the quarantine zone. However, under the rule of the military things are very strict with even the slightest indiscretion being an excuse for them to punish you.</p>
<p>The military are not the only potential threat. Outside the borders of the village, things are more dangerous. Outlaws and bandits roam this area, posing a real danger to the player. They will attack on sight, without a care of whether you could be friendly. The old quarry, the surrounding hills, and other locations all have their own secrets to discover. They also have resources that you will need to survive the world of Atomfall, The bunkers are home to irradiated creatures and patrolling security robots, both of which will attack players on sight too. But, these bunkers are key to discovering what happened so they will need to be explored.</p>
<p>Combat will be a mix of close up melee combat, with cricket bats being a weapon of choice. There are guns like pistols, shotguns, and rifles too, but as this is England ammo will not be easy to find. Using items found in the environment, weapons can be upgraded so they are more effective against foes. Crafting will be crucial to survival too, allowing players to make things such as bombs and healing items. A metal detector will be part of player’s inventory too, letting player’s search the ground for buried supply caches. Manuals will be found in the world of Atomfall too, unlocking new skills for your character like weapon throwing. The skills are grouped within four categories; ranged combat, melee combat, survival, and conditioning.</p>

<p>Atomfall will be available on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One,PS5 and PS4 from March 27th, 2025.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Slavic Magic and Hooded Horse have released a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> update, adding a couple of maps, the ability to construct bridges, and a bevy of smaller features to an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-early-access-review">already quite robust</a> medieval city builder. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The update rolls together two beta patches into one, gargantuan changelog. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-is-getting-new-maps-building-upgrades-and-reworks-for-the-marketplace-and-ale-distribution">Teased last November</a>, the new maps are High Peaks and Winding River. The latter is obviously where the bridge-building mechanic - an extension of the existing road tool - gets its chance to shine. 
</p>
<p>
Bridge-building is, I imagine, also helped along by some tweaks to the game's cliff geography. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253?l=english">Posting on Steam</a>, lead developer Greg Styczeń writes that it should be clearer which areas are buildable or traversable, thanks to a zigzag pattern that appears during build mode. He's also tweaked the pathfinding around cliffs, and got rid of a problem where gaps would appear between landscape components and cliffs when you zoom out.
</p>
<p>
Other major changes include worker restrictions for stalls. As of this patching, only storage building workers can set up marketplace stalls, because "there was too much confusion about who owned what and works where, and it was very difficult for players to understand, for instance, that a gravedigger could have a food stall," the developer goes on. Sorry gravediggers, but you'll have to flog your homegrown produce by other means. The number of goods a marketplace can supply is also now capped by the number of stalls (and therefore, assigned storage buildings), with capacity indicated on the market panel.
</p>
<p>
Styczeń has also introduced a stone well upgrade for wells, along with level two taverns, while changing how ale and water are distributed from wells and taverns. 
</p>
<p>
This is but the tip of the update's acrid compost heap. By all means click that Steam link and fill your horrified eyes with bulletpoints. Sometimes when I read an overly long changelog, I can feel myself... <em>changelogging in turn</em>. My brain starts to feel like a village marketplace, crowded with boisterous oxen and sorrowful gravediggers, hopelessly offering handfuls of turnips to anybody who will take them.
</p><p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> launched in April last year, and was due to remain in early access for approximately one year. Using such braincells as I have left that aren't now wholly given over to talk of bowyers, burgage plots and butchery, I deduce from this that it might leave early access in April 2025.

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could be getting a major boost in games after it launches. According to a new claim from known leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NateTheHate</a>, Xbox exclusives Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo: The Master Chief Collection are coming to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>The games are also reported to be coming to PlayStation 5 as well.</p>







<p>“Games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025, beyond the obvious, include Flight Simulator—will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2—and Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” NateTheHate said.</p>



<p>While those two games were the main ones discussed, they don’t appear to be the only ones coming to the upcoming Nintendo console. In a reply to a <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1877737536048574891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on social media</a> about games coming to the system, Windows Central Executive Editor Jez Corden said the total would be “way more than that”. He then followed up with that the games would be “most older games/timed stuff”.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct Announced for January 23&nbsp;</a></h6>



<p>No other details about what older games could come to the system were mentioned. Aside from Xbox games, NateTheHate also suggested that Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth—both PlayStation 5 console exclusives—will come to the system. They’ll also be coming to Xbox starting with Remake in 2025 and Rebirth in 2026.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Nintendo Switch 2 getting major Xbox first-party games like Flight Simulator and Halo?

Now, they know exactly what they missed out on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During <a href="https://youtu.be/C_ebmhxyR20?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an episode of the From Script to Life podcast</a>, Human Revolution and Mankind Divided writer Mark Cecere discussed where protagonist Adam Jensen’s story would have gone in the third game, were it not canceled. The writers planned for Jensen to take out one member of the Illuminati rather than the Illuminati itself, which would have caused “Bob Page to become Bob Page.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bob Page is the antagonist of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex">the original Deus Ex game</a>, Ion Storm’s hugely influential 2000 cyberpunk adventure. So, in this way, Jensen’s fate is to <em>cause</em> Deux Ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“He can never catch up to the Illuminati,” Cecere explained. “We know this. We know the Illuminati keep going until 2050. We know some of those same characters that are in the Illuminati inner circle are in 2050. So Jensen can never get there and do something concrete.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, what can happen? That was the question we were trying to answer at some point. So we did have one name that we could get rid of, and that was the one that Jensen would have caught up to and done something.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The repercussions were that by Jensen doing this, it causes Deus Ex, if that makes sense. And that’s the tragedy of Jensen, is that he causes what happens after — by doing something — he causes Bob Page to become Bob Page. That was where we were heading.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, it seems unlikely we’ll ever get to see this version of events. After the release of Mankind Divided in 2016, previous owner Square Enix had Eidos-Montréal shift to other projects, including 2021's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/guardians-of-the-galaxy">Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Then, in 2022, Square Enix sold Eidos-Montréal and the Deus Ex franchise to controversial umbrella company Embracer. Work on a brand new Deus Ex game had already begun, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-group-reportedly-cancels-deus-ex-video-game-as-layoffs-hit-eidos-montreal">but this too was canceled in 2024</a>, resulting in signifcant layoffs at Eidos-Montréal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deus-ex-actor-elias-toufexis-says-goodbye-to-adam-jensen-following-game-cancellation">Elias Toufexis, who played Adam Jensen, waved goodbye to the character seemingly for good, saying</a>: “alas, his story seems done.” While Toufexis confirmed he had not worked on this latest canceled Deus Ex game and expressed hope that another company might pick up the Deus Ex licence, it felt final.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1877082236400640098" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reacting to Cecere’s comments, Toufexis said</a>: “Hey this would have been fun huh?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Between the team making their Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-revealed-as-full-title-along-with-first-footage-confirmation-its-set-in-the-60s-sdcc-2024"><u>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</u></a> this July, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doctor-doom-becomes-emperor-of-the-marvel-universe-in-2025-nycc-2024"><u>One World Under Doom</u></a> event shaking up the mainline comic universe as Ryan North continues his acclaimed run on the property, and NetEase’s hero shooter Marvel Rivals making the F4 the focus of Eternal Night Falls (the first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-details-the-fantastic-four-new-maps-and-mode-coming-in-season-1"><u>post-launch season</u></a>), 2025 is shaping up to be the year that Marvel’s First Family reclaims their position as one of the Marvel universe’s core pillars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet the fact that they were ever <em>not </em>is a crime in itself. The 2010s saw the Fantastic Four lose a lot of their luster between their comic series being cancelled from 2015 to 2018, Josh Trank’s 2015 reboot becoming one of the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fantastic_four_2015" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>worst-received comic book movies</u></a> of all time, and supporting cast members being removed from cartoons and video games, such as Doctor Doom not appearing in Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite despite being a series mainstay. That’s all set to change in 2025, with all the new media featuring the Fantastic Four being a much-needed correction. Let’s take a look at how we got here and why 2025 is the year of the Fantastic Four.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The 2010s: Less Than Fantastic</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2010s were a pivotal decade for Marvel’s ascension to the top of the pop culture pyramid because of the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The Avengers were one of Marvel’s longest-running brands going as far back as 1963, but they weren’t household names in the same way Spider-Man or the X-Men were until Marvel Studios turned the likes of Iron Man, Captain America and Thor into superstars. Now, we’re happy that those long-standing Marvel heroes are as beloved by the general public today as they are by us nerds. But the rise of the MCU also had a dark side in how it dealt with the franchises Marvel Studios didn’t have access to on the movies side, where competitors they needed to outshine controlled certain characters. In particular, we're talking about the Fantastic Four and X-Men licenses once held by 20th Century Fox.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Fantastic Four suffered the indignity of having their comic cancelled over the 20th Century Fox situation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the height of MCU mania in the mid-2010s, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davegonzales/2015/05/31/marvel-is-killing-x-men-and-fantastic-four-merchandising/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Marvel moved away</u></a> from Fantastic Four and X-Men merchandise in favor of boosting properties they’d produced or were developing into films. That would be one thing, but the Fantastic Four also suffered the indignity of having their comic cancelled over the situation. Longtime Marvel writer Jonathan Hickman, who wrote the Fantastic Four book from 2009 to 2012 and is currently working on Ultimate Spider-Man, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/fantastic-four-writer-jonathan-hickman-says-marvel-canceled-comic-due-to-fox-dispute"><u>confirmed</u></a> that Marvel stopped publishing Fantastic Four “because of their disagreement with Fox.” That Marvel <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/20/fantastic-fours-return-was-definitely-worth-the-wait"><u>resumed publishing</u></a> the main F4 book when Disney was in the process of purchasing 20th Century Fox is most likely not a coincidence. Not to valorize corporate consolidation, but Disney reacquiring the Fantastic Four film license seems to have opened the gates for the characters to make their return to prominence in both comics and adaptations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s important to remember that despite no longer being at the height of their popularity, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-essential-issues-of-marvel-1961-1963"><u>wouldn’t have</u></a> a Marvel universe without the Fantastic Four. Their debut in 1961 was the genesis from which Stan Lee and Jack Kirby launched nearly all of the Marvel characters we’ve come to know and love in the time since, and their book featured the first appearances of many Marvel icons such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-doctor-doom-was-the-only-choice-for-the-mcus-new-thanos"><u>Doctor Doom</u></a>, Silver Surfer, Galactus, the Watcher, Black Panther, Adam Warlock, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/agatha-all-along"><u>Agatha Harkness</u></a>, the Skrulls, the Kree, the Inhumans and more. That pedigree alone should permanently guarantee them a spot in Marvel’s main pantheon, but you’d be hard-pressed to find any media about the Fantastic Four beyond their own comic from the past decade or so. Luckily, we now know things are about to turn around.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2025: The Return of the Fantastic Four</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s crazy to realize that the Fantastic Four will finally join the MCU a mere 17 years (!) after it began, but better late than never, we suppose. The Fantastic Four: First Steps is the second reboot of the Fantastic Four film franchise (third if you count the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/17/doomed-the-untold-story-of-roger-cormans-the-fantastic-four-review"><u>unreleased 1994 film</u></a>), and will bring the F4 back to the big screen. The excitement for First Steps is a far cry from where we were 10 years ago, when Fox’s last attempt at an F4 film left fans worried that we’d never see the First Family in live-action ever again. It’s hard to overstate just how doomed (ha) the Fantastic Four felt when Fant4stic (as the title was stylized) bombed in theaters back in 2015. But now that they’re back in Marvel’s hands, we know that we’re not just getting a new take on the Fantastic Four, but that they’re also set to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-the-fantastic-four-need-to-be-at-the-center-of-avengers-doomsday-and-secret-wars"><u>major players</u></a> in the upcoming Avengers: Doomsday and Avengers: Secret Wars, where the team will confront Robert Downey, Jr’s Doctor Doom.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just the movies. Ryan North has been penning the main Fantastic Four comic for the past couple of years, and will also be writing Marvel’s big 2025 crossover event One World Under Doom. This series will feature the Avengers and Fantastic Four dealing with a world where Doctor Doom has not just taken up the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme, but is also the self-declared Emperor of Earth. It’s not the first time Doom has conquered the planet (see David Michelinie and Bob Hall’s Marvel Graphic Novel #27: Emperor Doom from 1987 and Jonathan Hickman and Esad Ribić’s 2015 Secret Wars for his previous successes), but placing the Fantastic Four’s greatest nemesis at the center of their publishing year is surely a calculated effort on Marvel’s part to push the Fantastic Four franchise into the limelight as they prepare to make Doom their new Thanos for the Multiverse Saga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And most pressingly, the Fantastic Four are set to join Marvel Rivals as the first batch of post-launch playable characters in Season 1: Eternal Night Falls, where the F4 and the rest of the hero roster must confront Dracula and his legions in New York City. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvel-rivals-official-mister-fantastic-character-reveal-trailer"><u>Mr. Fantastic</u></a> and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/marvel-rivals-official-invisible-woman-character-reveal-trailer"><u>Invisible Woman</u></a> will join the battlefield on January 10 as the game’s newest Duelist and Strategist respectively, with the Thing and the Human Torch making their debut later in the season. The team’s robot companion HERBIE will also appear as a map item, with heroes needing to escort the little guy through the vampire-infested NYC. Making the Fantastic Four the focus of the first full chapter of Rivals’ overarching narrative shows how important they should be to every version of the Marvel universe.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Most Anticipated Comics of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It took some time, but with the Fantastic Four now back in movies, comics and games, hopefully we never again have to go through an extended period without Marvel’s First Family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we round up the current deluge of leaks surrounding Nintendo's under-wraps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">Nintendo has now acknowledged</a> the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">dummy Switch 2 models are being publicly shown off</a> by accessories manufacturers, and while these may not be based on access to the actual system, there's little doubt now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-switch-2-leaks-suggest-microsd-express-support-lack-of-switch-1-dock-compatibility">we've seen the gist</a>. (Even Nintendo is saying the leaks are "not official" rather than simply inaccurate.) A full reveal now feels  imminent.</p>
<p>Also this week, we discuss the increasingly troubled Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft, which has just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">delayed the series' next entry for a second time</a> while it issues cryptic messages suggesting the company is about to be taken private, sold, or something else just as monumental. What is going on - and how has <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> become the most pivotal game in Ubisoft's history? Joining me this week to discuss are Ed Nightinale, Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>

            <p>If it seems like only last week that I was complaining there were too many gigantic space games, that's because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spacecraft-is-aiming-for-the-gap-between-starfield-satisfactory-and-eve-online">it was only last week</a>. Since then, I have written about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-engineers">Space Engineers</a> 2, because I am nothing if not a creature of contradictions. Now, here I am writing about Era One. In my defence, it's all your fault. Specifically, it's TheGreatOneSea's fault. They left a comment about Era One on our list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">most-anticipated 2025 games</a>, and reader, I Googled.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It turns out that Era One is Homeworld, but you can clip together your own fleets like LEGO models. "It's Homeworld, but" is a formulation that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nebulous-fleet-command">unfailingly gets my hyperdrive humming</a>, and in this case, the developers are the modding team behind celebrated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-2">Homeworld 2</a> mod the Complex. They also helped Gearbox with Homeworld Remastered. Yes, I still have space in my life for this space sim. But it's the last one, you hear? None of you better recommend anything else in the comments. I'm serious. I will cry.</p>

<p>What excites me about Era One is actually the sound design. There's a particular grade of radio chatter I associate with Homeworld, a special blend of tinniness and white noise that makes even the most routine NPC dialogue sound a little sinister, a little inhuman. Era One very much has that. It also has, oh, so many ship modules. Here's some blurb to wash down that trailer.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Era One is an innovative space-themed game that empowers players to build their own fleet from scratch. Starting with a primary core ship or base, you'll have the freedom to construct a diverse range of capital ships, stations, floating bases, and even cities. This is made possible through the assembly of modules (referred to as cubes or bricks) that, when combined in a 3D space, give shape and function to your ship or base. </p>
<p>"Various types of modules will be available, each serving a specific purpose. For instance, basic modules will focus on structural integrity and customization, offering numerous variants that may expand in the future. Dedicated modules will handle resource loading, unloading, storage, and energy production. Hangar modules will enable the creation of fighters, cruisers, battleships, while other modules will manage your population, offensive and defensive weaponry, and subsystems." </p></blockquote>
<p>The developers classify Era One as "a spaceship builder and survival game set in an RTS environment". If you're fretting that it all sounds too sandboxy, there's a story component as well, though it's not clear from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2509200/ERA_ONE/">the Steam page</a> how elaborate the campaign options will be. </p>

<p>"From the ashes of a shattered universe, a young woman's quest for salvation sparks a journey of intrigue, danger, and discovery," explains the blurb. The short version is that Earth's resources have been depleted, and humans are now scattered across the solar system, warring over scraps. Genetic modification is rife, political upheaval abounds, and many people now live in space cities called "Navi Mondo". Somebody called Alya De Shars has stolen a power source and is embarked on a secret mission to find "a fresh beginning beyond the solar system". Honestly, I find the worldbuilding a bit of an undecided stew, but the premise of a fateful voyage is very Homeworldy.</p>
<p>Era One launches on 20th February. If you'd rather not build your own ships, and you like hiding behind planets, you might prefer to keep an eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1280190/Falling_Frontier/">Falling Frontier</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2’s selection of editions can’t come soon enough for long-time fans. It’s a chance to separate the casual audience from the hardcore players who adore the hardcore gameplay.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has provided a delectable selection of treats, depending on which Deliverance 2 edition you pick up. From a traditional Standard Edition to the pricey but prize-ridden Collector’s Edition, there’s something for everyone. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> has a lot of pressure to perform after the massive success of the debut title, but I’d argue that so do its launch-day editions.</p>



<p>Everyone has a Collector’s Edition nowadays, and it’s up to the team to make Deliverance 2’s special. Let’s find out if it is.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-edition">Every Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Edition</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re coming for at least one of those editions. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has three editions to choose from and pre-order: <strong>Collector’s Edition</strong>, <strong>Gold Edition</strong>, and <strong>Standard Edition</strong>.</p>



<p>I’m not shocked to see <a href="https://www.kingdomcomerpg.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deliverance 2</a> has three main editions. Occasionally, four editions might be seen for a new game, but a Standard Edition, a Collector’s Edition, and something in-between is the norm.</p>

<figure><figcaption>That’s a lot of goodies. Credit to Warhorse Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-collectors-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Collector’s Edition</a> is the ultimate bundle for fans as it comes with the game, a physical statue, digital bonuses, and a whole host of other smaller tangible tidbits.</p>



<p>It costs <strong>$199.99 </strong>or <strong>£189.99</strong>, and while this is expensive, I’ve seen much worse for Collector’s Editions. Its price tag can be ignored though as these super-duper editions always have enough demand to make their availability scarce. If you want your own, you better be quick.</p>



<p>Here’s the complete list of contents for the Collector’s Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Henry &amp; Pebbles 30cm Statue.</li>



<li>Letter of Hope.</li>



<li>The King’s Rebels Collectable Cards.</li>



<li>Coats of Valor: Enamel Pin Set.</li>



<li>Alleys of Kuttenberg.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit (digital content).</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gold-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Gold Edition Explained</h2>



<p>The Gold Edition is the middle ground, offering a slightly more lucrative package than the Standard Edition, but costing considerably less than the Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>This is for users wanting to show their support for Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and wanting some half-decent content in the process. The extra goodies here are digital-only though, so bear this in mind if you’re after physical memorabilia. You’re looking at <strong>$89.99</strong> or <strong>£79.99</strong> here for a purchase.</p>



<p>This is the full set of goodies in the Gold Edition:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC.</li>



<li>Expansion Pass for post-launch DLC.</li>



<li>Gallant Huntman’s Kit.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-standard-edition-explained">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2—Standard Edition Explained</h2>



<p>Finally, the Standard Edition is a routine copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 with no extra thrills or spills.</p>



<p>If you’re eager, you can secure the pre-order bonus if you order ahead of its launch. This at least secures you a bit of extra content you wouldn’t get otherwise—and it costs <strong>$69.99</strong> or <strong>£59.99</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s a smaller list, but this is the full inventory included:</p>



<ul>
<li>A copy of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</li>



<li>“The Lion’s Quest” Bonus Quest pre-order DLC (If you pre-order).</li>
</ul>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/infinity-nikki">Infinity Nikki</a> developer Papergames has ushered in the new year with word on a range of improvements and optimisations it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit.
</p>
<p>
According to a <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/news/72">freshly shared post on the Infinity Nikki website</a>, Papergames' plans for the open-world action-adventure have been formulated after gathering "millions of suggestions" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the "optimisations" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a "significant challenge that must be addressed".
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, it's hoping to not only improve frame rates but introduce a 60fps mode on mobile, but it says these efforts to "push the performance limits of current mobile devices while using Unreal Engine 5... will require a long-term and continuous optimisation process."
</p>
<p>
"Optimising graphics is one of our top priorities," it adds. "Efforts to boost graphics quality, address lag, and optimise power consumption are ongoing for all devices."
</p>

<p>
Broader optimisation work is also promised, with Papergames highlighting improvements to Infinity Nikki's Purification aiming system - including fine-tuning of collision sensitivity - to make it easier to hit enemies at close range and with varying height differences.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, there's talk of precise tracking improvements for the game's mini-map so items tracked using the feature will be easier to locate. Papergames is also working on an overhaul of Infinity Nikki's prologue that'll address overly long processes and unclear tutorials it believes are preventing players from engaging with the world. "We don't want the 'first encounter' to be filled with memories of getting lost, confusion, frustration, and failure," it notes.
</p><p>
Additionally, PC key binding customisation is in the works, as are automatic high-score recommendations for outfits, and improved controls for the Whimcycle on mobile devices. These'll take the form of two new control schemes - a joystick and button combo, plus a single joystick mode - with players able to select their preferred set-up in the options menu. Sticking with the Whimcycle, Papergames has confirmed it's issuing an update so bikes - which will soon be available for use in areas beyond the Breezy Meadow - no longer vanish from beneath riders whenever they connect with water, and will instead respawn players in riding mode. Eurogamer's Lottie Lynn is particularly delighted with that one.
</p>
<p>
And finally, all material refresh times are being fixed to 4am daily. I've been reliably informed this should help make <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-how-to-get-silvergales-aria-outfit-craft-make">acquiring items for the likes of the Silvergale's Aria outfit</a> "slighty easier".
</p>
<p>
As for new features a little futher out, Papergames says a vertical photo mode is coming in "future versions", as is Esseling tracking, plus group photos and interactive poses with Momo. "We are committed to delivering more meaningful improvements," the studio concludes. "Let's light up the new year together with Infinity Nikki!"
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's Jessica Orr had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review">four star review</a> last year, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly."

		<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is an inherently quite intimidating game. A lot of that is built off the reputation of the original, and much like the first game, it’s as close as we can really get to a medieval Europe simulator, albeit with the kind of fairytale character arc as you go from being a peasant to holding a fairly significant and influential position alongside those of noble blood. Your path is up to you, whether you play as a wholly honest and loyal subject, or rob and steal your way through the world to amass wealth, but whatever your choice here, it’s going to be a challenge.</p>
<p>In my time with the game so far, I have spent two hours being killed by three bandits time and again because one of them was in plate armour. I was convinced I almost had him and his two friends, but in actual fact was barely damaging him at all with my pathetic little hunting sword. These are randomly occurring bandits who just happened to appear on the way of my quest objective – they don’t even have real names. Like I said, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a> is as intimidating as its name is odd.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Final Preview on PS5 Pro –&nbsp;Use mace on bandits in this medieval sim" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pCblr7pQt0A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game puts you back into Henry’s shoes, picking up after the events of the first game as he and Sir Hans Capon travel to deliver a letter of peace and alliance to Trosky Castle. Naturally, things go awry quite quickly and you lose the message, your armour, your weapons, and all of the other men in Sir Hans’ retinue. Without all your fancy looking armour, you can’t get into the castle to see the Lord and if you could, you’ve lost the official letter anyway. Retreating to the village of Troskowitz, you’re separated from Hans after falling out over his classic spoilt rich brat breakdown, leaving you to get into contact with the Lord of Trosky Castle all by yourself. That’s trickier than it already sounds when he rides off into the distance with a retinue.</p>
<p>Wearing your beggar’s clothes, you’ll have a hard time getting much done, but I was able to find a job at a blacksmith who also gave me somewhere to sleep so I could save my game without drinking Saviour Schnapps. I quickly set about trying to find my lost dog, Mutt, and found myself tumbling through a comedy of errors. First I wandered around the area he was supposed to be and was torn to pieces by wolves in the pitch black of night, then I did some stuff that eventually led to me finding out that Mutt was, in fact, likely with those wolves and I just didn’t notice whilst they were killing me.</p>

<p>Ten hours of game later, I went back to this place to face off against these wolves, better armoured, weaponed, and skilled, only for the aforementioned three bandits, only able to defeat the one in plate armour after two hours of repeated deaths once I gave up and left to get a nice big mace that. I’ll soon use for my sweet revenge and then finally get my dog back.</p>

<p>I don’t even have a horse yet, unless you count the one I stole after I saw its owner get murdered by a bandit. Obviously I avenged his death and took his horse as a postmortem payment, but even the horse fence wanted more than a thousand gold to make the horse be summonable and not considered itself stolen – horses, as we all know, are very litigious and want to see paperwork in triplicate before. Instead I sold the horse for 300 Groschen and went back to walking everywhere for the time being.</p>
<p>Thankfully, KCD2 is a very, very good looking game when it isn’t night time and you can actually see. Even facial expressions are particularly detailed, though more so with Henry. There are moments in this game where you could swear that the landscape you’re looking at is real. It’s gorgeous enough that just strolling through nature is quite pleasant. Until the bandits attack, obviously.</p>

<p>The fact that many of these eccentricities can’t be found in other games due to fear of narrowing its target audience is part of the attraction here. This is a grown up game that won’t really sugarcoat your failures or streamline things to make it easier for you. It instead feels like an immersive sim of medieval Europe. If you’re not going to take that on board and engage with that idea, you’re going to struggle constantly, but if that’s your thing and you enjoy existing in a convincing rendition of the real world, this is probably going to be one of the best games out there for your tastes.</p>
<p>There’s still some minor quirks that we hope are addressed with a patch in time for launch – KCD2 went gold in early December, and we’ve been provided with a review build roughly a month before release, so there’s plenty time for a further polish update. The aspect that most affects the believability of the world is how inconsistently characters will react to you. They’ll often vacillating between being generally friendly and angry at your mere presence between interactions, or sometimes even in the same conversation.</p>
<div id="attachment_455908"><p id="caption-attachment-455908">This was literally 2 minutes after he hired me…</p></div>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 seems like an uncompromising marvel. It’s slavishly devoted to realism and accuracy in a way that likely makes it a very niche game, as working out how to do things can be difficult and requires real attention and care. Then again, that was exactly what drew millions to the first game, and as those fans will attest, it’s also incredibly rewarding. The first time I finished a quest that involved combat without it feeling like too much trouble I physically punched the air in celebration, and when I finally reached the blacksmith, got a job, and forged myself a new sword I was grinning from ear to ear. This is a unique game that turns being a peasant in medieval times into an enjoyable experience. Ironically, perhaps.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-dei/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games will not integrate DEI elements in their games to maximize player enjoyment and commercial success after having observed the high commercial risk these elements can present.</p>
<p>During a recent <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/czaty-inwestorskie/20250108/ci-games-marek-tyminski">investor chat</a>, the studio was asked about their stance on DEI in gaming. Global Marketing Director Ryan Hill confirmed that the studio remains committed to producing player-first video games that prioritize excellent user experience with compelling themes and characters created specifically for <em>"core and adjacent audiences"</em>. While some recent video games have taken the opportunity to implement <em>"social and political agendas"</em> within their experiences, Hill continued, the lower than expected commercial performance of some of these games shows that many players do not appreciate these elements. As such, the studio will continue to develop experiences that maximize player enjoyment and commercial success.</p>
<p>In the same investor chat, Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games talked about what's <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/">next for the game and the franchise as a whole</a>, confirming the game released in 2023 will continue to receive updates up to version 2.0. Development of the sequel is also proceeding, and extensive play testing will be conducted in 2025.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game, which has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-update-1-7-improves-combat-fluidity-adds-npc-summons/">improved</a> quite a bit since its release, in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Lords of the Fallen boasts impressive visuals and an interesting story for a soulslike, but unfortunately, that's where the praise ends. Despite functional gameplay and a well-designed world, the experience is marred by frustrating combat mechanics, subpar enemy placement, and an overall lack of polish, making it one of the most frustrating soulslikes ever released.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-clamps-down-on-mods-with-season-1s-arrival.1079145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>developer NetEase appears to have clamped down on the use of skin mods within the game in its latest update, effectively banning users from changing characters' skins with mods outright.</p>

<p>Per an IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the latest season of the game has added a process called "asset hash checking" to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which is essentially a way for the game to check whether assets are legit or not.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that any unauthorized user mods, such as the one that turns Iron Man into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dragon Ball</em>'s Vegeta</a> or the one that gives Guardian of the Galaxy Mantis a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/435" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">decidedly goth bent</a>, are no longer valid as far as&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is concerned.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown-mantis.jpg?itok=RG2Ln1V5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown-mantis.jpg?itok=Yyq4HoS- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, modders. Your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>Mantis goth mod won't work anymore. Image courtesy of svanax's mod on Nexus Mods.</figcaption></figure><p>As IGN points out, modding has always been against&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' terms of service, and NetEase itself has warned players against using mods to change their skins or do anything else unauthorized within the game.</p>

<p>In a statement to IGN, NetEase says it doesn't recommend modifying game files, because doing so "carries the risk of getting banned". It doesn't seem to provide any official confirmation that asset hash checking has been added.</p>

<p>It is, of course, entirely possible that enterprising modders (and is there any other kind?) will find a way around this latest setback. For the time being, however, you'll have to shelve your&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>mods if you don't want to get banned.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer hero shooter developed by Chinese studio NetEase and heavily inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>.</p>




<p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">in March last year</a>, the free-to-play game was released in December, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">hit 10 million players within a 72-hour period</a>. Of course, it's free-to-play, so many of those players may not be repeat customers, but it's still an impressive number.</p>

Stevenson was a highlight of the show’s first season, presenting a noble but twisted former Jedi warrior who had turned Sith mercenary after surviving Order 66, the directive which killed most of the rest of Jedi order in the prequel trilogy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has been a long time in the making. It has been almost seven years since the release of the first game, pushed to market following a Kickstarter campaign that raised $1.3 million in just one month. On February 4, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 will be released, and I’ve been lucky enough to piece together a preview of the game.</p>



<p>I’m a huge fan of the first title, which was steeped in historical accuracy, featured gruelling mechanics, and had an authentic story that left you feeling immersed and challenged in equal amounts. All that and more awaits you in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>Here’s my full preview – it’s an exploration of a cinematic masterpiece in progress.</p>



<p>If you’d prefer, you can watch the full preview in video format:</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-world">Enter the World</h2>



<p>I can’t stress how immersive I’m already finding Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 to be. With a surround-sound headset, I’m traipsing through summertime forests and fields, hearing the leaves and brush crunch under my feet while birds twitter above me in the canopy. The light’s rays pierce the branches, splashing a burst against a nearby stag, who catches my scent and scarpers through the trees.</p>



<p>Perhaps I’ll hunt later.</p>



<p>In the next moment, I’m on a beaten path flanked by a twinkling stream, which would be idyllic if I wasn’t being held up by cutthroats. They demand my Groschen; I simply plead with them to leave me alone, for I have nothing.</p>



<p>They don’t care, and in a flash, I’m on my back.</p>



<p>After a reload, I’m in a nearby village, watching a fight break out between two shopkeepers, for whatever reason. The townspeople gather to watch the spectacle as I turn tail and walk down the path, avoiding making eye contact because I’m not familiar with the residents and they are inherently mistrusting of me because of a recent tavern brawl.</p>



<p>That’s how granular Warhorse Studios has made Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>From the reputation system to how the AI treats items you’ve dropped, and from manually smithing a sword step-by-step to needing to dry herbs and smoke meat to preserve everything, the finest details and all the most monumental moments alike have been considered by the studio in this awe-inspiring game.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning.</p>



<h2 id="h-henry-returns">Henry Returns</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Henry of Skalitz (Tom McKay) is one of my favourite game characters of all time. His ascendance in the first game was nothing short of memorable, with his rags-to-riches story capturing perfectly the true grit of a survivor hellbent on turning around his ill fortune.</p>



<p>Henry returns in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, flanked by Sir Hans Capon (Luke Dale), his trusty companion – a brash, cocky counterpart with a sense of swagger as large as the fortune that sits in his family’s coffers.</p>



<p><em>Audentes fortuna iuvat</em>, and all that.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 sees our troubled duo land in hot water within a few minutes of the game’s opening sequences, left for dead after a skirmish and a near-naked chase through the night. The game’s deeply cinematic introduction left my mouth agape – everything from the soundtrack to the way the camera pans over medieval vistas blew my hair back right off the bat.</p>



<p>Immediately, McKay and Dale deliver stellar performances, perfectly representing the chemistry they’ve built up both on- and off-screen over the years. There’s humour, there’s intensity, and for the first three or four hours, there’s… Well, the typical tutorial missions you’d expect from a game like this – but it’s all <strong>great</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’ve never even heard of Kingdom Come Deliverance, you’ll enter the second game unsure of what to expect, but after a few hours settling into the ambitious open-world RPG, you’ll be chomping at the bit to explore, grow as a character, and pursue the winding, branching story.</p>



<h2 id="h-evolution-at-its-finest">Evolution at its Finest</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The first Kingdom Come Deliverance game was a marvel – but it was rough around the edges at times. It felt a little sluggish, there were a fair few bugs to deal with, and occasionally, it felt a bit <strong>too </strong>challenging. It’s not a game that holds your hand, but sometimes the difficulty level felt a bit too punishing for the average gamer.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 retains that obvious challenge in the earliest sequences of the game, presenting players with a dire set of circumstances that take them from being a lauded nobleman to little more than a peasant begging for scraps. Where you once had a fine set of armour and a razor-sharp sword, you now have rags and bloodied knuckles.</p>



<p>That’s the welcome you get in KCD2 – but it’s phenomenal.</p>



<p>For those new to the franchise, you’re starting at the beginning, building Henry of Skalitz from the ground up and shaping him into what you want, and Warhorse Studios has done such a perfect job of explaining <strong>why </strong>that’s happening. This is an RPG at heart, and from the skill paths to the way you build your character based on your desired fighting style, everything is manipulated and experienced by you, the player.</p>



<p>For my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I worked my way through the first ten hours or so of the game, but that was enough time to see that Warhorse has taken everything from the first game that I loved and improved upon it immeasurably – an evolution indeed.</p>



<p>Visually, the game is <strong>stunning</strong>. The audio palette is sumptuous and realistic, the movement mechanics are much smoother and more satisfying than the first game, and combat has been toned down a bit and optimised. The game’s AI is believable, interactive, and sensible, and the world around you feels as though it exists.</p>



<p>Of course, it helps that it’s rooted in history and authenticity – Warhorse made sure to employ the sharpest experts to make sure everything from swinging a sword to the behaviour of the local farmers is correct to the game’s period.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, I’m having no issues. I’m playing KCD2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-specs-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a high-end gaming PC</a> with a controller, and running it at Ultra 1440p is giving me no concerns about the game’s stability. It’s buttery smooth and (almost entirely) bug-free.</p>



<h2 id="h-forge-your-story">Forge Your Story</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I spoke to Tom McKay</a>, the actor behind Henry of Skalitz, he let me know about the depth of the choice and consequence system in this game. As I explored the opening sequences, piecing together the steps for my Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview, I became aware of just how impactful even a passing comment in a conversation could be.</p>



<p>The world is truly what you make of it, and if you want your Henry of Skalitz to be a conniving, manipulating criminal, then so be it. If you’d rather be a stalwart and honest member of the wider community in the open world of KCD2, then you’re free to do that as well.</p>



<p>As you explore the game and mould your character, you’ll come to experience intense fights, incredibly cinematic cutscenes – all of which are fully acted – and at times, a slower pacing that makes you feel as though you’ve been teleported back in time by a few hundred years.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 starts as a very slow burner. You might not even hit the title flash for a good while, depending on your play style. It’s designed to give all players a solid introduction, a spread of the backstory, and a tutorial for the game’s many mechanics. It’s nice – it feels natural and entertaining, and the best way to learn is by doing, so I was more than happy to crack on with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-long-to-wait">Not Long to Wait</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be released worldwide</a> on February 4, 2025. That’s just a few weeks away – and until then, I’ll be neck-deep in the game, exploring every nook and cranny in preparation for my full review, which you’ll find here on Insider Gaming on February 3.</p>



<p>I hope you’ve enjoyed this brief Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 preview – stay tuned for more coverage as the game’s release date draws closer, and as always, stop by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to chat about the game.</p>

                <p>When Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles was released nearly 25 years ago, it featured a roster of heroes--and a few villains--from Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Menace. Jar Jar Binks was not among the playable characters in the game's original form, but he will be featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/24-year-old-star-wars-game-coming-to-modern-consoles/1100-6527092/" data-ref-id="1100-6527092">the game's upcoming release</a> on modern consoles. In the reveal trailer below, Jar Jar finally gets a chance to become an action hero.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQsFR66qYU4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rQsFR66qYU4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Jar Jar shows far more skill and fighting prowess in that trailer than he ever displayed in The Phantom Menace or any of his subsequent appearances. Regardless, Jar Jar's ridiculous side is also on full display when he runs away from a pack of charging animals on Naboo. Courage was never Jar Jar's strong suit, but it might be fun to play all the way through the game as this unsung hero.</p><p>Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn are the two primary controllable characters in Power Battles. However, the game will also allow players to use Mace Windu, Plo Koon, Adi Gallia, Queen Padme Amidala, Captain Panaka, Ki-Adi Mundi, a battle droid, and Darth Maul. It's also been tweaked by developer Aspyr to give the Jedi screen-accurate depictions of their respective lightsaber colors. For example, that means Mace Windu will be getting his purple lightsaber.</p><p>Players will be able to fight each other in Power Battles' Versus mode, or they can face the Trade Federation side-by-side in co-op gameplay. This release will also feature Big Head Mode and other cheats that can be used during the main game.</p><p>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles will hit Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on January 23, 2025. If the game follows the same pattern as Aspyr's previous Star Wars games, there may eventually be a physical edition available through Limited Run Games as well.

Look for both of those fixes when Season 02 launches on Jan. 28.</em></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> today receives its fourth major update as early access continues, bringing a new bridge-building mechanic, bug fixes, and some experimental changes.</p>
<p>The bridge-building utilises the same road-building tool and arrives alongside two new maps, one of which includes a huge river, making bridges a necessity. Another watery addition is a stone well upgrade with increased water supply, while taverns can also be upgraded to level two.</p>
<p>Another new feature is an additional Overstock setting, which allows users to control the amount of extra goods placed in stalls or the tavern to exceed what's currently needed.</p>

<p>These additions come alongside a huge number of bug fixes, crashfixes, performance boosts, and more.</p>
<p>There are some experimental changes too, including a rework of cliffs to ensure they're less ambiguous (plus fixed pathfinding errors); changes to building costs to encourage more diverse resource use; amending food consumption to consume all types equally; and changing region strength selection so regions are picked from a finite pool to ensure necessary resources are available.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for this update, 0.8.024, can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/534338967351329253">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Manor Lords is available now on PC across Steam, GOG, Epic, Microsoft, and on PC Game Pass.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for its 1.0 release, though updates such as this prove developer Slavic Magic is hard at work.</p>
<p>"There's a confidence to Manor Lords that belies its one-person development, and what's there can be spellbinding, but it's a pastoral idyll that still needs significant development," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-early-access-review-beautiful-foundations-but-missing-important-pieces">Manor Lords early access review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/us-government-agency-proposes-new-rule-to-protect-victims-of-scams-and-theft-involving-in-game-currency.1079106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-game-currency-rule-roblox<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a United States government agency tasked with ensuring that people are treated fairly by banks and financial institutions, proposed a new rule that targets, among other things, video games. In short, the Bureau is hoping to ensure that companies operating games with robust in-game currency marketplaces – think <em>Roblox </em>– actually help players struggling with unintended transactions, hacks, theft, and scams.&nbsp;</p><p>The CFPB explained its rationale in a post that it shared with Aftermath, noting that over time, some games have grown to function <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/issue-spotlight-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more like banking and payment systems</a>.</p><p>“Gamers – or in some cases their parents and guardians – have reported issues such as trouble when converting dollars to in-game currency, unauthorized transactions, account hacks and takeovers, theft, scams, and loss of assets,” the agency wrote. “They have also described receiving limited to no help from gaming companies and the banks or digital wallets involved. Refunds are often denied, people are finding their gaming accounts suspended by the video game company after a player tries to get a refund from their financial institution, or people are left caught in doom loops with AI-powered customer service representatives while they’re just trying to get straight answers.”</p><p>To help mitigate these issues, the CFPB is proposing an interpretive rule, meaning one that draws on preexisting laws rather than drawing up new ones. In this case, it aims to clarify that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Fund_Transfer_Act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Electronic Fund Transfer Act</a> – signed into law by Jimmy Carter in 1978 – extends to video game companies, as well as virtual currency wallets and credit card rewards points accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>“The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts,” wrote the CFPB.&nbsp;</p><p>The proposed interpretive rule, viewed by Aftermath, further specifies that it’s taking aim at accounts with features that include but are not limited to “paying for goods or services from multiple merchants, [the] ability to withdraw funds or obtain cash, or conducting person-to-person transfers.” This would seem to imply that games like <em>Roblox </em>and <em>Second Life </em>are covered, but a game like <em>Fortnite </em>– which does not allow any of the above – might not be. <em>Fortnite </em>in particular, it’s worth noting, used to do exactly what the CFPB is describing and ban accounts associated with chargebacks under the assumption of fraud, even if, say, the account holder purposefully initiated a chargeback to counteract an unwanted purchase (for example: a kid got their hands on a parent’s credit card and bought a bunch of V-Bucks). Epic has since <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/chargebacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amended its policy</a>.</p><p>The CFPB is seeking to bolster its proposal by collecting “experiences with gaming assets that are stored on their accounts and used for all sorts of transactions within these worlds, including the purchases of goods and services, converting dollars to in-game currency and back, and P2P transfers” as well as anecdotes about “the things that have gone wrong and how [players] have been affected when trying to get help.” So get in there and tell them about that time a person fraudulently obtained your credit card info and <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-vbucks-fraud-credit-card-bank-chargeback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used it to buy $100 worth of <em>Fortnite </em>items</a> (or whatever has happened to you).&nbsp;</p><p>The comment period runs until the end of March. Ideally, the CFPB will still be around to do something with those comments when the time comes, but it's far from guaranteed. Elon Musk, who incoming president Donald Trump selected to co-lead the newly-created and stupidly-named Department Of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musk-calls-abolishing-consumer-finance-watchdog-targeted-by-republicans-2024-11-27/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested that the CFPB should be eliminated</a>. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/california-wildfires-ces-generative-ai-nvidia-google"><h3>What Are We Even Doing Here?</h3></a><p>Wildfires rage in California while, one state over, tech giants brag about adding AI to everything</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-golden-needle-challenge-how-to-beat"><h3>Balatro’s Golden Needle Became A Prison</h3></a><p>Balatro's Golden Needle challenge, which requires both luck and skill, trapped me in a gameplay torment of my own creation.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will be among the Xbox games that will launch on other platforms in the near future, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking during a recent podcast, well-known insider <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NatetheHate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NateDrake</a> talked about the Xbox games that will launch this year on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2. Beyond the obvious, the insider confirmed he heard that Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator will launch on the other systems this year. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">yet-to-be-announced Oblivion remake, </a>which is supposedly launching this June, will be another game launching on consoles other than Xbox systems, although this is more speculation than an actual rumor based on the fact that there is no reason for the game not to be a multiplatform release. At the same time, the "loss" of two exclusives will be compensated with the release of Final Fantasy VII Remake and Rebirth, which will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively, not only on Xbox consoles but also on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox 2025 Predictions: Gears E-Day in 2025, FF7 Remake, BIG Switch 2 &amp; PS5 Games, Oblivion &amp; More" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIhoTirZxlk?start=3220&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Nintendo Switch 2 probably won't have much trouble running the Halo: The Master Chief Collection, it will be very interesting to see how the much more demanding Flight Simulator will run on the next Nintendo system. If recent rumors are any indication, these ports may be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dynamic-ai-upscaling-ports-xbox-series-s/">scaled-down versions of the Xbox Series S versions</a>, which would make sense considering the system is currently the less powerful current generation console.</p>
<p>The launch of Halo: The Master Chief Collection on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 would be a landmark moment for Microsoft, further highlighting the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-xbox-fans-are-being-redefined-into-enjoying-games-on-all-their-devices-i-feel-very-good-about-the-gaming-division/">shift in strategy. </a>Hopefully, it won't take much longer to know if PlayStation 5 and future Nintendo Switch 2 owners will be able to experience the first few entries in the series on their platform of choice.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Space Engineers 2 Steam Workshop Support Confirmed for Post-Launch Update]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-support-confirmed-for-post-launch-update.1079094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced that&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will, in fact, be using Steam Workshop as its main user-generated content platform.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1133870/view/527583567913419118" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Keen Software House CEO Marek Rosa says that the decision to switch to Steam Workshop came from "listening to our community, particularly our content creators, who have expressed a strong preference" for the platform.</p>

<p>The original plan, according to Rosa, was to use Mod.io, which Rosa says was "driven by the goal of providing a unified backend" for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s PC and console versions. However, user feedback subsequently "made it clear" that Steam Workshop was the preferred direction.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=p7SAGgLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-steam-workshop-astronauts.jpg?itok=xTKQW9up 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content will primarily use Steam Workshop, it's been announced.</figcaption></figure><p>Rosa goes on to say that Steam Workshop support will be added for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>'s user-generated content in the game's first major post-launch patch, which will arrive after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">planned Early Access launch on January 27th</a>.</p>

<p>As for console players, Rosa says he and Keen Software House are currently "evaluating the best approach" when it comes to console-based user-generated content, and that the studio will "share more details as we progress".</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://2.spaceengineersgame.com/roadmap-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap</a> has also been updated to reflect the Steam Workshop decision, with Vertical Slice 1.1 now connecting the in-game workshop to Steam Workshop rather than Mod.io.</p>

<p>Future Vertical Slices for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will bring the likes of improved gameplay mechanics, support for modding via the VRAGE Editor, and the opportunity to explore individual planets, plus lots more.</p>




<p>As you can probably guess,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>. It expands the original's sandbox gameplay with new blueprint tools, new gameplay systems, and plenty more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead of a mostly single-player campaign like its predecessor, the spin-off focuses on co-op play between three players (or you can play solo) as they take on successive waves of tough enemies and bosses through a day-and-night cycle, while exploring a randomized version of the original game’s open-world map. </p><p>It’s going to be a $40 release and feels a bit like FromSoftware drew inspiration from various PC mods that turned <em>Elden Ring</em> more into a survival roguelite than a traditional action-RPG. The combat shown in the initial trailers also looks like it will be faster, flashier, and more dynamic than the version in <em>Elden Ring</em> proper. Some lucky players will find out soon enough when they go hands-on with the game in next month’s network tests. And while those are only for current-gen consoles, the full game will be on PC as well as PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p>.﻿<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was announced at The Game Awards 2024 with a debut trailer, below, and a 2025 release window.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The network test will allow three players to team up and take their chosen Nightfarers to battle "against new terrors, and explore an ever-changing map to defeat increasingly challenging bosses and ultimately take on the Nightlord," Bandai Namco added, before confirming the network test features a three day-and-night cycle squads must try to outlast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>The all-new adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign begins at the Roundtable Hold, set in a universe parallel to the events of Elden Ring. Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, an ever-changing environment, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide.</blockquote><blockquote>At the end of each night, players will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate in the third night when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat. Unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</blockquote><blockquote>Elden Ring Nightreign is unlike any experience created before by FromSoftware, Inc. In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards, and Limveld itself are ever-shifting and evolving with each new session. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Finding Sites of Grace gives each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Nightfarer in this parallel world.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year IGN had the opportunity to visit FromSoftware and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-we-played-it"><u>go hands-on with an early build of Elden Ring Nightreign</u></a>.
