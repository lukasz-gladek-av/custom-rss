            <p>
Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater's release date appears to have been leaked by GameStop.
</p>
<p>
In a now-deleted social post, the US retailer listed the release date as 17th November, alongside a pre-order option.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fresh-gameplay-of-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Fresh gameplay of the remake was shown at the Xbox Games Showcase</a> on Sunday night, but no specific release date was provided - although it's expected in 2024 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-gives-2024-release-window-to-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-and-silent-hill-2-remake">thanks to a PlayStation blog</a>.

<p>

Konami has also released a new video, hosted by Snake voice actor David Hayter, providing new details on the game.
</p>
<p>
For instance, the level of detail in the visuals mean scrapes, scratches and bruises will mar Snake in real time, plus injuries will now be permanent throughout the game.

<p>
Delta will also come with two playstyles. The first, Legacy Style, offers the overhead camera and controls of the original game, while New Style has a fully controllable third-person camera - likely equivalent to the original's Subsistence re-release.
</p>
<p>
The video includes an interview with producer Noriaki Okamura, who apologised for the poor state of the Metal Gear Solid Master Collection on release.
</p>
<p>
"Now, when [the collection] was released, we got a lot of unhappy feedback, where people were struggling with bugs and playability issues, and issues with the resolution," said Okamura. "And we're very sorry that the game wasn't up to standards. But, we're still continuing to update and improve the game to address these issues."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "We want everyone to still be enjoying Metal Gear, and this compilation, even 10, 20 years from now, so we hope everyone will give us a little more time to get it there."

<p>
Okamura also discussed who's left from the original team to work on the Snake Eater remake - not Kojima, that's for sure.
</p>
<p>
"Myself included, there are still plenty of people on the team who were part of the original games," he said. "Everyone who is no longer working on Metal Gear is pursuing their own path now, and that's going to remain the case for these titles."
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Okamura had a message for the fans, essentially asking them to hold the team to account.
</p>
<p>
"We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going," he said. "So please, keep watching, and keep us honest."
</p>
<p>
Fans certainly will, as many have complained about the visuals of the remake. Though technically impressive, the higher fidelity removes some of the unique style of the original.
</p>
<p>
This thread on social media site X, for instance, has comparison gifs between the original and remake and while the shot-for-shot recreation is faithful, the visual tone is distinct.

			<p>Ubisoft Massive may be busy with Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-the-sky-breaker-story-pack-is-out-on-july-16/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLCs</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-gameplay-ubisoft-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, but they're also still updating The Division 2. The studio has now unveiled the content that will be added to the game in its sixth post-launch year.</p>
<p>The first season is called First Rogue and lands today on all platforms. In the new story, players will need to track down Agent Kelso. Arguably the most important change brought by the season is the endgame revamp, though:</p>
<p><em>All owners of Tom Clancy’s The Division 2 will now be able to level up their characters to level 40 without need of owning Warlords of New York. Players will be able to keep leveling their characters beyond 30 in the streets of Washington DC and reach the level 40 cap without any additional purchase. Upon reaching level 40, the entirety of the endgame will be available to them. This includes all level 40 items implemented in the past years, Seasons and all their activities (Leagues, Global Events, Apparel Events, Manhunts – including the new Y6S1 First Rogue Manhunt), level 40 Game Modes (The Summit, Countdown) and the recently implemented Incursion, Paradise Lost.</em></p>
<p>Year 6 Season 2 will introduce a revamp of The Division 2's season system, which will now feature dedicated seasonal characters.</p>
<p><em>Each season is meant to be experienced from level 1, featuring a fully revamped and accelerated progression designed to swiftly guide players to the endgame while gradually introducing all game mechanics to prepare them for level 40. Seasons will offer a flexible structure, allowing players to progress in many ways, but also provide clear guidance with a series of objectives and projects to accompany players through their progression journey. </em><em>To create and maintain an ever-fresh experience, each season will introduce a new set of gameplay modifiers, enabling new playstyles and challenges that will require a reevaluation of established strategies and builds.</em></p>
<p>When seasons end, any earned XP and rewards will be transferred to your main characters, while seasonal characters are added to the roster.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division 2 - Year 6 Deep Dive | Ubisoft Forward" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DUFOhxfGuwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A new The Division 2 story DLC will be released in 2025, bringing players back to New York's Manhattan. Moreover, next year, the developers aim to add several enhancements to character customization features.</p>

One comment confirmed The Veilguard will give players six factions to choose from when creating their character, all with “deep roots in Thedas.” Three examples were provided: Antivan Crows, Gray Wardens, and Shadow Dragons.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 FACTIONS TO CHOOSE FOR OUR PLAYER HERO!!!!! <a href="https://t.co/z5cI0wDqYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/z5cI0wDqYT</a></p>— Jackdaw 🐦 (@JackdawYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackdawYT/status/1800249581361406392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These examples harken back to previous Dragon Age games, with mention of the Gray Wardens in particular rekindling memories of the much-loved first Dragon Age game, subtitled Origins. In that 2009 RPG, the player character is recruited into the Grey Wardens, an ancient order that fights the Darkspawn. Some fans are now speculating that The Veilguard will let players play through their faction’s backstory, as Origins did to great effect, but this is unconfirmed for now.</p><p>Elsewhere, BioWare confirmed players can customize their Inquisitor from the Dragon Age: Inquisition story in the Veilguard character creator, and "make a few key decisions that will impact how The Veilguard begins." This suggests Dragon Age fans' Inquisitor will make an appearance in The Veilguard in some capacity. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE INQUISITOR IS COMING BACK AND WE WILL CREATE THEM AT THE START OF DA:TV!!! 😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/1UJKsVRFET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1UJKsVRFET</a></p>— Jackdaw 🐦 (@JackdawYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/JackdawYT/status/1800248048146403511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>And finally, it is confirmed that fan-favorite character Scout Harding is a romance option. This comes as little surprise given Harding is one of seven companions in The Veilguard.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/11/gpvn5fqxiaaleks-1718099229998.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>BioWare released a new image of Scout Harding in The Veilguard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-update-1810-pulls-xtwitter-support-bringing-it-in-line-with-playstation-and-xbox<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-losing-xtwitter-integration">Nintendo had announced</a>, it has now pulled X/Twitter support from the Switch via a new firmware update.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch update 18.1.0</a>, out now, discontinues X/Twitter integration, which means a number of previously available social media sharing options are gone. Elsewhere, our old friend “General system stability” has seen improvements “to enhance the user's experience.”</p><p>The removal of X/Twitter integration from the Switch means all three major video game consoles now lack the sharing functionality they launched with, with Sony and Microsoft going first for PlayStation and Xbox in 2023. The decisions to remove support came after Elon Musk’s social media platform began charging more for business use of its API, the interface used by third-party developers to access Twitter data.</p><p>Nintendo didn't give an explicit reason for the removal of support, but big companies like it, Sony, and Microsoft could be charged around $42,000 a month to uphold integration, according to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wired</u></a>. It notably continued to support Facebook, however, which does not charge for using its API.</p><p>At the time Nintendo announced its plan to pull the integration from Switch, X/Twitter itself responded, insisting it was dedicated to enhancing the gaming community's experience on the social media platform and that it still has a strong relationship with Nintendo.</p><p>"The gaming community is one of the largest and most vibrant communities on our platform, and we are dedicated to enhancing and supporting gaming-related features," X/Twitter said in its own, now-deleted post.</p><p>"Our partnership with Nintendo remains strong, and we are working together to ensure a smooth transition for all users. We will continue collaborating with partners to bring new and exciting experiences to our global gaming community."</p><p>X/Twitter's API changes arrived in March 2023 and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/twitters-api-changes-appear-to-have-caused-microsoft-to-disable-xbox-console-screenshot-sharing"><u>Microsoft disabled Xbox integration in May</u></a> that year. Sony <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-is-losing-xtwitter-integration-next-week"><u>removed X/Twitter integration from PlayStation</u></a> in November, though like Nintendo, neither company referenced the API changes as a reason for doing so.</p><h2>Nintendo Switch update 18.1.0 patch notes:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>The following updates were made for the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discontinuation of X (formerly Twitter) integration</a>:<ul data-cy="list"><li>The option to “Post to Twitter” when sharing from the <strong>Album</strong> in the Nintendo Switch <strong>HOME Menu</strong> was removed.</li><li>The ability to post Super Smash Bros.

            <p>Activision has clarified Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 isn't 309GB after all - or at least, you can download the core of it for less.</p>
<p>This is despite Xbox's store page for the game stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-always-online-including-campaign-due-to-continuous-texture-streaming">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's install size is a rather chunky 309.85 GB</a>. This made many heads turn, because that seemed excessive.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Call of Duty team has now issued a correction with more detail. Writing on social media platform X, Activision stated the file size currently listed for Black Ops 6 "does not represent the download size or disk footprint" for its upcoming Call of Duty game.</p>
<p>"The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Warzone and all relevant content packs, including all localised languages combined which is not representative of a typical player install experience," it explained, before adding: "Players will be able to download Black Ops 6 at launch without downloading any other Call of Duty titles or all of the language packs."</p>
<p>The studio did not say what Black Ops 6's file size will actually be, however. Rather, it said it would share more details on this closer to the game's launch this autumn, so stay tuned.</p> <div>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-cod-2024-is-named-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">officially named last month</a>, after newspaper advertising spotted by fans pointed to its title. Soon after, Microsoft confirmed to Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier">Black Ops 6 will be available across Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members</a> on its debut.</p>

            <p>What a thrill! Oh, wait, actually no. It’s just a release date. We get those all the time. Still, I’m not entirely un-thrilled to learn that stealth <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> could be arriving as soon as the 17th of November this year, according to a hastily scrubbed X post by retailer GameStop. Thankfully, the folks at the (good, handsome) Ian Games Network <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-seemingly-leaks-via-gamestop">grabbed the offending information square</a> before it was deleted. Here’s said square:</p>

<p>As IGN point out, the 17th of November falls on a Sunday this year, which is an unusual day to release a game. Should the leak turn out correct, however, that would mean the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</a> remake releases exactly 20 years after the original. So that's one point for and one against, creating a sort of legitimacy equilibrium. This scans to me, as both Good Leakman and Bad Infoman would be fine names for Metal Gear bosses.</p>
<p>We got our first look at Delta <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-first-gameplay-shows-off-a-faithful-mgs3-remake-in-unreal-engine-5">last year</a>, and then another, better look at it over the weekend as part of the<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mgs-delta-gameplay-trailer-gives-a-first-eyeful-of-the-boss-and-earful-of-david-hayter-in-snake-eater-remake"> Xbox Games Showcase</a>. Yesterday, Konami put out a video featuring Snake voice actor David Hayter doing some marketing, and chatting to producer Noriaki Okamura, which you can find below.</p>

<p>The video felt a bit plastic and gross to me in ways I can’t quite articulate. Everyone loves Hayter, and Hayter evidently retains a lot of love for the series, so I’m not sure why they couldn’t have just had him speak like a human being instead of like he was trying to sell me some Cillit Bang. Still, it was good to hear his voice in the trailers, and I’m fully supportive of him getting that bag. From the interview, I got the strong impression that Konami intend to continue the series with original titles if the remakes are successful, although I imagine that’ll be a good few years off now. Whether we'll all be feasting on tree frogs or simply eating crow come November, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>The playable area in Caravan SandWitch’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024">Steam Next Fest</a> demo isn’t all that big, but within seconds you’re plonked at the rusty wheel of an offroading motorhome and let loose to roam it. It’s a figurative "Go nuts," and given how much more this narrative-heavy, third-person exploration yarn seemingly has to give, it's an attitude I’m seriously hoping holds firm throughout the full game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Your character, and lucky recipient of the aforementioned partyless party bus, is Sauge, a prodigal daughter of the planet Cigalo who’s returned home after picking up a distress call from her missing sister. That might sound like the setup for a hard sci-fi story but Caravan SandWitch keeps things light, warm, and dusty; if it weren’t for the holograms and van-mounted gadgetry, this little patch of Cigalo could pass for a ramshackle rural town here on Earth. Regardless, it’s dripping with tantalising mystery. Where’s your sister? Why is a spacefaring species living amid ruins? And who’s the tall lady in the hat, peeping you from afar then pulling a G-Man disappearing act whenever you get close?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Questions for another time, or at least another release date. But I’m already enjoying what’s here, especially the smoothness of Caravan SandWitch’s on-foot clambering and the chunky handling of its... well, caravan. In lieu of any combat, time pressures, or particularly challenging <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzles</a>, nailing the feel of manoeuvring through Cigalo’s decayed landscapes could go a long way in keeping the exploration engaging.</p>
<p>It also helps that Caravan SandWitch is a real looker, rich in colour and detail both. The latter, perhaps more so than you might expect from the debut project of a small indie outfit. If anything, this lushness makes it a little frustrating when the demo concludes just as you’re seemingly about to feast on its first real swooping vista. No, no! Let me keep cooing at your vast dustbowls and foreboding electrical storms, <em>game</em>.</p>

<p>Just to make that fade-to-black moment even thwarting, it occurs just as the map is clearly opening up, as well as immediately after completing a pretty unremarkable fetch quest based around scrounging circuitry. It’s all in service of building a giant resource-scanning tool to bolt on the van, which Xzibit never thought to do, but the demo just ends before you can get any meaningful use out of it. Which is vexing, but then, isn’t the whole point of a demo to leave you wanting more?</p>
<p>I certainly do, and with any luck I won’t have to wait too long, as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/">Caravan SandWitch’s Steam page</a> currently lists a 2024 release. You can download the demo yourself from there.</p>

<p data-characters="450" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Ubisoft Forward showcase on June 10 may have had some exciting new footage for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-outlaws-looks-like-an-authentic-open-world-adventure-staying-true-to-its-universe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws</a></em> and a reveal for the next <em>Anno</em> game, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/anno-117-pax-romana-will-let-you-build-ancient-roman-cities-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></em>, but one beloved Ubisoft IP was glaringly absent. Yes, once again, Ubisoft had nothing to say about the long-awaited <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, and not even the first game’s remaster was brought up. Naturally, fans of the series can’t help but be disappointed by the lack of news.</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">“We have lost again,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1dcv1va/we_have_lost_again_no_anniversary_edition_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one blunt Reddit post</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1dcv1va/comment/l80h7b5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a few other fans</a> saying they “expected nothing and [are] still let down.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1dcwg84/hello_darkness_my_old_friend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Another Reddit user</a> shared a saddening piece of art depicting Jade and Pey’j, the protagonists of the first <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, wistfully staring at a photo of Pey’j as he appears in one of the trailers for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>. Said post is appropriately captioned with the popular “Hello darkness, my old friend” meme.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Plenty of fans admitted they weren’t surprised by the complete lack of <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, but had at least thought the first game’s remaster would make an appearance. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1dcvvaa/no_remaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">One baffled fan</a> wrote, “I wasn’t expecting <em>BGE 2</em> in the Ubisoft Forward event, but no remaster is madness.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondgoodandevil/comments/1dcv1va/comment/l80nbt9/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Another concurred</a>, saying, “I cannot fathom why they wouldn’t even <em>mention</em> the anniversary edition–not even a teaser or vague release window? Such a shame.”</p>
 <p data-characters="720" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">The confusion from fans is warranted. The <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em> remaster was formally announced in November 2023 (after it had <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accidentally leaked online</a>), with Ubisoft promising to share more information in early 2024. We’re now in June, and there hasn’t been a single update on its release. Considering this remaster is being done to celebrate the original game’s 20th anniversary (which was in 2023), you’d think Ubisoft would want it out sooner rather than later. We do still have another six months left of 2024, so hopefully the remaster will still release before the end of the year, but it’s understandable why fans are worried about it given Ubisoft’s silence on the matter.</p>
 <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="false">As for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, who even knows what’s become of that project. Some consider the game vaporware at this point, with it being roughly seven years since its E3 2017 debut. It’s also <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/beyond-good-evil-2-most-delayed-aaa-game-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most delayed AAA game of all time</a>, surpassing the previous record holder, <em>Duke Nukem Forever</em>, in 2022. Given its continued absence at Ubisoft’s gaming showcases, I wouldn’t be surprised if the game has undergone some significant overhauls and will end up looking quite different to its initial reveal… assuming it ever actually releases.</p>

		<p>Given the number of games that our eyes and inboxes are now full of, it’s hard to pick out our favourites. That said, Empire of the Ants definitely has our attention. Based on the ant-filled novel from Bernard Werber, this is an RTS that focuses on the small stuff, and by small stuff we mean the life and trials of an ant, and the various insectoid creatures that they encounter and command.</p>
<p><iframe title="Empire of the Ants – Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gayRYRZoU-g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Built in Unreal Engine 5, the visuals are seriously impressive, looking as close to real life as we’re currently able to achieve. If you’ve played the indie RTS Empires of the Undergrowth, there are plenty of elements here that you’ll recognise, particularly the attacks by your ant troops, but as you’re playing a particular ant – that’s 103,683e if you want to be specific – it feels as though it may play more like Pikmin as you command your groups directly.</p>
<p>There’s also seemingly plenty of exploration, with your hero ant traipsing through the blades of grass, up branches and across the dirt as you encounter all sorts of landscapes including items left behind by humans like a decaying football. Hopefully, the game will blend storytelling and strategy, with developer Tower 5’s previous game Lornsword Winter Chronicle showcasing their ability to match meaningful tactics to a narrative.</p>


<p>Bernard Werber’s Empire of the Ants has captivated millions of readers, and was originally translated into video game form all the way back in 2000 for PC, releasing on PC and published again by Microids. While it wasn’t hugely well received by critics, it featured over 60 different species of insect to encounter. Hopefully the new game will offer a similar level of variety.</p>
<p>Empire of the Ant’s release date is on the 9th of November, 2024 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned to TheSIxthAxis for more!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review.897744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/11/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s not beat around the bush, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a> is exactly the finale that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> deserves. Almost a decade on from the original game’s release, and with many players having sunk thousands of hours into the science fantasy shooter over the years, The Final Shape had a lot of expectations and pressure heaped upon it to deliver the satisfying ending for all the characters we’ve come to know and love. They took a little while longer to make sure they got it right – especially after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/14/destiny-2-lightfall-review/">Lightfall’s disappointment</a> – but&nbsp;Bungie has absolutely nailed it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you have not been following the story of Destiny 2 then you’re out of luck, it would take ten thousands words just to explain it and we don’t have the time. Suffice to say the big bad, The Witness, has shoved a massive yonic hole in The Traveller and the core cast of Zavala, Ikora and your Guardian have travelled inside where they meet a seemingly resurrected Cayde-6, this completing the original Vanguard trio for the final battle. Its been almost ten years since these three started the fight and in those years Bungie’s storytelling has (Lightfall excepted) improved immeasurably. This is not a happy tale with grief, and loss weighing heavily on all of the cast, each of them coming to terms with their own personal demons. It’s by far the most mature story Bungie have attempted and the cast, including a returning Nathan Fillion and Keith David who is now voicing Zavala after Lance Reddick’s untimely death, are excellent.</p>


<p>Bungie has also gone to town with cutscenes with far more in The Final Shape than any other Destiny DLC. You still get Ghost doing a exposition recap at the end of each mission but all the key plot points are animated in full CGI or with pencil sketch style animations. They’ve also included a lot more voice work, there are no new characters but we final get to hear Zavala and Cayde’s Ghosts speak. Between battles there a scenes with characters just talking around camp fires explaining their emotions and thoughts and this really bonds you them, making each mission more personal, more meaningful.</p>


<p>The campaign itself is excellent, especially on Legendary difficulty level with your Fireteam. Many fights are set in huge open areas and it really makes a difference, allowing you to attack from cover from quite a distance, and if needs be – make a frantic dash back to a forest to hide for a bit and regain your health. The game also looks stunning with biomes changing as you progress, breath-taking vistas and a liberal dash of body horror. I mean that quite literally, there are bridges made of grasping hands and walls of faces, contorted in agony. Destiny fans will recognise many of the locations as they taken from previous iterations of the game, areas from long forgotten missions, the original tower, discarded Crucible maps and levels from planets that no longer exist make a return. This may seem like a cheap move but they have all been changed and enhanced and they play a key part of the story, your journey in Destiny that began all those years ago and what must, like everything else in the universe, eventually come to and end.</p>
<p>The campaign missions are long, our Fireteam took around ten hours to beat everything on Legendary although a good few hours of that were the final boss fight which ramps up difficulty considerably with multiple instant kill attacks. Rather like Raids, the missions gradually introduce new puzzle elements and these are used through the campaign in various combinations and, thankfully, there are just a few jumping puzzles. The Witness is an almost constant presence, whispering in your ear while you fight, teasing you with promises of power and riches and laughing at your attempts to get near them. Again, this makes the fight personal, learning what they have done to others is quite sickening and by the end you really, really want to give them a Gjallarhorn up the backside and send them packing.</p>
<p>Early on the Campaign you unlock your new Super class, Prismatic. This isn’t and entire new Super class but a way of mixing and matching abilities from all five existing Super classes and creating your own brand of destruction. This means that abilities that were specific to class can now be shared, for example my Titan could have a Solar Super, Strand grenades, and a dodge rather a barricade. There are also limited time perks that can be found specific to the new open world area, the Pale Heart and with these, Prismatic and some new Exotic Weapons and Armour, the combinations are extensive.</p>

<p>The one disappointment as you come to the end of the main campaign is that you barely get to scratch The Witness and after all that talk of endings, nothing really ends. However, Bungie had one last trick up their sleeve and upon the first completion of the new Raid, Salvation’s Edge, a new activity appears: Excision. This is Bungie’s first ever 12-player activity and it’s clearly heavily influenced by Avengers Endgame. The cinematic before the encounter brings almost every friendly character to the fight with Zavala giving a rousing speech to the assembled troops.</p>
<p>Excision gives us an idea of what a Destiny 3 might be like, or at least the potential for when they finally drop support for the last generation consoles. It’s an utterly ridiculous spectacle with all twelve players firing off Supers, using abilities and every weapon they can. The NPC’s provide back up and instructions and you finally get to smack The Witness in the chops and send them packing. Further cut scenes show the aftermath and we get to see all the fan favourite characters ending with the core cast sitting down for one final chat. Obviously there’s still a year of content to come, but as this really is the end of the main Destiny 2 story, Bungie tug at those heart strings and I expect many of those who have been playing since day one will shed a tear or two during those final scenes.</p>
<p>We played The Final Shape on PlayStation 5 but did load up the twelve player activity, Excision, on PlayStation 4 just to see how the old console would cope. I did see the frame rate stutter but just once, though the last generation only targeting 30 FPS, the lower frame rate did make it difficult to work out exactly what was going on in certain moments.</p>

<p>There’s still plenty to do in the game, though. The Pale Heart is full of brand new activities and secrets to discover and there are lengthy hidden quests to unlock the rest of the Prismatic class. However, wander around The Pale Heart and you may feel a bit lonely as Bungie have decided to only allow your Fireteam in each instance. If that Fireteam consists of just you, then that’s it, you are the only one fighting across the entire massive area, a very odd decision and, technically at least, one that seems at odds with jamming twelve players and all the supporting cast in the final mission.</p>
<p>The locking of that final mission, is another example of improvements made by Bungie, in this case one of pacing. Up until now the Seasonal content dropped the same time as the expansion leaving players with a screen full of tasks and flashing icons. For this year the Seasonal content begins a week after the expansion so you don’t have to rush through everything in the first week, and it’s being split into smaller Episodes – the first, Echoes, drops today. Bungie have also announced <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/dev_insights_episode_echoes">an eleventh year of content</a>, so it looks like Destiny 2 will continue with a brand new story.</p>

            <p>It’s a well known phenomena by now that if you want to level up very quickly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>, the best place to do so is a cliff’s edge by Mohgwyn Palace. Nearby to this now-famous site of grace camps a merry band of blood-cursed Albinaurics, as well as a stupid gross bird you can trick into killing itself over and over again. I do not give a single solitary biscuit about that leperous avian, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to waste my new-found position of prominence on this glorious website by not moralising at you heartless rune-hoarders about the unconscionable violence you keep inflicting on my bulbous, shiny frog sons. With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> out soon, the amount of violence the community is collectively inflicting is breaking my tiny heart.</p>

<p>Please, stop this.</p>
<p>You’ve been told before. Two years ago, Reddit user Evoxrus_XV put out the following plea:</p>


<p>And yet, nobody listened. Even on this<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-fastest-way-to-reach-shadow-of-the-erdtree"> very website</a>, Ollie will not cease spreading tips on how to butcher these fine folk as efficiently as possible. I won’t stand for it, so I'm using my powers for good.</p>
<p>Back in the days of the first Dark Souls, if we wanted to grind efficiently, we’d have to kill the same gaggle of shielded goos in the Painted world. If you tried this nonsense in Dark Souls 2, they’d simply take your enemies away after you killed them too many times. You kids these days don’t know how good you’ve got it, and how do you show your appreciation? By trying to wipe out an entire species just so your Moonveil hits for like, 5% more damage. How about you just learn Maleketh's stupid bullshit patterns instead of trying to one-shot everything, eh? How about you grow yourself a heart, you swine. </p>
<p>This is not what John Dark Soul died for. You should feel ashamed, just as I did when I realised the fun Albinauric hat I’d been wearing for hours was actually a flayed face. Go kill some rolling goats instead. Those guys suck.</p>

<p data-characters="248" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Every year, <em>Call of Duty </em>fans spend months complaining about the fact that Ranked Play hasn’t launched with the game. While we don’t know for certain when it will be released in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, eagle-eyed <em>CoD</em> fans have already spotted it. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">During the UI reveal at <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty Direct</a>, well-known leaker BobNetworkUK highlighted an image taken from the screen that shows <em>Black Ops 6</em>‘s main menu. In it, alongside multiplayer and Zombies, is a button for Ranked Play. </p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Of course, this doesn’t mean that the mode will be live at launch, but the fact that they’ve baked it into the main menu from the start suggests it may be coming earlier than usual. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">The release window of Ranked Play has been a real source of frustration among <em>CoD</em> fans, who have complained that waiting three months, or sometimes even longer, for the mode is far too long. <em>MW3</em>‘s competitive playlist dropped in January 2024, while players had to wait until February 2023 for <em>MW2</em>‘s version. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">Ranked Play allows players to test their skills against opponents in curated maps and modes, based on what the professional players compete on in the <em>Call of Duty</em> League. Players are given a rank to demonstrate their ability and earn Skill Rating by winning matches. At the end of each season, players are awarded cosmetic items based on their performance. </p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">With the mode spotted in early builds of the game, fans are hopeful that we’ll see Ranked Play in Season 1 of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which usually drops a month after the game’s launch. This would allow players to jump in while the game’s population is at a high, and would likely see a second influx of competitors when the Christmas rush happens. </p>
 <p data-characters="118" data-current-count="118" data-injectable="false">Of course, nothing is confirmed just yet, so we’ll just have to wait for Treyarch to provide some confirmation. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-spirit-of-e3-could-be-felt-in-la-now-lets-bring-it-back-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>If the industry truly wants something to emerge from the ashes of E3, it needs to work together</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The last week in LA was pretty good.</p>
<p>I enjoyed it, at least. This past week, whatever you call it – Summer Games Fest or Not-E3 or E3 lite or the ghost of E3 (oh I like that, something that's still here but also not really) – had some strong announcements, some games you could actually play, and a bunch of nicely put together showcases.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we're all beholden to the line-up. Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest showcase was well done this year, with good pacing, a strong opening message, decent variety, and diversity. But even Geoff can't make games appear out of nowhere. It was well done, but it's not going to go down in history as an all-timer.</p>
<p>PlayStation is clearly going through a lull with its line-up. Over the last two weeks, it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">announced and showcased its 2024 first-party slate</a>, which primarily consists of Astro Bot, Concord and LEGO Horizon Adventures. Now these games hold a lot of promise and look lovely, but they're hardly God of War or Spider-Man. Nevertheless, PlayStation was in LA this week, with a physical presence. The media could meet developers and play Sony's line-up during this period for the first time since 2018. That for me feels significant.</p>
<p>Xbox had undoubtedly the biggest show by far, with a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-new-gears-of-war-and-doom-headline-xbox-showcase-2024">string of blockbuster reveals</a>. You can certainly see what $80 billion buys you, with blockbuster brands, impressive new IP and returning fan favourites during a relentless 90 minute broadcast. It was an exciting show. It perhaps lacked a little variety, I felt it was crying out for a family game, but then Microsoft knows its crowd. It was a shame it was a pre-recorded video and not a live show, because I felt the audience would have reacted very strongly. But perhaps one for next year.</p>
<blockquote><p>To all those events organisers, it's worth remembering this week doesn't belong to you. E3's death was, in part, a failure of consensus. The industry couldn't agree with what it wanted</p></blockquote>
<p>Ubisoft had an event, too. This was another company that focused its immediate line-up, which includes two of this year's biggest games in Star Wars Outlaws and Assassin's Creed Shadows. The firm is clearly missing E3, with a venue featuring stormtroopers and props (including blue milk) on the lower floor, and an upper floor decked out like a Japanese house.</p>
<p>Finally, there was IGN Live. I popped by on the Sunday to do a panel (GI and IGN are now part of the same group of websites) and I thought it looked good. It was relatively small, and certainly far from the scale of an E3, but as a dedicated fan event with some interesting presentations, it did a good job, especially as something pulled together in just a few months. I am eager to see this one scale.</p>
<p>Overall, it wasn't the blockbuster-laden show of E3s past, but Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Dragon Age and Monster Hunter were all here being presented to press. And although some publishers clearly have smaller slates these days, there were a few with a wide variety of games to show, including Tencent, Amazon, Netflix and Netease, which just shows how quickly the industry has changed over the last five years.</p>
<p>All of this – Summer Games Fest, Play Days, Xbox Games Showcase, Ubisoft Forward, IGN Live, The Mix - wasn't E3. Not even close. But if you're like me and are hoping to see <em>something</em> emerge from the ashes of that legendary show, there was plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the future. All we need is a stronger slate, a few more business elements, and a bit more time to pull it altogether, and we might have something E3-ish in 2025.</p>
<p>We also need those trying to make this happen to pull together a bit. Some of these events do overlap a little, and so a bit or rivalry between the various shows is inevitable and, I'd argue, desirable. It's competition that keeps the costs in check and forces the various organisers to innovate and be ambitious. Competition is good.</p>
<blockquote><p>With a stronger release slate, a variety of different event options and a little bit of co-ordination, and I'm convinced we'll have 'gaming Christmas' back again</p></blockquote>
<p>But to those events organisers, it's worth remembering that this week doesn't belong to you. E3's death was, in part, a failure of consensus. The industry couldn't agree with what it wanted. Some wanted something digital, some wanted a media event, some wanted a consumer show, some wanted just business meetings… some wanted a combination of a few (or all) of those. What we have now in LA is the start of something that should cater to all those things. If you just want the media? Play Days is the place to be. Want to get consumers hands on? IGN Live is worth a look. Want to just make a splash with a big announcement? Well, you’ve plenty of options to choose from depending on your budget.</p>
<p>These various components need to work together. The big companies that are here presenting with their own shows, Xbox and Ubisoft, clearly know this. They have put on their own experiences, but Xbox also had a presence at Play Days and IGN Live, while Ubisoft had Star Wars on stage at Summer Games Fest and exhibited at IGN Live. They know that by supporting the wider ecosystem, that benefits the entire week, their partners and themselves.</p>
<p>A bit of collaboration and co-ordination is going to be helpful. Let's not put too much on at the same time, and let's not put these shows on too far away from each other. If I have one quibble about this week, it's that Xbox putting on its showcase 30 minutes away left me an exhausted, sweaty mess by the time I'd finished my appointments at 7:30pm on the Sunday. Perhaps, heaven forbid, Downtown LA isn't the best place to put all this on.</p>
<p>These events won't get on. They'll compete fiercely. But as the saying goes, a rising tide lifts all boats. A successful IGN Live benefits Play Days, just as a successful Play Days benefits IGN Live. I think back to Rob Matthews, the former Xbox exec who led the firm's E3 offerings, and what he said to us as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-life-and-death-of-e3">our retrospective on E3 last week</a>.</p>
<p>"[PlayStation and Xbox] were frenemies for that whole endeavour," he said. "We were doing something for the bigger cause of video games around the world […]. We would compete vigorously with each other all throughout the year, but we also realised that we were all in the same small industry and doing something special."</p>
<p>The ghost of E3 has been more substantial this year. Bigger isn't always better, of course, and I'm fairly sure that I'll enjoy this week less the noisier it becomes.</p>
<p>However, I also believe that a big, exciting, confident showing is just what the games industry needs right now.With a stronger release slate, a variety of different event options and a little bit of co-ordination, and I'm convinced we'll have 'gaming Christmas' back again.</p>
<p>I just hope the various people involved can get along enough to make it happen.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, KONAMI officially opened pre-orders for the retail editions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The Tactical Edition will include the game plus some bonus digital items to be unveiled at a later time.</p>
<p>The $199.99 Collector's Edition, on the other hand, comes with the following goodies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The day one “Tactical Edition” of&nbsp;<em>METAL</em><em>&nbsp;</em><em>GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER</em></li>
<li>Miniature terrarium based on the iconic opening scene of Virtuous Mission where Naked Snake must recover his backpack snagged on a tree branch. Includes miniature Naked Snake figurine and tree stump with hanging bag.</li>
<li>A recreation of the fake identification badge Naked Snake uses to break into Groznyj Grad Northeast as a scientist.</li>
<li>High-quality stitched patch showing membership in the legendary FOX UNIT.</li>
<li>Unique rubber patch commemorating Naked Snake’s historic HALO parachute jump.</li>
<li>Beautiful retro style metal game case utilizing original&nbsp;<em>METAL GEAR SOLID 3: SNAKE EATER&nbsp;</em>artwork.</li>
</ul>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image002-1-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>KONAMI also released a new developer diary featuring none other than English Snake voice actor David Hayter, who outlined some of the biggest enhancements of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater over the original title. For starters, the damage system has been updated so that battle scars inflicted on Snake will remain throughout the entire game. Cutscenes have been improved as well, although they will largely remain untouched from a narrative standpoint. When it comes to controls, the game will offer a legacy option that plays exactly like the original game and a New Style control for players accustomed to modern third-person action games.</p>
<p>In the second part of the video, Hayter interviewed Producer Noriaki Okamura, who said:</p>
<p><em>We left the gameplay, the story, and the voice cast of the original game as-is, but we had to bring the graphics and controls up to modern standards, all of which has changed over the years. All of that has been updated, but the core game – and the creative vision of the original staff – none of those parts of the game have changed.</em></p>

<p>The game still doesn't have a release date, but it might not be that far. Yesterday, GameStop briefly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dcwy6n/mgs_delta_release_date_possibly_leaked_by_gamestop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">listed</a> a November 17 date, although that's a Sunday and, therefore, unlikely to be correct.</p>

The game is set between <em>The Empire Strikes Back </em>and <em>Return of the Jedi, </em>during a time when the Galactic Empire is at its strongest and most spread out. But who cares about all that? What I want to discuss is the big reveal that arcade games exist in the <em>Star Wars </em>universe. </p><h2 id="h28"><a id=""></a>The history of video games in Star Wars</h2><p>It’s weird to think about, but even though there have been hundreds of <em>Star Wars</em> games released over the last few decades, we’ve never seen a canonical depiction of a video game in the universe itself. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Video_game_(in-universe)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Video_game_(in-universe)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The <em>Wookieepedia </em>entry for “in-universe video games”</a></span> is incredibly short and small. In a franchise where “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Duck/Legends&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Duck/Legends" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ducks” have a few paragraphs</a></span> and pictures in their wiki entry, it stands out that games are so underrepresented in the universe.</p><p>Technically, video games were mentioned once in Legends (the old canon from before Disney bought the franchise), in the 1993 Choose Your Own Adventure novel  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Dawn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Dawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jedi Dawn</a></span>.” They later showed up in two non-canon books for kids. And...that’s it. I guess you could say <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dejarik&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dejarik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dejarik, aka the holo-chess game</a></span> seen in the Milennium Falcon is sort of a video game, but I consider that more an electronic tabletop thing. I don’t care if you use an iPad when you play <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> it’s not a video game.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="015a4a4a30bf782720774e229a1a7e00" data-recommend-id="image://015a4a4a30bf782720774e229a1a7e00" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif shows the arcade game in Outlaws.

That’s pretty wizard!<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/490LVhVGAqo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/490LVhVGAqo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a different video, Ubisoft says</a></span> the arcade machine we see in Outlaws is <em>Raven 6 </em>and the devs described it as “a space shooter” that Kay Vess has played “for years.” Even more exciting, Ubisoft says you’ll be able to find other arcade games around the galaxy and they are all playable, too.</p><p>And...wait. Oh, no. Now I’m realizing that if video games exist in <em>Star Wars</em>, that probably means annoying chuds who take them too seriously probably exist as well. Oh no. <em>Star War</em>s contains gamers. Fuck. Shit. Welp, we had a good run, everyone. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-6-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The Coalition is taking fans back to where it all started with Gears of War: E-Day, and that means revisiting the horrors of Emergence Day and the Locust horde.</p><p>Brand Director Nicole Fawcette and Creative Director Matt Searcy opened up about the studio’s desire to focus on the “scary” aspects of Gears during an interview with IGN. Searcy says the team wants to “capture a moment in time” and “tell a very intimate story about what happened” to the people in one of Sera’s cities.</p><p>“For us, it’s like a what-if story,” he said. “What if the ground opened up and monsters came out? Yeah, it’s set on a fictional, other planet, but there are very human reactions and stories we get to tell. To do that, we need to be able to tell a story that feels like a horror story.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Gears of War: E-Day Trailer Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p>Searcy continues, explaining that Gears of War: E-Day will still have the heart and sci-fi the series is known for, but it will also focus in on this specific moment in time by telling a story that takes place over only a few days. The decision to lean in more on horror comes from The Coalition’s desire to recapture the feeling of terror many players might remember experiencing when playing through the series.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"But when people tell you what they remember playing, the things that stood out to them, the feelings, a lot of it is about these, kind of dark, almost horror-esque, scary moments.”</p></div><p>“We looked back at what people felt like when they played Gears of War or any of the Gears – Gears 4 included,” he said. “But when people tell you what they remember playing, the things that stood out to them, the feelings, a lot of it is about these, kind of dark, almost horror-esque, scary moments.”</p><p>Searcy continued: “So we basically took that feeling, that vision that's in everybody's head, and we're like, ‘That's the game we're going to build.’ We're going to build that game with all the skills we've learned, with all the technology we've built, and sort of go hard at that. So definitely part of the story is about reintroducing the locust to Gears as scary monsters from the ground come up. And then you realize as it goes on, this is not just monsters, there's an army here and it's bigger than anybody thinks it is.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Fawcette elaborated on how new technology is allowing The Coalition to present the Locusts in new, horrifying ways.</p><p>“Through Unreal Engine 5, we now can show the locust at that visual fidelity that is believable as scary creatures from the subterranean,” she said. “And so, like you saw in the trailer, we're really kind of leaning into those horror vibes as fans remember it and as time has moved on. What was scary in 2006 is very different than 2024. There's sort of that just doubling down on how people remember how they feel about it.”</p><h2>Why E-Day?</h2><p>Gears of War: E-Day is detouring away from the storylines of Gears of War 4 and Gears 5, but as The Coalition explained in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/gears-of-war-e-day-interview-details-xbox-games-showcase-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a>, they <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-is-by-no-means-abandoning-the-stories-told-in-gears-4-and-5-despite-decision-to-do-a-prequel-next">won't be abandoning that era of the Gears saga forever</a>. Searcy tells us that the studio chose to go back in time for their next Gears of War game not because they were finished with the previous storyline but because revisiting Marcus and Dom's relationship made sense for the team itself.</p><p>“For us, there is a story here, for our studio, of how we found our way to E-Day," he explained. "It was about, sort of, reflection, and part of it is just the energy that rolls up about, this was the story we wanted to tell at this time. So, it wasn't really about picking between these things, it was just a snowball of the stuff that was on the table and this is the one we wanted to do right now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Hell yeah. We want to make this."</p></div><p>Fawcette chimed in, saying that when the idea for Gears of War: E-Day came about, it was a feeling of "Hell yeah. We want to make this."</p><p>Searcy continued: "We love those characters, and like I said, it's really nice to have a franchise where we can tell stories of different places. When we're at Gears 4 and 5 we tell these stories, and Tactics, that goes at a different time, and all these sorts of things. For us, it is just the one we wanted to work on now is the one that felt right."</p><p>The Coalition <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gears-of-war-game-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>revealed Gears of War: E-Day</u></a> during yesterday’s Xbox Games Showcase. We’ve not seen any gameplay yet, but this first footage promised a return to the series’ roots with a touching moment that saw the return of fan-favorite character, Dom Santiago. It’s been 13 years since fans watched Dom him sacrifice himself for his fellow COG brothers in Gears of War 3, so while Fawcette and Searcy promise a horrific prequel that explores one of humanity’s darkest days, it’s sure to be an emotional journey, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Gears of War: E-Day is currently without a release date.

			<p>When I think of the vampire fantasy, I picture the secret societies and the intrigue. I think of stalking prey through the night maybe, like, a cape &amp; ascot customisation minigame. Minecraft-style crafting and base-building is the last thing that comes to mind when I picture what I want out of a vampire power-fantasy game, and that dissonance is what kept me away from <em>V Rising </em>for so long. Coming around to check the game out in its 1.0 release has been an incredible surprise, though. While the vampire simulation seems thin at a glance, what this game accomplishes in streamlining and incentivising the usual tedium of survival games blew me away.</p>
<p><iframe title="V Rising - Ruins of Mortium Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-w-1d5UErE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There isn’t any dense world-building or character-driven drama spurring you to action in the opening moments of <em>V Rising. </em>You awake and arise from a coffin, all vampire-like, and you’re given a list of bounties and a goal: reclaim your vampire power. The idea is that each of the 50 boss battles present on your bounty list rewards you with a different vampire ability, and also takes you across various realms that scale in difficulty as you grow. This loop was everything to me. I always suffer from the lack of direction in survival-crafting games: I find my focus depleting and my interest in playing further entirely vanishing. The constant boss-battle goals and your checklist of progress for them kept me engaged – and as I progressed through the list, I naturally found myself falling into the other systems of the game all too naturally.</p>


<p>Another thing that kept me engaged with <em>V Rising </em>is that, unlike so many other survival crafting games, it isn’t set in a massively open or procedurally generated world. The game feels and handles much more like Diablo, guiding you through hand-crafted and sometimes claustrophobic environments. The visuals of these varied biomes aren’t all that impressive, as the game rocks a consistently underwhelming color palette and aesthetic throughout. What matters more, though, is how these more structured environments and the engaging combat encounters they guide you toward feel – and they feel <em>really </em>good.</p>


<p>Combat in <em>V Rising </em>feels like a MOBA, but centered around smaller engagements and one-on-one duels. No matter how many weapons and abilities you unlock, you’re only able to equip two weapon abilities, two spells, and an ultimate at once. So you’re always working with a limited tool-belt, but combining that set of tools with the task of dodging enemy attacks and aligning your own character optimally to dish out damage kept me on my toes in every boss battle. Additionally, I rarely felt like a boss I encountered was fodder or generic. Each one has a really special thing going on, whether it’s a combative fisherman flinging trout at you or a bullet-hell necromancer battle. I was surprised by how much depth there was to each encounter, and it made me all too excited to track down the next.</p>
<p>In-between boss-battles, <em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>has you building a base, gathering resources, and smithing weapons. This is where all of the typical survival-gaming tedium would come into play…but only if you want it to. If you’re like me, and the repetitive grind and long-wait times associated with those tasks is a chore, <em>V Rising </em>lets you fine-tune the difficulty and scaling of almost every aspect of the game to your liking. I was able to lessen resource requirements, shorten wait times, remove restrictions on fast-travel and more – the result was my own personally tuned vampire survival experience, where I could focus on the systems and challenges that excited me the most while the less-interesting elements were kept to a minimum for the sake of my sanity.</p>

<p>That kind of accessibility goes a long way – not just for gamers who need assistance like that to be able to properly play a game, but for making me feel like I have the ability to truly play <em>V Rising </em>any way I would like to. I got to dive in deep on the base-building, crafting my own gaudy vampire castle full of ridiculous candelabras and torture chambers. In doing so, though, I didn’t have to sit through the tree-chopping tedium that might frustrate me, feeling rewarding and peaceful – hopefully it’ll feel the same for other house-proud would-be-vampires. All these balance adjustments can be done on live servers, too – whether you’re playing co-op in a PvE world or dealing with player threats on a PvP one.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, <em>V Rising </em>isn’t a typical vampire fantasy. Yet the way it blends survival-crafting with a boss-focused action RPG and sprinkles the themes of vampirism throughout turn it into an incredibly successful power fantasy nonetheless. Plus, the sheer depth of customisation you can dig into for tuning and balancing the game exactly as you need it is a breath of fresh air, and helps make this one of the most innovative and approachable survival games I’ve ever played.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/despite-a-strong-lineup-the-xbox-showcase-left-me-cold.897588/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-showcase-summer-game-fest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft, a behemoth with near-limitless resources that’s nonetheless spent the past few years lost in the woods, needed a win over the weekend. By most measures, it got one. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s Summer Game Fest-adjacent showcase</a> came out guns blazing – and also chainsaw shield blazing, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpgAOAOMUnA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in <em>Doom</em>’s case</a>. But try as I might’ve, I was unable to walk away from it feeling anything aside from mild trepidation.</p><p>To begin, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> does look sick. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> gives off appealingly incomprehensible JRPG vibes filtered through a French historical lens. <em>South of Midnight </em>seems to be hitting all the right notes with its vibe and southern setting. And <em>Dragon Age</em>… well, I’m gonna reserve judgement until after we see gameplay tomorrow.&nbsp;</p><p>But all the other designated heavy hitters felt like strained attempts at recalling a better time. <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> is a prequel to an already long-in-tooth franchise.<em> Indiana Jones</em> is a prequel to multiple decades-old movies. <em>Metal Gear Delta</em> and <em>Age of Mythology</em> are both remakes. <em>Fable </em>and<em> Perfect Dark</em> are attempts at reviving franchises that struggled to evoke excitement the last time Microsoft wheeled them out. <em>Mixtape </em>is literally a game about playing the hits. <em>Diablo IV</em>’s <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> trailer made me wonder what a story like that would look like if it wasn’t chained to a decades-old franchise about making numbers go up. Even <em>STALKER 2</em>, a game whose download button I plan to mash frantically the second it becomes available, mostly just looks like a prettier version of a game I played in 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m sure all of this is for someone – many someones, in fact – but it just didn’t really land for me. Microsoft owns <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1799834606973448642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a significant chunk of the triple-A video game industry</a>, but it has struggled to marshal those forces in a direction that feels fresh or uniquely compelling. Don’t get me wrong: Sony and Nintendo also lean heavily on franchises, but the former demonstrates a <em>slightly </em>more regular willingness to throw something new into the mix, while the latter never stops making old new again. I’m not encouraged, meanwhile, by Microsoft’s baby-with-the-bathwater approach to studio ownership. The closures of Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin loomed heavily over Xbox’s showcase, ghosts of the recent past that show what happens when successful teams swing and miss (or <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swing and don’t hit hard enough</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>This, to some degree, is what that approach gets us: a creaky boatload of franchises that feel, to executives, like surefire successes, but which eventually suffer from diminishing returns. It’s a microcosm of <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where the video game industry seems to be headed</a>: toward a future of fewer, bigger games that grow endlessly, for growth’s own sake more than as a result of any organic need. It’s difficult to look forward to tentative twists on the same old steps in a year when indies have <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stepped up in a big way</a> and delivered some of the most interesting hits in ages.&nbsp;</p><p>Following an unyielding torrent of industry layoffs, the disparity between indie and triple-A sectors is likely to grow. In this sense, the main Summer Game Fest showcase was instructive; big names like <em>Civilization VII</em> and [checks notes] <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> popped up here and there, but surprising debuts like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4USyK7mIuY8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Killer Bean</em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqCfIra8Bb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Wanderstop</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhm_6wJ9TdY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outersloth</a> – <em>Among Us</em> developer Innersloth’s plan to make sure the indie firehose doesn’t shut off anytime soon – brought the heat.</p><p>If this is what the foreseeable future is going to look like, I’m not mad about it. I’m drowning in cool games I still need to play, and I don’t think that’s going to change anytime soon. What the Microsofts of the world are doing just isn’t for me anymore, and that’s alright. Moving on is just part of life, even if it’s a part that big companies, specifically, are loath to embrace.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion now here, officially bringing the ten-year Light and Darkness saga to a close, developer Bungie has turned its attention to the future, sharing more on what's next for its live-service shooter - including a tease of the mysterious Codename: Frontiers, whatever it may be, coming next year.
</p>
<p>
When Bungie revealed The Final Shape last August, it announced 2024 would bring a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-the-final-shape-heads-into-the-travellers-infinite-vast-unknowable-pale-heart">significant shake-up</a> to the way Destiny 2 content is delivered. Instead of four yearly Seasons, it said it would release three "larger, content-packed" Episodes, each featuring standalone stories split into three six-week-long Acts.
</p>
<p>
The first of these, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/dev_insights_episode_echoes">Echoes</a>, launches tomorrow, 11th June, picking up immediately after the events of The Final Shape. It all unfolds on Nessus, where there are ancient secrets to unearth and a mysterious new enemy to encounter. Echoes will then be followed by Revenant later this year (Bungie's previous roadmap said between July and October), and comes with a vampire-hunting theme as players, in the role of a Slayer Baron, take on the Fallen. There's also a new potion crafting system - featuring combat and loot potions - alongside the new story elements, quests, and rewards set to feature in all three Episodes.

<p>
And finally for the announced Episodes, there's Heresy - likely arriving between November and February next year - which promises to be a real blast from the past, taking players back to the Dreadnaught from Destiny's The Taken King expansion. So far, so mostly expected - but it's what comes next that sounds most intriguing.
</p>
<p>
Destiny 2's 2025 seemingly kicks off in earnest with a mysterious something Bungie is so far only referring to as Codename: Frontiers. As to what it is, that's currently unclear, but the fact Bungie didn't just write 'more Episodes' in its announcement has some speculating it might be a new expansion, perhaps getting Destiny's <em>next</em> big story arc properly underway.
</p>

<p>
It's unlikely we'll learn more about Codename: Frontiers anytime soon, of course, given Bungie has three Episodes to release before its arrival - so, for now, all eyes are on Echoes, to see if the switch in Destiny 2's content delivery strategy is something worth getting excited about.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/xbox/24175612/xbox-showcase-2024-game-pass-exclusives-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="DPJEY7">Last week, I posited that the Xbox showcase on June 9 would be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis">the most important</a> in the history of Microsoft’s gaming division. If it wasn’t, that could be because this slick prerecorded show couldn’t possibly compete for historical impact with, for example, the garbage fire that was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reflects-on-what-went-wrong-with-the-/1100-6468802/">2013 Xbox One reveal event</a>, or the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/19/4446060/xbox-one-drm-used-games-online-restrictions-180">bungled E3 show</a> that followed it. It was confident and smooth in its orchestration, impressive in a way that was almost calming after the awkward anticlimax of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Summer Game Fest</a> two days earlier. But it was still immensely significant: for its indication of the seismic publishing power Microsoft now holds, for the questions it answered about Xbox’s future, and for the questions it didn’t.</p>

<p id="hSOTT6">In fact, the two most telling bits of news emerged outside the boundaries of the show itself. The first was the confirmation, more than a week before the show, that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">will be released on Game Pass on day one</a>. The second, which was not mentioned by Microsoft during its showcase but slipped out in a press release alongside it, is that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> (one of the biggest first-party reveals of the event) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel">is also coming to PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p id="MzwKj6">Between them, these two facts spell out Microsoft’s strategy quite clearly: Game Pass is everything, and Xbox consoles aren’t. Microsoft is doubling down hard on its subscription service, and bringing its new, almost terrifying might as a game publisher to bear on the Game Pass catalog. But the company had little to say about Xbox hardware, and its attitude to console exclusivity for Microsoft-owned games remains ambivalent at best.</p>

<p id="EOk7yu">After the shock release of four former Xbox exclusives on PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">earlier this year</a>, many Xbox fans were looking to Sunday’s showcase for explicit reassurance that Microsoft was still investing in Xbox consoles by getting its vast army of first-party studios to make exclusive games for them. That reassurance did not come. In fact, Xbox console exclusivity was not mentioned once. The words “coming to Xbox Series X and PC” appeared as much at the end of trailers for games in storied Xbox franchises like Fable and Gears of War as they did for multiplatform releases from third-party publishers like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. There was no attempt at differentiation on this score.</p>
<p id="mHkIqc"><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">Reports indicate</a> that Microsoft has “no red line” internally when it comes to which of its games it will consider for release on other platforms, and the wording (or lack of it) used on Sunday shows that the company is keen to keep its options open. It’s striking that Microsoft chose to open the showcase with two heavy hitters that’ll be available on PlayStation: <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which was already slated for PS5 (per <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797265/microsoft-sony-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft’s Call of Duty deal with Sony</a>), and <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, which wasn’t.</p>
<p id="P2K0IV"><em>The Dark Ages</em>’ PS5 release is a clue to how Microsoft intends to handle exclusivity in the short term, at least as far as games from Bethesda, Activision, and Blizzard are concerned. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-briefly-explains-the-decision-to-bring-doom-the-dark-ages-to-playstation-5-ign-live-2024">Speaking to IGN</a> after the showcase aired, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said, “Doom is definitely one of those franchises that has a history of so many platforms. It’s a franchise that I think everyone deserves to play. When I was in a meeting with Marty [Stratton, id Software studio director] a couple years ago, I asked Marty what he wanted to do, and he said he wanted to sell it on all platforms. Simple as that.”</p>
<p id="eei6Az">Spencer’s explanation — as well as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/11/6/7167349/microsoft-owns-minecraft-mojang-acquisition-closes">Microsoft’s handling of <em>Minecraft</em></a> — suggests that Microsoft does not intend to make previously multiplatform game series exclusive. It’s a strong indication that Bethesda’s <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>, for one, will get a PlayStation release. For everything else, it’s an open question. It might seem unthinkable that <em>Gears of War: E-Day </em>or <em>Fable</em> will come out on PS5, but nothing said (or unsaid) on Sunday indicates that that’s off the table.</p>

<p id="Lm9ZnO">As far as Game Pass goes, however, Microsoft could not have been more emphatic. “Play it day one with Game Pass,” boomed the stinger on the end of trailer after trailer after trailer. Of the 30 games, expansions, and updates featured in Sunday’s showcase, 20 will go straight to Game Pass. Of those 20 Game Pass titles, 13 come from Microsoft-owned studios; nine are scheduled to debut in 2024, eight in 2025, and three have no release windows yet. </p>
<p id="5XumSq">Call of Duty, Doom, Gears of War, State of Decay, <em>Perfect Dark</em>, <em>Fable</em>, Indiana Jones, STALKER, Flight Simulator, <em>Avowed</em>... all coming to Game Pass as soon as they’re released. There are blockbuster shooters and role-playing games, strategy and sim games, wistful indies, and, thanks to partnerships with companies like Kepler Interactive and Rebellion, a good helping of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDyqGZy78Ng">AA Eurojank</a> (perhaps the ideal kind of Game Pass game).</p>
<p id="tvKdIy">In a way, it’s more illustrative to look at what from the showcase <em>won’t</em> be coming to Game Pass. Those 10 titles include big third-party franchises like Metal Gear Solid and Assassin’s Creed; a handful of smaller third-party games; and expansions for <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em>, and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. Selling DLC for Game Pass-included titles like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>TES Online</em> is a big part of the Game Pass business model, so you could still consider those titles under the Game Pass umbrella. (<em>World of Warcraft</em> is the outlier here as the only Microsoft-owned game featured that isn’t on Game Pass at all — and indeed, the only one not available on Xbox consoles.)</p>
<p id="it2ZDg">If Microsoft has doubts about the commercial viability of console-exclusive releases in the long term, it certainly doesn’t seem to have those doubts about Game Pass. With subscriber numbers seeming to have plateaued (according to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">Microsoft’s rarely released figures</a>), and with the presumed considerable loss of revenue resulting from rolling a guaranteed seller like <em>Black Ops 6</em> into a subscription service, many were wondering if Microsoft’s “Netflix for games” approach made economic sense. It’s possible that this debate has been ongoing in Microsoft until recently: <em>Black Ops 6</em> developer Treyarch told <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-focuses-on-impressive-games">Game File’s Stephen Totilo</a> “it wasn’t that long ago” that the studio was informed that the game would launch on Game Pass. But taken as a whole, the showcase was a resounding vote of confidence in the service, and an indication that it will go on to provide great value to subscribers through 2025 and beyond. </p>

<p id="BO8i0m">After its acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Microsoft is now the third-biggest gaming company in the world by revenue — and arguably the biggest in terms of intellectual property and publishing might. Sunday’s showcase demonstrated quite convincingly how it intends to fill those massive boots: dozens of solid-looking games in famous, fan-favorite franchises, stretching far into the future. Quality <em>and</em> quantity. The surprise inclusion of a few long-gestating titles that had reportedly been stuck in development hell, like <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>State of Decay 3</em>, seemed like a pointed message that Microsoft can be trusted to keep all these projects on track, despite its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11537392/lionhead-studios-closed">spotty record in studio management</a>.</p>
<p id="gNQRgS">But Xbox hardware only got the briefest mention, in the form of three new console configurations and a promise that “we’re hard at work on the next generation.” The rumored <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">handheld announcement</a> did not materialize. And exclusivity remains a glaring open question. </p>
<p id="ZjBQSc">Regarding Microsoft’s position in the broader game industry, it seems we have our answer: It’s now a publisher first, a subscription platform second, and a console hardware platform a distant third. </p>

That show, along with a wealth of previews and interviews that have sprung up in the past few days, have given us a pretty clear picture of all the massive changes and returning features that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will bring to <em>Call of Duty </em>later this year. Here’s a rundown of some of the biggest details we learned about the upcoming shooter:</p><h2 id="h115336"><a id=""></a><strong>The kids are calling it omnimovement </strong></h2><p>Omnimovement is perhaps the biggest addition <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is bringing to the franchise.

For example, omnimovement will seamlessly grant players a full 360 degrees of movement at any time. That means that they will be able to slide and dive in any direction they want, in a way that’s somewhat reminiscent of <em>Max Payne</em>, though more versatile. Players will be able to do things such as dive forward, turn around in midair and shoot behind them without a labored animation. During the Direct, a player could be seen turning to their side while diving through the air to line up a shot, which could not be done before.</p><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196909,195840" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>In <em>Black Ops 6</em>, players will also be able to sprint in any direction, which is a radical change from how movement has worked in the franchise before. In other words, you can face forward while sprinting left, right, or backwards, whereas previously you could only sprint in the direction that you were facing. According to Treyarch, this is inspired by the actual movement of operators and soldiers, and the studio felt it had to be included once that was discovered.</p><p>Treyarch also looked outside of the realm of shooters for inspiration, and came away from that with a suite of radical new accessibility features that the team’s calling Intelligent Movement. According to Matt Scronce, an associate director at Treyarch featured in the Direct, the motivation behind the system was the team wanting “all players to focus on what they want to do and not how to do it.” To that end, there are three options in menus (sprint assist, mantle assist, and crouch assist) that will reduce the number of inputs needed for the associated actions. </p><p>All of these innovations in <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s movement system will be available across every mode in the game, including multiplayer and Zombies.</p><h2 id="h115337"><a id=""></a><strong>We’re taking back the 90s</strong></h2><p>It has been confirmed that <em>Black Ops 6</em> single-player campaign (which will, unfortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-single-player-internet-1851529371&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-single-player-internet-1851529371">need a constant internet connection</a></span>) will take place in the 90s against the backdrop of the Gulf War and increasing lack of trust in the government. Frank Woods, the tortured legacy character that the <em>Black Ops</em> subseries absolutely refuses to let die, will be back in <em>Black Ops 6 </em>along with a new cast of characters who will be compromised after a mission gone wrong, which prompts them to go rogue and unravel a conspiracy entirely on their own.</p><p>Speaking of conspiracy theories…</p><h2 id="h115338"><a id=""></a><strong>No, there will not be a 9/11 mission</strong></h2><p>As reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-depict-911-treyarch-confirms/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-depict-911-treyarch-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer</em></a></span>, Treyarch shot down the widespread speculation about <em>Black Ops 6 </em>featuring a playable mission taking place during the events of 9/11 earlier this week. Though the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise has garnered shock and criticism in the past for controversial levels and retellings of certain historical events, it seems like <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be steering clear of the September 11 attacks, though some believe that they will be alluded to in the game in other ways.</p><p>Given the nature of the <em>Black Ops </em>series’ conspiracy-theory-driven stories, you can understand why players and fans might’ve suspected 9/11 would figure into the game. There’s no shortage of conspiracy theories around the events of that day—”jet fuel can’t melt steel beams” originated not as a meme or a joke but an actual belief some voiced in earnest—and I suspect some folks will never really let it go.</p><h2 id="h115339"><a id=""></a><strong>Prestige is back</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e250a8bfb71e2010b832636e884acf63" data-recommend-id="image://e250a8bfb71e2010b832636e884acf63" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a character in uniform in Black Ops 6.

Players will be able to rise through the ranks until they eventually reach the max level, at which point they can stay there or reset their progress and embark on the path to prestige. There will be ten prestige ranks to climb through, making for a lengthy progression path, and once players reach the final level of the tenth prestige, they will unlock another 1000 ranks of master prestige to ascend. The most diehard multiplayer fans of <em>Call of Duty </em>will have a lot of levels to burn through when <em>Black Ops 6 </em>releases.<br></p><p>There will be a full multiplayer reveal at <em>Call of Duty </em>Next on August 28, 2024.</p><h2 id="h115340"><a id=""></a><strong>Fidelity and detail</strong></h2><p>Treyarch is broadly upping the fidelity of the series with <em>Black Ops 6</em>, and this includes features such as updated damage models. Previously, character models would take and react to damage across four distinct regions of the body, but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is upping that number to <em>nine </em>regions now, all with their own bespoke damage and death animations based on the region and the direction from which the damage is being taken.</p><p>Players will also dynamically alter the position of their weapons automatically as they are rounding corners. Guns will be pointed in the direction that you are already headed in, making it easier and more seamless for players to acquire their targets without having to manually shift themselves.</p><h2 id="h115341"><a id=""></a><strong>Zombies is going back to the basics</strong></h2><p>Treyarch’s beloved cooperative Zombies mode has been a hotbed for experiments over the years, but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is bringing things back down to earth. It’s picking back up on the Dark Aether storyline that has driven the mode for the last several installments, and the action will once again be round-based. Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will launch with two maps, Liberty Falls and Terminus, and will have a slew of returning mechanics, though the team is hesitant to share too much too early. </p><p>According to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-returning-round-based-confirmed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-returning-round-based-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with <em>Gamesradar+</em></a></span>, Liberty Falls will be set in a small Appalachian town and is leaning into the Americana feel that the name conjures with “abandoned bowling alleys, ‘90s diners, and comic book shops.” Meanwhile, Terminus will take place on a “deep and complex map” set on a prison island, and the two maps will be linked by a storyline occurring simultaneously across both settings.<br></p><p>In the past, the Zombies mode had ditched its specific set of characters for generic operators but <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be reversing course on this. One of the things I loved most about the traditional Zombies experience of my youth was the rich characters and how distinct the mode felt compared to everything else in the <em>Call of Duty </em>package, and it seems like <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is trying to recapture some of this feeling. I’m actually excited to hear as much.</p><p>There will be more information around the full multiplayer reveal taking place at Call of Duty Next.</p><h2 id="h115342"><a id=""></a><strong>Emphasis on choice and alternative gameplay decisions</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-recommend-id="image://2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Treyarch / Raven Software / Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-recommend-id="image://2dd619bfb9a3286424451eb5efac3e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="2592" data-height="1458" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of characters in Black Ops brandishing rifles, presumably to engage an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As has become a bit customary of the <em>Black Ops </em>subseries, the latest installment is once again emphasizing choice in its gameplay scenarios. As <em>Call of Duty </em>continues to attempt to buck linearity, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is introducing some open-ended levels (as we last saw in the widely panned <em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>campaign) as well as light role-playing aspects. Players will be able to converse and barter with characters throughout the campaign in order to unlock alternative routes through missions. There will also be more traditional choices, such as going in guns blazing or quietly.</p><h2 id="h115343"><a id=""></a><strong>Customizable HUD</strong></h2><p>For the first time in the history of the <em>Call of Duty </em>franchise, the HUD will be completely customizable. The minimap can be placed in different locations on the screen and you can even put your ammo counters in the middle in case you don’t want to look away from your targets. Players have long wanted ways to customize HUDs to best compliment their own playstyles or stream setups, and <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is taking a major step in the right direction with this move.</p><h2 id="h115344"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be a “fresh start for everyone”</strong></h2><p>Trying to keep track of which <em>Call of Duty</em> games (across the mainline entries every year as well as the constant updates to Warzone) are connected and have crossover feels next to impossible. For example, weapon and operator skins were carried over from <em>Modern Warfare 2 </em>to <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> the last few years, but none of that will be making the jump to <em>Black Ops 6</em>, according to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-3-content-does-not-carry-forward-into-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with IGN</a></span>. The team doesn’t want there to be confusion that could “break that immersion in that narrative we want,” and will instead focus on bringing new, unique skins tied to the <em>Black Ops </em>universe into the game post-launch.</p><hr><p><em>Black Ops 6 </em>is predictably massive, and there’s still more to talk about, especially how it will factor into <em>Warzone </em>when it launches later this year, and how Treyarch and Raven Software are innovating the multiplayer experience. So far though, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is making a decent first impression, and might just get me back into the fold.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At one point Kay uses binoculars to mark enemies and then sneak into a base using a climbing rope. Nix, Kay’s pet and partner, can be sent out to attack or distract enemies. Nix also seems to have a ping ability that lets you mark enemies through walls, sort of like Eagle Vision in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.</p><p>Later, she is spotted and fights her way out. It all reminded me a lot of the kind of stuff I’ve done in <em>Far Cry </em>or other <em>Ubisoft games.</em> But hey, if it ain’t broke...</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="886fc17d8c1fea17254c780012ef27a3" data-recommend-id="image://886fc17d8c1fea17254c780012ef27a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows a screenshot of Star Wars Outlaws.

                <p>GameStop has posted what appears to be the release date for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" data-ref-id="5000-589435">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. The remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 doesn't have an official release date at the moment, but a recent post from GameStop implies that the game will be out on November 17.</p><p>In a now deleted post on X (formerly Twitter), the video game retailer wrote, "Prepare to slay in Metal Gear Solid [Delta]: Snake Eater. Where stealth &amp; survival meet savagery! Coming 11.17." That release date of November 17 hasn't been posted anywhere else and GameStop's own website has a placeholder date of December 31, 2025, listed as the game's release. The post was up for over an hour before being deleted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316702" data-ratio="0.85426356589147" data-width="645" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316702"></a><figcaption>GameStop has since deleted the post.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4316702-mgstweet.jpg"></figure><p>It's not immediately clear if this is an unintentional leak or if the date in the post is a mistake. It's important to point out that November 17, 2004 was the release date of the original Metal Gear Solid 3, so either the date is an homage to the original, or someone accidentally pulled the old date for the post. November 17 falls on a Sunday this year, which would be abnormal for a video game release, as they typically release on Tuesday or Friday.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater did make an appearance at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-demos-just-how-much-anguish-youll-see-on-snakes-face-this-time/1100-6524070/">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on Sunday, where it got a new gameplay trailer, but no date was given at the event. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-preorders-now-live/1100-6524133/">Preorders for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, both the normal version and the collector's edition, also went live recently.</p>

Max served as the protagonist of the original Life is Strange, and this time she's trying to (literally) turn back time and stop the death of one of her friends. It looks to be another impressive narrative-driven game from Deck Nine, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D6885NB9?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are now open ahead of its October 29 release.</p><p>Three different versions are up for grabs, with two offering tons of in-game goodies.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-hints-at-a-future-for-the-series.897534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175632/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-delta-konami-future-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0vIj53"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23351764/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-release-date-trailer-announcement">Konami’s remake of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em></a> sounds like it will be the beginning of a series of new projects in the franchise created by a “new team,” according to comments from producer Noriaki Okamura.</p>
<p id="Re5ZqS">In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p-dbSJ2MK8">new video released Monday for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></a>, the name of Konami’s upcoming <em>MGS 3</em> remake, Okamura tells longtime Snake voice actor David Hayter that his team, which includes “plenty of people on the team who were part of the original games,” has “been entrusted with the future of Metal Gear.”</p>
<p id="N2W6gV">“We want the players to be able to judge for themselves whether this new team is right for the job of keeping Metal Gear going,” Okamura said, referring to the team’s work on <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> and the recently released <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23939010/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-review-scripts-lore"><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em></a> compilation. </p>
<p id="lBpSnW">In his discussion with Hayter, Okamura opaquely addressed the departure of former Metal Gear creatives, like Hideo Kojima and Yoji Shinkawa. While he does not explicitly name them, he says, “Everyone who is no longer working on Metal Gear is pursuing their own path now, and that’s going to remain the case for these titles.” That’s a pretty solid indicator that Konami plans on (re)making more Metal Gear without the involvement of its original creator.</p>
<div id="LIzvbc"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1p-dbSJ2MK8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="KunoEP">Okamura previously worked with Kojima and team on games like <em>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/18/5519578/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review"><em>Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes</em></a>. He was also a producer on the poorly received 2018 game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/3/1/17067982/metal-gear-survive-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Metal Gear Survive</em></a>, the only original Metal Gear project released after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/12/15/10220372/hideo-kojima-new-studio-leaves-konami">Hideo Kojima left Konami</a>. </p>
<p id="2gBfKX">The <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> remake could represent a fresh start for the franchise at a post-Kojima Konami. The 2024 game was selected to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23931980/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-konami">lavishly remade in Unreal Engine 5</a> due to its place in the overall Metal Gear timeline, <a href="https://jp.ign.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/68128/news/mgs3metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-konami">Konami told IGN last year</a>; <em>Snake Eater</em> is an origin story for Naked Snake/Big Boss, and the first game chronologically in the franchise. In other words, it’s a smart place to start to bring in new fans who may not be well-versed in the MGS series’ era-jumping sequels.</p>
<p id="ABtSGT">If <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> is a success, and Konami does continue to remake games, <em>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</em> would be next in line chronologically. Those two early Cold War-era follow-ups to <em>Snake Eater</em> also star Big Boss — not Solid Snake — and would be able to build on the foundation of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>, using characters and assets from <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>. </p>
<p id="vJWFId">When future Metal Gear remakes will come to pass is still unknown, as is the release date <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em>. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24025475/silent-hill-2-remake-metal-gear-solid-3-release-dates">remake was originally pitched as a 2024 release</a>, but Konami hasn’t said anything this past week about <em>Delta</em> arriving this year, even as it sets pre-orders live. A 2025 release is starting to look more likely.</p>
<p id="qCFVN7">For now, Metal Gear fans will have to pass the time poring over new gameplay details released on Sunday in a new trailer for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-just-had-its-best-showcase-ever-and-at-the-perfect-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Amid multiple <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-decay-3-trailer-to-debut-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-leak"><u>leaks</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-showcase-rumors-gears-of-war-and-doom-look-likely-with-one-potentially-on-ps5"><u>rumors</u></a>, we had a decent idea of what was going to be at this year’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>Xbox Games Showcase</u></a> with seemingly plenty to get excited about. But when the Showcase finally aired, Microsoft did the near-impossible for any company in a fickle social media-fueled age: they exceeded expectations and drew almost universal acclaim. Eighty-four percent of the 10,000+ voters in <a href="https://x.com/DMC_Ryan/status/1799887129058938940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>my X poll</u></a> graded it an ‘A’ on the academic scale. Ninety-five percent gave it an ‘A’ or ‘B’. </p><p>A home run like this would be welcome at any time, but it’s an especially fortuitous one now for both Xbox fans and, no doubt, Xbox employees alike. Confidence had been shaken in recent months, with dedicated fans rankled by Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-hi-fi-rush-confirmed-for-ps5-release-date-announced"><u>decision</u></a> to bring some previously exclusive games to other platforms. Worse, Microsoft joined the tragically long list of gaming and tech companies to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>lay off thousands of employees</u></a> early in the year and, more recently, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>shut down four development studios</u></a> it acquired as part of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-bethesda-zenimax-aquisition"><u>$7.5 billion deal</u></a> just four years ago. Two of those were household names in core-gaming circles: Arkane Austin, who, their recent Redfall <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfall-review"><u>misfire</u></a> aside, had an incredibly impressive track record; and the one that really stuck in the community’s craw, Tango Gameworks. They were not only Xbox’s lone Japanese developer, but they’d had an unquestionably good run, highlighted by their most recent and arguably <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>best</u></a> game, Hi-Fi Rush. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>While Xbox’s best showcase ever can’t erase the human impact on the laid-off developers nor reignite the creative embers that have been snuffed out at the shut-down studios, it is the best way for fans who remain invested in the Xbox ecosystem to move forward with confidence and excitement for the future of the platform. And my goodness did that top-to-bottom brilliant showcase give me confidence and excitement for Xbox.</p><p>Call of Duty debuted on Xbox’s stage for the first time since the Xbox 360 era, with Black Ops 6 already looking like it could be one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-website-says-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-weighs-in-at-an-eye-watering-30985-gb"><u>biggest</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-first-campaign-and-zombies-details-first-multiplayer-impressions"><u>best</u></a> releases for the series in a half-decade – since Infinity Ward’s excellent Modern Warfare reboot in 2019. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer could barely contain his excitement on stage in announcing Doom: The Dark Ages, a bold, more melee combat-intensive prequel in id Software’s brilliantly revived and historically iconic first-person shooter franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And speaking of prequels, Xbox President Sarah Bond introduced the “one more thing” game for this Showcase: the long-anticipated new entry in the Gears series, which itself was not a surprise. What shocked everyone, though – which the trailer slowly made more apparent – was that we wouldn’t be picking up Kait’s story in Gears 6, but instead we’ll be going back to Emergence Day and the formation of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago’s Delta Squad in a Gears of War prequel – complete with a most-welcome (by me, at least) restoration of the “of War” part of the name. </p><p>But the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase didn’t just start big with Black Ops 6 and Doom: The Dark Ages and end big with Gears of War: E-Day – it kept cooking for almost the entire runtime. A new gameplay trailer for Fable floored me, as not only was I not expecting to see any more of it after getting our first tiny glimpse at gameplay at last year’s Showcase, but we got to see quite a bit of Playground’s gorgeous new rendition of Albion. The cherry on top was Microsoft committing to a 2025 release window, which means we can already pencil in Doom: The Dark Ages and Fable for next year – my gut says the former will drop in the Spring, and the latter in the Fall. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Oh, but South of Midnight belongs on that 2025 list too! We got a proper gameplay trailer for Compulsion’s first game since joining the Xbox family after it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-new-game-from-we-happy-few-developer-unveiled-at-xbox-showcase"><u>announced</u></a> with a cinematic piece last year, and the art style is incredibly beautiful and wholly unique. </p><p>Meanwhile, it didn’t get a release year attached to it (meaning, assume 2026 for now), but the game that stole the fantastic show for me was Perfect Dark. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative"><u>long-gestating</u></a> reboot of the beloved Nintendo 64 classic (and decently liked Xbox 360 launch title) has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away"><u>reportedly</u></a> endured a <a href="https://in.ign.com/perfect-dark-next-gen/206374/news/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-reportedly-in-a-rough-state-since-years-according-to-industry-insider" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>troubled development</u></a>, but the co-developers at The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics blew me away by showing off a gameplay-packed trailer that showed off gadgets, first-person shooting, and parkour, leaving me optimistic that we might have a slick combination of Mirror’s Edge, Deus Ex, and the original Perfect Dark on our hands. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Even the inevitable mid-show lull that every showcase like this goes through yielded compelling reveals: the ‘90s-set adventure Mixtape feels like it was made for me specifically, Metal Gear Solid: Delta appears to be both a gorgeous and incredibly faithful remake of the classic Metal Gear Solid 3, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle only “disappointed” me with an otherwise A+ story trailer because we didn’t get a more specific release date than “2024.” But it does reaffirm that within six months I’ll be playing the next effort from MachineGames, a studio that has never missed.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The game that stole the fantastic show for me was Perfect Dark.</p></div><p>In fact, Xbox’s 2024 Games Showcase was so spectacular and packed with huge first-party games that I didn’t even notice that two of their biggest pillars were missing: Halo and Forza. Granted, I wasn’t expecting anything from Halo, as we’re still only 2.5 years past Halo Infinite’s release. But Forza? Surely a new Forza Horizon – arguably Xbox’s most <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/25/forza-horizon-4-review"><u>consistently</u></a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-review"><u>brilliant</u></a> franchise – is in the works! If you’re Microsoft, you know you’ve had a heck of a showcase when Halo and Forza can stay home and nobody seems to mind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I suppose there was one rumored thing that ended up not being included: an Xbox handheld. Fortunately, I got a chance to ask Phil Spencer about that directly afterwards, and I’d say he came as close as he could to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024"><u>confirming its existence</u></a> without formally announcing it.</p><p>If this stellar showcase reaffirmed anything for both Microsoft and Xbox fans alike, it’s that a powerful console is great, and Xbox Game Pass offers a nice value option, but a consistent diet of top-shelf games is what matters more than anything else. More of this please, Microsoft.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

On the other hand, it <em>would</em> be fitting, considering it would mark exactly 20 years after the original Metal Gear Solid 3 released. It's in line, too, with a previously announced release window, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-seemingly-confirmed-for-2024-release-in-playstation-trailer">PlayStation had it listed as a 2024 game</a> in a trailer at the beginning of this year. </p><p>IGN has reached out to Konami for comment.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta was one of the many games to get a spotlight <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase">at yesterday's Xbox Showcase</a> but, much to the disappointment of fans, a release date was not revealed with the new trailer then. We first learned about Metal Gear Solid Delta <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-announced-playstation-showcase">in May 2023</a>.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is said to be a faithful remake of MGS3, so much so that Konami isn't <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-reportedly-isnt-recording-new-voice-acting-for-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">even planning on recording new voice lines for it</a>. Despite that, the Delta symbol in the name of the remake (stylized as Metal Gear Solid Δ: Snake Eater) is meant to highlight "'change' or 'difference' without changing structure," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-explains-why-theres-a-symbol-in-metal-gear-solid-3-remake">Konami previously explained</a>. </p><p>For more, check out everything that was announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced">at yesterday's Xbox Showcase</a>. </p><p><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

                <p>Xbox's 2024 Showcase came and went without any mention of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a> or Halo in general, but the official <a href="https://x.com/Halo/status/1800243795503546868" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Halo X account</a> did share a month-old Halo Infinite trailer a day later.</p><p dir="ltr">This year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5460/" data-ref-id="2900-5460">Xbox Showcase</a>, the first since Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard, was without a doubt one to remember, featuring new installments from heavy-hitting franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/" data-ref-id="1100-6524072">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-coming-2025/1100-6524073/" data-ref-id="1100-6524073">Doom</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-trailer-shows-first-gameplay-coming-2025/1100-6524087/" data-ref-id="1100-6524087">Fable</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-e-day-a-new-gears-of-war-prequel-revealed/1100-6524074/" data-ref-id="1100-6524074">Gears of War</a>, and the reboot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-gets-first-gameplay-trailer/1100-6524084/" data-ref-id="1100-6524084">Perfect Dark</a>. What wasn't shown or mentioned was Halo, the franchise whose lead character, the Master Chief, has long served as a mascot for the Xbox brand and, until Microsoft's acquisition of Call of Duty, has arguably always been its most recognizable game franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">That made Halo's absence during the showcase even more noticeable. Not even Halo Infinite was mentioned, further solidifying the writing on the wall that the 2021 title, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-dev-shifting-to-unreal-engine-no-halo-infinite-story-content-planned-report/1100-6511013/" data-ref-id="1100-6511013">not receiving story DLC</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-moving-away-from-seasons-doubling-down-on-free-operations-instead/1100-6520471/" data-ref-id="1100-6520471">future multiplayer seasons</a>, is reaching the end of its life. Developer 343 Industries has said nearly as much, having already publicly said the studio is changing priorities and looking to ramp up development on future Halo projects.</p><p dir="ltr">Adding to the oddness surrounding Halo's absence was the fact that the official Halo X account shared what at first glance seemed like a new trailer for Halo Infinite, not on the day of the showcase, but a day later at the same time as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/ubisoft-forward-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5462/" data-ref-id="2900-5462">Ubisoft Forward</a> press conference was taking place. Even stranger was that the trailer wasn't in fact new, but a month-old trailer that had already been posted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvz0PdDiZR8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, highlighting all the various features, improvements, and community-made Forge creations that had come to Halo Infinite in recent months. Many of the replies to the Halo account's post asked why the trailer wasn't part of the showcase, while others wished there was more to look forward to in regards to the franchise's future.</p><p dir="ltr">If there is a silver-lining, it's that there are at least some rumors of future Halo projects. Halo support studio Certain Affinity was long said to have been working on a Halo spin-off, though that has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rumored-halo-battle-royale-project-seemingly-canceled/1100-6520335/" data-ref-id="1100-6520335">reportedly been canceled</a>. A recent report from The Verge stated a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-halo-game-is-reportedly-being-considered-for-ps5/1100-6523999/" data-ref-id="1100-6523999">remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is also in the works</a>, but that it's still in early development and could potentially release on PlayStation 5 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-comments-on-xbox-games-coming-to-playstation/1100-6522971/" data-ref-id="1100-6522971">Xbox's new multiplatform strategy</a>, in what would be a strange fate for the series that was once held as Xbox's most important console exclusive. What the future holds for Master Chief and the Halo franchise is still unclear, but what is clear is that fans are ready to learn what's next, sooner rather than later.</p>

The series’ first foray into first-person arrives first on July 2, while the RE2 port is "currently in development."</p>

<p>Both entries will be playable on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPads and Macs with the M1 chip or later. Both games will feature enhanced controls and a new Auto Fire feature, a more approachable option that causes guns to automatically fire when aimed at enemies. RE7 will also include the Not A Hero story DLC starring Chris Redfield. You can also purchase the Gold Edition that includes additional DLC such as the End of Zoe, Vol. 1 and 2. of Banned Footage, the Madhouse difficulty mode, and more.&nbsp;At launch, players can try a slice of each game via a free download before making a purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard launched in 2017 and introduced fans to Ethan Winters, who travels to a terrifying house in the backcountry in search of his missing wife. The game kicks off the current storylines for the mainline series, which continued in Resident Evil Village. Speaking of Village, that game, along with the Resident Evil, were<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/09/25/resident-evil-4-remake-re-village-and-assassins-creed-mirage-announced-for-iphone"> ported to Apple platorms last year</a>.

            <p>It’s been almost a decade since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rebel-galaxy">Rebel Galaxy</a> ably picked up the sci-fi trading and exploration mantle handed down by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/freelancer">Freelancer</a>, but it looks like a successor to the serene galaxy-venturing vibes of both is finally upon us. Star Trucker is exactly what it sounds like, transplanting the chill A-to-Z courier journeys of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator">Euro Truck Simulator</a> to the interplanetary, uh, roads of space. It’s out this September, and it looks wonderful.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Unlike Rebel Galaxy and Freelancer, Star Trucker keeps its galaxy nice and peaceful, doing away with any threat of combat in favour of focusing on the hauling of your cargo to your destination.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean there won’t be the chance of some drama, mind - the burning heat and light of nearby suns mean you might need to drop the cab’s windscreen shield, while taking too much damage from collisions and the harsh conditions of space means you’ll have to strap on a spacesuit and conduct some repairs on a spacewalk or risk needing a tow across the cosmos. As well as delivering your legit cargo to earn cash, unlock new jobs and upgrade your rig, you’ll also have the option to stop off and sell smaller goods - and even flog contraband - for some bonus money.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, it looks to be a game to sit back and relax to, plotting your route before turning on the radio and firing up your rocket-powered lorry. The radio will infuse plenty of that good ol’ Americana feel into your deep-space trucking with a choice of genres that’d feel right at home on a Top Gear driving music compilation - “starburst blues, galactic rock and asteroid-infused americana” - as well as the ability to chat with fellow space truckers (all fully voiced) for gossip, request docking to a station or issue an emergency SOS if you need it.</p>
<p>Alice B (RPS in Peace) seemed impressed by Star Trucker’s bonafide simulation credentials <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/egx-highlights-8-great-games-from-the-rezzed-zone-you-need-to-play">when she checked it out at EGX last year</a>, along with the fact you get a glove compartment and a call sign for the CB radio.</p>
<p>Star Trucker <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2380050/Star_Trucker/">already has a demo on Steam</a> you can go and try yourself if you’re curious, ahead of its newly-revealed release date on September 3rd. It’ll also hit Game Pass on day one, so you’ll be able to give the full thing a go for free then too.</p>

  <p id="6LHmIN"><strong>Wondrous Tails</strong> (commonly abbreviated as <strong>WT</strong>) is one of the most important weeklies in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>, giving you rewards for doing duties and helping you clear new content. It’s kind of like bingo and you’ll get more rewards for getting more lines in a row.</p>
<p id="4ktFkU">Below we detail how Wondrous Tails works in <em>FFXIV</em>, how to unlock Wondrous Tails, the rewards you can get, and how to get three lines.</p>
<hr id="EhJms6">

<p id="fT2Qk0">Every week, Khloe Aliapoh, a young Miqo’te in Idyllshire, will give you a book to fill out. In exchange for tales of your triumph, she will give you <strong>stickers</strong>. Line up four stickers in a row on the four-by-four grid and you’ll get a special prize. You can get nine stickers total, so if you get more lines, you’ll get bigger prizes.</p>
<p id="zWsrZZ">The Wondrous Tails book is a <strong>key item</strong>, and you can use the item to open the book. You can earn stickers by completing the duties displayed on the left side of the book and you can see the stickers you have on the right side.</p>
<p id="ZRampO">For every assigned duty you complete, Khloe will give you a <strong>sticker in a random spot on the grid</strong>. Ideally, you want at least one line before the book expires during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24118981/reset-daily-weekly-times-server-time">weekly reset</a> (it says when the book goes bad on the top left), to get some good rewards.</p>

<p id="WwTI5W">If you are in a party with anyone clearing any content for the first time, you’ll get a “<strong>Second Chance</strong>,” as displayed below the grid of duties. For example, you’ll get a second chance if you queue in Trials Roulette and get a new player completing “The Striking Tree” for the first time, even if it’s not on your list of Wondrous Tails duties for that week.</p>
<p id="plfAEh">You can use Second Chances to “<strong>retry</strong>,” marking a cleared duty as uncleared (making it so you can earn another sticker from completing that same duty) and moving the clear to a different duty. You can also use two Second Chances to “<strong>shuffle</strong>,” <strong>rerolling where your stickers are on your grid</strong>. This is super important if you’re going for a specific amount of lines.</p>
<p id="MIwp71">Once you have nine stickers in your book, return it to Khloe to get your rewards. If your book expires before you do this (even if it’s complete), you will not be able to claim any rewards.</p>

<h2 id="D4VWeA"><strong>How to unlock Wondrous Tails in FFXIV</strong></h2>
<p id="sT0avz">To unlock Wondrous Tails, you need to complete the level 60 quest “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/1e9e056a547/">Keeping Up with the Aliapohs</a>” (lol). You can pick this quest up from the <strong>“Unctuous Adventurer” NPC in Idyllshire</strong>.</p>
<p id="dHXxGP">The NPC will have the blue quest marker with the plus sign above their head, so you should be able to find them on your map.</p>
<hr id="h4TihC">
<h2 id="lyZpjn"><strong>Wondrous Tails rewards</strong></h2>
<p id="01KKbU">Khloe will offer the same rewards for lines, though the type of Tomestones rewarded vary depending on the patch. There are some exceptions, as some rewards will change to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24125345/tomestones-poetics-what-to-spend-cap">Poetics</a> if a new patch that changes tomestones is about to come out. You’ll also only get certain Tomestones if you have at least one job at max level. You will have to pick one reward from the following, depending on how many lines you got:</p>
<ul>
<li id="heOQ7G">
<strong>9 Seals</strong>: 500 Allagan Tomestones of Poetics, an Allagan Platinum Piece, or a treasure map from the current expansion</li>
<li id="znBO6p">
<strong>1 line</strong>: 1 MGP Gold Card (worth 30,000 MGP, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24067651/gold-saucer-unlock-side-quest-location-manderville-mgp">Gold Saucer</a> currency), 1 Khloe’s Bronze Certificate of Commendation, or 300 high-value tomes</li>
<li id="LYBgAf">
<strong>2 lines</strong>: 2 MGP Gold Cards, 1 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1,000 lower-value tomes</li>
<li id="uYDUS8">
<strong>3 lines</strong>: 20 MGP Gold Cards, 3 Khloe’s Silver Certificate of Commendation, or 1 Khloe’s Gold Certificate of Commendation</li>
</ul>
<p id="lVhQLt">If your book is complete with nine seals, you’ll also get <strong>50% of a level’s worth of EXP on whatever job you turn the book in with</strong>. That said, you should make sure to turn in the book on a job that isn’t maxed to make the most of the rewards.</p>

<p id="bdmyZr">Each of Khloe’s certificates have their own item exchange when you talk to Khloe. The rewards for each type are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="uQWknh">
<strong>Bronze Certificates</strong>: Clusters for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24124503/materia-location-how-to-get-meld-overmeld-pentameld">materia</a>, minions, and magicked prisms</li>
<li id="RL1LuP">
<strong>Silver Certificates</strong>: Glamour accessories, older ornate armor, clusters for materia, minions, and a framer’s kit</li>
<li id="dmXY2I">
<strong>Gold Certificates</strong>: Sabotender de la Luna Whistle, Magicked Children’s Bed, Wondrous Lanner Whistle, Troll Horn, Calydontis Horn, Incitatus Whistle, clusters for materia, and ornate armor</li>
</ul>
<p id="w5dmpZ">Keep in mind that almost everything that Khloe will trade you can be bought from the marketboard, though at a high price. (The mounts you get from the gold certificates can sell for nearly 10 million gil, depending on your server!)</p>

Here’s what we learned.</p><h2 id="h120763"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> goes back to the source</strong></h2><p>Searcy tells us that The Coalition continued to work on <em>Gears 5</em> for well over a year after its 2019 launch, and that shaped their decision to pivot to <em>E-Day</em>. ‘When we finished all that stuff we were actually pretty far into the [covid] pandemic. So, a lot of people at the studio were saying we’re just gonna take a beat and reflect.” The natural progression might seem to be toward <em>Gears 6</em> (especially considering the cliffhanger at the end of <em>5</em>). But, the team instead found inspiration in an iconic, but relatively unmined, aspect of <em>Gears </em>lore: Emergence Day, or E-Day, when the bad-guy Locust first emerged from underground on the planet Sera.</p><p>“We wanted to make something that really went to the heart of what people have in their heads when they play <em>Gears</em>,” Faucette said. “We spent a lot of time listening to how fans talk about <em>Gears</em>.” The Coalition settled on four main pillars: the brutality inherent in this universe, the melancholic vibes (exemplified in the marketing both then and now, which loves to needle drop somber versions of  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18YvjD9oH38" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Mad World”</a></span>), the brotherhood shared by the members of the COG army, and big, bold action sequences.</p><p>“E-Day is where we landed [after discussing those franchise pillars],” Searcy said. “We felt like we could get the most out of the theme, the vibe….it’s the most important day in the entire franchise and there’s never been a game set there. It’s a ‘what if’ story. What if monsters came out of the ground in Los Angeles?”</p><p>Faucette said that the team wants the Locust to feel scarier than they have in a while, especially the Drones, who have become a kind of cannon (and meme) fodder as the <em>Gears</em> series has progressed. We want to “go back to those horror vibes,” Faucette said. “[We want the Locust to be] actually monsters that scare the shit out of you.”</p><h2 id="h120764"><a id=""></a><strong>Bros of war</strong></h2><p>Aside from the chainsaw gun, <em>Gears</em> <em>of War</em> is probably best known for its bond between Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago. The two hulking manly men have plenty of tender moments throughout the original trilogy, and Dom’s death at the end of <em>Gears of War 3</em> remains to this day one of the most emotional things I’ve experienced in a game. <em>E-Day</em> takes place 14 years before the events of <em>Gears 1</em>, during a time in which Marcus and Dom aren’t yet the best bros.</p><p>“They’re not the same Marcus and Dom that you know from the original trilogy,” Faucette said. Dom’s older brother recently died in the Pendulum War, and he and Marcus  were best friends, so there’s “tension, they’re struggling with grief and loss.” For The Coalition, <em>Gears of War E-Day</em> is an origin story of both Emergence Day but also of the bond that “defines the franchise.”</p><p>I love Marcus and Dom just as much as everyone else, but I still had a momentary pause after seeing the trailer. Until Anya (the Lieutenant in your ear in <em>Gears 1</em> and <em>Gears 2</em>) became a playable character in <em>Gears</em> <em>3</em>, the franchise always felt incredibly masculine—especially if you played online like I did. With Kait Diaz becoming a central character in the second trilogy, it felt like the franchise was spreading its wings a bit more. Now, we’re back to the bros—during a time of great strife in the industry where, perhaps, a female-focused <em>Gears</em> game would be met with derision from some bad actors.</p><p>I asked Faucette and Searcy about this, if <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> would feel like a bro-down session, a sort of backtracking, and they assured me it wouldn’t. They couldn’t tell me about them, but they promised there’d be other characters central to the story. “Those are just the two people in the trailer,” Faucette pointed out. “<em>Gears</em> has always had a commitment of [showcasing] a wide array of humanity on this planet up against these monsters. That’s our studio values and our franchise values. We are 100% committed to unique and interesting characters in all walks of life.”</p><p>Here’s hoping I get to cut a Locust in half as a bad-ass bitch whenever <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em> drops. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has unveiled Anno 117: Pax Romana, a new entry in Ubisoft Blue Byte's long-running economic city builder series, which is set to whisk PC and console players back to ancient Rome and the Roman Empire when it launches next year.
</p>
<p>
"It is the year 117 AD," Ubisoft explains, "as a Roman Governor of twin provinces of the Empire, your choices matter to your citizens. Build, trade, expand. Seize opportunities and harness the unique advantages and challenges that Albion and Latium provinces present."
</p>
<p>
"Will you encourage economic growth or expand your rule through dominance?," it continues. "Lead with rebellion or unite a diverse culture? The cost of peace is yours to decide."

<p>
Details are limited at present, but the <a href="http://anno117paxromana.com/">Anno 117 website</a> makes mention of a "challenging narrative journey... where alternative paths beckon", and it'll all unfold across the the twin provinces under players' stewardship - those being the aforementioned Albion and Latium.
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, there're no screenshots and no gameplay footage to be scrutinised (although Ubisoft <em>has</em> released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJNzvo3UJb8">live-action teaser trailer</a> to set the mood), so all we can do is await further information ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana's eventual arrival on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime next year.
