<p>The next Assassin’s Creed game has secured its Lead Scriptwriter, and it’s someone with a history of working on the franchise.</p>



<p>Christopher Grilli, someone with a history as the Scriptwriter for Assassin’s Creed Origins and Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and the lead writer for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, recently revealed on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christophergrilli_im-thrilled-to-share-that-im-starting-a-activity-7417934734485413889-FrRL?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAGBVXOMBvz_qCqVv-uRJAvpCCT5UFNbGSog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile that he has signed on to be the Scriptwriter for the next game in the long-running franchise, code-named Hexe.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I’m thrilled to share that I’m starting a new position at Ubisoft Montreal as a Lead Scriptwriter on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe. Incredibly grateful to be a part of this team and project,” he shared on January 16.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-everything-known-about-assassin-s-creed-hexe-so-far">Everything Known About Assassin’s Creed Hexe So Far</h2>



<p>In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-hexe-early-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming reported</a> that the game was in a relatively early stage of development and was expected to be released this year. It’s also believed this will be a more linear experience than other games in the franchise, and that the series will feature a female protagonist named Elsa with supernatural abilities.</p>



<p>The game takes place in 16th-century Central Europe during the Holy Roman Empire, and reports indicate developers plan to implement a fear system inspired by the Jack the Ripper DLC from Assassin’s Creed Syndicate.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>With the Lead Scriptwriter only now coming on board, it’s fair to suggest that the game is still a ways from release, but with someone with such experience on the team, it appears to be heading in the right direction.

                <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>'s Season 2 launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-update-delayed-to-help-refine-the-content-after-fan-feedback/1100-6537352/" data-ref-id="1100-6537352">was pushed back to February 17</a> to give the development team more time to implement some needed changes. But that doesn't mean there won't be some improvements ahead of time. Electronic Arts has announced that Battlefield 6 Update 1.1.3.5 will arrive on Tuesday, January 20, and it's bringing some good news for anyone who wanted the jet combat to be more refined.</p><p>Going forward, jet cannon damage against flying vehicles has been greatly reduced, and it will take "approximately 40% more hits" to blow targets out of the sky. However, the air radar that was previously announced will not be included in this update.</p><p>Melee combat was also a priority for this update, which aims to improve "responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer." The Assault Ladder should also be more functional after this update, and the patch notes indicate that it has resolved some issues with the user interface and heads-up display in Redsec and Multiplayer, in addition to better stability for the Battle Royale and Gauntlet modes.</p><p>Since Season 1 has been extended, Battlefield Studios is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-season-2-delay-adds-more-challenges-cosmetics-and-double-xp-to-season-1/1100-6537406/" data-ref-id="1100-6537406">adding new weekly challenges</a> and a Frostfire bonus path that includes a hardware XP boost, a vehicle skin, and player-card customization items. Season pass owners will also be able to get a weapon package, an XP boost for your entire career, and more cosmetics.</p><p>The complete patch notes for Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 are below, and they will go live on January 20 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET.</p><h2>Battlefield 6 Season 1 Update 1.1.3.5 Patch Notes</h2><h3>Major Updates for 1.1.3.5</h3><ul><li>Improved responsiveness, consistency, and sprint behavior for melee attacks, including knives and the sledgehammer.</li><li>Updated jet combat balance by reducing jet cannon effectiveness against other air vehicles.</li><li>Updated and refined the UI and HUD across Multiplayer and REDSEC, improving armor bar visibility, reticle presentation, and menu navigation.</li></ul><h3>Changelog</h3><h3>Vehicles</h3><p>Fixed an issue where vehicles could explode when a takedown was performed on an enemy soldier lying on top of them.</p><p>Reduced jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, requiring approximately 40% more hits to destroy enemy air targets.</p><h3>Weapons</h3><ul><li>Bipod attachments no longer display as always providing a hipfire accuracy bonus, as this bonus only applies while the bipod is deployed.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the GRIM 1.50x optic on the DB-12 cost fewer loadout points than intended (15 instead of 25).</li><li>Fixed an issue where the RPKM iron sights would shoot low when using the short barrel.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the TR-7 Light Barrel incorrectly improved muzzle velocity.</li><li>Fixed bipod mount input behaviour for Alternate, Lefty Alternate, Southpaw, and Legacy Southpaw presets so the bipod mount now follows the melee button.</li><li>Improved attack speed for knife melee attacks.</li><li>Improved buffering behaviour for knife and sledgehammer attacks.</li><li>Improved consistency of melee damage timing against enemies and the environment.</li><li>Improved consistency of recoil modifiers when using a controller across different weapons.</li><li>Improved how sprint is interrupted when performing melee attacks.

You made it to the end of the week, and I hope some of the stories we published this week made doing so just a little bit easier. It was a slow week for reviews, previews, and the like – a very quiet January so far before the storm of releases that is February, which includes some big games – but a big one for news. We also completed a ton of magazine proofing and editing this week, and we're putting the final touches on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">the next issue</a>, featuring [REDACTED] on the cover, as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of, we'll be revealing said cover next week, so keep an eye out on <em>Game Informer's </em>social channels for exact details on when. You don't want to miss it!&nbsp;</p><p>I started <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/12/the-first-ever-pokemon-lego-sets-have-been-revealed-and-they-look-amazing">This Week On GI</a> as a formal article last week to detail weekly <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping updates AND to neatly and concisely organize all the content we published on the site that week. Below, you'll find the general <em>Game Informer </em>housekeeping section followed by an article round-up underneath it:&nbsp;</p><h2>Game Informer Housekeeping</h2>

<p>Overall, it's a quieter week on the housekeeping front. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/wowmidnight">The latest magazine issue</a>, which features <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover/2025/12/16/cover-reveal-world-of-warcraft-midnight">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a> on the cover, continues to ship to mailboxes. We're aware that prior issues – mostly the The Outer Worlds 2 and, to a lesser extent, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined editions – had some shipping issues; it was the result of post service errors and shipping delays as a result of last year's government shutdown and while that was out of our hands, we take full responsibility and continue to try to make things right for those who are still waiting on magazines. That said, it seems like the majority of shipping problems are behind us, and the World of Warcraft: Midnight issue is reaching mailboxes in a timely and expected manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, thank you all for your patience as we work with our shipping partners to get everything back on track. We're looking forward to delivering some excellent physical magazine goodness to your mailboxes this year, and our next issue is a very exciting one, so get stoked!</p><p>If you aren't already a <em>Game Informer </em>subscriber, there's still time to become one and receive that issue – <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">you can subscribe here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Story Round-Up</h2><p>Below, I've divided up the various sections of <em>Game Informer's </em>published stories, hopefully making it easy to check out the articles you might have missed.</p><h3>News</h3>

              <p><span>The video game industry’s awards season was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>dominated</span></a><span> this year by adulation for French turn-based roleplaying game</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span>. It’s easy to see why so many people loved it, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119"><span>AI usage</span></a><span> and</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>controversial status</span></a><span> as an “indie” game aside, but my personal game of the year was a much smaller project that garnered a lot less attention: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/baby-steps"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span>. Fortunately, at least one awards show is finally giving it the respect a bunch of us weirdos believe it deserves.</span></p> <p><span>The 2026 Independent Games Festival Awards released </span><a href="https://igf.com/article/baby-steps-strolls-to-lead-with-5-nominations-at-2026-igf-awards"><span>its list of nominees</span></a><span> on January 8, showcasing the incredible work of developers outside the AAA space. </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> managed to pick up nominations in five categories, including Excellence in Audio, Excellence in Design, Excellence in Narrative, the Nuovo Award (for “experiences that make the awards jurors think differently about games as a medium”), and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/baby-steps-qwop-indie-devolver-pc-ps5-new-trailer-1850521583"><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i></a><span> tells the story of Nate, a man transported from living in squalor in his parents’ basement to a magical world inhabited by long-dicked donkey men and Australians. Navigating this strange setting, at least on PlayStation 5, revolves around using the controller’s triggers to independently control Nate’s feet by lifting them off the ground, and the control stick to have Nate lean in whatever direction you intend on traveling. Even simple walking requires maintaining a rhythm, and things get even more difficult as you climb slippery slopes and awkward rockfaces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’m so happy to see </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> get this kind of recognition. Not only does it advance the nascent genre of physics-based “rage games” practically invented by co-developer Bennett Foddy (who previously made&nbsp;<em>QWOP </em>and <em>Getting Over It</em>),&nbsp;but it also manages to interrogate the very concept of challenging video game mechanics through both gameplay and narrative. Please play this game, and remember, </span><i><span>Baby Steps</span></i><span> doesn’t want you to rage, it wants you to love yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>Offbeat local TV broadcast simulator</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/blippo-plus"> <i><span>Blippo+</span></i></a><span>, surreal strategy game</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/titanium-court"> <i><span>Titanium Court</span></i></a><span>, and the bafflingly controversial</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><i><span>Horses</span></i></a><span> also received multiple nominations. After seeing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>the Game Awards</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260115137649/en/Finalists-Announced-for-the-26th-Annual-Game-Developers-Choice-Awards-Led-by-Clair-Obscur-Expedition-33-With-Eight-Total-Nominations"><span>the Game Developers Choice Awards</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.interactive.org/awards/29th_dice_awards_finalists_93k3p1.asp"><span>the DICE Awards</span></a><span> focus almost exclusively on </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> and other mainstream, AAA fare, it’s refreshing to know there are still shows dedicated to plumbing the depths of the medium rather than remaining at surface level.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Furthermore, this year’s show features a new category honoring games made by women and other gender-marginalized developers in collaboration with investment fund</span> <a href="https://www.wingsfund.me/"><span>Wings Interactive</span></a><span>. Each award comes bundled with a $2,000 bonus, apart from the grand prize which awards $20,000.</span></p>

      <p>What are the best mothers and ships in video games? Thank goodness there’s a website for that now.</p><p><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/board-the-mothership/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mothership</u></a>, a new publication at the intersection of gender and games from ex-Polygon staffers Maddy Myers and Zoë Hannah, is the one bright spot in <a href="https://aftermath.site/layoff-verge-inverse-gaming/"><u>an already terrible year</u></a> for games media. Also, it’s about way more than mothers and ships. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours/" rel="noreferrer">Aftermath Hours</a>, Maddy and Zoë tell us about their plans for the site and what it means to launch a publication like this in an era when feminist media has been gutted, and even venerable institutions like Teen Vogue – a primary inspiration for Mothership – <a href="https://www.cjr.org/feature/the-tragic-loss-of-teen-vogue.php?ref=aftermath.site"><u>have fallen</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about <a href="https://defector.com/how-much-is-eight-dollars?ref=aftermath.site"><u>how much money $8 is</u></a> (actually $10, but also possibly $5). We also imagine what might happen if Asmongold, fresh off <a href="https://x.com/Disinfo_Tracker/status/2011808087431397672?ref=aftermath.site"><u>being retweeted by JD Vance</u></a>, travels to The White House and gives Donald Trump some kind of plague. Nothing too terrible, of course!</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> From one of our readers: Who/what is the best mother in games? Use whatever meaning of the term “mother” you want. And what’s your favorite ship? Use whatever meaning of “ship” you want.</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>Oh my god. Best mother in games is legit hard because there’s almost no moms in games.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Best as in “best portrayal of what motherhood often ends up being like” is the lady from <em>Portal</em>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Chell?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Not Chell, the robot.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> GLaDOS and Chell’s mommy-daughter relationship is terrifying.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That is a mother-daughter relationship, and that is a pretty accurate representation of how a lot of adult women feel about their mothers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> Yeah, I would say [it’s the] best in terms of a story potential and also an iteration on, I would say, the classic Mother Brain-Samus relationship, which is of course an iteration on the original <em>Alien </em>movie – the mother AI in that movie. All of these things are permutations of permutations of permutations, and GLaDOS is one of the greatest ones. The idea of a super computer AI being a female voice and also therefore being your mom and evil – just kind of knowing that lineage is so key there. It’s part of what makes GLaDOS so fascinating and still relevant today to some of the conversations we have about AI and what it’s for and what it does.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Do you have any other ideas of who the best mom is?</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>I mean, I don’t know. There’s a lot of bad moms in games. I did like <em>Returnal</em>, where you get to play as a woman who’s kind of wrestling with the idea of that. I might go with that. But I think GLaDOS is also a really great answer as a multifaceted mother figure character.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Your mom doesn’t want you to disobey her, and if you do, she’ll kill you.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> Maybe it says something that it’s so easy to think of bad moms in games. I think that may be something to interrogate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Along the same lines as, at a certain point in time, all video games became about being a father.</p><p><strong>Maddy: </strong>Yeah, but we still haven’t had the time where all video games are about being a mother. They’re instead about the game developer’s relationship with their mother – which says something about who’s making games still and how many of them are mothers. Maybe not that many.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Do you have a favorite ship?</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> I was asked on the Minn/Max show earlier this week about what I picture as being the Mothership, and I talked about the Protoss mothership in <em>StarCraft II</em>. I do think that ship looks freaking cool as hell, and it is what I picture.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think what they’re really asking [about] is romantic ship. There’s some pretty good <em>Dragon Age</em> and<em> Mass Effect </em>classics. Like, come on: Player/Garrus. There’s a reason why that’s a classic. It’s still good.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>We all understand why.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Calibrations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> Calibrations, baby.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Hundreds of thousands of frustrated female players and Johnny Silverhand is my favorite.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> He’s not my type, personally, but I do get it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And you know why he is my type.</p><p><strong>Maddy:</strong> I do know you well enough to know that, and it’s like with anything else: You have some mild concern about someone whose type is Johnny Silverhand.</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://www.mothership.blog/board-the-mothership/?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Board the Mothership.</p><p>You’re just in time. A couple weeks from now, on January 26, 2026, we’ll be launching the full version of our new gaming website, Mothership, which aims to analyze games specifically through the lens of gender and identity.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Who’s ready to stream the <a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816">new<em> Zelda</em> movie</a> on Netflix at their in-laws’ in 2027? Why did Sony delete over 1,000 shovelware games from PSN? And just how bad are graphics card prices about to get? Welcome to a special afternoon edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Look, I was really busy today.</p> <p>Here’s your moment of zen for the weekend: local news broadcasters <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@quietcharacterofficial/video/7595295106295532818">trying to say the names of famous Pokémon</a>.</p>   <h2>Sony and Netflix lock in a new mega deal after the success of <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em></h2> <p>“Netflix and Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE) today announced a landmark global Pay-1 licensing deal. In the exclusive multi-year agreement, SPE’s feature films will stream on Netflix worldwide — an industry-first for Pay-1 — following their full theatrical and home entertainment windows,” the companies revealed this week. Netflix cited Nintendo’s upcoming live-action <em>Zelda</em> adaptation as a specific example toward the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-sony-pictures-entertainment-enter-new-global-pay-1-deal">bottom of its announcement</a>. It hits theaters on March 26, 2027.</p>

 <p><span>“Some of the first SPE feature film titles that will stream on Netflix as part of the new deal include </span><em><span>The Nightingale</span></em><span>, the highly anticipated adaptation of Kristin Hannah’s global sensation starring Dakota and Elle Fanning together for the first time; Sony Pictures Animation’s </span><em><span>Buds</span></em><span>; Nintendo’s live-action </span><em><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></em><span>; </span><em><span>Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse</span></em><span>, the conclusion to the groundbreaking<em> Spider-Verse</em> trilogy; and Academy Award-winner Sam Mendes’ audacious quartet of Beatles films,” it read.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>If a graphics card is still being stocked but no one can get it, does it still matter?</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE"><em>Hardware Unboxed</em> reported</a> earlier this week that the Nvidia RTX 5070 Ti had effectively reached “end-of-life” status and would no longer be supplied by manufacturers. That was sourced in part to comments from Asus, which quickly turned around and said no, no, no, you’ve got it all wrong.</p>

 <p>“Current fluctuations in supply for both products are primarily due to memory supply constraints, which have temporarily affected production output and restocking cycles,” it said <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/statements/asus-rtx-5070ti-5060ti-statement/">in a statement</a>. “As a result, availability may appear limited in certain markets, but this should not be interpreted as a production halt or product retirement.”</p>

 <p>That means you can still get one, right? Right?? A quick search online shows they’re out of stock at Best Buy, Microcenter, and other retailers, with even cards marked up 50 percent over the $750 MSRP being on back order.</p> <h2><em>Toy Story Mania</em> and 13 other Disney games just disappeared from Steam</h2> <p>The delistings were spotted by <a href="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.steamgifts.com/discussion/3wgEr/14-disney-games-were-suddenly-delisted">Steamgifts forum member HappyCatEW</a>. Other games removed from Valve’s storefront include <em>Finding Nemo</em>, <em>Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell’s Adventure</em>, and <em>Chicken Little: Ace in Action</em>. It’s unclear if this is part of a larger move on Disney’s part or just someone looking at a particular segment of the gaming division and wondering why it’s still maintaining listings for games that people aren’t really playing. Still, <em>Disney’s Hercules</em> has seven people in-game right now according to SteamDB. Game preservation suffers another blow.</p>

 <h2><em>The Grudge 2</em>‘s Teresa Palmer is the<em> God of War</em> TV show’s latest casting addition</h2> <p><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/god-of-war-series-cast-teresa-palmer-1236633293/">She’ll play Sif</a>, Thor’s wife, alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584">Ryan Hurst</a>, who played Thor in&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarök </em>but is playing leading man Kratos here. Getting confused yet? Notably, Sif doesn’t appear in <em>God of War</em> 2018, suggesting the first season of the Amazon adaptation will be blending characters and events from across the whole Norse saga.</p>

 <h2>Sony nukes a bunch of PlayStation shovelware</h2> <p>Over 1,000 games, in fact. The mass deletions were spotted <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">by </a><span><a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">RobThanatos</a> and took aim at ThiGames_DE, which supposedly was ranked 4th for total number of listings across all of PSN. The game titles were things like <em>The Jumping Taco</em>, <em>The Jumping Hot Dog</em>, <em>The Jumping Soda</em>, and<em> The Jumping Taco TURBO</em>. Quick and cheap Platinum trophies, in other words. RIP to some real ones.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">Backlog week has begun, but what even is a backlog in 2026?</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">There’s a very convincing theory about why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ framerates are so bad on PC</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>The Fallout 3</em> and<em> New Vegas</em> remaster rumors have gotten out of control</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

			<p>Following our previous reports on John Gibson's stance regarding the <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-gibson-ex-tripwire-ceo-underrepresented-majority/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"underrepresented majority" in gaming</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-tripwire-ceo-remote-work-game-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the efficiency pitfalls of remote work</a>, we are now presenting the <strong>full transcript</strong> of our lengthy conversation with the executive, which lasted more than 60 minutes and has been slightly edited and condensed for brevity.</p>



<p>John Gibson isn't just a veteran with 25 years in the trenches of the industry; he is a co-founder of Tripwire Interactive (<a href="https://wccftech.com/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-following-backlash-against-john-gibsons-views-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he stepped down in September 2021</a>) with a track record of several consecutive profitable titles. Now at the helm of <strong>Templar Media</strong>, Gibson has made no qualms of critiquing what he calls a "monolithic political block" in modern game development, advocating for a return to the <strong>"Entertainment First</strong>" philosophy of the 80s and 90s.</p>



<p>In the following transcript, Gibson pulls no punches on the <strong>"video game apocalypse"</strong> of layoffs and delays, the current development progress and challenges of making the Bible-based adventure game <strong><em>Gate Zero</em></strong> (Templar Media <a href="https://wccftech.com/templar-media-acquires-bible-x-studio-making-gate-zero-where-you-play-the-bible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purchased developer <strong>Bible X</strong></a> last month), and his pragmatic approach to utilizing <strong>AI in development</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="pivot-entertainment-first"><a href="#pivot-entertainment-first">The Pivot to Templar Media: From Tripwire to "Entertainment First"</a></h2>



<p><strong>John, for those who haven't followed your recent transition, could you tell us about your journey from leading Tripwire Interactive to founding your new venture, Templar Media?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Sure thing. I was formerly the co-founder, co-owner, and CEO of Tripwire Interactive. Now, I am leading Templar Media. I founded Templar Media earlier this year. After selling Tripwire, I took a break, but I realized I wanted to get back into games. I noticed that in a lot of media, the focus had shifted away from pleasing the player or the viewer. Instead, it was often about whatever commentary or message a developer or entertainer wanted to convey. This is where our slogan, <strong>"Entertainment First,"</strong> originated. I wanted to establish a company focused on creating great content that people truly enjoy. While everyone aims to make something great, players can tell if your primary focus is not on building an entertaining and fun game. Our goal is to make great, entertaining content.</p>



<p>We are catering to an underserved mainstream market. In America and somewhat in Europe, the people creating entertainment often represent a monolithic political block. However, consumers are not a monolithic block and do not necessarily share the same views as those making the entertainment. There is an underrepresented majority that wants entertainment without a specific agenda. When I was growing up, movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Indiana Jones</em> or games like <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Metroid</em> were about entertaining you, not an agenda. This has been lost in much of modern entertainment. For example, in the new <em>Dragon Age</em> game, there is a cutscene where the player is lectured about pronouns. We experience entertainment to forget about day-to-day politics and just have fun. Entertainment needs to go back to focusing on entertaining people. While our first game is faith-based, we are not afraid to tell those stories to an underserved market and to anyone who simply wants great content without modern agendas. As a company owner and designer, you must focus on what the customer will enjoy, not just your own preferences.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GateZero_GC_Screenshot-19-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="underserved-faith-based-market"><a href="#underserved-faith-based-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gate Zero: Tapping into the Massive Underserved Faith-Based Market</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The first game we are developing tells biblical stories, allowing players to experience the Bible firsthand. This is not the only type of content we will produce, but we are not ignoring it either. In the television and movie industries, faith-based content is currently massive. It has gained mainstream success with projects like <em>The Chosen</em>, <em>Jesus Revolution</em>, and <em>House of David</em>. This mirrors the 1950s in America, when movies like <em>The Ten Commandments</em> were mainstream box office hits. <strong>Regardless of a person's faith, these are foundational stories of Western society and are simply great, entertaining narratives</strong>. We will not shy away from such content, but our primary goal remains to entertain people. </p>



<p><strong>How did your relationship with the Norwegian studio Bible X begin? Were you always a believer in the project from day one, or did it take some convincing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> I initially reached out to the Bible X team a couple of years ago after seeing videos for <em>Gate Zero</em> in my social media feed. To be candid, I had low expectations for faith-based entertainment, assuming it would not be very good. However, the project kept appearing in my feed, and I eventually decided to reach out. Although I was retired and did not need to work anymore, this project seemed interesting. I quickly got to know the team, and they asked me to serve as their executive game consultant to help make the game better.</p>



<p>When I played what they were working on, I saw a team that was excellent at storytelling and art with a great vision, but they needed help making the game truly fun. BCC Media, the parent organization of Bible X, has long-standing experience in media, including satellite television, film, and animated features. They already used Unreal Engine technology for their animated features. They had the technical and storytelling background, and I brought 25 years of video game design and execution experience to the table. I worked with them for a while to improve the game.</p>



<p>When I started Templar Media, I looked for titles to publish. Aside from the quality of the game, I looked for leading indicators of success. It is challenging to determine what will be successful years in advance. One indicator I look at is social media response. At my previous company, after 17 years, we had about 40,000 social media followers across all platforms. In a short amount of time, <em>Gate Zero</em> and Bible X had 500,000 grassroots followers. My previous company had games with 35 million players that sold millions of copies, yet we only had 40,000 followers. This indicated a very high level of interest in <em>Gate Zero</em>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GateZero_GC_Screenshot-18-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype"><a href="#kickstarter-proved-gate-zero-hype">Why Kickstarter Success Proved the Gate Zero Hype</a></h2>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Another business indicator I examined was Kickstarter. While Kickstarters usually do not fund an entire project, they help gauge public interest. Most video game Kickstarters fail, raising an average of about $2,800 to $3,000. When Bible X prepared their Kickstarter, a consultancy firm suggested setting the goal at approximately €30,000. The team decided that was not enough to prove potential success and set the goal at €200,000. They hit €200,000 in less than three days and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gatezero/gate-zero-a-bible-exploration-video-game?ref=nav_search&amp;result=project&amp;term=Gate%20Zero&amp;total_hits=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>reached €300,000 by the end of the 30-day campaign</strong></a>. This was a smash hit that proved an audience wants this kind of entertainment.</p>



<p>These indicators led me to sign the game as a publisher. As development has progressed, I have looked for further signs of success. In 2008, when I looked at <em>Killing Floor</em> for my previous company, we saw massive potential and decided to buy the IP. That first game eventually sold 6 million copies. <strong>I am seeing even higher indicators for <em>Gate Zero</em>, and as I play what we are creating, I see that something special is being made</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Game-Delays-Remote-Work-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="remote-work-and-inflated-salaries-fueling-game-delays-and-layoffs"><a href="#remote-work-inflated-salaries-delays-layoffs">The "Video Game Apocalypse": Remote Work and Inflated Salaries Fueling Game Delays and Layoffs</a></h2>



<p><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry? There's a lot of discussion on the layoffs that have hit big and small companies alike in the past few years, shortly after the COVID-induced boom ended.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> The industry faced a "video game apocalypse" in 2023 and 2024 as things collapsed following the pandemic boom. Games were not always of high quality or were taking much longer to develop. For instance, the sequel to <em>Killing Floor 2</em> took five years to make. <strong>I believe part of the reason for these delays is distributed work</strong>. While working from home feels great, people are often less efficient and less creative. Some of the greatest ideas in the games I have worked on came from random encounters in the hallway. Two people might have different parts of a great idea, chat in the hallway, and create a whole concept for the game. As part of this acquisition, the core team on <em>Gate Zero</em> is relocating to our offices in Georgia. Having everyone in the office will allow us to iterate quickly to finish the game. This business decision will result in a more entertaining and fun game for the player.</p>



<p><strong>Another challenge was overinflated salaries during the pandemic</strong>. Companies with high COVID-era profits were overpaying for talent. For instance, an engineer might be offered a million dollars for their first year. This was unsustainable, and many of those companies eventually conducted massive layoffs. There is now a reset occurring where people must readjust their salary expectations to fair, sustainable levels.</p>



<p>We are also focused on right-sizing budgets. My lead producer once asked how we could make a game for $100 million, and my response was, "How do you spend $100 million making this game?". <strong>Companies sometimes go bankrupt because they spend too much and lose focus. You have to be pragmatic and scale up with the market</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Fortnite</em> is a major factor in the industry, "sucking a lot of the air out of the room". To exist alongside it, you must offer a unique experience. It is not necessarily about direct competition. When I made <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Left 4 Dead</em> had just come out, and people questioned if the market could support another zombie game. We sold six million copies because the games were different enough.</p>



<p>But the market has grown significantly. When I signed the first Steam agreement in 2005, Steam had perhaps 3 to 5 million users. Now it has about 180 million, and <em>Fortnite</em> has 150 million. In the past, a million units was a massive success; now, successful games can sell 30 to 50 million units. There is room for games that sell 1 to 5 million copies. A rising tide lifts all ships, and a generation raised on games wants diverse experiences. A single-player experience like <em>Gate Zero</em> can find its place in the market. I am also not opposed to making live service games, as we were successful with titles like <em>Chivalry 2</em> alongside <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>



<p><strong>How many developers are currently working on the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Between developers and contractors, <strong>there are 25 people on the team, plus about 10 from Templar, totaling 30 to 35 people</strong>. While we do not have a <em>GTA</em> budget, this is not a small indie game. It will compete with AAA titles and <strong>has a budget greater than $10 million</strong>. This is the studio's first game, so we are careful with spending, intending to increase resources for subsequent versions if the first is successful. I think of it like <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. <em>The Fellowship of the Ring</em> was a high-quality movie, but once it was a hit, they could put significantly more resources into the second and third films. <em>Gate Zero</em> will be a quality game built on a healthy, reasonable budget.</p>



<p>When I first met the Bible X team, I noted that during my time as CEO and co-owner of my previous company, I was involved in 15 games, every one of which made a profit. Part of that success involves right-sizing the budget and picking a great title. I told the team we should make something undeniably great, and I informed them that it would require doubling their original budget. </p>



<p><strong>Can you share any details about Gate Zero's pricing and launch window estimates yet?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Regarding pricing, it is too early to share a specific price, but it will be more budget-friendly than other big AAA games. It will not cost as much as an $80 game or a new Switch game, but it will not be a $19 game either. <strong>We are over halfway through development; it is not coming out next week, but it will not take two years either</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="mixing-assassins-creed-narrative-agency-gameplay-and-influences-mixing-assassin-s-creed-with-narrative-agency"><a href="#mixing-assassins-creed-narrative-agency">Gameplay and Influences: Mixing Assassin's Creed with Narrative Agency</a></h2>



<p><strong>Gate Zero has drawn some comparisons to Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. How do you define the gameplay style, and what other major titles influenced the game's design?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> While there are some of those elements, <strong>I describe it as a mix of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, the newer <em>Zelda</em> games, and <em>Shadow of Mordor</em></strong>. The comparisons to <em>Assassin's Creed</em> are natural because we have a time machine and are going back to ancient history. Furthermore, we have several former <em>Assassin's Creed</em> developers on the team, including an art director who worked on several entries in that series. We also have the <em>Assassin's Creed</em> contract art team and developers from other major games. I worked on <em>Killing Floor</em>, <em>Maneater</em>, and <em>Chivalry 2</em>. We have people from Rockstar who worked on <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> and <em>GTA</em>, as well as a developer from the original <em>Thief</em> game. The game includes stealth, action, exploration, and puzzles. It will be a unique combination of genres with a deep narrative and narrative trees.</p>



<p>I love narrative and stories, and I am a fan of games like <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, where choices matter. In <em>Gate Zero</em>, <strong>the character Max is a 15-year-old who is not a person of faith. He uses a time machine to end up in 30 AD during significant events. He grows through moral decisions that are not always cut and dry. These decisions impact the story, dialogue choices, and who aligns with him. We want the player to have agency in their story</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Given the target audience of faith-based entertainment, I have to ask how much action (and potentially blood) there will be in your game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> We are holding off on discussing the action in detail until early next year because we believe we have something compelling that people have not seen before. <strong>There is compelling action in the game; it is not a "walking simulator" or strictly a puzzle game</strong>.</p>



<p>By the way, we also have specific rules for time travel to avoid messing up the timeline. Max looks like he could be of Italian or Roman heritage. If he goes around killing Roman guards, he might inadvertently kill an ancestor and cease to exist. Designing around these constraints forces us to be creative. It is similar to the challenges we faced making the shark gameplay in <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/maneater-rough-waters-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maneater</a></em> fun. Because the game is set in 30 AD rather than a time of open war like the eras of Samson or David, putting action into it is an interesting design problem.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Gate-Zero-Co-Play-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>







<p><strong>I've read that the game will feature a co-play element that works with smartphones. What can you share about that?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> Often, when someone plays a single-player game, their friends get bored and look at their phones. The co-play feature engages everyone in a party atmosphere. Friends can play mini-games on their phones that help the player on the screen. This scales to larger groups of up to 10 people. I have never seen this done well before, as mobile apps for games often just feel like an extension of the HUD. <strong>Because of the faith-based elements, youth groups could play the game together, which is a unique group element for the target audience</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AI-Tools-Usage-Without-Sacrificing-Truth-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="ai-debate-accelerate-creativity-without-sacrificing-truth"><a href="#ai-debate-accelerate-creativity-without-sacrificing-truth">The AI Debate: Using Tools to Accelerate Creativity Without Sacrificing Truth</a></h2>



<p><strong>Finally, let's discuss the proverbial elephant in the room: the usage of AI in the games industry. Some developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently came under fire from fans after disclosing their usage of AI</a>. Where do you stand on this topic?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Gibson:</strong> When used properly, <strong>AI is a tool that speeds up human creativity rather than replacing it</strong>. For <em>Gate Zero</em>, our concept artists might hand-draw a concept and then use AI to generate 10 other versions to accelerate development. It helps augment the increasing costs of development. We are still very far from a "Star Trek holodeck" that can generate entire games on command.</p>



<p>In the 1990s, teams had to create their own game engines. Later, the licensing of engines enabled smaller teams to make better games that could compete with big developers. Similarly, AI can give smaller teams an edge. More broadly, AI presents challenges that governments may not be ready to tackle. If AI and robotics converge alongside quantum computing, economies and the world will change significantly. It might not be <em>The Terminator</em>, but it could be <em>I, Robot</em>.</p>



<p><strong>In Templar Media, my policy is that AI answers cannot be considered truth</strong>. Employees can use tools like ChatGPT to find a direction, but they must always find and share the primary source for any fact. ChatGPT often gets things wrong. For example, I once searched for the production numbers of a rare 1983 Pontiac Trans Am I own. The AI stated that about 600 were made, which was correct, but its primary source turned out to be my own Instagram post. AI is a tool, but do not assume it knows everything or is always correct.</p>



<p><strong>Definitely. Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>It’s a bad time to be in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossings-next-update-has-players-revisiting-long-deserted-islands/1100-6537314/" data-ref-id="1100-6537314">Animal Crossing</a> hotel business. New Horizons’ 3.0 update introduced a wave of new features, but one addition stands out above the rest: a fully fledged hotel that appears on the pier of every island. Overnight, that official beachfront resort has effectively put countless player-made hotels out of business.</p><p>That might matter more if anyone besides Tom Nook--and the long-suffering players paying off his loans--actually exchanged money in New Horizons. Still, the arrival of an island-sanctioned hotel has made the decision to tear down pre-update resorts an easy one for many players who suddenly found their handmade creations obsolete.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Animal Crossing New Horizon 3.0 Update - Everything You Need to do Day One</p>
      </div>
<p>"The fateful day has come for the new update, and the local resident-run hotel has fallen on hard times thanks to the illegally constructed hotel on the pier," wrote Redditor ll_LoneWolfe_ll in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdah21/the_new_pier_hotel_spells_doom_for_my_islands/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>. "These are truly troubling times for the residents of my island!"</p><p>Hotels have long been a popular attraction for Animal Crossing players, even though the game has never provided the infrastructure to build a functional one. Instead, players relied on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/20-years-ago-animal-crossing-finally-showed-what-it-could-be/1100-6536728/" data-ref-id="1100-6536728">creativity</a> and illusion. Some terraformed multi-room interiors and used partitions to simulate hallways and suites, while others leaned into visual trickery, creating hotel facades meant to be admired from a specific angle.</p><p>One such example can be seen in a Reddit post documenting the final day of an island’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qdmq9a/the_last_day_of_my_islands_hotel_dodo_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dodo Hotel</a>, a lovingly crafted facade that existed purely for aesthetics. These facades have become works of art in their own right, allowing players to build convincing cityscapes that evoke sun-soaked Greek islands, dense urban skylines, or luxury five-star resorts looming in the distance.</p><p>The 3.0 update finally brings those hotel fantasies into the game in an official capacity, but it does so with a rigid, one-size-fits-all design. The new hotel is anchored to a specific pier at the front corner of each island, limiting where and how it can exist. Players were quick to discover, however, that while the structure itself is fixed, the surrounding area is not.</p><p>As expected, players immediately got to work customizing their piers to stand out from countless of other islands around the world. One Redditor, jorgom, used custom designs, fences, castle pillars, and themed furniture to transform their pier into a hotel inspired by the Sanrio character <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qeim2x/my_attempt_at_a_pompompurinthemed_hotel/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pompompurin</a>, turning a standardized feature into something personal.</p><p>In many ways, the new hotel represents Animal Crossing’s ongoing tension between player creativity and developer-imposed boundaries. Nintendo has given players more tools than ever, but those tools still arrive with clear limits. The community’s response-- decorating around, over, and in spite of those limits--remains as inventive as ever.</p><p>Player-made hotels may be disappearing, but the instinct behind them hasn’t gone anywhere. Even when the game builds something for players, they’ll still find ways to rebuild it in their own image, proving once again that New Horizons is less about what Nintendo adds and more about what players do with it.</p>

They can also meet cosplayers and influencers; the Orc cosplayers will be inside the stadium for the game itself.</p><p>The Midnight expansion adds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-future-housing-plans-include-co-decorating-and-a-long-requested-feature/1100-6537427/" data-ref-id="1100-6537427">player housing</a>, which is something fans have been requesting for years. Blizzard is also partnering with real estate company Zillow on this branded partnership, according to <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/sb-blogs/newsletter-gaming/2026/01/16/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Business Journal.</a></p><p>People can find the Welcome Home Pre-Game Tavern outside Gillette Stadium in Foxboro, Mass. Blizzard Entertainment CMO Monica Austin said the team has been building the tavern at Blizzard's headquarters in Anaheim, California for months, and only just recently decided to host the event in Foxboro as opposed to Denver, where another Divisional round game will take place.</p><p>But why have this kind of marketing campaign in the first place? Austin said  Blizzard's research has shown that lapsed and active WoW players also enjoy watching sports.</p><p>"We've done a tremendous amount of deep dives to understand who are our players, lapsed and active. One of the things we see consistently is that our players are over-indexed in watching sports. And for the NFL, it's top-three over-indexing sport," Austin said. "We know our players are there. We know they're watching. This is a strategic way that we want to use to reach them."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-midnight-expansion-launches-in-march-2026/1100-6536536/" data-ref-id="1100-6536536">Midnight launches on March 2</a>, and will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/" data-ref-id="1100-6534043">revamp the game's nearly two-decade-old Blood Elf zones</a> as well as introduce new areas, dungeons, and raids.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-update-1-1-3-5-add-polish-and-consistency-ea-battlefield-studios/</link>
            <guid>1408735</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>EA</strong> and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> have released the latest patch notes for the next update coming to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a></strong>, numbered <strong>Update 1.1.3.5,</strong> which aims to bring a bit more "<em>polish and consistency</em>" to the game, with refinements to melee attacks, movement, jet combat, and more.</p>



<p>"<em>With Update 1.1.3.5, we’re delivering a smaller set of focused improvements aimed at polish and consistency across Battlefield 6</em>," <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-game-update-1-1-3-5">a blog post on the Battlefield 6 website</a> detailing the changes in the update reads. "<em>This update enhances melee responsiveness, refines jet combat, improves ladder interactions, and resolves UI and HUD issues in Multiplayer and REDSEC, alongside fixes for Battle Royale and Gauntlet stability</em>."</p>



<p>It's not the biggest update in terms of scale, but it does include several significant updates, like fixing a bug that could see a vehicle explode if an enemy player lay on top of it and performed a Takedown, and a major reduction in jet cannon damage against other jets and helicopters, which brings a huge balance to the game's air combat.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Other notable improvements include the attack speed for knife attacks being faster, and improvements to the buffering behaviour for both knife and sledgehammer attacks. More consistent behaviour for recoil modifiers when using a controller, and perhaps the one that players will notice the most: sprinting will now only be interrupted when your melee attack reaches its target, instead of what would happen before, where you would sprint towards your enemy, only to have your sprint interrupted just before you were in range because you pressed the melee button.</p>



<p>This update and its fixes will be live next week on <strong>January 20, 2026</strong>, so you still have to play through the weekend before they're implemented. It's also the first update the game is getting since EA and Battlefield Studios confirmed that the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/"><strong>Season 2</strong> would be delayed and pushed to <strong>February 17, 2026,</strong></a> which means players still have another month to wait before any new content, including new maps, weapons, and vehicles, is added to the game. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair superdrop for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The new Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop brings in more cards from Bethesda's post-apocalyptic sci-fi franchise, <em>Fallout</em>.</p><h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop Announcement</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-rad-superdrop" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a>, Wizards of the Coast detailed four drops of cards as part of the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop. These four drops will focus on different elements and facets of the <em>Fallout</em> series.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-rad-superdrop-beyond-vault-33-card-artwork.jpg?itok=8cut4zHi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="700" height="649">

  </picture><p>The first drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Beyond Vault 33</em>, focuses entirely on the <em>Fallout</em> TV Show on Prime Video. This drop will contain six cards. Three of these cards are original designs featuring the show's leads: Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus. The other three are equipment cards, <em>Pre-War Formalwear</em>, <em>Spirit Mantle</em>, and <em>T-45 Power Armor</em> reimagined as <em>T-60 Power Armor</em>.</p><p>Notably, this drop is the first Secret Lair made available on Amazon. This is most likely an extension of marketing for the show's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-season-two-doesnt-just-go-to-new-vegas-it-builds-on-it" rel="nofollow">second season</a>.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>For dog lovers, the <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Greet The Dog</em> drop is for you. This drop contains five cards, featuring artwork of the most loyal pup in the post-apocalyptic wasteland. The drop contains the following:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="ee9f19ef828879ce874bd6471eb75c698"><em>Yoshimaru, Ever Faithful</em> as "<em>Dogmeat, Constant Companion</em>"</li><li data-list-item-id="ed9b77cbdac11aa9f7ae3c40d8d3375c3"><em>Arcane Signet</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e3eedaf10bbb77436594fd74452b110f4"><em>Lightning Greaves</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e621aee5bdd15f1acfe012e0ae6fbb2de"><em>Patchwork Banner</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea03b03b1666842cf9421234dc0632f8c"><em>Sol Ring</em></li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>The third drop in the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop is aptly titled <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Rad</em>. This drop of cards focuses on the more outlandish sci-fi elements of the series. This includes the Nightkin Supermutants, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-76" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout 76's</em></a> Mothman, and the bizarre mutations brought on by wasteland radiation. The cards contained are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e2469fca0265aba744ca5d0ba2520d077"><em>Ripples of Potential</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e36faab575ad75118607da1a970016ac7"><em>Mutational Advantage</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea83bcb79d7732bcdf7614b816d9e0a24"><em>The Wise Mothman</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e27fdc1470fbfee69d52d33a462492152"><em>Mindcrank</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ea0f5683831427994ccf444ee312b4538"><em>Mesmeric Orb </em>as<em> "Mothman Egg"</em></li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>Lastly, drop number four spotlights the fan-favorite <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a>. The drop, <em>Secret Lair x Fallout: Welcome to New Vegas</em>, is more standard fare. Older <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> cards featuring Fallout-themed artwork and card names. Humorously enough, one of those repurposed cards comes from the official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> set, <em>Adventures in the Forgotten Realms</em>. The five cards included are as follows:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="eec7a5947c4270ff88347a1b1596c0954"><em>Tinybones, Trinket Thief </em>as<em> "Benny, Platinum Thief"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e3e3f4a246eb819530a385640dad2983f"><em>Isshin, Two Heavens as One </em>as <em>"Joshua Graham, Burned Man"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ecc2730b05d38587ef5b017ff7fc6d442"><em>The Deck of Many Things </em>as<em> "Custom Caravan Deck"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e2b87ac5cfb30eb2f224f832196def83c"><em>Caged Sun </em>as<em> "The Platinum Chip"</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e0b66ae422782ab664f4bdc9bc75c3f81"><em>Nuka-Cola Vending Machine </em>as<em> "Sunset Sasparilla Machine"</em></li></ul><p>Pre-orders for the Secret Lair: Rad Superdrop will go live on January 26, 2026. <em>Beyond Vault 33</em> is available in non-foil at an MSRP of $39.99 and foil at an MSRP of $49.99. The other drops are available in non-foil at an MSRP of $29.99 and foil at an MSRP of $39.99. For those with deep pockets, any purchase above $149 will get a <em>Silver Shroud Costume</em> promo card at no additional cost while supplies last.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Beginning January 20th, experiences — which Epic Games calls “islands” — will not be able to offer in-island transactions as “a ‘spin’ or ‘increased luck’ for a prize wheel,” according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/1qefc13/update_to_fortnite_developer_rules_inisland/">an Epic staffer on Reddit</a>.</p><p>Epic is adding the rule after <em><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@ferins/3225-0366-8885?lang=en-US">Steal The Brainrot</a></em>, one of the biggest non-Epic games available to play in <em>Fortnite</em>, implemented a prize wheel that let players pay V-Bucks (<em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game currency) for spins and luck to acquire in-game items. <em>Steal The Brainrot</em> also added lootboxes, and the moves have drawn criticism from players, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-fortnite-enables-third-party-microtransactions-steal-the-brainrots-developer-is-slammed-by-fans-for-immediately-adding-45-premium-bundles-and-gambling-style-mechanics">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>.</p><p>Until this month’s change, Epic didn’t let creators offer in-game transactions in their experiences, meaning that creators instead were paid through <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/28/23659492/fortnite-creator-economy-2-0-epic-games-catch">an engagement-based system</a>. (Roblox, one of <em>Fortnite’s</em> biggest competitors, does let creators sell in-game items.) But Epic made the change <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers?lang=en-US">to give</a> “independent Fortnite developers more agency over their creative and commercial decisions.”</p><p>Through the end of this year, Epic will pay creators 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from any in-island transactions.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-starfield-bethesda-tes-2000660653</link>
            <guid>1408696</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A veteran designer recently sat down with</span> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> to discuss his surprise departure from Bethesda Game Studios in 2023 after two stints and over 20 years at the company. He cited what he saw as detrimental changes in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>maker’s development process due to Bethesda’s continued expansion as the driving impetus behind his decision.</span></p> <p><span>Kurt Kuhlmann, who worked for Bethesda as a junior designer in the late 1990s before rejoining the studio as a senior designer in 2003, made waves in the industry when he decided to step away from the role. By that time, he had worked on every major game in the </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> series<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->apart from the first, </span><i><span>Arena<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></span></i><span>and was responsible for building out much of its setting and lore.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was almost certainly time for a change,” Kuhlmann told </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “There were some things that had been going on for a long time that I’d not been super happy with.”<br> </span></p> <h2>Communication breakdowns on<em> Starfield</em></h2> <p><span>Much of this unhappiness, Kuhlmann explained, revolved around Bethesda’s growth from a handful of developers making games in a basement office to hundreds of people across four studios that were managed by Microsoft. No longer could they just pop in on each other to discuss something and get a quick decision from trusted leaders like executive producer Todd Howard.</span></p>

 <p><span>Instead, senior developer responsibilities were becoming more managerial, and everything had to go through several layers of bureaucracy. Kuhlmann described the environment as prone to “communication breakdowns,” attributing some of Bethesda’s recent development struggles to this bloated, hands-off structure. </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span> teams, for instance, were often confused about what they were supposed to be doing as discussion filtered through the various studio leads.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The expectation was your job can’t be also making content if you’re actually managing that scope of the project,” Kuhlmann said. “I didn’t want to work that way, because I like making games and being hands-on. It had gotten to a scale beyond where I was really enjoying working in that environment.”</span></p>

 <h2>An <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> cliffhanger</h2> <p><span>This shift in priorities, combined with Howard retracting a previous promise to make Kuhlmann lead designer on </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, signaled to the veteran it was time to leave Bethesda. Kuhlmann, for his part, does acknowledge it was a smart decision to change his potential responsibilities on the still unreleased game, as he probably wouldn’t have liked the job much due to Bethesda’s new development woes.</span></p>

 <p><span>As for what he envisioned for </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>, Kuhlmann likened his rough ideas to </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> sequel </span><i><span>The Empire Strikes Back</span></i><span>: The bad guys would have won, setting up the main conflict of </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls 7</span></i><span>. The protracted AAA release schedule, however, would likely have made a cliffhanger of that magnitude “unfeasible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“That’s not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we’ll see you in 10, 15 years,” Kuhlmann said.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, the God of War live-action series has secured its Sif, and it’s none other than Teresa Palmer. </p>



<p>Things have been shaping quite well for Amazon’s God of War live-action series, with new castings being announced over the past day. Yesterday, we were informed that the man taking on the iconic role of the God of War will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sons-of-anarchy-star-cast-kratos-god-of-war-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sons of Anarchy’s Ryan Hurst</a>, who will pick up the Leviathan Axe and the Blades of Chaos as Kratos. </p>







<h2 id="h-teresa-palmer-to-play-sif-in-god-of-war-s-live-action-series">Teresa Palmer to Play Sif in God of War’s Live-Action Series</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a> reveals that Teresa Palmer will play Sif/Phoebe, Thor’s wife. Amazon has declined to comment on whether this news is true. Fans will remember Palmer from movies like Sorcerer’s Apprentice, Lights Out, The Fall Guy, and more. </p>



<p>The report on this casting has also made fans wonder about the series’ timeline. Players who have played both games will remember that Sif and Thor do not make an appearance until God of War: Ragnarok. So, will the live-action series follow the game’s events or set its own flow? </p>



<p>Additionally, a report from last month discusses who will play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-series-thor-baldur-cast-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur and Thor</a> in the upcoming series. It seems Max Parker from Boots will be taking on the role of Baldur. At the same time, Olafur Darri Olafsson from Severance will be playing the God of Thunder, Thor. </p>



<p>There are still many essential characters left to cast, including Atreus, Odin, Freya, Mimir, Sindri, Brok, and more. Which characters do you think will best fit these roles? </p>



<p>In other news, the voice actor of God of War’s Kratos has expressed his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-wars-kratos-actor-wants-to-go-to-egypt-for-the-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">desire to go to Egypt</a> for the next game. Additionally, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-cancelled-multiplayer-screenshots-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screenshots</a> from a cancelled God of War multiplayer title. </p>

                <p>Earlier this month, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> players reported that the game actually performed better on Steam when it has more DLC installed. Word about that improvement spread quickly among the Monster Hunter Wilds community, but the real reason for the game's improvement isn't about whether the game has DLC. Instead, the problem arises when Monster Hunter Wilds checks for DLC.</p><p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> debunked the notion that more DLC was speeding up Monster Hunter Wilds. Instead, DF discovered that there's an automatic check for DLC that greatly impacts Wilds' performance. According to the report, when the option for DLC content was offered, the game itself "checked for DLC thousands upon thousands of times, adding to the CPU load of an already over-burdened processor" in less than a minute.</p><p>Essentially, this recurring issue in the hub area near a Support Desk Felynes has nothing to do with the DLC itself; it's happening because the game is constantly checking for DLC. That's slowing everything down, even if there isn't any DLC to be found.</p><p>Other players have already noticed this and released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a less DLC checks mod</a> that helps alleviate the issue. It doesn't solve all of Monster Hunter Wilds' underlying issues on PC, but it can solve this one until Capcom decides to eventually address it.</p><p>Capcom had previously promised that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-problems-will-be-addressed-in-an-update-this-winter/1100-6534077/" data-ref-id="1100-6534077">an update released this winter</a> would directly target the biggest problems with Monster Hunter Wilds on PC. Many of those issues still persist, and it's unknown when or if they will be fixed.</p>

			<p>Amazon is having a busy week for its TV series adaptations of video games. On top of showing off our first look at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-tv-show/">Sophie Turner as Lara Croft</a></strong> and confirming the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-fallout-shelter-reality-competition-show-confirmed/">rumoured <strong>Fallout Shelter</strong>-based reality competition show to be real</a>, it also confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst</strong>, who played Thor in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>, would be playing <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Now, we have our latest cast member for the God of War series, with Warm Bodies star <strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> tapped to play <strong>Sif</strong>.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/teresa-palmer-cast-prime-video-god-of-war-1236684477/">Deadline</a>, and arrives just one day after Hurst was named as Kratos for the show. The series is reportedly set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming sometime in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, and if that is still the case, then we'll likely start to see more casting announcements as we get closer to the series kicking off production.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to note about this casting announcement is that it gives us more insight into the approach the show is taking with the story. We already knew that this series wouldn't be addressing Kratos' story from the original set of Greek mythology-based games, and that it would be jumping right into the Norse era.</p>



<p>But now that we know the show will include Sif, who players will remember is a Norse goddess in her own right and the wife of <strong>Thor</strong>, we know that the show is pulling from both the 2018 God of War and Ragnarok. Sif doesn't appear in Ragnarok, so now at least know whatever version of Kratos and Atreus' story we get in this show, it'll involve more than just the few Norse gods we meet in the first game.</p>



<p>The series is being led by <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/"><strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong>,</a> who took over as showrunner after PlayStation Productions scrapped the initial version of the show over creative differences with its previous leads. The first couple of episodes will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-series-two-seasons-shogun-director-to-direct-opening-episodes-amazon/">directed by Shogun director, <strong>Frederick E.O. Toye</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and hopefully, we'll have more official news about the series, and when we'll get our first look of it soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/851165/ces-2026-what-to-expect">As we predicted</a>, the world’s biggest consumer electronics show was a bit of a bust for gamers this year! CES 2026 brought us <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/848331/8bitdo-ultimate-3e-controller-xbox-wireless-tmr-swappable-joysticks">several</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge/video/7593953104756821262">neat</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860346/force-feedback-steering-wheel-in-a-gamepad-feels-surprisingly-great">gamepads</a>, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date">barely</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu">any</a> handhelds and no new desktop GPUs — not from Nvidia, not from Intel, and not from AMD.</p><p>But if you dig deep, AMD said two things at this year’s show that are worthy of attention. Did you catch that the company’s about to make socketed <em>mobile</em> chips again? Or that its answer to Intel is to lower the price of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">monster Strix Halo silicon</a>?</p><p>Publicly, AMD barely acknowledged consumers at the Consumer Electronics Show. “AMD failed us,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsCrKGY9F1o">decried Gamers Nexus</a>, pointing out that the company’s keynote was almost entirely fixated on AI. Outside the keynote, the company’s few consumer-friendly announcements — including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855188/amd-ryzen-7-9850x3d-processor-boost-clock-announcement">the Ryzen 7 9850X3D</a> for gaming desktops and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855343/amd-ryzen-ai-400-release-date">Ryzen AI 400</a> for laptops — are all retreads of existing components.</p><p>AMD also didn’t announce a new chip for handheld gaming PCs, no successor to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">the Z2 and Z2 Extreme it introduced</a> a year ago, even as Intel publicly announced plans for an “entire handheld gaming platform” and Qualcomm teased its own handhelds for a possible March reveal.</p><p>Intel didn’t miss a chance to jab: “They’re selling ancient silicon, while we’re selling up-to-date processors specifically designed for this market,” Intel client product management director Nish Neelalojanan <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3024634/theyre-selling-ancient-silicon-intel-warns-handheld-war-is-coming.html">told <em>PCWorld</em></a>.</p><p>Yet AMD claims those so-called “ancient” processors are more than a match for Intel’s new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854519/intel-core-ultra-3-panther-lake-18-a-release-date-decoder-ring">Panther Lake silicon</a>. AMD client chip boss Rahul Tikoo <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-is-unphased-by-panther-lakes-big-integrated-gpu-its-not-even-a-fair-fight-to-compare-the-arc-b390-to-strix-halo-amd-exec-claims">told<em> Tom’s Hardware</em> </a>that AMD’s Strix Halo / Ryzen AI Max chip “will kill” Panther Lake. He said, “It’s not even a fair fight at that point, because it’s discrete-level graphics.”</p><p>Tikoo also told <em>Tom’s</em> <em>Hardware</em> that Intel’s gaming-grade Panther Lake chips might be pricier than you expect: “And, oh, by the way, that 12 Xe [Panther Lake]... Wait until you see the price point on that. It’s gonna be, you know. Enough said.”</p><p>Price has been the problem with AMD’s Strix Halo too — every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/791460/gpd-win-5-corded-handhelds">powerful Ryzen handheld</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">mini desktop</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/621947/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-laptop-amd-strix-halo-review">monster tablet</a> we’ve seen has cost around $2,000, even before <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/839353/pc-ram-shortage-pricing-spike-news">the RAM crunch</a>. But that brings me to <strong>the first exciting thing for gamers</strong> AMD quietly revealed at CES: The cost of its powerful Strix Halo systems is almost certainly about to come down.</p><p>AMD introduced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855463/amd-strix-halo-ai-max-plus-388-392-handheld-gaming">two new cut-down versions of Strix Halo</a> last week with their full-fat graphics intact; Tikoo told us that gaming companies specifically had been asking for parts like the new Ryzen AI Max Plus 388 and 392.</p><p>And when I caught up with AMD’s Jason Banta, who’s in charge of interfacing with those companies, he said AMD genuinely expects the two new chips will lead to lower Strix Halo system prices, below $2,000 even when you factor in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">the runaway price of RAM</a>. (I asked the question several different ways to be sure of his answer.)</p><p>Banta would not tell me if the company has any <em>other </em>plans to defend its tiny handheld empire (the Steam Deck, Xbox Ally, Legion Go, and more all use AMD chips, as do the PlayStation and Xbox) when Intel and Qualcomm come knocking later this year. “We believe imitation is a great form of flattery,” is all he’d really say. “When we’re creating the segment, innovating the segment, we expect others to enter.”</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->9</strong><span><figcaption><em>OneXPlayer brought liquid-cooled Strix Halo handhelds and tablets to CES. This is the “Frost Bay” external cooler.</em></figcaption> <cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>Banta isn’t afraid of Intel and Qualcomm handheld chips taking his customers away. “What they’ve seen is we’ve proven we can execute, and not just execute: When we see a quirk with a game, we follow up, we update, we optimize. […] That has a very big influence on those design decisions for every one of these OEMs,” he said. Banta said AMD’s handheld business is still growing, too, and the company still plans to keep investing.</p><p>Most PC makers don’t seem ready to climb aboard Intel’s handheld bandwagon just yet. If you take a close look at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/857252/intel-handheld-gaming-pc-panther-lake-custom-cpu">Intel’s keynote slide</a>, the only major vendors listed are Acer and MSI, and the only boutique handheld makers are GPD and OneXPlayer, both still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860992/onexplayer-ces-2026-liquid-cooled-strix-halo-apex-super-x-handheld-egpu#comments">big on AMD</a>. The rest of Intel’s partners (Compal, Foxconn, Inventec, Pegatron, Quanta, and Wistron) aren’t brands, but rather the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laptop_brands_and_manufacturers#Original_design_manufacturers_(ODMs)">ODM contract manufacturing companies</a> that’ll be fighting for their business.</p><p>While I was chatting with AMD’s Jason Banta at the show, he brought my attention to one more piece of news that was <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-shows-first-renders-of-ryzen-ai-400-for-am5-socket">easy to miss</a>. <strong>The second potentially exciting thing for gamers</strong> is that AMD is making <em>socketed</em> mobile processors again — Ryzen AI 400 laptop chips that aren’t soldered down, but fit into a socket like a desktop CPU, so you can replace or potentially even upgrade them in the future.</p><p>He said they’ll begin to appear in desktops in the early part of this year, specifically targeting Q2. Banta thinks socketed mobile chips are going to unlock gaming and productivity designs of all shapes and sizes: “That socketed Ryzen AI 400, we’re expecting to see that everywhere from 1-liter designs all the way to 30-liter designs,” he says. (<a href="http://ming/606006/nvidia-rtx-5090-egpu-gaming-handheld-oculink-test-pcie-minisforum-deg1">Mobile processors can be a good match for beefy desktop GPUs</a>, since most games don’t require all that much CPU power at high resolution.)</p><p>These socketed chips aren’t just for gamers, mind; it sounds like they were actually targeted at AI PCs to start. “What we’re seeing is folks that want the flexibility of the socketed design, but they want to try out Copilot Plus, they want to try out some local models that can actually leverage the NPU and run directly on that,” he said.</p><p>When I asked if the socket means we should expect upgradable <em>laptops</em>, Banta gently throws some cold water on that idea. “In general, what we find is people want the thinnest system they can get, even if they’re enthusiast users,” and that both the socket itself and a socketed CPU’s integrated heat spreader add unwanted thickness to a laptop.</p><p>But he seems to think it’ll happen in mini PCs: “What we’re seeing is BGA, LGA, everyone’s experimenting in a lot of different ways within those 1-liter, 2-liter designs, things you can fit on your desk.”</p><p>While I didn’t spot a mini PC with a socketed CPU at the show, I bumped into one with tiny modular desktop graphics cards — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/831106/minisforum-g1-pro-mini-pc-price-release-date">this Steam Machine competitor from Minisforum</a> — and it makes me excited for a possible future where we can upgrade the CPU, too. Why should only larger PCs be fully upgradable? The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/818111/valve-steam-machine-hands-on-preview-specs-announcement">new Steam Machine</a> isn’t, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/749404/framework-desktop-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-max-385-395-plus-review">Framework Desktop</a> requires you to upgrade a whole mainboard at a time, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>For that to happen, though, AMD would also have to <em>sell</em> its socketed mobile processors at retail the way it sells its desktop ones, and AMD’s not yet willing to commit to that today.</p><p>“What can I say… we have active partnerships with OEMs on Ryzen AI 400 socketed designs. DIY is not something we’re communicating information about at this time, so more to come later,” Banta said.</p><p>Here’s hoping.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/862861/amd-ces-2026-socketed-laptop-chips-strix-halo-price]]></content:encoded>
