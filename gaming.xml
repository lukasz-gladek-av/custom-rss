<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a5400365af705/yoshi-touch-and-go-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo Life</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>We're back with another clash of the covers as we embark on this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-operation-c-probotector-game-boy">Last time</a>, it was the Game Boy's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a> (or <strong>Probotector</strong>, depending on your region) being put in the limelight, and we had a full three covers to choose between. It was the North American design that walked away with the win, however, snatching up 56% of the vote and splitting the remaining 23% and 21% between Japan and Europe, respectively.</p>
<p>With another Yoshi game on the horizon (don't tell us you had forgotten about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">The Mysterious Book</a> already!), we thought it only right to head back to Mario's dino pal this week, as we take a look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/yoshi_touch_and_go">Yoshi Touch &amp; Go</a> on the DS. It's not the greatest Yoshi game by any means, but we remember having some fun with it back in the mid-2000s.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fxrjymt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PA87rC9nG4k" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Europe and North America opted for the same design on this one, so we've got a good old-fashioned duel on our hands. Crack out of your shell and let's get into it...</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:144307 @ 1758448803 -->
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7b3b55b296f33/yoshi-touch-and-go-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bright, colourful and just a little bit sweet, we've got a soft spot for the European design. Yoshi and Baby Mario take centre stage as a Shy Guy propels by in the top corner, and the small stylus icon tells you everything you need to know about the game's controls. Neat!</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Yoshi Touch &amp; Go - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/34a49b5f518ff/yoshi-touch-and-go-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6614-yoshi-touch-go">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese design goes for something very different indeed. It's far more stripped back than its counterparts, and puts the focus on a little bit of peril. Baby Mario is a bigger focal point of this one (you can't knock a bit of brand recognition), and we see the stylus iconography make a return in the crayon line background.</p>

<figure><a title="Nintendo Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb4442208bc8e/nintendo-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As part of the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/round-up-everything-announced-for-super-marios-40th-anniversary">40th anniversary news</a>, Nintendo revealed it would be offering a "limited-time" Nintendo Museum ticket.</p>
<p>Instead of the regular Mii design, for the next year (between now and September 2026), Nintendo Museum guests will be able to get a special Super Mario Bros. 40th anniversary design. Again, this will be available for "approximately one year". Here it is:</p>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ce860db020de8/nintendo-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo's official Museum webpage explains how all tickets will be this Mario anniversary design by default during this period. If you've already set your ticket to the Mii design, there's no need to worry, as you can swap it via the official Nintendo Museum ticketing website before visiting.</p>
<p>Nintendo's website also mentions how the specific "end date for the special Mario design will be announced at a later date".</p>
<p>Nintendo is expanding on these celebrations at its museum as well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-museum-introduces-limited-time-mario-bros-40th-anniversary-ticket">with not only its art gallery</a> (featuring art from Mario's games), but also a "limited-time" lighting display, which will begin in December 2025.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Nintendo Museum will be illuminated with special lighting throughout the facility from Wednesday, December 3, 2025, to Monday, April 27, 2026. During this period, the special lighting will be active from 4:00 PM until closing. At the Warp Pipe photo spot, a special installation featuring the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary logo will be on display. Visitors can take photos with it throughout the day.</p>
<p>*The lighting display is accessible only to those with a valid ticket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from these updates for the Nintendo Museum, Nintendo shared many other Mario anniversary announcements during its recent Direct. You can catch up on all of this in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life. This includes new games, returning titles, and even the next Mario Movie.</p>

<p>Watch out, SEGA</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Team Reptile has announced it will be releasing another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/jet_grind_radio">Jet Set</a>-style release. Following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bomb_rush_cyberfunk">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> on the Switch in 2023, it has now unveiled its new project <strong>Hyperfunk</strong>.</p>
<p>The exact name and details are "subject to change". It's targeting a PC and console launch, but specific platforms and the release date haven't been confirmed just yet. Here's the official summary, and above you can check out the teaser trailer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Team Reptile’s new game is called HYPERFUNK. An extreme trick and graffiti game in which the higher your combo score, the faster you can boost. Follow the story of a crew called MACH10 and compete with the other crews in dynamic style wars or hang out online with friends.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/">Steam listing</a> also notes how you'll be able to "meet random online players" and "hang out online with your friends".</p>
<figure><a title="Jet Set Radio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66feeabf95fbe/jet-set-radio.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team Reptile</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In case you missed it, there's also an option in Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that allows you to unlock the framerate. Team Reptile originally shared this detail alongside the Switch 2 launch. Here's the rundown:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Playing Bomb Rush Cyberfunk on Switch 2? Know that there is an option in the game to unlock the framerate up to 60fps named 'Unleash the beast'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Team Reptile is the same team behind the projectile fighter series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lethal_league_blaze">Lethal League</a>. This reveal follows on from Sega announcing it would be reviving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/jet_grind_radio">Jet Set Radio</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/12/sega-reveals-new-details-for-shinobi-jet-set-radio-streets-of-rage-revivals">alongside multiple other classic IPs</a>.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>The recent Direct broadcast revealed the Virtual Boy library would be joining the Switch Online 'Nintendo Classics' library.</p>
<p>As you've likely already seen, there are a few paywalls. Firstly, you'll need to have an active Expansion Pack subscription (on top of the regular Switch Online subscription), and according to Nintendo, a paid accessory is "required".</p>
<p>There are two options here - the Virtual Boy replica for <strong>$99.99 / £66.99</strong> or the more affordable cardboard model for <strong>$24.99 / £16.99</strong>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187794 @ 1758449743 -->
<p>With all of this in mind, it's got us wondering if you're planning to check out this new digital collection when it arrives for Switch and Switch 2 on 17th February 2026. <em>So vote in our poll and leave a comment below.</em></p>

		<p>Warner Bros. Games has released an eight minute long video which delves into how Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight has come to be, including the inspirations. There is also more footage from the game which shows the different eras players will go through, including young Bruce Wayne before he becomes Batman, including his training with the League of Shadows.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO® Batman™: Legacy of the Dark Knight - Official Behind the Scenes - Building the Legacy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iB9SqHGitFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The video shows how every era of Batman has been used to create Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight, including the movies, TV shows, and the comic archive. The developers also give a look at how iconic moments from across Batman’s history have been used to create the story and build the city of Gotham, with lots of familiar locations. The city will have a lot going on for players to discover including areas where crimes are happening that need to be thwarted. Batman is not the sole focus of the game, with the Bat Family and rogues gallery playing an incredibly important part in proceedings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The developers of Battlefield 6 are doing a lot to fight cheating on PC, especially with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">requirement of Secure Boot</a> and Trusted Platform Module (TDM) 2.0. However, nowadays, cheating is an issue even on consoles. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/interview-we-dont-consider-this-a-port-battlefield-6-dev-on-why-it-built-the-ps5-version-concurrently-with-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking with Push Square</a>, Ripple Effect Technical Director Christian Buhl said they have partnered with Sony and Microsoft to better detect things like Cronus Zen on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, it's unfortunate that cheating has become a problem within the console space, especially with Cronus Zen machines and everything. So we've partnered with PlayStation and both Microsoft in this regard to kind of do detection. We actually have our own level of macro detection and everything.</em></p>



<p><em>So if players are doing rapid with Javelin on the PC side. That's why we've enabled Secure Boot to help us combat the never-ending cheater problem. And we are aware of the console cheater issue, and we're going to be taking cheating very, very seriously here.</em> <em>And we want to preserve as much of the fair play and competitive integrity that we can, because at the end of the day, we want to ensure that you're having a fair competitive space to play Battlefield 6 in.</em></p>



<p>Cronus Zen not only fools games into believing a player is using the gamepad instead of the mouse and keyboard they've actually connected to their consoles, but it also provides access to game scripts and a script compiler, opening the door to many different types of cheats. Needless to say, this could ruin the experience of many players once Battlefield 6 launches on October 10. Here's hoping the collaboration with Sony and Microsoft turns out to be helpful against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ripple Effect also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-secretly-console-first-turn-off-crossplay-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that console players will be able to turn off cross-play with PC, which remains the platform most likely to be affected by cheats.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Resident Evil Requiem 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39bc17e5e3c50/resident-evil-requiem-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since the first big blowout Direct for the Switch 2 back in April, I’ve been itching to see an announcement for <strong>Resident Evil</strong> on the new console. It’s possibly my favourite series of all time, after all, so I’m eager to play the recent entries on a Nintendo console without having to connect to the bloomin’ Cloud. Heck, aren’t we all?</p>
<p>I’ve been banging on about it so much over online chats and meetings that I’m quite sure my colleagues were just about sick of it weeks ago. So you can imagine how much my excitement ramped up when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/rumour-resident-evil-requiem-could-be-heading-to-the-switch-2">rumours began to surface</a> about not only existing RE Engine games making their way to Switch 2, but also the upcoming ninth mainline entry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>Surely not, right? We’re Nintendo fans, for goodness’ sake; we’re used to getting ports of games months, if not years after their release on other platforms. That’s if they even get ported <em>at all</em>, of course. Which often isn’t the case. And that’s fine, y’know, we’ve got our own first-party games to enjoy, plus a plethora of incredible indie titles.</p>

<p>But then it happened. Towards at the end of the latest Nintendo Direct, atmospheric shots of spooky hallways emerged, followed by the ringing of a telephone. 'Is this Resident Evil?!' I asked myself. And, stone the crows, it <em>was</em>! Not just any Resident Evil either, but as rumoured, it was Resident Evil Requiem, launching day-and-date with other consoles on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, represents a pretty significant shift for the Switch 2 early in its lifespan. As I said, we’re so used to getting ports of games long after their initial release on other platforms (or, in the case of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, just a few weeks later), but this is a major new entry in one of the biggest gaming franchises of all time – a franchise in which 4 of the 13 titles available on Switch were relegated to Cloud Versions. Yet there it was; a native port launching right alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>There was once a time – very briefly, mind you – in which Capcom and Nintendo were besties, with the former bringing a bunch of exclusives to the GameCube, including the now-iconic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>. Thanks to lukewarm sales, it didn't last long, and with Nintendo subsequently going in a drastically different direction to Sony and Microsoft, flagship RE games just weren't a thing on Nintendo consoles anymore.</p>
<p>The success of the Switch did change things quite a bit, and Capcom has done an admirable job in supporting the system over the years, but from the customer's point of view, and from <em>our</em> point of view, Cloud Versions just aren't good enough, and it felt like Switch owners were still drawing the short straw. Now, we're back in the driver's seat, and it feels wonderful.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting some major revolution in which every publisher suddenly rushes to launch their flagship games on the Switch 2, but the console’s remarkable success since its launch just a handful of months back has clearly made executives sit up and pay attention. This, along with the Switch 2's favourably comparable specs to the Series S has made immediate ports of new games a much more likely prospect.</p>

<p>Now, you could make the argument that Resident Evil Requiem isn’t the first ‘AAA’ game to launch day-and-date with other platforms. We had <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-plus-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> back in July, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</a> earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> is launching just next week. But let’s be fair, publishers would still be releasing sports games on the PS2 if they thought they could get away with it.</p>
<p>Seeing games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> gave me a great deal of hope that the Switch 2 would be a good home for modern blockbusters, even if it means waiting just that little bit longer. Then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> happened, and that felt like a good nudge in the right direction.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem, though? Yeah, that’s on a whole new level. This is a big deal, and I sincerely hope it signifies a bit more openness from publishers to launch their games on the Switch 2 alongside other platforms.</p>
<p>It's also worth mentioning that we're getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a> in March 2026 alongside other platforms, and there's a good chance <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">the untitled third entry in the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong></a> <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/the-entire-final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-is-making-its-way-to-switch-2">trilogy</a></strong> will also land day-and-date. Good things are happening folks!</p>
<p>Whether it continues is likely down to how well these games actually sell, so... Yeah, buy Resident Evil Requiem, everyone.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up has dropped a mysterious image onto social media, leading some fans to speculate it could be teasing a horror event or even crossover promotion with the upcoming release of Konami's horror, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p>
<p>While there's no cheeky copyright notices or any obvious indication that Stellar Blade is taking us to Silent Hill, Shift Up did share an image of a very Silent Hill Otherworld-esque world onto Stellar Blade's X/Twitter page, complete with crumbling walls, a dilapidated ceiling, and a very familiar rust-red hue. Hmm.</p>

<p>The text – which reads "in one week…" alongside a stars emoji and the hashtag Stellar Blade – similarly doesn't give much away, but coincidentally enough, Silent Hill f – the first mainline Silent Hill game since 2012 – is due to launch next week on 25th September.</p>

<p>As both franchises have partnered with other games for promotional purposes, it's certainly possible, but it could, of course, just be a spooky-themed time-limited event or another horror game or movie with Halloween just a few short weeks away. Whatever it is, hopefully we'll find out soon.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shift-up-to-expand-stellar-blade-franchise-after-successful-launch-across-multiple-platforms">Shift Up announced it intends to expand the Stellar Blade franchise with "various derivative works"</a>. A new financial report explored the success of its different products, including Stellar Blade, highlighting the game's impressive performance both at launch and with its port to PC.</p>
<p>The report added (via machine translation): "Through this, [Stellar Blade] was able to effectively secure a new user base and further strengthen its position as a global AAA franchise IP.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kratos-rumored-to-wield-a-khopesh-in-the-next-god-of-war-game.1303377/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Renowned leaker Tom Henderson shared an interesting tidbit regarding Kratos and the next God of War game in the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFHG7oPngE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming's weekly podcast</a>. </p>



<p>Henderson was discussing with the others the likelihood that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 2.5D Metroidvania spin-off</a> would be announced at the next State of Play (rumored to take place before the end of September). The leaker then remarked that Sony Santa Monica is also working on a new mainline entry, adding that Kratos would be equipped with a brand new weapon from ancient Egypt.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>There's some weird confusion because there is the Metroidvania game in development and then there's also a new mainline God of War game in development, which is kind of similar in themes. I think that Kratos this time has an Egyptian sword, you know, like the curved Egyptian sword. I can't remember what they are called, but I think like what Prince of Persia's got or whatever.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Henderson appears to be referring to the Khopesh, a sickle-shaped sword that evolved in Egypt from battle axes. It would be a new weapon for Kratos, but more to the point, it would indirectly imply a potential Egyptian setting. After all, why would there be an Egyptian sword if that wasn't the case? The Norse duology added fitting weapons like the Leviathan Axe, a weapon historically favored by nordic warriors.</p>



<p>It's not first time that the Egyptian setting has been attached to God of War. Before the release of the 2018 installment, Game Director Cory Barlog said that, after the Norse saga, future games could feature either Egyptian or Mayan mythology.</p>



<p>It's already been three years since the release of Ragnarök. However, if the rumor about the smaller Metroidvania game is correct, chances are the next big main installment is a bit further away. Still, in the meantime, fans have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">Amazon Prime Video adaptation</a> to look forward to. The first season is expected to <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">start filming in March 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Would you like for Sony Santa Monica to choose Egypt as the next God of War setting?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/say-no-to-100-speakers-this-anker-alternative-is-nearly-free-on-amazon-2000627456</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium brands love charging $100, $200, even $300 for Bluetooth speakers but a lot of the time, you’re paying for the label more than the performance. If you want real bang for your buck, the <strong>Anker Soundcore 2</strong> is a fantastic choice. Now, with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Amazon dropping the price from $45 to just $29, this deal is too good to pass up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Pocket Powerhouse That Delivers Where It Counts</h2>
<p>The Soundcore 2 isn’t your average small speaker: Inside its <strong>compact body hides a powerful 12W output</strong>, delivered through dual neodymium drivers engineered to produce rich sound even at higher volumes. One of its standout features is the BassUp technology which selectively boosts low frequencies in real time and makes bass tones punchier without causing distortion.</p>
<p>One of the big concerns when buying a portable speaker is durability and resistance to weather conditions: The <strong>Soundcore 2 handles that with an IPX7 rating of waterproofing</strong>. It’s a level of protection that can keep it underwater for full submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It also makes it easy to clean it up—just wash off and go.</p>



<p>Anker’s famed power management combined with a 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery<strong> lets this speaker run for up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong>. That’s enough to last a full day of work or travel without constantly hunting for an outlet. Plus, <strong>fast charge technology</strong> means you’re back to full power quickly and makes it ready for your next adventure.</p>
<p>Portability is never sacrificed: Tipping the scales at <strong>about half a pound </strong>and measuring small enough to fit into backpacks, purses, or big pockets with ease, it fits easily in your pocket. The looks are clean and minimalist, and the controls are uncomplicated enough that anyone can become familiar with them quickly. And talking of Bluetooth, the new <strong>Bluetooth 5.0 standard ensures reliable and low-latency connections</strong> with your device and improved range.</p>
<p>If expensive Bluetooth speakers are out of your budget, then this Anker Soundcore 2 deal shows you don’t have to take out a second mortgage on a quality portable speaker that’s rugged, sounds great, and plays all day on one battery charge.</p>

              <p>Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are <strong>designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life</strong>.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Plans at Avast.com</a></p>
<h2>Protect Your Identity</h2>
<p>With insight into the reality of rising threats, Avast has grown beyond mere status as the free antivirus pioneer to an all-out defender of PCs, Macs, Androids, and iOS devices through advanced protection that keeps up with the cybercrime tools of the modern age. Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.</p>
<p>A premium choice is <strong>Avast Premium Security</strong>. At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78)</a>, it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Avast Premium Security</a></p>
<p>Add more, and <strong>Avast Ultimate</strong> has it all from Premium Security with extras such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/avast-vpn-vs-nordvpn">the Avast SecureLine VPN</a>, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.</p>
<p>In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up,<strong> Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance</strong>. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: <strong>they safeguard your entire digital existence</strong> and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.</p>
