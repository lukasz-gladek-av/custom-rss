		<p>Following the mixed reception to its launch last week, a second hotfix update is now available for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</a> on PC, as Nixxes look to address the main pain points that users have felt with the port.</p>
<p>In particular they’ve sought to stamp out crashes and stability issues as much as possible – though they also hazard that you really, really should update your drivers to the very latest version to have Spider-Man 2 compatibility built in.</p>


<p>Beyond that, they’ve fixed an Achievements bug that was causing them to fail – this will work retroactively upon loading a save file – and fixed a DualShock 4 button prompt bug.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Spider-Man 2 PC v1.202.0.0 patch notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Various crash fixes and stability improvements.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could cause Achievements not being awarded on some configurations.</li>
<li>Triangle and Square button prompts are now displayed correctly when using a DualShock 4 controller with Steam Input enabled.</li>
<li>Resolved a frame rate related bug that could block players during the mission ‘Show Me New York’.</li>
</ul>
<p>For what it’s worth, we’ve been playing with our PCs and generally found that the game has been fine following <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/500563872868991406">the first hotfix last Friday</a>, both in terms of stability and performance. Hopefully the game quickly gets up to snuff for those that are running into problems.</p>

			<p>For fans of Age of Empires, today's announcement is going to feel like a massive celebration. The developers of Age of Empires have shared that there will be new content coming to multiple games, as well as their exciting announcement of reaching 60 million Age of Empire players worldwide.</p>
<p>Diving into the updates one by one, PlayStation 5 fans are in luck. Both Age of Mythology: Retold and <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-might-be-coming-to-playstation/">Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition</a> will be making their way to PlayStation. Age of Mythology: Retold will be launching on PlayStation 5 in correlation with the Immortal Pillars expansion being released on March 4. This expansion will introduce the Chinese pantheon, as well as new maps to explore, myth units, and added gameplay features. For those who want to get their hands on this expansion, pre-orders are now live. Those who own Age of Mythology: Retold - Premium Edition will automatically receive the expansion on day one.</p>
<p>Age of Empires II: Definitive Edition will launch on PlayStation 5 later in the Spring. When both titles are released, they will feature content parity across all platforms, as well as cross-play support. This title is currently available on Xbox Game Pass and Steam.</p>
<p>In addition to these two games being released for PlayStation, it's been confirmed by the developers that new content will be released for Age of Empires IV this year. It will receive two pieces of DLC in 2025, with the first one launching this Spring. The first DLC will be titled "Knights of Cross and Rose" and will give players the opportunity to lead two well-known armies that are inspired by history. It will also introduce a new solo. More information regarding the second DLC will be shared at a later date, most likely once the first DLC has been released.</p>
<p>For those who play Age of Empires Mobile, February will be a big month for you. There are new features and events to participate in, including a new campaign named Battle of Dawn, as well as a new event named Stellar Glory. For Valentine's Day, Age of Empires Mobile will be getting exclusive Valentine's Day cosmetics, as well as three events to participate in that are themed around Princess Josephine's Treasure Hunt.</p>
<p>More information and screenshots are available on the <a href="https://www.ageofempires.com/news/whats-coming-in-2025-for-age-of-empires-and-age-of-mythology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Age of Empires website</a>, so you can see what the game will look like with the introduction of the new content in all games. There is also some concept art available to look at, as well as a gift code for those who play Age of Empires Mobile.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/04/wreckfest-2-hurtles-toward-pc-early-access-in-march/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Crash-tastic racer sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>&nbsp;is barrelling its way to a PC Early Access release on 20th March 2025, Bugbear and THQ Nordic have announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On day one, the early access version of Wreckfest 2 will have the core game modes of Racing, Derby and multiplayer, and this will provide a great testbed for the game’s fundamental gameplay, with all the racing for up to 24 drivers, the overhauled physics and renewed visuals.</p>
<p>Bugbear will feed in more content over time, including the revamped career mode that will adapt to individual playstyles. Online racing will have a new skill-based matchmaking system and server queues, though it’s not clear if they will be there on day one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/car-smashing-sequel-wreckfest-2-has-been-announced/">Announced last summer</a>, Bugbear previewed their&nbsp;new ROMU engine for demolition physics and dynamic simulation, which looks to take the smash-happy racing to new levels. There’s also a brand new sound system, which they believe to be one of the very best and more accurate in a racing game.</p>

<p>Another big new feature is the car customiser, which allows you to change colours per body part, add layered decals, but then also go deeper into making your car look like a bit of a wreck by painting on rust and body damage. I’m sure there’s going to be some great car liveries made in Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>In the fullness of time, Wreckfest 2 is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Wreckfest was a smash hit when it first launched back in 2018, though we reviewed it for the original console launch, with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/29/wreckfest-review/">9/10 Wreckfest review</a>. We said, “Wreckfest is a surprising triumph in blending the best that sim and arcade racers have to offer in an explosive and visually gratifying package. A few visual issues and overly aggressive AI do little to spoil one of the best driving games of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bugbear gave the game years of support after that, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/wreckfest-native-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-version-how-to-upgrade/">a big upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> that brought 60FPS racing to consoles. I’m sure we can expect similar plans for Wreckfest 2.</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has released the first gameplay trailer for MLB The Show 25, and with it came reveals of new features coming to this year’s game.</p>



<p>MLB The Show 25 features a number of updates coming to each of the game’s core modes. With Road to the Show, players will be able to now play in high school and college before making it to the big leagues. Colleges confirmed in the game so far—based on the trailer—include UCLA, LSU, TCU, Cal-State Fullerton, Vanderbilt, Texas, South Carolina, and Tennessee.  There are also metal bats in the game, replicating the play and sound from lower-levels of baseball.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Moving on to Franchise Mode, Sony San Diego is touting a new “Front Office Experience”. According to the studio, “choices matter, consequences are real, and time is precious as a revitalized Free Agency system adds risk/reward elements, strategy, and excitement to the pursuit of the top free agents each offseason”.</p>



<p>For Diamond Dynasty, the game’s card-collecting mode, there will be two new game modes within. The first is called  Diamond Quest, a rogue-like offline mode. The second is an online league-style mode called Weekend Classic. </p>



<p>Other new features revealed include the addition of more quick-time events, first-person cameras, and more. More details and deep dives into the modes will come as part of Sony San Diego’s pre-launch roadmap that you can see below.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>MLB The Show 25 launches March 18 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. For the first time in years, the game won’t be available day one on Xbox Game Pass.</p>

<p>It feels like we’ve not had an amazing Battlefield game for a long time. This is why EA is giving its all to make Battlefield 2025’s release as good as it can be and bring the franchise back to the forefront of FPS gaming with a bang in Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Battlefield 2025 is exactly what I’m looking for right now. Call of Duty is still great but can be arcadey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-season-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> and Overwatch are compelling Hero shooters, and The Finals is lacking something, but adds the delicious destruction I seek. Battlefield has always provided something a bit different, and (in my opinion) we haven’t had a memorable entry since 2016’s Battlefield 1.</p>



<p>Early indicators are EA is inventing a lot of time, resources, and manpower into Battlefield 2025, so let’s check out what we know about the next <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-will-the-next-battlefield-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield release</a> and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-release-period">Battlefield 2025 Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Boom. Credit to Battlefield Studios – Official Battlefield Labs Reveal Teaser video on YouTube</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s unconfirmed, but Battlefield 2025 is being eyed up for a potential 2025 release, and multiple reports seem to verify this.</strong></p>



<p>We’ve reported previously <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA’s next Battlefield game was aiming for 2025</a>. A few months later Vince Zempella—heading the new Battlefield title—hinted Battlefield was returning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern-day combat, also in 2025</a>.</p>



<p>EA hasn’t come out and said a 2025 date is happening, but it seems extremely likely. I highly doubt it’s going to stay as “Battlefield 2025” either, and we could finally be getting the long-awaited <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> many have been asking for.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-2025-battlefield-labs-testing-explained">Battlefield 2025 Battlefield Labs Testing Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield Labs is described as the “The most ambitious community collaboration in franchise history” and is a full-on cohesive alliance of multiple developers and players to create the ultimate Battlefield 2025 game.</strong></p>



<p>February 3 saw the first mention of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-confirms-battlefield-labs-community-testing-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> project. It’s a series of tests throughout the pre-alpha phase (and probably beta testing) to continually ascertain the quality of the product. Consistent player feedback is looking to help the four studios working on Battlefield 2025: <strong>DICE, Ripple Effect, Motive, </strong>and <strong>Criterion</strong>.</p>



<p>We don’t how long <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/announcing-battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs</a> will last, but you can try to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> and test the potential Battlefield 6 entry—providing feedback of your own.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-battlefield-6-gameplay-revealed">First Battlefield 6 Gameplay Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s hope for a good one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The first-ever footage of Battlefield 2025 AKA Battlefield 6 was shown off during the Battlefield Labs demonstration. It showed explosive gameplay, destructible environments, vehicles, high-octane weapons, and much more.</strong></p>



<p>It looks spectacular for pre-alpha footage, but we’ve been fooled by Battlefield before. Nevertheless, you can check out the reveal for yourself below.</p>

<p>What does Battlefield 2025 need to do differently from Battlefield 2024—and even Battlefield 5—to make itself relevant again and bring the player base back? Is this the last chance saloon for EA and Battlefield as a whole? Get involved with a comment below.</p>



<p>We’ve also learned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-portal-return/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Portal</a> makes a return for Battlefield 6, and we’ve gone through and dissected everything we’ve seen and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-learned-from-the-new-battlefield-game-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned from the first gameplay footage</a>.</p>

            <p>
We were big fans of developer Bugbear Entertainment's demolition derby racer Wreckfest when it launched back in 2018, so there was some excitement when a sequel was announced last year. And now, the studio has now confirmed similarly enthusiastic sorts can slam pedal to the metal from 20th March, when Wreckfest 2 launches into Steam early access.
</p>
<p>
Wreckfest 2 promises what Bugbear is calling the "next evolution of full-contact racing", and there's talk of an overhauled physics engine, more intricate component damage simulation, and "even higher crash fidelity" - all working together to conjure "absolute vehicular mayhem".
</p>
<p>
Course-wise, Bugbear is promising a blend of high-speed circuits, "crazy courses with obstacles and jumps", plus intersections and oncoming traffic. Initially these'll be available in Racing, Derby, and multiplayer modes - supporting up to 34 players - with more to come. Sometime into Wreckfrest 2's early access release, for instance, Bugbear is introducing a revamped career mode designed to adapt to individuals' playstyles, plus a skill-based matchmaking system and server queues for online players.

<p>
Vehicle customisation also has a major role, and players can spruce up their cars with new armour and component types suited to different driving approaches. New components will arrive as early access continues, with other future additions set to include tournaments, high-score challenges putting players in "unconventional vehicles", and mod support.
</p><p>
Bugbear says the goal of early access is to ensure Wreckfest 2 is "shaped by [player] feedback" from day one. And while there's no indication of how long early access will last as yet, the original Wreckfest notably remained in early access for four years. The results, however, were worth it, with Martin Robison calling it a game of "primal pleasures" and "little by way of pretension" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wreckfest-2-gothic-1-remake-gameplay-and-everything-else-from-thq-nordics-showcase">his Recommended review</a>.
</p>
<p>
So if you're eager to get behind the wheel as Wreckfest 2 heads toward the early access finish line, you can do so when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/">it comes to Steam</a> on 20th March.

As of the end of 2024, the Nintendo Switch has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">sold over 150 million units</a> in the eight years since its release.

Though hardware sales are down a whopping 30 percentage points compared to 2023, Nintendo has, predictably, taken an optimistic stance. After all, this console is eight years old <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">with the Switch 2</a> tantalizingly close to launch.

But that impressive 150 million unit total is still a bit short of the massive 154 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its 12-year lifetime. Bolstered by recent games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> and with new games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> on the horizon, it’s likely that the Switch will finally overtake the DS this year, making it Nintendo’s best selling console ever.</p><p>After that, there’s one more boss for the console to beat before it can be called the best-selling console of all time – the 160 million units of the PlayStation 2. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Probably not. Here’s a very short explanation: In 2018 video game composer and jerk Tommy Tallarico announced plans to create a new Intellivision-branded console focused on affordable games and family fun. A number of games (mostly ports of mobile and web titles) were planned to launch alongside the Amico, including a new version of <em>Breakout </em>developed by Choice Provisions. Of all the Amico games, this new <em>Breakout </em>was the one most people were excited about. </p><p>Here’s the reveal trailer for Amico’s Breakout game: </p><p>And then years of mismanagement, delays, covid-19, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-is-selling-nft-games-for-a-console-that-a-1847836174">NFT nonsense</a></span> and more occurred, and here we are in 2025 and the Amico is still not on shelves. If you want to learn more about the car crash that is the Amico, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271">click here</a></span>. </p><p> Anyway, in 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atari bought the Intellivision brand and its games</a></span>, but not the Amico console. For a while now, people have wondered what happened to that cool looking <em>Breakout </em>game. Was it doomed to never see the light of day? Nope! Atari realized it had a possible banger on its hands and is finally getting around to releasing the game on actual platforms people own and use. </p><p>That brings us to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041770/Breakout_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Breakout Beyond</em></a></span>, the “new” game announced today for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. (No release date was provided.) It’s nice to see this thing escaping the Amico to get a chance to launch and be played. Hopefully <em>Breakout Beyond </em>is worth the wait. At least now nobody needs to buy an Amico, assuming the doomed console actually comes out one day. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Elsewhere, "hundreds" of new gameplay animations have been added, along with a new G.O.A.T. difficulty setting and an "ambush hitting" system.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G33itOzDkM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0G33itOzDkM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Road to the Show's progression system has also been overhauled, which Sony says gives you "more control over your player's development, including crafting Perks to your liking." With any luck, it should help your players from falling too neatly into one of a few different archetypes, as they could in years past.</p><p>Diamond Dynasty has also gotten some big changes. The Sets and Seasons system, which limited the players you could take into an online ranked match, have been removed. A new tabletop-like Diamond Quest mode and the multiplayer Weekend Classic have also been added, giving you another way to earn rewards.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, MLB The Show 25 sees the return of Storylines with The Negro Leagues Season 3. Negro Leagues Baseball Museum president Bob Kendrick is back to showcase some of the greatest baseball players of all time in an educational mode that always features some unique game situations.</p><p>MLB The Show 25 releases on March 18 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and Switch. Preorders are live now.</p>

The first season was a mostly faithful recreation of the original 2013 game, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=last%20of%20us&amp;timestamp=1738685251805#:~:text=5%20Things%20We%20Noticed%20In%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us%E2%80%99%20New%20Season%20Two%20Trailer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/search?blogId=9&amp;q=last%20of%20us&amp;timestamp=1738685251805#:~:text=5%20Things%20We%20Noticed%20In%20The%20Last%20Of%20Us%E2%80%99%20New%20Season%20Two%20Trailer">what we’ve seen of season two</a></span> looks pretty close to the sequel. One notably different aspect, however, is Abby, the co-protagonist of the game, now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-max-show-abby-actor-kaitlyn-dever-1851152428">played by Kaitlyn Dever</a></span> in the show.

Fans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-abby-casting-shannon-berry-muscles-1850237103">including us</a></span>, were hoping this part of Abby’s character would survive the transition to live-action and wondered if Dever would be bulking up. But after seeing her a few times in the trailers, that doesn’t seem to be the case, and part of the explanation for why is kind of silly.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195896,196578" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/kaitlyn-dever-abby-the-last-of-us-didnt-need-muscles-exclusive-8784835&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/kaitlyn-dever-abby-the-last-of-us-didnt-need-muscles-exclusive-8784835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a></span>, showrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin gave two reasons for why Dever wasn’t hitting the gym to match Abby’s muscular frame in the game. The first is pretty reasonable: They wanted someone who could <em>play</em> the part more than just <em>look</em> the part.</p><p>“We value performance over anything else,” Druckmann said. “We need someone to really capture the essence of those characters... We don’t value as much, ‘Do they look exactly like the character with their eyebrows or their nose or their body?’ Whatever it is. It’s not nowhere on the priority list, but it’s below a bunch of other things that we consider.”</p><p>But the second reason is where I raise an eyebrow. Druckmann goes on to explain that because the show isn’t recreating the mechanics of playing <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, they didn’t see the need to differentiate Abby’s physicality from Bella Ramsey’s Ellie.</p><p>“We would’ve struggled to find someone as good as Kaitlyn to play this role,” Druckmann explains. “In the game, you have to play both characters [Ellie and Abby] and we need them to play differently. We needed Ellie to feel smaller and kind of maneuver around, and Abby was meant to play more like Joel in that she’s almost like a brute in the way she can physically manhandle certain things. That doesn’t play as big of a role in this version of the story because there’s not as much violent action moment to moment. It’s more about the drama. I’m not saying there’s no action here. It’s just, again, different priorities and how you approach it.”</p><figure id="" data-id="cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-recommend-id="image://cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1893" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-recommend-id="image://cc4d4c9e97e53eb40e6fd5498efe56de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1893" data-height="1065" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Abby looks down at something off-screen covered in blood and other wounds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yeah, Abby having a different kit played into her brute strength, but I think boiling down her muscular build to something entirely mechanical is a bit reductive. We see Abby through a few different points in her life in<em> The Last of Us Part II</em>, and her physical transformation echoes her emotional one. She starts working out as a reaction to her father’s murder, and by the time she is ready to avenge him, she’s physically unrecognizable from the small child she was when he passed. It’s as much a sign of her emotional arc as it is a mechanical tool for Naughty Dog’s developers to implement. She’s obsessive, and exercise is as much an outlet to channel her anger as it is a means of survival. I’m curious to see how the show finds some other way to communicate that part of her if Dever isn’t going to bulk up.</p><p><em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season premieres in April and will include at least a few new characters, in addition to the ones from the game. <em>Schitt’s Creek </em>actor Catherine O’Hara plays one new role, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/catherine-ohara-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-1851749776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/catherine-ohara-the-last-of-us-season-2-hbo-1851749776">apparently bringing some levity to an otherwise dark story</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We don’t know what the future holds for the studio, but we can celebrate its past by looking back at some of the best moments from its various series. Spoilers for all four games follow.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> begins with one of six playable opening chapters, the one you play based on the race and class of character you choose, providing a unique background for your character before they head out into the main story.</p><p>The Hero of Ferelden can be part of human nobility facing a tragic series of losses, a castless dwarf struggling to make it in the city of Orzamar, or a mage evicted from the magic school they’ve known their entire life, and those starkly different origin points are only half of the options. These origins define how your hero will be viewed in the dozens of hours that follow, and also function as a starting point for how a new player will view the franchise. I started as a Mage when I first played <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>in 2009, and have always felt like a veteran of the Circle at heart. Future <em>Dragon Age </em>games would implement this concept of different player backgrounds with <em>Inquisition </em>and <em>The Veilguard</em>, but none would do it as thoroughly—<em>Origins </em>was the only time I got to see that history play out in real-time.</p></div><div><p>No character in <em>Origins </em>is as impactful as Morrigan, the enigmatic Witch of the Wilds. The apostate carries a sense of superiority toward the rest of the party, as well as the trials and tribulations of Thedas. When you meet her in the early hours of <em>Origins</em>, you still don’t know much about the world, but her commanding presence elevated by Claudia Black’s excellent voice performance tells you that she is unlike anyone or anything you’ve met so far. Morrigan is one of the few characters in <em>Dragon Age </em>who watches nearly every important moment in Thedas’ history unfold, so seeing her here, both enigmatic but still so young and naive, is chilling to look back on.</p></div><div><p>After you’ve picked your background and lived out whatever trauma is associated with it, <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>puts you at the center of a battle with a darkspawn horde. Your job is to signal for reinforcements to help defeat an army of bloodthirsty monsters, but before the battle starts, the vibes seem off. The golden retriever King Cailain is jazzed about the incoming battle, though his father-in-law Loghain Mac Tir seems less enthusiastic. The tension between the two is tangible, but who are you to get involved in royal family affairs? However, when you signal for reinforcements, Loghain instead commands his forces to retreat, leaving everyone, including you and his own son-in-law, for dead at the hands of the Blight. Most of the preceding origin stories are full of some kind of betrayal. You might think you would get some respite from it at some point, but <em>Origins </em>doubles down, reminding you that you know nothing of this world and the lengths people will go to get what they want.</p></div><div><p><em>Origins </em>is not an entirely grimdark fantasy drama—some of the best character interactions come from your party members hanging out with your dog companion. Though Mabari dogs are trained to be vicious combatants, your canine companion is a sweetheart. Many interactions between the party and dog give him a hard time for being a mangy mutt, only for him to be revealed as a sensitive soul who just wants to play. Examine your preconceived notions, <em>Origins </em>crew. The sharp fangs mask that the Mabari is actually a good boy.</p></div><div><p>There are several points in the <em>Dragon Age</em> series in which a party member can turn on you, but none have ever been quite as shocking as when the religious bard Leliana, and otherwise kind-hearted Wynne, turn on you if you taint the Urn of Sacred Ashes. This is a crime against one of the most prominent doctrines in all of Thedas, and bringing two of the most devout members of the party to watch is bound to cause drama, but <em>Origins </em>takes it a step further by having both of your teammates take up arms against you.</p><p>It doesn’t matter how far you’ve progressed through their personal stories, or even if you’re involved in a romance with Leliana; faith trumps all other emotions here, and you will have to strike down your allies. You’ll face plenty more betrayals during the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, but Leliana and Wynne’s heel turn is still one of the most sudden and violent. </p></div><div><p>Much like killing Leliana, <em>Origins </em>has a few choices whose ramifications were so earth-shattering that BioWare later had to write themselves out of the box they’d created so they could re-use characters that could be dead. One of those was the option to kill Flemeth, Morrigan’s even more enigmatic mother who allegedly wanted to steal her daughter’s body as a vessel to live longer, though the reality is a bit more nuanced than that. When Morrigan finds out about this plan, she begs you to slay the old woman in her hut in the woods. You can choose to do so or strike a deal with her to spare her in exchange for her grimoire of old spells, but choosing to slay her means fighting her in a powerful dragon form. It’s a tough fight, but doing so leaves you not with a rewarding cutscene and major story revelation, but instead an unsettling and anticlimactic quiet. You’re left with more mysteries than you had when you arrived, and the unshakable feeling that you might have killed something far beyond your understanding. Flemeth’s place in the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe was too significant to be silenced by something as trivial as death, but for a moment, you feel like you have driven a stake through the heart of something you cannot comprehend.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>’ big moment where all your choices culminate is The Landsmeet, a political meeting where you can finally unmask Loghain for all his crimes and essentially set up the country of Ferelden’s future. Your relationships and understandings formed over the past 50+ hours of video game are put to the test, and things can change drastically depending on how the battles of wits and blades pan out. To this day, The Landsmeet is one of BioWare’s most effective showcases of its ability to sew hours of choices into a final consequence. In just one quest you solidify the future for Ferelden in a way that sends most players down the same path, but colors that result so differently that many players, especially those who don’t know every secret the game has to offer, will see something that diverges significantly from what the next player might see.</p></div><div><p>One of the last major choices you’ll make in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em> comes back to Morrigan. The witch has had more than enough reasons to leave the party considering she doesn’t really get along with anyone on the team, but she sticks around long enough to give you a final choice: ending the Blight will cost you your life—unless you or Alistair undergoes a blood magic ritual that will transfer the Archdemon’s soul into an unborn child. It sounds like a get-out-of-jail-free card, all you have to do is lay with her for one night or convince Alistair to do it. But Morrigan is cagey with her intentions and says that whether you agree or not, she will leave the party after the final battle. This is why she’s been here this whole time, but does that mean any connection you’ve formed with her was all an act? What will become of this child? Is it going to be like any other child or will it be some darkspawn demon that could bring about just as much pain in the world as the archdemon would? Morrigan gives you nothing to go on, but makes her terms clear. <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>would go on to have three sequels that would wipe away the ambiguity of this decision, but at the time, all you had to go on here was your trust of Morrigan, or lack thereof. Everything you’ve ever been told about blood magic and interrupting the natural order of the Blight should tell you to say “no,” but are you willing to risk it to save your own life? It’s a fascinating choice. Did <em>Dragon Age</em> do right by it? Your mileage may vary.</p></div><div><p>With <em>Dragon Age II</em>, BioWare started earnestly looking for a way to franchise the series. It had built itself a new cage as the “choice and consequence” studio thanks to the <em>Mass Effect </em>series, and <em>Dragon Age </em>followed suit by importing your <em>Origins </em>save to pepper in cameos and references to your past deeds. That includes whether or not you killed Flemeth, but since BioWare still wanted to use the mysterious witch either way, it had new hero Hawke unwittingly carry her to safety through an enchanted amulet even as she fought for her life against the Hero of Ferelden. Reviving Flemeth is one of the most effective moments in all of <em>Dragon Age </em>in showing how playing as different protagonists in each game could create satisfying meta moments. As she rises from the ashes, you watch the impact of one of your hero’s actions be undermined by the one you’re playing as now. <em>Dragon Age </em>takes place over decades, and a big part of its appeal is watching different stories you’ve helped write weave in and out of one another. It’s a course correction, but one that is still bone-chilling to watch unfold.</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Dragon Age </em>differs from the first in several ways, from taking place almost entirely in one city to swapping the tactical RPG battle system for more action-oriented combat. But one of the most notable and interesting changes it made was to the approval system, which integrated a Friendship and Rivalry mechanic so you didn’t have to kiss a party member’s ass to progress their relationship storyline. The difference between Friendship and Rivalry is all about how you challenge their preconceived notions. Each party member has a pretty defined view of the world; the radical mage Anders, for instance, is all about freeing magic users from the Circle at any cost, while the elven slave Fenris has an aversion to magic. Uncritically enabling them will give you Friendship points, and going against the grain will net you Rivalry points. This changes the tone of your relationships significantly, and even someone you’re in a romantic relationship with may greet you with a thorny disposition. Watching those connections gradually change is one of the most compelling parts of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s writing. Romancing Fenris as a mage while being rivals was one of the most interesting, angsty relationships I’ve ever experienced in a BioWare game. It’s a shame the studio didn’t keep the system around.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age II</em> is all about years of civil unrest bubbling to the surface of one city, and between the conflict with the stranded Qunari and the Mage/Templar War, the former is certainly handled with more care than the latter. While early <em>Dragon Age </em>games had multiple crisis points in which party members can leave the party or betray you, one of the most memorable is when one party member makes a decision not to leave, but to return. Isabela is the cause of the Qunari’s extended stay in Kirkwall, and when she’s given the chance to run off with a tome they have been searching for, she takes it. If you’ve not established a solid enough friendship or rivalry with her, she will never return. If you have, she makes a big hero’s entrance just as the Qunari are about to strike down what remains of the city. She attempts to make amends, showing the growth she’s been trying her damnedest to avoid since arriving in the city. But then the Qunari leader says she still must answer for her crimes. You can give her up and betray her, or you can fight for her instead, and seeing her be big enough to not sell you and the rest of Kirkwall out for once in her life is one of <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s most memorable companion moments.</p></div><div><p>Choosing to fight for Isabela’s freedom results in a somewhat silly but exceptionally satisfying fight. <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s action-based combat isn’t quite as snappy and tight as <em>The Veilguard</em>’s, but it has some spectacle that can keep it interesting in fights that don’t just pit you against waves of enemies being thrown at you. The Arishok fight can go a few ways depending on if he respects Hawke or not, but fighting the giant Qunari in a one-on-one duel is still one of the best combat sequences in the game. You may be in for a tough time if you haven’t spec’d into a class and build that can handle a solo fight, but in any case, taking down the Arishok and being crowned the Champion of Kirkwall is one of the defining moments of <em>Dragon Age II</em>.</p></div><div><p>One bright spot in <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s extremely uneven final act is the conclusion to Merrill’s story. The elven blood mage has gone against the wishes of everyone around her in a tunnel-visioned need to bring back a part of her clan’s history, even seeking out the help of a demon. <em>Dragon Age II</em> takes place across a decade, with Merrill at odds with her clan leader Marethari all the while, and yet the leader sacrifices herself to “save” Merrill by allowing the demon she had been working with to possess her instead. Merrill can insist this was meddling and you can be supportive of her or not, but the real people she has to answer to are the clan’s remaining members. Depending on whether you advocate for her or throw her under the bus, you may have to fight the entire clan on your way out. It’s a brutal mess that’s tied to the character with perhaps the most emotional range of any party member in the franchise. It’s such a terrifying, saddening web of contradicting feelings and subverted expectations, all leading to a stunning payoff.</p></div><div><p>I have a lot of issues with the handling of the Mage/Templar War in <em>Dragon Age II</em>. It creates this complicated political and religious conflict around an oppressed group of people and a tyrannical religious organization but insists that both sides are equally bad, actually. Don’t even get me started on how you can convince Anders, the radical mage who is the face of this conflict, to kill the mages he tried to save. But the moment in which Anders, worn down by a lifetime of captivity and oppression, blows up the Kirkwall Chantry is one of the few unambiguous statements the game makes in its final hours. The scene itself is dramatic and shocking and kickstarts a war that would (in theory) shake the foundations of Thedas. It requires everyone in your party to make a stand. There will be no more fence-sitting in this fight, and all your relationships will be tested as your team decides whether or not to follow you into battle. Sadly, the reveals that follow undermine any choice you make, but as a spark that ignites a flame, Anders’ act of terrorism is a statement in a game that otherwise seems unwilling to make one.</p></div><div><p>A lot of the highlights we’ve talked about are big story moments or reactions to your decisions, but one of the coolest things <em>Inquisition </em>does happens literally the moment the game starts. The main menu shows rows of mages and templars marching toward a building off in the distance. Despite where we left them in <em>Dragon Age II</em>, these two opposing sides don’t seem to be fighting, so perhaps they’re making their way to peace talks? Could the future of <em>Dragon Age </em>be written not in blood, but in signed treaties? Let’s press “new game” and find o-</p><p>Oh.</p></div><div><p>I have heard some fans say the moment in which members of the Inquisition start singing “The Dawn Will Come,” a hymn of the Chantry, to your main character in a moment of religious fervor is cheesy and cringe, to which I say, fuck you, it’s one of the most incredible moments in the game. <em>Inquisition</em>’s themes can be radically different depending on how you play the Herald of Andraste. This hero has been unwillingly made a religious figure, with hundreds of people expecting you to live as a symbol for a god you might not even believe in. If you take this approach, playing as a non-believer who actively shouts down the claims of the faithful, “The Dawn Will Come” can be an unnerving, haunting reminder of how much unwavering belief can compel groups of people even as you insist on a different, provable truth. If, on the other hand, you’re undecided or playing as a believer, it can read like a beautiful moment of hope and community. <em>Inquisition </em>allows you to define so many shades of who your character is and see them reflected in a world that struggles with your very existence. And sometimes, no matter how hard you kick and scream, you cannot stop the world from believing what it does. Instead, you can just awkwardly stand there while people sing to you and then complain about it later.</p></div><div><p>With each subsequent game, <em>Dragon Age </em>has gotten better at illustrating the closeness (or lack thereof) of your companions. Banter in the overworld is good, but seeing the crew actually get together is better. The Wicked Grace scene, in which the party gets together to play a card game, is one of BioWare’s best scenes that make use of a game’s entire core ensemble. Everyone’s personality gets a chance to shine, whether they’re playful, stuffy, horny, or just trying to wrangle all these weirdos together. It’s delightful, succinct, and has stayed in the hearts of many <em>Dragon Age </em>fans.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Dragon Age </em>series has always been explicitly queer. For all the diaper-shitting about <em>The Veilguard</em>’s queer themes, <em>Inquisition </em>was examining the life and times of a Thedas gay long before Taash learned the term “non-binary.” Dorian Pavus’ personal quest remains one of the most memorable in all of BioWare’s canon. It drops combat for one incredibly well-acted cutscene between the Tevinter mage and his estranged father, where it’s revealed that, to continue their bloodline and climb his way up the Tevinter political ladder, Dorian’s father planned to use a blood magic equivalent to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conversion therapy</a></span> in order to force his son into an arranged marriage. I’ve spoken to many <em>Dragon Age </em>fans over the years about what decision they made here, as you’re able to help the two reconcile, or to get Dorian out of there. I’ve never once considered telling Dorian to hear his father out. It’s one of the best examples I’ve seen of a game adapting the queer struggle to a fictional culture. Dorian becomes a radical because he has seen how low even those he loves will go to maintain power in Tevinter, and it all ties into his identity as a gay man. It’s a stunning scene that tells you so much about Dorian and where he came from, and lets you gently nudge history as you stand beside him.</p></div><div><p>Blackwall goes under the radar for a lot of players. He’s quiet, keeps to himself, and is even in a pretty out-of-the-way spot in your base in Skyhold. A lot of people think the Grey Warden warrior is boring, but they’re wrong; the big reveals you experience in his companion missions are outstanding. Blackwall tells you he’s a Warden but is secretive about the organization which, if you played <em>Origins</em>, may nudge you to think back to your own experience playing as one. You know why they’re all tight-lipped on the inner machinations of the faction, so you don’t question it. But it turns out, he’s actually not a Warden at all, and is instead an imposter on the run for war crimes he committed years ago. Eventually, the guilt eats at him and he turns himself in to save others from answering for his orders with a hangman’s noose. This man duped you for dozens of hours, and you’re left with the power to decide his fate. Blackwall’s quest can go one of several ways, whether you leave him to rot, pardon him, or send him to the Wardens to let them decide what happens to an imposter. Whatever you choose, Blackwall’s quest leaves an impression as one of BioWare’s most surprising and subversive. Y’all need to quit calling characters you don’t even talk to boring. This shit rips.</p></div><div><p>Even as someone who likes <em>Mass Effect </em>more than <em>Dragon Age</em>, I have a hard time thinking of a singular quest in the sci-fi series that matches up to <em>Inquisition</em>’s Wicked Eyes and Wicked Hearts. While you will unsheathe your weapons a few times, this mission is all about politics, charming the worst people you’ve ever met, and working the crowd. Running around the Winter Palace, meeting the most powerful players in Orlais, and manipulating the politics of an entire country to your whims is more intriguing than anything you do with a sword or staff. Mechanically, the mission is surprisingly elegant as it codifies social status and attention into something that can be measured by a video game, and it’s intriguing learning more about the figureheads you can rally to your cause. There are several outcomes at the end of this mission, and getting what you want might come down to blackmail, reuniting long-lost lovers, or a betrayal of your own. It’s unlike anything else in the <em>Dragon Age </em>series, and I haven’t seen many studios pull off something like it since.</p></div><div><p>At one point, it seemed as if Flemeth might be the throughline connecting all of <em>Dragon Age</em>. For two games, she was presented as a manipulator, lurking in the shadows and moving the pieces of Thedas’ chess board to her liking. Then all her machinations finally came to a head in <em>Inquisition</em> when she, Morrigan, and perhaps the child the player helped conceive two games prior, all gather in the Fade. Flemeth seemingly has control of the situation, appearing to hold her grandson Kieran hostage and using him as leverage against her daughter who has been on the run since <em>Origins</em>. But as anger gives way to truth-telling and the moment softens, the two find not total reconciliation, but at least an understanding that neither is in danger from the other. It is a series-best performance from Black and Flemeth actor Kate Mulgrew, bringing together three games of choices and history into one incredible confrontation. I’m still unsure how I feel about the final echoes of this moment in <em>The Veilguard</em>, but Flemeth and her family reuniting and acknowledging the struggle of love and fear for one another that they’re caught in remains one of the most memorable interactions in all of <em>Dragon Age</em>.</p></div><div><p>I could just throw the entirety of the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC in here and it would be in the running for best “moments” in the series. The final expansion BioWare released for <em>Inquisition </em>in 2015 isn’t just an epilogue for the RPG, but is pretty much the true ending. You say goodbye to all the companions with some silly, heartfelt scenes, engage in some politics, and fight some really memorable battles, but the meat of the DLC is in its final 10 minutes. Solas, the elven apostate who abandons your team at the very end, reveals that he is the Dread Wolf, the trickster god who led a rebellion against the rest of the elven pantheon. He plans to tear down the barrier between the real and spirit worlds, which he believes will revitalize the old world of the elves, granting them immortality once more and destroying everyone else in the process. But you’re given two choices that (before <em>The Veilguard</em>, at least)<em> </em>felt incredibly meaningful as a final word for the Inquisitor: Do you think Solas is beyond saving? And is your organization in a state to fight him? Ultimately, neither of those choices mattered in <em>The Veilguard</em>, despite them being imported into the game at the beginning. But back in 2015 it felt like a victory lap, a final declaration by a character you probably wouldn’t get to play again.</p></div><div><p>BioWare has always been held up as a studio that spearheads inclusive design, but <em>The Veilguard </em>takes this one step further by letting you explicitly determine that your protagonist Rook is trans. This isn’t just a cosmetic choice like giving them top surgery scars or picking a voice; it can be part of your character’s backstory that you talk about from time to time with other characters. Few games have been this thorough about letting you define your character’s identity, and <em>The Veilguard </em>approaches it with a great deal of care.</p></div><div><p><em>The Veilguard </em>continues the trend, started with <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, of BioWare hiding some of a game’s biggest lore reveals behind an optional collectathon, but this time they are so far-reaching and important that I can’t believe some players may never see them. Collecting wolf statues throughout <em>The Veilguard </em>reveals Solas’ regrets. These are murals depicting memories from the elven god’s long life, and essentially write the creation myth of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe. When I first played <em>The Veilguard</em>, I did these quests pretty late and they started to turn me around on the game entirely. I had mostly considered <em>The Veilguard</em> less a meal than a series of really good sides, but this was when I as a long-time fan felt like I was really eating. Each reveal was juicier and more surprising than the last, bringing connective tissue to a universe that had often felt disparate and disconnected. God, I can’t believe they’re optional.</p></div><div><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s choices are binary, but most of them are still pretty compelling. The first world-altering choice comes when you must decide which of two cities to save from incoming dragon attacks: Minrathous or Treviso. There’s a lot of emotion tied up in this choice, as well as tactical considerations to make. Your Rook might be from Minrathous, but pursuing a relationship with Treviso native Lucanis. You may be trying to develop partnerships with the radical Tevinter group the Shadow Dragons and feel like you should help them defend their city to not burn bridges. Whatever your reasoning and whatever the consequences, you have to choose right then and there. Your teammates are looking to you for an answer, and you realize that a mere few hours of gameplay ago you were just a contractor helping Varric track down Solas. Rook’s arc is all about them confronting the leadership role that has been thrust on them by circumstance and Varric’s expectations. This is the moment it becomes clear that they might not be cut out for the decisions they have to make, but they’ll have to learn to live with those choices one way or another.</p></div><div><p>The Mourn Watch necromancer Emmrich is <em>The Veilguard</em>’s best marriage of character and faction culture. He is fascinated by death because he has an all-consuming fear of the end. Emmrich’s goal is to become a Lich, an immortal keeper of the dead, willing to watch life begin and end forevermore. But as his personal quests unfold, his assistant Manfred, a reanimated skeleton, is killed in a battle with a rival Lich. Using his powers, he could bring Manfred back, but doing so would disqualify him from achieving the immortality he desires, as it would show an inability to accept death. How can you be immortal and watch everything live and die in an endless cycle if one death of a loved one compels you to defy the natural order? I’ve heard people make cases for allowing Emmrich to become a Lich, but I chose to advise him to bring Manfred back and leave Lichdom behind. The Lich order may believe his inability to leave Manfred behind as a weakness, but I saw it as an asset. It’s proof that he loves too strongly to spend an eternity watching everyone he cares about disappear over and over again. Still, I see the argument for the other side. No other choice in <em>The Veilguard </em>so succinctly nails the companion-first format BioWare wanted while saying so much about the world in the process.</p></div><div><p>The Grey Warden headquarters of Weisshaupt has been referenced since the very beginning of <em>Dragon Age</em>, and after all those years hyping it up, our first experience of it is one hell of a followthrough. <em>The Veilguard</em>’s mission at the fortress is an action-packed and narratively rewarding setpiece packed with reveals about the state of the Grey Wardens and demonstrating just how much of a threat the remaining elven gods pose. Meanwhile, the drama it stirs between your team of usually harmonious heroes is a peak moment for the whole series, and holy shit, that boss fight at the end might be the most challenging BioWare’s ever created.</p></div><div><p>After you see all of Solas’ regrets, you meet a visitor in the Lighthouse: Morrigan. She gives you one last big lore dump, finally putting a bittersweet bow on the tragic story between her and her mother. She also reveals to you that the figure that has been looming over their hit-and-run relationship is Mythal, the elven god of love who once led the pantheon. Mythal is long dead, but her memories have transferred from host to host in the millennia since. Morrigan is the keeper of her memories now, and believes that if even a fraction of the old god were able to release Solas from all his regret, it might be enough to take him off this violent path. Morrigan’s epilogue is introspective and melancholy, but as she directs you to one of the last pieces of Mythal’s soul trapped in the fade, all that family drama is given some meaning. The conversation in which you try to convince Mythal to help you is one of the best in <em>The Veilguard</em>. It branches into multiple topics, giving you several footholds to perhaps convince her that your cause is just. Who your Rook is can play into how effective you are in making your case, and if you can’t persuade her, you can always fight her for her favor. Whatever route you choose, this is one of those moments in which you can feel <em>Dragon Age </em>history changing with every dialogue option you pick.</p></div><div><p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>’s final missions are a kind of greatest hits of BioWare’s best tricks. It’s got everything: unavoidable sacrifice, avoidable losses determined by whether or not you know your team well enough to assign them tasks befitting their talents, and a culmination of all the strategic relationships you’ve built with different factions. It might not be as interactive as <em>Mass Effect 2</em>’s Suicide Mission, but as a series of interlocking decisions bringing you to a myriad of mini conclusions, it far exceeds anything the studio has done in the past 20 years. I was nervous and shaking making those choices, and it’s all portrayed with a level of cinematic finesse that goes beyond anything BioWare’s done before.</p></div><div><p>When <em>The Veilguard </em>reaches its climax, it becomes clear that all the while, you’ve been caught in a battle of ideals between Varric’s hope and Solas’ cynicism. Rook has been a pawn (no pun intended) for Solas. The elf has been manipulating them the entire time in hopes of trapping them in the Fade and resuming his plan. He’s done this by projecting a vision of Varric who hypes Rook up until they can be cut off at the knees, falling into a state of regret so consuming it traps them within the spirit realm. Here, they’re guided by Varric through the prison until they discover the truth: Varric died at the beginning of the game, and Solas used his image to nudge Rook along the entire game.</p><p>The reveal is incredible because you realize BioWare pulled off a <em>Sixth Sense</em>. No one else speaks to Varric the entire game, but he’s placed naturally enough in each scene that you don’t really question that no one else responds to him. You realize that you’ve been fooled by Solas just as much as Rook has, and when they mourn their mentor’s loss, they’re effectively a stand-in for you, the <em>Dragon Age </em>fan. But as despondent as they might be, they still have a job to do, and Varric reminds them that they’ve done everything up to this point by themself. They don’t need Varric’s guidance. They already have everything they need.</p><p>As frustrated as I was with <em>The Veilguard</em>’s decision to leave the Inquisitor behind for a new protagonist, this twist was what made Rook work for me. The whole game essentially emerges from Varric betting on someone to finish the job he couldn’t. His belief in Rook is what keeps the game going, even as Solas tries to manipulate it to his own advantage. It may have been sad to watch Varric go from a city dwarf just trying to make it to a victim of Solas’ pride, but his belief in others lives on. </p></div><div><p>After four games, pretty much everything <em>Dragon Age </em>has ever been leads to one final conversation with Solas. The Veil is coming down, the rest of Thedas will be burned to ash in the aftermath, and the only way to stop it is for the trickster god himself to bind himself to it. No matter what you do, Solas will end up using his immortal life force to keep Thedas and the Fade separate. But the tenor of your decision still matters. You can knock him senseless and forcibly cast the blood magic spell to hold him there, you can trick him so his magic backfires and leave him helpless as you bind him to the Veil, or you can take the third option. Bringing Mythal’s essence out allows her to release him from her service, letting him lay down a lifetime of regret. It’s the culmination of learning all the secrets left in this world, and once you have all that understanding, it feels like the most appropriate way to cap off a cliffhanger whose resolution we’ve been awaiting for ten years.</p><p>After everything that’s happened to BioWare in the months following <em>The Veilguard</em>’s launch, what sticks out to me most is how much the game leans into finality. Closure is a key pillar of its storytelling, even if there are hints toward a sequel we may never get. And if this is the note we leave off on, I won’t be upset. I hope most of the team that was at BioWare at any point during the series’ development won’t be either.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The lead writer of the beloved RPG Fallout: New Vegas has returned to Obsidian, but those who are hoping to see a hypothetical New Vegas 2 are going to be disappointed. On his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrgonzalez/" rel="nofollow ">LinkedIn profile</a>, John Gonzalez posted that he's returned to Obsidian Entertainment in a new role as creative director. Under the entry for this job, he wrote the following: "Back to Obsidian for exciting times! (No, it's not FNV2.)"</p><p dir="ltr">Gonzalez is arguably best-known as one of the lead writers of New Vegas, but he's contributed to a number of other projects. As his LinkedIn shows, he served as narrative director on Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West at Guerrilla Games. He also worked on Tom Clancy's EndWar at Ubisoft and contributed lead narrative to Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Gonzalez is also working on a novel titled "God Mode: Single Player," which he describes as "the ultimate video game novel."</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's unclear what Gonzalez is working on at Obsidian, the studio has two currently announced projects. One is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-first-gameplay-trailer-debuts-during-the-game-awards/1100-6528439/" data-ref-id="1100-6528439">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, the sequel to one of the studio's biggest games, known for its signature sense of humor.

Avowed releases on February 18, 2025, while The Outer Worlds 2 is set to come out sometime in 2025.</p>

			<p>The sports game that everyone has been waiting for is finally going into Early Access on PC on March 20, 2025. Wreckfest 2, a title that will have extreme full-contact racing and chaos, will be bigger and better than ever. The developers stated that the physics engine has been significantly overhauled so that the crashes are more intense than ever and deeper component damage. Of course, there will be the iconic mayhem of the races that everyone loves, but now it's even more detailed than before. This title was one of the most highly anticipated racing and sports games in<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/"> our 2025 round-up</a>.</p>
<p>For those who want to see what they can expect from Wreckfest 2's Early Access period, make sure to check out the trailer below to see some of the adrenaline rushes you can experience in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Early Access Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z2PCl64qnng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>High-speed circuits make a return, and you'll even get to race and crash through a junkyard, which can make for some intense collisions. More than that, you'll also get to try and attempt some serious jumps, which can help you get ahead of the opponent while weaving through oncoming traffic at busy intersections. Compared to other racing games, Wreckfest 2 is a game where no rules apply, and it's every driver for themselves. You will be racing against up to 23 other players or AI drivers, depending on what you are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Instead of sparkly supercars to race through the tracks, the cars you choose will be patchwork jobs full of dents, rust, and broken parts to really add to the grime and grittiness of Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p>Early Access will continue to progress and add new content, and during this time, you'll be able to build your very own car from the ground up and turn it into a force to be reckoned with. There will be new cars added to the game, as well as other vehicles to come in the future as the game continues to develop and evolve.</p>
<p>Consumer feedback is essential to the developers during the Early Access period and will all be taken on board so that it can be refined and reshaped as needed during Early Access.</p>
<p>For those on PC and want to get stuck into Wreckfest 2, make sure to wishlist it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203190/Wreckfest_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> so you'll be notified when the game officially enters the Early Access period on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-execs-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlatinumGames founder and former CEO Hideki Kamiya has revealed that at least four more high-profile execs have quit the company, including the directors of hits like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a recent video on his YouTube channel (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-video-reveals-five-more-leads-have-quit-platinum-including-bayonetta-3s-director/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>), Kamiya includes a photograph of himself and five other individuals, labeling the picture as a "former PlatinumGames directors' drinking party".</p>

<p>As well as Kamiya himself, the photo also includes Yusuke Miyata, Kenji Saito, and Takahisa Taura, the directors of <i>Bayonetta 3</i>,&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Rising</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>, respectively. You can also spot&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta Origins</em>' Abebe Tinari, as well as character artist Masaki Yamanaka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=hhKATQvb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hideki-kamiya-platinumgames-directors-photo.jpg?itok=ygdronBD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several more folks appear to have left PlatinumGames.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC points out, Tinari already revealed his departure from PlatinumGames last month, but to the best of my knowledge, the departure of the other four from PlatinumGames is new.</p>

<p>Kamiya doesn't state in the video whether any of the folks in the photo have joined his new studio Clovers or whether they'll be moving on to other ventures within the gaming industry, although at the very least, it seems plausible that&nbsp;<em>Astral Chain</em>'s Taura is <a href="https://x.com/NSK29_0916/status/1869213824198599053" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting his own studio</a>.</p>

<p>In any case, these departures follow some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platinumgames-quietly-removes-all-mentions-of-project-gg-from-website" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rather odd changes</a> to PlatinumGames' website. A number of games, including titles like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/world-of-demons-delisted" rel="nofollow">now-delisted</a>&nbsp;<em>World of Demons</em>, and the previously-teased&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.</em>, have all been removed from the site's listings.</p>

<p>It seems the studio has removed games that are no longer available, which presumably also means&nbsp;<em>Project G.G.&nbsp;</em>has been canceled, although the fact that they're completely gone from PlatinumGames' list feels a touch like revisionist history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=U7B6A1Sy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/transformers-devastation-platinumgames.jpg?itok=FQKd5U6J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Delisted games like&nbsp;<em>Transformers: Devastation&nbsp;</em>have been removed from PlatinumGames' website.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Kamiya himself, after leaving PlatinumGames <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-explains-why-he-quit-platinumgames" rel="nofollow">back in 2023</a>, he's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">currently working on a sequel to&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/okami-2-hideki-kamiya" rel="nofollow">Okami</a>&nbsp;</em>with his new studio Clovers, which also has several ex-PlatinumGames staffers working for it.</p>

<p>The sequel is likely some way away from being released, but it's nice to know that Kamiya is getting to work on a project in which he'd <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideki-kamiya-would-like-to-make-new-viewtiful-joe-and-okami-games-comments-on" rel="nofollow">previously expressed interest</a>. Maybe now we can hope for that new&nbsp;<em>Viewtiful Joe&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>PlatinumGames, meanwhile, is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>alongside Team Ninja. The game was revealed during last month's Xbox Developer Direct and is set to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012110" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/ninja-gaiden-4/9p0sq1s72g4j" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/605811/infinity-nikki-gacha-mechanics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’ve been having a great time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a><em>. </em>I do my dailies, grind for materials, and desperately search for an outfit that works with the single ugliest piece of clothing in the game: a red vest. But as I’ve progressed, the game has given me — a gacha newbie — an unfortunate crash-course education on how these games really work and what not to do if you want to keep your sanity and your wallet intact.</p><p>The trouble began right before the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348535/infinity-nikki-firework-season-update-trailer-january-date">Lunar New Year event</a>, when I started obtaining every piece of a special outfit called Wings of Wishes. In <em>Infinity Nikki</em>, special outfits like Wings of Wishes are gated behind what’s called Resonance Events, which are essentially slot machines available for a limited time. When you spend currency in the game, you’re not buying outfits outright; you’re paying to “pull” the lever on that slot machine in hopes that it’ll spit out the pieces you want. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>This is the best I can do styling this hideous red vest. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Throughout the month Wings of Wishes was available, I managed to earn eight of its nine pieces, even though I wasn’t really trying to get it. And as the event wound down, I was confident that even if I ran out of currency, I’d simply earn enough back for the final piece. But once I exhausted all the story and event quests, I learned that the game does not reward currency at a pace that can keep up with even casual, intermittent pulling. I went from earning enough to pull 10 or 20 times a week down to four or five times. It was like that <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/when-you-get-paid-biweekly">paycheck meme</a>, where, in the first week after you get paid, you’re eating steak and caviar for dinner, but by the second, you’re having ice soup. It got so dire that, by the end of the event, I started spending money hoping I’d pull the last piece, but I never did. </p><p>I was crushed, not only for obvious reasons but also because playing this game wasn’t supposed to change my spending habits. And I learned through consulting with my gacha veteran friends and the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit that I made the rookiest of mistakes in thinking I could outsmart a game engineered to part me from my money in ways I wouldn’t really notice or feel. </p><p>Gacha games have a poor reputation because of the way they can exploit players to extract their money. I got got because I thought I was above that, not realizing the game had already tapped into my FOMO and my wallet. Nothing, not even Wings of Wishes, was ever so desirable that it was worth focusing on. It only became a focus when I realized I needed <em>one more piece</em> right before the event ended. On top of that, I never noticed my spending. I wasn’t concerned because I wasn’t dropping $30–$50, but I was spending two dollars, three dollars, 99 cents, two and three times a day, because again, all I needed was <em>one more piece</em>. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>I spent so much money I didn’t intend trying to complete this Wings of Wishes outfit that I don’t even like!</em></figcaption></p></div><p>True blue gacha veterans will tell you that if there’s something you want, be prepared to either pay for it or plan for it. Players who don’t want to spend money for outfits skip two and three events in a row, hoarding their currency, waiting for the right outfit to spend their entire warchest on all for free. On the other hand, if a player wants to pay for an outfit, they know to be prepared to spend bill money for it. Pulling is the same as working a slot machine: you’re not guaranteed to hit. But <em>Infinity Nikki</em> guarantees a high-value piece every 10 pulls. With the currency used for pulls going for a dollar apiece, a nine-piece outfit like Wings of Wishes will run you at least $90. That amount goes up dramatically because the guarantee is for <em>any</em> high-value piece, and Resonance Events often contain <em>multiple</em> high-value outfits that have anywhere between eight and 10 pieces.</p><p>I understand that my problems likely don’t extend to the majority of other players. From perusing the game’s subreddit, I get the feeling most people either already understand the level of preparation required to obtain coveted clothing effectively, don’t mind spending eye-watering sums, or are content to either engage with the system casually or ignore it altogether. I planned on being the latter, someone who tossed the developers a few bucks here and there to obtain the occasional outfit I fancied.</p><div id=":R52rarr6:"><p><figcaption><em>Anyway, these are much better outfits.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And in my naivete, I assumed that’s how gacha games worked. You could either grind out the resources you needed or spend money only when you chose to for items you wanted. Yes, I understood there were elements of random chance to compete against, but I genuinely thought that I could guarantee myself the desired outfits through a mix of casual play and light spending. I will not make that mistake again. Thankfully, the current Lunar New Year event doesn’t have any premium outfits I want. Plus, the ones being given away for free are more than cute enough to soothe my sartorial spirit. </p><p>The real tragedy of all this is that I don’t even like how Wings of Wishes looks. I only wanted it for its special ability to make Nikki’s floating animation look like she’s gliding on a magical paper crane. I have multiple substitutes for the white stockings I’m missing, so I can easily complete the look. But without that final piece, the outfit’s ability won’t trigger, and I don’t like it enough to wear it casually. So it’ll sit, incomplete and unworn, in my wardrobe, possibly forever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Warhorse's medieval muck-o-rama <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> launches today. It's an engrossing RPG, despite developer co-founder Dan Vávra's tendency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gamergator-rhetoric-of-historical-accuracy-has-come-back-to-bite-kingdom-come-on-the-arse">throw his weight behind alt-right harassment campaigns</a>. Also, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pc-performance-best-settings">a relatively bug-free one</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In the course of my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review-a-bastard-for-all-seasons">51 hours as reviewer</a>, I've encountered only a smattering of more significant technical issues. Firstly, some heavy slowdown while roaming Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of the opening Bohemian Paradise region, which I resolved by quitting and reloading. Secondly, a mildly terrifying moment in a dugout when a wounded soldier I was supposed to be treating struck a T-pose, as though afflicted by lightning early onset arthritis. And thirdly a repeated crash bug which I feel warrants its own article given that, together with Deliverance 2's eccentric saving system, it cost me several hours of progress.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
My game started to crash frequently following a larger patch before the review embargo, about halfway through my playthrough. The simulation would lock up in the menus, when using the photo mode, and sometimes during exploration. After some trial and error, I deduced that this had to do with my controller cable connection being a little loose. KCD2 does not, in my experience, like it when you appear to be switching rapidly between mouse-and-keyboard and a controller. After switching to a new cable, I was able to make headway without much further trouble.
</p>
<p>
The bug cost me hours of progress not because it wiped or corrupted saves, but because it formed a devil's partnership with Deliverance 2's interestingly fussy, hydra-headed approach to saving. As in the first game, you can checkpoint your progress by drinking an in-game alcoholic beverage, Saviour Schnapps. As Brendy observed to me during edits, it's a fun bit of Ye Olde Meta Commentary that openly positions quicksaving as a vice. 
</p><p>
It's not quite as inconvenient as it sounds: I stumbled on fresh batches of Saviour Schnapps regularly during quests, and you can always brew it yourself from nettles, which grow all over the place, and belladonna, which is found in forest clearings. What's more, apothecaries like the one in Trosky village buy the stuff for decent money, so you can turn a quick profit while stocking up. A single dose of Saviour Schnapps will render you merry (with associated stat buffs) but not absolutely plimsolled, so it shouldn't interfere with your exploits providing you're not the kind to hit F5 at the slightest whiff of peril. 
</p>
<p>
The trouble with Saviour Schnapps is simply that Warhorse try to have their cake and eat it. If the idea is to teach you to weigh the prospect of failure properly, by making quicksaving more of a ritual, this is undercut by the fact that the game <em>does</em> checkpoint after certain quest milestones. As such, it's easy to forget the need to toss back a schnapps now and then. Stir that inconsistency together with a persistent crashing problem, and you have a spicy cocktail I like to call The 11pm Shrieker.
</p>
<p>
Again, this is the only genuinely severe technical problem I've discovered in KCD2. The issue with loose controller connections may have been patched out by the time I read this. Still, you might want to check your USB ports, just in case. For more advice about drinking in moderation, here's Ollie's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-save">guide to saving in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>.
