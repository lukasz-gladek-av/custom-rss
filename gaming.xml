            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-helldivers-community-is-coping-with-a-spotlight-it-doesn%E2%80%99t-want.1297581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Yesterday was an interesting day for the Helldivers community.” That’s the very obvious understatement that announced the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nfso8x/please_read_rhelldivers_has_been_reopened_a/">reopening</a> of the Helldivers gaming subreddit in the small hours of Saturday morning. On Friday it was discovered that Tyler Robinson, arrested for the alleged killing of Charlie Kirk, had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/777313/charlie-kirks-alleged-killer-scratched-bullets-with-a-helldivers-combo-and-a-furry-sex-meme">inscribed messages</a> on the casings of several bullets found at the crime scene. One of those read “Hey fascist! Catch!” accompanied by an up arrow symbol, a right arrow, and three down arrows, a reference to the code to call down the <a href="https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/Eagle_500kg_Bomb">500KG Bomb stratagem</a> in the cooperative shooter<em> Helldivers 2</em>.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, within minutes the official <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/">subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777614/discord-charlie-kirk-shooting-tyler-robinson">Discord</a> servers were thrown into chaos. Moderators quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nf6g7e/rhelldivers_is_locked_temporarily_requests_to/">locked</a> the Helldivers subreddit, pointing to a high number of posts that violated its rule against “Real-World Political Discussions.” Similarly, references to Robinson, Kirk, or the 500KG Bomb stratagem were quickly deleted on the Discord server, and some users speculated the code had been flagged for autodeletion. (Arrowhead Game Studios, makers of the Helldivers series, hasn’t released a public statement about the incident and didn’t respond to a request for comment.) Users merely asking why the subreddit was locked were shut down — “We are not allowed to discuss, I would suggest looking elsewhere,” one user was told.</p><p>Online and in conversations with <em>The Verge</em>, Helldivers fans mostly seemed confused and a little concerned about what might come along with all of this sudden attention. “I just don’t want to see a community I love get slandered to no fault of their own,” one Discord user, Inferionix, wrote.</p><p>Helldivers is hardly the first piece of media tied to an act of violence; the Columbine High School shooting famously put an unwelcome spotlight on <em>Doom</em> as commentators searched for a meaning behind the attack. But Kirk’s slaying inspired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/politics/776293/charlie-kirk-maga-influencer-violence">widespread calls for retaliatory violence</a> by Republicans, making the still-ongoing search for Robinson’s motive particularly high-stakes. Even discussing it is risky, as lawmakers and right-wing tycoon Elon Musk are surveilling social media to police social media users’ <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/776840/charlie-kirk-death-social-media-jawboning">responses to Kirk’s death</a>, demanding firings at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777664/elon-musk-charlie-kirk-satya-nadella-fire">employers including Microsoft</a>. The subreddit mods said in their reopening post that nobody was banned during the initial flood of shooting-related comments, but anyone who discusses it in the future will be.</p><p>One brief bastion where fans of the game could share their feelings was the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/helldivers2/">Helldivers 2</a> subreddit, which doesn’t have the same strict ban on real life political discussions. A megathread there, at least for a while, was filled mostly was fans marveling at just how surreal the situation was. “Waking up and hearing a sitting governor of the United States say ‘Notices bulge OwO whats this?’ was a goddamn flashbang,” Reddit user Snaxwheels wrote, referring to one of the other, non-Helldivers-related inscriptions. But eventually that thread was also removed after moderators felt it had gotten out of hand.</p><p>Some posters there expressed concern that the attention could reignite the culture war around violent video games. One even pointed out that RFK Jr. had recently revived a largely dismissed theory <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/watch-kennedy-says-nih-is-studying-possible-causes-of-u-s-gun-violence">linking violent games to school shootings</a>. Isadora, an active community member who spoke with <em>The Verge</em>, was more dubious. “Givin [sic] the short news cycles and the fact that such a large portion of MAGAs youth base are among the [conservative games streamer] Asmongold/gamergate type I don’t see the admin and its media machine coming super hard against the game itself.”</p><p>One outstanding question is what — if anything — Robinson thought about Helldiver’s politics. The series, which draws from Robert Heinlein’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> and Paul Verhoeven’s film adaptation, is a satire where players take the role of brainwashed military grunts fighting to spread “managed democracy” for a quasi-fascist Super Earth government. Isadora calls the gameplay the biggest draw, but “its politics is what made me fall in love with it,” they said. “I’m a big Paul Verhoeven fan and <em>Starship Troopers</em> was one of my favorites.”</p><p>As with other satires on authoritarianism, like <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, there’s a persistent discussion about <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/helldivers-2-fascism-satire-debate-rcna140653">whether some players get the joke</a>. Isadora, largely, thinks they do. “I’m sad that this community has been drug into this as I think the game’s ironic criticism of fascism is a great outlet for so many people,” they told <em>The Verge</em>. “It reflects negatively on a community that largely understands the criticisms it lays out.”<br>Helldivers will almost certainly go down as a footnote in Kirk’s death. But for some players, the strangeness of using the 500KG Bomb combo — or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dnnzys/for_democracy/">having it as a tattoo</a> — might linger. One Redditor suggested starting a petition to encourage Arrowhead to change the button command. Most disagreed, littering his message with thumbs down and big red X reactions. “Please don’t bring it here,” said the only reply.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjA5MzU0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Terrence O'Brien</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/777738/helldivers-community-reddit-discord-charlie-kirk]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/miyamoto-explains-how-super-mario-bros-world-1-1-was-created</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/miyamoto-explains-how-super-mario-bros-world-1-1-was-created.1297578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">World 1-1. We’ve all run, jumped, and brick-bashed our way through that familiar first stage. It seems so simple and second-nature to us now, but in this modern age of iterative entertainment, it is almost impossible to convey the magnitude of the leap Super Mario Bros. represented compared to everything that came before it. That cabinet, that game, might as well have descended from outer space. Its art, music, smoothness, and most of all, its level design were light-years beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World 1-1 introduced game design principles and a geometry of motion so perfectly calculated that it endures as one of the great works of the art form to this very day. But how was this miracle performed? Well, let us tell you, with the help of its creator, Shigeru Miyamoto.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The closest things to the opening level of the plumber’s first solo adventure up to that point were the stiff-but-serviceable screen-flipping Pitfall! and the gorgeous but terrible side-scrolling Pac-Land. Both were early essays on game design: Pitfall! presented a two-layered jungle with plenty of enemies and obstacles to jump over, but its flip-screen progression, huge non-linear map, strict time limit, and unintuitive treasure placement made it feel more like a puzzle to solve than a world to explore. Pac-Land was simply beautiful to behold and scrolled fairly cleanly in one direction, but the layout of the levels was haphazard and frustrating, and the controls felt maddening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In comparison, Mario was like exploring a realized, unified, and diverse world. Every step revealed new threats and sights. Leap over enemies or land on them? What’s in those question blocks? There’s a Starman?! Wait, hidden lives? A secret underground treasure room with its own music?! Wait, there’s a FIRE FLOWER?! You can hold B to run or blast turtles with pyrotechnics?! What even is this game????? But in order for all of this madness to be built, it first needed solid foundations, and that’s where World 1-1 really comes into its own — teaching you the basics in the most elegant manner possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Bros. isn’t nearly as big as it feels. In fact, World 1-1 measures only about 15 screens, including the underground room. It feels much bigger because over two or three screens, the tone of the terrain changes, from the intro section to leaping over pipes to platforming to pits. And yet within that tiny space, you have every power-up in the game, a hidden multi-coin block, a pair of traversable pipes, an invisible 1-UP, two enemy varieties, and a secret fireworks display.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-1-1757588267401.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">But perhaps the biggest secret of 1-1 is that it’s a school. And the course is Mario 101. In a 2015 interview with Eurogamer, Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka talked about the extraordinary degree of thought that went into the design, beginning with World 1-1’s iconic opening: a tiny Mario facing an empty plane. Then the team considered how to teach the player several skills at once: how to avoid enemies, how to destroy enemies, how question blocks work, and how to tell an enemy Goomba from a helpful mushroom. All three are accomplished within the first steps of this opening level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If a suspicious enemy appears,” states Miyamoto, “the player will need to jump over it.” Running forward into the first Goomba just kills you, a lesson a player need only learn once before discovering they’re much safer in the air. Then moving forward, the player discovers some low bricks and question blocks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we have a question block, they might just try to tap that as well,” continues Miyamoto. “If they see a coin, it will make them happy and they’ll want to try again.” Tapping the second block releases a mushroom that slides away, then bounces off a pipe to come hurtling at the character. The low ceiling makes it very hard to avoid, and the mushroom hits Mario, but instead of damaging him, it transforms him into <em>Super</em> Mario. In a matter of seconds, you’ve learned how both rewards and dangers work through the rest of Super Mario Bros.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-2-1757588280610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“We kept simulating what the player would do”, Miyamoto explains. “So even within that one section, the player would understand the general concept of what Mario is supposed to be and what the game is about.” Even small details mattered. The opening screen’s first enemy was supposed to be a Koopa Troopa, but teaching the player the jump and kick movement necessary to overcome one worked less well at the beginning than they’d hoped. So they invented the simple-to-stomp Goomba (late in the game design process, according to Tetzuka) to help players understand the basics first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another valuable lesson, holding B to run before a long jump, is taught safely by two gaps later in 1-1. Pointing at this area, Miyamoto says, “Here we are preparing the player for the B-Dash”. He notes that the first gap is a pit with a filled-in bottom, a safe place to experiment and learn about long jumps without risking lives. This jump is followed immediately by a nearly-identical variant, a pit where, if the player falls, they will die, but by applying the skills they’ve just learned, they will easily survive. “By doing that, we wanted the player to naturally and gradually understand what they’re doing”, he continues. “The first course was designed for that purpose: so they can learn what the game is all about.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once the player realizes what they need to do, it becomes their game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyamoto further explains that the tutorial nature of early stages usually comes only after the team has crafted more sophisticated levels, so the creators know what skills the players need to develop. “Usually when we have a really fun course, they tend to be the later levels”, Miyamoto confirms. “World 2-1, World 2-2, we create those first and then afterwards come back and create World 1-1. There’s a lot of testing whilst the game is being built. I don’t give them (players) any explanation and just watch them play and see how they do it, and most of the time I think they’ll play a certain way or enjoy a certain part, and they end up not doing that. I think ‘That's not what I intended!’ So I have to go back and use that as feedback”.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The intricately crafted layout creates a satisfying illusion of choice and a constant curve of advancement. Miyamoto sums it up perfectly: “Once the player realizes what they need to do, it becomes their game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Super Mario Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The level layout is tuned to match Mario’s famous momentum, allowing a skilled player to perform precise jumps, slides, and combinations. An experienced Mario jockey can run forward at the beginning 1-1, squash a Goomba while hitting the first mushroom block, sprint forward, hit a coin block, reverse direction, jump up, catch the mushroom before it hits the ground, and hit the other coin. The team wisely mapped run and fireball to the same button, creating a slight degree of real-world physical dexterity challenge to trading momentum for projectiles. Likewise, the need to hold B to run and press A to jump made long jumps just slightly and satisfyingly more difficult.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the music. Unlike most software development teams, the Mario team’s composer, Koji Kondo, was embedded with the developers. The famous Mario theme was composed and edited over and over as the level layout changed to match the pace of the design, and from then on, those few bars of digitized score would never leave our brains again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And all of this magic was achieved using only the most limited of tools back in 1985. To really understand why Super Mario Bros. works so well, you first need to understand how the NES renders graphics. The animated characters that move around the screen, such as Mario, are sprites, detailed and mobile clusters of pixels. The NES can only handle a few sprites onscreen at a time, so most of the rest of the world, including the ground, platforms, hills, and backgrounds, is made up of tiles and 8x8 blocks. Most of the objects you see in Super Mario Bros. are composed of these chunks. The question blocks, walls, and bricks are all made up of four combined 8x8 tiles, creating distinct 16x16 squares. It’s similar to the process used to build levels in Mario Maker, only more granular. These little tiles were the tools that Shigeru Miyamoto and team worked with to build a masterpiece.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/11/mario-4-1757588404839.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Mario Bros is an early NES game, created before advanced memory map chips stretched its graphical capabilities. That meant that to achieve their vision, the Mario team had to push the hardware to the absolute limits of its capabilities. The entirety of Super Mario Bros.’ source code is 40K. That means the entire game, including graphics, fits on about thirteen closely-typed pages. Crammed into that space are 32 distinct worlds, eight boss battles, a second quest, myriad secrets, and a memorable cast of characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That restriction meant the design team had to make every bit count, and that led to all kinds of clever tricks to save space. Ever noticed the clouds and the bushes are just the same palette-swapped tiles? Or that the blocks in 1-2 are just recolored blocks from 1-1? Both tricks (and many others) were used to compress space and make room for more features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Add together the level design, gorgeous visuals, perfect controls, and iconic music, and you have a game that transcends the tropes of older action games. Super Mario Bros. took levels and made them worlds. And Mario just went on from there. World 1-1 to 1-2. An underground kingdom. Then later, forests. Castles. Bridges. Under oceans. Worlds upon worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But none would exist without that very first. Hell, it's arguable that video games as they exist now wouldn’t be a thing if it weren’t for World 1-1. From the most meagre of pixelated tools, Miyamoto and the team at Nintendo crafted a miracle, and one that’s still as fun to play today as it was 40 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jared Petty likes writing about how wonderful and silly video games are.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Is &quot;Acting To Protect The Industry&quot; - Ex-Capcom Staffer Defends Switch 2 Game Key Cards 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f0bc44a267aea/nintendo-is-acting-to-protect-the-industry-ex-capcom-staffer-defends-switch-2-game-key-cards-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Since Switch 2 launched, one of the hottest topics has been Game Key Cards – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-switch-2-game-key-cards-somehow-manage-to-make-codes-in-a-box-worse">physical items which unlock digital downloads</a>.</p>
<p>Critics have said Game Key Cards are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">anti-consumer</a>, and Japan's National Library has since decreed that they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/japans-national-library-says-game-key-cards-are-not-eligible-for-preservation">cannot be considered eligible for preservation,</a> which stands to reason, as the Game Key Card contains no actual game data.</p>
<p>However, a Ubisoft staffer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">recently explained</a> that one reason developers are choosing Game Key Cards is access speed. More recently, composer and former Capcom developer Masakazu Sugimori has waded into the debate on Nintendo's side (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendos-game-key-cards-and-pricing-are-not-about-greed-ex-capcom-dev-argues-they-are-acting-to-protect-the-industry/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/m_sugimori/status/1965252381219901629">Speaking on social media</a>, Sugimori argues that physical items don't have the longevity of digital ones:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Do physical items outside of digital products last forever? Most of the time, they don’t, right? Physical things always have a lifespan and will eventually break. Digital products, on the other hand, generally don’t have a lifespan."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Others would argue that digital items only last as long as they're available online, and we've seen many quite recent games <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2024/12/psa-xboxs-forza-horizon-4-will-be-delisted-in-less-than-one-week">removed from circulation by publishers</a> – which shoots a hole in Sugimori's debate somewhat. However, he has a point; if digital games were made available forever, then they would certainly outlast physical games, which can be subject to wear and tear.</p>

<p>Sugimori also claims that Nintendo's Game Key Cards are also a measure "against illegal copying", as the data cannot be extracted from the cartridge and distributed online (it can still be extracted from the storage of the console it is downloaded to, of course). It also reduces the risk of Nintendo and other publishers holding excess inventory and potentially losing a lot of revenue, as Game Key Cards are far cheaper to manufacture.</p>
<p>"I feel that these moves are largely aimed at protecting the gaming industry and the digital entertainment industry," he concludes. "It might be a bit too optimistic of a view, but the fact is that because Nintendo takes the lead, other companies can more easily follow suit to protect themselves."</p>
<p>Greed is often cited as one of the main reasons for the Game Key Card initiative, but Sugimori disagrees on this point. "Do you think a company that’s already made that much profit would do this just to make even more money? Even if they stopped selling anything right now, they have enough cash reserves to support all their current employees until retirement (It’s so incredible it’s almost ridiculous)."</p>
<p>Sugimori composed music for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ace_attorney_anthology">Ace Attorney</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/viewtiful_joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> series during his tenure at Capcom, and left the company in 2007 alongside Atsushi Mori, Kento Hasegawa and Masato Kouda to form DesignWave.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest surprise of the recent Direct was Nintendo's Virtual Boy announcement for the Switch Online service.</p>
<p>If that wasn't already enough for one week, the developer behind the indie sensation <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/antonblast">Antonblast</a> has now timed in its own announcement with this news, revealing it will be adding a dedicated 'VB mode' in the title's next major update.</p>
<p>Here's the official rundown about this, along with how you'll be able to activate this mode:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Summitsphere:</strong> "<em>AND</em>, we are very proud to announce that we are adding a VB mode in the next major <em>ANTONBLAST</em> update. You will be able to play the game in this mode by purchasing the Virtual Visor from Brulo's for a measly 770,000 casino chips. You can then turn it on and off at any time by accessing the "Goodies" menu from your pause screen. ...wait, what?"</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FLqacb9dotM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FLqacb9dotM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4fd535ywrukl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLqacb9dotM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I would not call the time I’m having with<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769489/hollow-knight-silksong-news-updates">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> </em>“fun,” and yet I’m still playing.</p><p>In the depths of The Marrow, the second major area of <em>Silksong</em>, there’s a particularly nasty midboss. I eventually beat him, but my reward wasn’t a new ability, item, or a bench where I could rest and save my progress. All I got was pain, suffering, and death. In <em>Silksong</em>, the only way out is through, but the “through” is a tunnel lined with spikes that occasionally spew gouts of flame.</p><p>I should have given up right then and there, but I have not abandoned <em>Silksong </em>the same way I do other unfun games. For the life of me, I couldn’t figure out why I didn’t just put <em>Silksong</em> down and chalk it up as another “not for me” game the way <em>Hollow Knight</em> just wasn’t for me. I enjoy Metroidvanias a great deal — <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> was one of my favorite games of last year. And for <em>Silksong</em>, I wanted to try Team Cherry’s work again and see if it would finally click. It has, and it’s because of the community (and a <em>lot </em>of spite).</p><p>I came to <em>Hollow Knight</em> late, long after the buzz about it had left my social media circle. With <em>Silksong</em>, I’m playing it at the same time as everyone else. My social media feed is full of people who love the game much more than I do, posting tips, commiserating about its moments of bullshit (hello, lantern fruit pogo platforming), and gushing over the adorable Sherma.</p><div><p><sub>“I have only known Sherma <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ive-only-had-arlo-for-a-day-and-a-half">for a day and a half</a>…”</sub></p></div><p>When I post lamenting the game’s bullshit, I get excited messages from my friends giving me advice on what I should do next. It’s like we’re all doing our own personal let’s plays together while being in each other’s chats. It feels good. I am not alone in my misery, and better yet, I’ve got friends to help. For <em>Silksong</em> it’s worked in such a way that’s kept me playing longer than I would have if I were going this alone.</p><p>This kind of collective, collaborative gaming experience has also taught me a new trick: taking a break. I’ve never been the kind of gamer that stops playing when I can’t overcome an obstacle. I either do something else in the game or keep running at my problem until I figure it out. Now, when I feel myself getting even the slightest bit mad because I was so close (or I <em>thought</em> I was so close) to surmounting a challenge, I turn off the game and come back later. It’s so silly that, once again, the “touch grass” people are right, but the strategy has gotten me through some of the game’s most egregious moments. (If the vendor Shakra wants to leave her post in Greymoor because of something I did, that’s fine. But taking her bench with her that’s in a room <em>right before a brutal combat gauntlet</em> is a unique and dastardly flavor of <em>Silksong</em> bullshit.)</p><p>And when I overcome that bullshit, I get this incredible frisson of thrill. When I easily beat a boss in fewer tries than I’m used to, I feel godly. I’m actually quite tickled to hear Team Cherry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/774277/silksongs-first-patch-boss-difficulty">is working to nerf some of the early bosses</a>, because those were fine. (It’s the damn pogo platforming!)</p><p>I’m pretty sure I’m going to finish <em>Silksong </em>and whatever I feel at the end of that journey will be more like relief than joy. <em>Silksong</em> has shown me I don’t need to feel “happiness” or “joy” to continue playing a game. I just want to feel something — even if that something is pure spite.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/777653/silksong-impressions-team-cherry-metroidvania-sherma-is-cool]]></content:encoded>

<p>The upcoming release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> got a little bit more time in the spotlight during the latest Direct.</p>
<p>Apart from the title's Switch 2 box art, it's also been revealed Japan will be getting a special "Treasure Box" release featuring all sorts of goodies. This retails for 17,780 Yen and comes with not only the game, but also a scarf, cloth poster, acrylic standee, keychain, and two clear sheets. Here's a look, <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal/status/1966628191445152079">courtesy of Nintendeal on social media</a>:</p>

<p>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment launches exclusively for the Switch 2 on 6th November 2025. This title will also support 2-player splitscreen and GameShare (meaning you can even battle alongside someone on the original Switch). Will you be joining the fight on release? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For a while now, I have been yearning to play The Order of Giants DLC for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As you probably remember if you've read my review of the base game, I loved the original experience that launched late last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rating the game 9 out of 10</a>:</p>



<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, the game received widespread critical and fan acclaim, although its late release prevented it from attempting to win prizes at Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards. It is only natural that many players, myself included, have been looking forward to the story DLC, which was known to be on the way even before the base game's launch. </p>



<p>Its focus on The Order of Giants felt on point, too, as that was definitely one of the core mysteries from Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that fans wanted to learn more about. However, what we got left me quite a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong: most of the things that were great in the base game can be found here, too, such as the gameplay and especially the puzzles, which are even more complex this time around. The problem is that, despite being billed by the developers in <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-the-order-of-giants-dlc-qa-people-just-wanted-more-everything-is-freshly-built/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my Gamescom 2025 interview</a> as a 'story-driven DLC', The Order of Giants completely fails in this regard. Not only is the narrative thread extremely thin, but it also does not provide much in the way of answers, and, worse yet, it ends with a whimper, so much so that most players will inevitably get slack-jawed, and not in a good way, when the DLC's logo flashes right after the only boss fight of The Order of Giants.</p>



<p>That boss fight is pretty good, and there is a (predictable) plot twist before that, but it's just all too short and not that meaningful to the overall experience. I'm saying this from the perspective of someone who played the game at launch (before, in fact) and returned specifically for it, but I am pretty sure the same could largely be said for people who played the DLC as if it were one of the various side content pieces available in the game. Even from that perspective, The Order of Giants would inevitably feel weak compared to the rest of the content. The DLC barely manages to properly introduce the Cult of Mithras before it's all over. It had potential, that's for sure, but it should have been fleshed out in much greater depth.</p>



<p>Even the promise of entering Rome proper, as exciting as it sounded (especially as an Italian), is essentially betrayed by the fact that you'll spend most of the time in the Cloaca Maxima, Rome's ancient sewer system. Sure, venturing into sewers makes sense for such a game, but failing to add some actual monuments and streets seems like a wasted opportunity.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The best reason to play The Order of Giants is, honestly, to bask once again in the game's excellent visuals, which have been enhanced even further since I last played. Indeed, back then, neither path tracing nor NVIDIA DLSS Ray Reconstruction were available, and that's not everything. A prior update added ray traced local lights, which ensure that ray traced shadows include all light sources, increasing their quality especially in interiors. This update, on the other hand, introduced <a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-hair-coming-september-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RTX Hair</a>, a feature that takes advantage of the LSS (linear swept spheres) primitive available on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards to render hair in a much more realistic fashion. The improvement is obvious, though since this is mostly a first-person game, you'll only notice it during cutscenes - and there aren't many of those in the DLC. Again, </p>



<p>Overall, the game looks simply magnificent. Even more important is that it runs nearly flawlessly, too, a testament to MachineGames and their MOTOR engine (derived from the idTech 7). Worry not about the stuttering, for there is practically none here. </p>



<p>So, I would still highly recommend getting Indiana Jones and the Great Circle if you haven't already, but I cannot do the same with The Order of Giants DLC, at least not until it can be purchased for a lower price than the current $19.99.</p>

<p>Operation Brawl</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Operation C - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b0a2de4b1ae51/operation-c-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well howdy y'all, and welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/forsaken">Forsaken</a> for the N64, which yes, we'll admit wasn't the most inspiring duo of box art designs. Nevertheless, North America managed to seal the deal with 59% of the vote. Well done!</p>
<p>This week, we're going back to the Game Boy to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/operation_c">Operation C</a>, otherwise known as <strong>Probotector</strong> in Europe. Released in 1991, the name was actually supposed to stand for 'Operation Commando', supposedly due to the connection to the Iran-Contra affair in the late '80s.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6wumqig&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>This is a full-on three-way brawl, so let's get to it.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:5506 @ 1757871627 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Operation C - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3fd9d085680fa/operation-c-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17222-operation-cen-64/1821-harvest-moon13-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Konami / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a classic Contra-style box art design, showcasing some badass action in which a giant sodding scorpion is being shot at. We love the comic book-style artwork, and it's just such an engaging piece of work. Lovely.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Probotector - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a07fa48d5cef0/probotector-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17222-operation-caken-641-harvest-moonils/6413-chibi-robo-park-patrol">Konami / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Europe changed the game to Probotector, we get a good look at the robots in question. Again, the art style is pretty cool, but the composition arguably isn't quite as cool as North America's.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Operation C - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9f4fd594a766d/operation-c-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/17222-operation-c">Konami / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Japan's approach features a central character that definitely looks like the iconic action star Arnold Schwarzenegger. It's a cool image, and we actually love the white background; it really makes the image stand out nicely.</p>

            <p>
You might not think of it as one, but Wikipedia is a game. It has untold numbers of characters and stories, each page an interactive slate with your mouse and hand acting as the choice maker for what you learn next, thus impacting your following choices. This is, admittedly, a bit of a wanky, thinkpiecey way of talking about Wikipedia, so instead of that let's talk about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neurocracy">Neurocracy</a>, a game that could quite easily fool you into thinking it is another version of Wikipedia.
</p>
<p>
It first launched a couple of years ago now, in 2023, and started its third season earlier this year. In fact, its final episode for season three is coming next week on September 17th, so now seems like a pretty good time to get started with diving into it.
</p>

</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPwWYRQUQso" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
There is is no main character in Neurocracy so to speak, other than you, and you are browsing <a href="https://omnipedia.app/wiki/2049/10/09/Main_Page">Omnipedia</a>, a very real but still fictitious website you can head to right now to view everything, though the full version of the game has a virtual conspiracy pin board you can use to unravel the mystery with - we'll come back to that.
</p><p>
Omnipedia, according to its in-world description, is an "English-language online encyclopedia founded by internet entrepreneur Tony Hsiung in June 2049. Intended as “a general reference work and trusted source of information,” Hsiung initially conceived of Omnipedia as a successor to Wikipedia, which was discontinued in 2048." 
</p>
<p>
We've already learned a few things here - that we're a good couple of decades into the future, and Wikipedia is dead. Gathering bits of information like that is the name of the game, though you're after juicier pieces than that, as there's a murder mystery to be solved. As you find actually useful pieces of information, within the full version of the game you can add particular links and bits of text to build this conspiracy for yourself.
</p>
<p>
I've only dipped my toe into Neurocracy's world, it's impressively expansive, though it does feel like the kind of thing you should add to slowly, with only the occasional day of falling through the rabbit hole here and there.
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, Neurocracy's third and final season wraps up next week, September 17th, but you can pick it up on <a href="https://pyrofoux.itch.io/neurocracy">Itch.io</a> now to start getting yourself ready for it.

            <p>
Getting your game a publishing deal has never been an easy thing to do. Right now, it's especially hard given that for many publishers, if it doesn't seem like a guaranteed hit, it likely isn't something they'll take on. This is something that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/poncle">Poncle</a>, or rather the actual person, Luca Galante, takes great issue with, and in a recent interview he spoke more broadly of his issues with publishers, and his thoughts on now being one.
</p>
<p>
"I see a lot of publishers I don't like, and I think that's my way to define what a good publisher should be, probably," Galante explained to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/i-see-a-lot-of-publishers-i-dont-like-vampire-survivors-creator-made-his-own-publisher-to-share-the-luck-and-says-too-many-companies-try-to-exploit-the-platforms-just-to-make-money/">GamesRadar</a>. "I see a lot of publishers that try to exploit the platforms just to make money, basically, because the video game industry is very obviously an industry that makes a lot of money. There is a lot of money to make. I see that these publishers will try and just exploit platforms for money."
</p>
<p>
He went on to note how there are publishers who will put out simply incomplete games, or early access games that never get finished, and that for him, "what a publisher should do is, first of all, make genuine games, genuine products, something that has some real value, and then understand that not everything can be a breakout hit." Galante also spoke of the importance of post-launch support, and for him this is "definitely a big thing from my point of view that publishers should be able to offer."
</p>
<p>
As of now, Poncle has published two games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a> or Die, a beat 'em up where you have to mash your keyboard to beat enemies, and Kill the Brickman, a Brick Breaker-esque, turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> game, both of which are cheap as chips (£3 and £4 respectively).
</p><p>
It's these kinds of affordable games with smaller teams that Galante wants to lean towards in publishing, and in particular his priority is to find devs "that are very transparent in what they do, they want to talk with their community, and they have a real, genuine passion for making games." Not only that, it's important to him that these devs get to realise their vision by enriching it, as opposed to forcing in things like microtransactions or season passes.
</p>
<p>
Galante is, perhaps most importantly, fully aware with how lucky he got with Vampire Survivors, and that's why he wants to publish other games. "We definitely made some mistakes when it comes to putting the game out there, but we learned a lot, and wanted to try to sort of share what we learned with other indies. It was a way to try and give something back to the indie community, share the luck." Good luck indeed! At this point in time, every dev needs every ounce of the stuff they can get.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For a long time, the word “Nintendo” was synonymous with video games, and Nintendo has always been shorthand for Mario. The Japanese console mainstay has published dozens of platformers starring the overall-loving plumber since his original debut in 1981’s <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and we’re here to tell you which ones are the worst and best.</p> <p><em> This ranking was originally published on March 31, 2023. We are re-publishing it today in honor of the 40th anniversary of the </em>Super Mario Bros.<i> series.&nbsp;</i></p> <p>After connecting with his brother Luigi in 1983’s single-screen arcade hit <em>Mario Bros.</em>, Mario made the jump to consoles—and scrolling—in 1985’s NES adventure <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> Nearly 40 years and 25 games later, the <em>Super Mario</em> games comprise one of the longest running and most predictably spectacular series ever. From 2D to 3D, on good hardware and bad, Mario running, jumping, and collecting coins has been a constant not just for Nintendo, but in the fabric of the medium itself, driving it forward, inspiring it, reacting to what’s worked, and pushing back against what hasn’t.</p>

 <p>Trying to rank the<em> Super Mario</em> games is like trying to rank flavors of ice cream. Some are clear favorites. Others are acquired tastes. Most are still better than whatever the alternative is. In putting together this list, which includes input from across <em>Kotaku</em>’s staff, as well as direct contributions from many of us, we tried to consider the games holistically: their historical context, their revolutionary or creative innovations, how well they hold up now, and the impressions they’ve left with us.</p> <p>The ranking we arrived at is not beyond reproach and is far from scientific, but it is correct. Here we go!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Randy Pitchford has responded to complaints about the console version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> lacking a field of view (FOV) slider, suggesting fairness may have something to do with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S players of Borderlands 4 were shocked to discover not only a lack of a FOV slider in-game, but no motion blur toggle, either. The PC version of Borderlands 4 has settings for both — in the case of FOV you can increase the value in degrees up to 110 for both first-person play and vehicle use, and for motion blur you can change the amount and the quality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lack of a FOV slider is the biggest issue right now with Borderlands 4 on console, if anecdotal evidence across the internet is anything to go by, with some complaining that not being able to tweak the FOV value is causing them motion sickness.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Man, I've tried to play it twice today,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndwq95u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor xInsaneAbilityx</a>. “Both times I get that ‘car-sick’ feel after about 15 minutes and have to stop.” “Yeah I’m pretty sensitive to motion sickness and a narrow FOV in first-person makes me really dizzy. Combining that with motion blur just churns my stomach,” added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndx69um/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dallywack3r</a>. “This game feels almost zoomed in, it‘s really not pleasant to play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1nffex7/comment/ndy99ih/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said christophlieber</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also suggestions the console version of Borderlands 4 lacks a FOV slider in order to maintain certain performance levels. By increasing the FOV, you’re putting the hardware under more strain and potentially impacting things like framerate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But social media posts from Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford suggest one of the considerations is fairness.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Quickie for console friends: FOV settings,” Pitchford began. “There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pitchford included a vote in his social media post, which, after nearly 25,000 votes, reveals just how important a FOV slider is to his followers. At the time of this article’s publication, the option “FOV slider or GTFO!” had 72% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The outspoken Gearbox boss went on to say players “have no idea what the team and I were planning and how FOV slider might affect fairness with such a thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “That said, I've always want to commit to and prioritize what Borderlands should be versus try to turn it into something it should. My hope is for my/our ambitions to be additive, not subtractive.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Quickie for console friends: FOV settings: There's some dreams I have where an FOV setting might affect fairness. I can't really talk about it yet, but I see this is important to you so we're looking at it. Vote here:</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966626024235434322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">So, what is Pitchford actually saying here? The “fairness” quote has caused some confusion. Could it relate to an upcoming PvP mode? If so, why would the PC version have it? Right now, Borderlands 4 is a PvE co-op game, so the line about “fairness” has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if Pitchford is talking about fairness in terms of the performance of the game giving some players an advantage. The higher the FOV, the more the player can see, versus the lower the FOV the more stable the frames are. Perhaps both give some level of advantage?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What does ‘fairness’ even mean?’ asked redditor buddachickentml. “Basically being impartial to all players without favoritism. Fairness to all,” suggested Wolf-O7. “Funny enough it's completely backwards though. Because console players aren't being treated fairly compared to their counterpart on PC. (Especially since this sort of sounds like a PVP mode the way he makes it seem).” Then, from Airaen: “Yeah, how is it fair that PC players can change the FoV and console players can't?” “Fairness in a PvE game? Will you ban ultrawide monitors?” said on social media user.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 supports crossplay between all platforms at launch, so Pitchford’s comments are doubly confusing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for motion blur, in another social media post Pitchford told console players "we aren't down with motion blur and do not support it." He continued: “If you're seeing what seems to be motion blur, maybe check your television settings for whatever automatic BS it might be doing to your image? It's not us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But again, that comment is confusing given there are motion blur settings in Borderlands 4 on PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/13/randy-1757782577055.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Randy Pitchford has addressed Borderlands 4 console complaints. Photo by Jon Kopaloff/Getty Images for Lionsgate.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Pitchford means here, Borderlands 4 has got off to a big start on Steam. It’s approaching a peak concurrent player count of 300,000 on Valve’s platform, where it is one of the most-played games. No other Borderlands game has come close to that in terms of concurrent player numbers on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-am-that-confident-randy-pitchford-says-its-impossible-for-borderlands-4-players-to-break-the-games-servers-this-weekend-challenges-them-to-try">Pitchford declared it impossible to break the <u>Borderlands 4</u> servers this weekend through sheer weight of player numbers alone</a> — and he’s so confident he’s publicly promised that Borderlands 4 won’t join the long list of big AAA games whose online systems fail at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Borderlands 4 is off to a big start in terms of player numbers, it’s not entirely plain sailing for Gearbox. The release was marred by complaints about PC performance that have resulted in a ‘mixed’ user review rating on Valve’s platform. The complaints revolve around poor performance even on high powered PCs, with some affected by crashing that makes the game difficult to even start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Gearbox posted a Borderlands 4 Nvidia Optimization guide on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190/view/679602429802577921" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Steam</u></a>, advising players how to optimize their graphics settings for “better performance and framerates” on PC with the Nvidia app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox then issued a piece of advice to PC gamers that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-gearbox-asks-pc-gamers-to-keep-playing-for-at-least-15-minutes-after-they-tweak-settings-to-see-how-performance-has-changed-as-negative-steam-reviews-pile-up"><u>to me reads like an effort to prevent players from making knee-jerk reactions to the game's performance as soon as they’ve changed their settings</u></a>: “Please note that any time you change any of your graphics settings, your shaders will need to recompile.
