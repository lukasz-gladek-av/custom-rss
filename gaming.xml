			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> has a lot of systems that its players need to be aware of, and while the gear you take with you each time you go <strong>Topside</strong> is important, you also need to be levelling up your Raider's skill tree appropriately, if you want to be able to make the best of your runs.</p>



<p>While completing the full <strong>Skill Tree</strong> is a slog, since you don't just have to unlock skills by spending individual points, you need to spend a certain amount of skill points in each of the three sections (<strong>Conditioning, Mobility,</strong> and <strong>Survival</strong>) to move into the second and third tiers of skills. </p>



<p>That means you don't want to needlessly spend your skill points on skills that won't have as much of an impact on your playing experience. This guide will show you which of the skills in the skill tree are the best in the game, and what you should be focusing on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-3-scaled.jpeg"></a><figcaption><em>The ARC Raiders skill tree.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-conditioning-skills">Best Conditioning Skills</h3>



<p>The <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch of skills is all about keeping your Raider in top shape for the marathon that is going on runs Topside. The skills in this branch help toughen your Raider in bad situations, with some restoring stamina and health while you're low on health, and others that make you more proficient at common elements of the game, like breaching containers and how fast you can be with extra weight on your back. </p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Conditioning branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Used to the Weight</strong> - Wearing a shield doesn't slow you down as much</li>



<li><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> - Breaching doors and containers takes less time</li>



<li><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> - When you're critically hurt, your stamina regenerates faster</li>



<li><strong>Downed but Determined</strong> - When you're downed, it takes longer before you collapse</li>



<li><strong>A Little Bit Extra</strong> - Breaching an object generates resources</li>
</ul>



<p>The first on the list, <strong>Used to the Weight</strong>, is also the first Conditioning skill you'll unlock. Its description (read above) might not sound like a lot on the face of it, but when you consider that you'll be wearing a shield every time you're Topside, you immediately understand why it's essential. So essential that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> put it at the beginning of the branch, to ensure you don't miss it. </p>



<p>When you've unlocked the rest of the skills in the opening tier of the Conditioning branch, and you're looking for skills to dump points into so you can continue to the next tier, Used to the Weight should be one of the first skills you max out.</p>



<p><strong>Proficient Pryer</strong>, <strong>Downed but Determined</strong>, and <strong>A Little Bit Extra </strong>are all fairly self-explanatory in their importance. You're constantly breaching things open to get resources, and you're vulnerable while breaching something. You should work to make this as quick as possible. While Downed but Determined gives you a greater chance at survival if you do go down, with other players having more time to pick you back up. Lastly, A Little Bit Extra is just that - extra resources that can go a long way to making breaching anything and everything worth more.</p>



<p><strong>Survivor's Stamina</strong> is just as key as actually increasing your max stamina (which we'll get to in the <strong>Mobility </strong>section). You'll find yourself in a lot of tough situations in ARC Raiders. Having your stamina regenerate faster in those situations will help you get out of a lot of jams that would've otherwise killed you.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-mobility-skills">Best Mobility Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the Conditioning branch helps keep your Raider in top shape, the <strong>Mobility </strong>branch keeps you nimble and mobile, with skills that directly impact your stamina, both how much you have and how it regenerates, how fast you are, and how far actions like jumping and vaulting can take you.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the Mobility branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Youthful Lungs - </strong>Increases your max stamina</li>



<li><strong>Marathon Runner</strong> - Moving around costs less stamina</li>



<li><strong>Calming Stroll</strong> - While walking, your stamina regenerates as if you were standing still</li>



<li><strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> - When you're downed, you crawl faster</li>



<li><strong>Heroic Leap</strong> - You can Sprint Dodge Roll further</li>
</ul>



<p>Like some of the skills in the Conditioning branch, the importance of skills like <strong>Youthful Lungs, Marathon Runner, </strong>and <strong>Calming Stroll</strong> is all pretty self-explanatory. Everything you do impacts your stamina, so levelling up Youthful Stroll to give you more is a no-brainer; the same goes for Marathon Runner to make the stamina you do have go further. Calming Stroll helps you keep that stamina up and ready for when you need it, like being surprised by a Hornet or a Rocketeer you didn't notice was patrolling by, and you accidentally walked right into its sightline.</p>



<p>I can tell you from experience that <strong>Crawl Before You Walk</strong> (especially when paired with <strong>Downed But Determined</strong>) can be the difference between you making it back to Speranza alive or a failed run. Not successfully extracting stings, and it stings even more if the difference was just a few feet and your Raider's inability to stay alive for a few seconds longer. </p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Heroic Leap</strong> can be an essential skill for combat. As noted in our <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/arc-raiders-tips-and-tricks-guide/">Tips and Tricks Guide</a></strong>, plenty of the maps you'll visit in ARC Raiders have a serious lack of cover, and getting caught out in the open without a place to hide or duck behind can mean a resource-draining fight, or worse, the end of your run. Heroic Leap can take you that extra bit to help you stay ahead of ARCs and other players while in combat.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-survival-skills">Best Survival Skills</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARC-Raiders-Best-Skills-Guide-2.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The third and final branch of the skill tree in ARC Raiders, the <strong>Survival</strong> branch, is all about skills that keep your instincts sharp while Topside. Some of that includes skills that impact how much noise you make and how you interact with looting resources, while some of the skills give you additional abilities to use while Topside.</p>



<p>Here are the best skills in the <strong>Survival </strong>branch, listed with their in-game descriptions:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>In-Round Crafting - </strong>Unlocks the ability to field-craft items while Topside.</li>



<li><strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> - Increases the maximum weight you can carry.</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Instincts</strong> - When searching a container, loot is revealed faster.</li>



<li><strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> - Your stamina regeneration is less affected by being over-encumbered.</li>



<li><strong>Minesweeper</strong> - Mines and explosives can be defused when in close proximity.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>In-Round Crafting</strong> is an obvious one, because it means you don't have to rely on bringing as many bandages and shield rechargers as you can carry. You'll be able to craft items like those on the fly while Topside, freeing up more space in your backpack for more tactical items. <strong>Broad Shoulders</strong> and <strong>Stubborn Mule</strong> are two skills that work in tandem with each other. One increases your carrying capacity, while the other ensures that even if you go beyond your limits, you won't be impacted as greatly as you could've been.</p>



<p><strong>Minesweeper</strong> is another that's important for obvious reasons, because being able to defuse explosives can help give you the upper hand when fighting enemy Raiders trying to get the jump on you. Lastly, <strong>Looter's Instinct</strong> works in tandem with <strong>Proficient Pryer</strong> from the <strong>Conditioning</strong> branch. Not only will you be faster when it comes to breaching, but Looter's Instinct helps to make the actual looting part as quick as possible, so you're not left vulnerable in the looting menu for longer than you need to be.</p>



<h3 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h3>



<p>The five skills listed in each section are, in my experience, the best skills to put levels into as soon as you can, and the ones you should focus on unlocking the most. That said, there are a few that I did want to make sure I highlighted, so you don't needlessly ignore them.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sturdy Ankles </strong>(<strong>Mobility</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Looter's Luck</strong> (<strong>Survival</strong>)</li>



<li><strong>Loaded Arms </strong>(<strong>Conditioning</strong>)</li>
</ul>

            <guid>1423345</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t worry, podracing fans. While <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer’</em>s debut trailer didn’t feature any podracers, the iconic fast-moving space chariots will be a part of the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced last year at the Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an upcoming racing game set in that galaxy far, far away. <em>Galactic Racer</em> is being developed by some former <em>Burnout</em> devs at Fuse Games, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">a new studio created in 2023</a>. The game looks awesome and features Sebulba at the very end of its teaser trailer. However, there was not a single podracing vehicle to be seen in that first teaser, which had fans like me worried that we wouldn’t get to recreate the best part of 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace,</em> aka the podracing scene. Thankfully, there will indeed be podracers in <em>Galactic Racer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">In a recent interview with <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> &nbsp;Fuse Games CEO and co-founder Matt Webster told the outlet that yes, of course podracing will be a part of the studio’s <em>Star Wars</em> racing game.</p>  <p id="6d1737fa-b5a4-42f5-8eb9-7604d114ba62">“You can’t really make a <em>Star Wars</em> racing experience and not have podracing, can you?” said Webster. “The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy.”</p>

 <p>“However, when we set out to create <em>Galactic Racer,</em> we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. <em>Galactic Racer</em> offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes.”</p> <p>More good news: <em>Galactic Racer</em> will feature the option to drive around in first-person, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-star-wars-episode-i-racer-remaster-is-a-little-ugl-1844206400">which is my preferred way to play podracing games</a>.&nbsp;Now, I just need Webster or someone else at Fuse Games to confirm the Boonta Eve Classic race course featured in past podracing games, like<em> Star Wars Racer’s Revenge,</em> will be playable in <em>Galactic Racer</em>, and I’ll be a happy wookkiee when the game arrives on consoles and PC later this year.</p>

Developer Epic Games hasn’t confirmed whether Chappell Roan or her famous pink pony mascot will actually show up in-game, but fans are still expecting an announcement as soon as this week.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">CHAPPEL ROAN POTENTIALLY NEXT FESTIVAL ARTIST <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Fortnite</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ut2jTrm6Ok" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Ut2jTrm6Ok</a></p>— Leaky (@itsmeleaky) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 22, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">X/Twitter user @itsmeleaky seems to have been the first to kick off rumors that the Midwest Princess was next to join Epic’s roster of Festival stars, sharing images of some very Chappell Roan-looking music cosmetics and what appears to be a llama sidekick dressed up as a pink, cowboy hat-wearing pony. Players were then able to find these same items in <a href="https://x.com/realAlucar/status/2014308961957056613?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a special room in-game</a>, with some other familiar visuals, including flashy pink stars and some knight armor, adding to the pile of alleged evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All three items would certainly fit the occasion, especially the potential sidekick, which looks a lot like a reference to the star’s mega-hit song, Pink Pony Club. The knight armor, meanwhile, has been taken as a sign that at least one of what could be a few skins could pull from Chappell Roan’s medieval-themed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ENzV125lWc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Video Music Awards performance of Good Luck, Babe!</u></a>. She’s known for her many, many memorable looks, though, so music fans are still guessing which direction Epic could take her cosmetics should she have a substantial presence in Fortnite this month.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">👀| Fortnite appears to have begun teasing a possible collaboration with Chappell Roan <a href="https://t.co/zUMRqjXlxx" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zUMRqjXlxx</a></p>— Chappell Roan Now (@ChappellRoanNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChappellRoanNow/status/2014734311988113832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 23, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the studio confirmed plans to launch <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2017289932310479080?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fortnite version 39.40</u></a> this week on January 30, leaving fans to look out for new content in the days ahead. Again, Epic hasn’t confirmed whether the star will show up at all, but for some, it’s not a question of if, but when and how.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chappell Roan’s status as a <a href="https://www.grammy.com/artists/chappell-roan/56864" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grammy award-winning artist</a> with millions of listeners has many expecting her to headline an upcoming Festival update as its new icon. It would mean potentially multiple skins to accompany the inclusion of more of her music, though how the star’s career could be represented is unclear. It’s possible she could have a more muted presence, but with the previous icon, Lisa, set to rotate out in just a few days, fans believe it could be the perfect time for Chappell to make her proper Fortnite debut.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE VALENTINE'S DAY EVENT TEASER <a href="https://t.co/ew7rxBrrzg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ew7rxBrrzg</a></p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/2018022087365951661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As Chappell Roan rumors for Fortnite heat up without official confirmation, players are still looking forward to other updates for February.

As a demanding Unreal Engine 5 game, many PC gamers — on various PC setups, including high-end ones — have unfortunately voiced their frustrations when it comes to the game's performance profile.</p>



<p>This guide should hopefully help you attain an optimal balance between performance and visuals. We will break down how each graphics setting impacts performance and visuals in the form of video comparisons, and provide you with a ready-to-use optimized settings table that should improve your performance without <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">completely</em> sacrificing visual fidelity.</p>

<h2 id="h-about-code-vein-ii-a-brief-overview">About Code Vein II — A Brief Overview</h2>



<p>Released on January 29, 2026, on PC (via Steam), <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> is the sequel to Bandai Namco’s anime-inspired action RPG, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/">Code Vein</a></em>, blending stylish characters and high-octane Souls-like combat with an open-world twist. Early reviews praise its combat and world design, but many critics and PC players alike have flagged performance issues even on fairly powerful rigs.</p>

<p>Even with recommended specs, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> can dip below target framerates in open-world and intense combat scenes, thus highlighting the need for extra tuning of the game's graphics settings in order to achieve better performance/visuals ratios.</p>



<p>Thankfully, the game does have a Pipeline State Object (PSO)/shader compilation step, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">which,</strong> in my experience,<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed"> was quite effective as I failed to spot a single instance of shader compilation stutter</strong>. Further, the game also <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">doesn't seem to have a lot of traversal stutters and hitches</strong>, which is quite impressive for being an open-world Unreal Engine 5 game.</p>

<h2 id="h-graphics-settings-breakdown-visuals-vs-performance"><strong>Graphics Settings Breakdown — Visuals vs Performance</strong></h2>



<p>In this section, we will explore the various graphics settings in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II, </em>via comparison videos that should show case both the graphics and performance (in terms of FPS) of each setting, thus allowing us to determine which settings strike the best visuals/performance balance, which is the basis for establishing optimized graphical settings in this game, or any other game for that matter.</p>



<p>Also, please be aware of the fact that the graphics settings comparisons in this section have all been made on a system with the following specs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CPU:</strong> Intel Core i7-14700K;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">RAM:</strong> 32 GB DDR5-7000 CL34;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Storage:</strong> 2 TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU:</strong> NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090;</li>



<li><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Operating System:</strong> Windows 11 25H2;</li>



<li>All system firmware, drivers, BIOS, and OS updates were fully applied before testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>Also, all of the comparisons were done under <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">GPU limited scenarios at a resolution of 2560x1440 (1440p) with TSR (Temporal Super Resolution) as the temporal upscaling solution at the native resolution (100% render scale)</strong>, as in this game — like most other Unreal Engine 5 games — the GPU will largely be the performance limiting factor rather than the CPU (or other system components), unless you were aiming to achieve some really high framerates. Furthermore, please be aware of the fact that lowering GPU-intensive graphics settings (which are basically all of the following settings) will not affect a game's performance if the rest of your system (mainly CPU and system memory) is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> too slow to keep up with your GPU</strong>.</p>



<p>First of all, let's take a look at the game's graphics setting menu, with all of its subsections:</p>


<p>

</p>

<p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Graphics-Settings-3.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Code Vein II graphics settings menu — Part </em>3</figcaption></figure>
</p>


<p>We can see that the game supports all major temporal upscaling solutions, <strong>with the exception of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/intel-xess-3-mfg-multi-frame-gen-up-to-4x-mode-unveiled-coming-to-all-arc-gpus/">Intel's XeSS</a></strong>. Unfortunately, we can also see that <strong>the game supports no frame generation technologies</strong>, which would've been useful to further increase the game's smoothness, albeit at the cost of potential visual artifacts and higher latency.</p>



<p>Another thing that's worth mentioning is that in the following comparisons, you might sometimes spot differences in lighting that go beyond changing the relevant graphics setting. This is unfortunately due to the fact that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the game has a rapidly changing dynamic weather system</strong>, which makes it really difficult to capture completely like-for-like scenes in video format at different time frames.</p>



<p>With that said, let us finally delve into the visuals/performance profile of each relevant graphics setting that the game offers.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Note</strong>: The comparison videos have a <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/how-to-set-up-high-quality-performance-overlays-with-rtss/">CapFrameX/RTSS based overlay</a> that contains performance data regarding two metrics that we feel are relevant to gauge the performance profile of each graphics setting, which <span>are<strong>&nbsp;real-time</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> framerate (FPS)</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dedicated GPU memory (VRAM) usage</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-draw-distance"><strong>Draw Distance</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Draw Distance Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wbyEVammyGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Draw Distance</strong>" setting seems to control the distance at which various game assets <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> such as rocks, pebbles, and foliage <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> are drawn on the screen. We can also see that the various levels of this setting don't really affect performance much differently, and that the two lowest settings especially exhibit noticeable pop-in of certain assets in the ground. <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Therefore, we recommend using the "Farthest" level for this setting</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-anti-aliasing-processing-and-render-scaling-aka-temporal-upscalers"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong> <strong>(AKA Temporal Upscalers)</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Temporal Upscaler Comparison   DLSS SR vs FSR vs TSR" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AL8_hlI9aig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Anti-Aliasing Processing and Render Scaling</strong>" settings are intricately linked with each other, as the former setting controls the type of temporal upscaling/anti-aliasing solution to tackle the game's aliasing and/or to also upscale a lower-resolution input into a higher-resolution one, and the latter setting controls the per-resolution axis upscaling factor (in terms of percentages from 40% to 100%). <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Our recommendations for this setting simply depend on your GPU vendor</strong>: NVIDIA GPU users should obviously use <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-super-resolution-how-to-guide-image-quality-analysis-performance-impact/">DLSS Super Resolution</a>, whereas both AMD <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> except AMD RDNA4 users who may be able to utilize the way more advanced FSR 4 upscaling via the AMD Adrenalin GPU driver interface <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and Intel GPU users should simply avoid FSR (version 3.1) upscaling at all costs <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> given its incredibly soft and shimmery output <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> and instead use Unreal Engine 5's included TSR (Temporal Super Resolution), whose quality and performance impact can be controlled from the Anti-Aliasing setting, which we shall see a bit further down.</p>



<h3 id="h-post-processing"><strong>Post-Processing</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Post-Processing Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YhG-1Ju4-Uk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This setting seems to control whether certain post-processing effects <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> such as bloom, depth of field, lens flare, and chromatic aberration <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> are enabled at all. Given that there doesn't seem to be much of a difference in performance between the various levels here, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">we will simply encourage players to choose which level of post-processing they like the most in terms of their subjective perception</strong> of the aforementioned post-processing effects.</p>



<h3 id="h-anti-aliasing"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Anti-Aliasing</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Anti-Aliasing Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/al1ESoCGi2k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This setting controls the quality of Unreal Engine 5's TSR, and given the fact that there aren't any major differences in visual quality between the different levels on display here, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">we recommend that users stick with the "Medium" setting</strong>, as a safe and balanced option when it comes to its performance/visuals balance.</p>



<h3 id="h-shadow"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Shadow</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Shadow Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OdGDTlECEb0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>We recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" shadow quality setting, as in our opinion, it strikes the best visuals/performance ratio out of all levels on display in the above video. However, should players encounter distracting shadow flickering — especially in some tree/foliage heavy areas of the game — then we recommend that they bump it up to the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">High</strong>" level, and avoid the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highest</strong>" level unless they have a lot of GPU horsepower to spare.</p>



<h3 id="h-texture"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Texture</strong></h3>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Code Vein II - Texture Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YTCJq05e9eI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>For the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Texture</strong>" setting, we simply did not observe any differences in both performance and texture quality of some game assets, like rocks and walls. This is perhaps reflected in the fact that the GPU dedicated VRAM usage meter doesn't really seem to differ between all levels of the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Texture</strong>" setting. However, since the game was allocating <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">at least</em> 8 GB of GPU memory at 1440p on our RTX 4090 GPU, we <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">recommend that people not play this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> at least at this resolution or higher <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> on GPUs with less than 8 GB of VRAM, </strong>lest they encounter increased stuttering and hitching due to insufficient video memory capacity.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Effects</strong>" setting seems to control the quality of special effects such as GPU-accelerated particles and certain transparencies. From the performance/visuals ratio of each level of this setting, we can see that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Medium</strong>" level should be adequate for most people looking to strike a decent balance in both visuals and performance.</p>

<p>The "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Material</strong>" graphics setting is a bit of an odd one, and one we think is sadly poorly explained by the game developers. We think it controls the quality of specular highlights and reflections, and it seems that the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Low</strong>" level performs clearly better than the higher levels. However, in rainy weather, the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Low</strong>" level simply destroys the specular highlights of various game assets, such as rocks and characters. The "High" setting obviously has the highest visual quality, though it also comes at a performance cost. Therefore, we recommend that players opt for the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Medium</strong>" level of this setting.</p>

Consequently, <strong>we recommend that players just use the "High" level of this setting</strong>.</p>



<p>Wrapping it all up, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">here are the final, recommended optimized graphics settings</strong> for <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Code Vein II</em>, which we feel strike an optimal point in the realm of performance/visuals trade-offs:</p>

<p>You can further improve your <em>Code Vein II</em> performance <strong>by combining both optimized graphics settings and temporal upscaling from a lower input resolution</strong>, not to mention that <strong>you could also overclock your GPU to further boost your framerates and frametime consistency</strong>. Just make sure that your overclock is fully stable!</p>

<p>And if that still isn't enough for you, then you could further improve the game's visual smoothness <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> at the cost of extra latency and potentially visible visual artifacts, especially at low base framerates <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">by enabling FSR Frame Generation</strong> <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> or even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/latest-intel-arc-graphics-driver-introduces-xess-3-multi-frame-generation-support/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">XeSS Frame Generation</strong></a> in the case of Optiscaler <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em>, either <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/codevein2/mods/19?tab=description"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">via this mod</strong></a> or with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/heres-how-to-add-amd-fsr-redstone-frame-gen-to-almost-any-game-using-optiscaler/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Optiscaler</strong></a>. You could also use GPU driver frame generation/interpolation technologies, such as NVIDIA Smooth Motion or AMD Advanced Fluid Motion Frames (AFMF) 2.1, if the aforementioned methods aren't viable for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-final-words"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Final Words</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Code Vein II</em> did not impress us with its ratio of visual fidelity and performance. Even among the slew of many dozen Unreal Engine 5 games that are available on both consoles and PC, the game simply fails to achieve a satisfying balance between performance and visuals, and is therefore in need of multiple updates to further improve its performance. The lack of XeSS upscaling and frame generation technologies is also a sore technical point in the delivered package.</p>



<p id="h-">Still, with smart tweaking of individual graphics settings (including temporal upscaling), you can achieve a somewhat decent experience in this game <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em> especially if your hardware is up to snuff <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">—</em>, as fully maxed-out visuals often come at an unnecessarily steep performance cost that's well within diminishing returns in terms of extra visual flair. It’s a balancing act worth mastering for the best experience, at least in our opinion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bad news for anime fans: Popular streaming service Crunchyroll has announced another price increase across all of its tiers, including its cheapest “Fan Tier.” Subscribers will have to pay between $12 and $24 extra a year starting next month. Just one of many services that’s getting more and more expensive.</p> <p>On February 2, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/2/crunchyroll-updates-membership-pricing-to-give-fans-more-of-what-they-love">Crunchyroll announced</a> that all three of its streaming tiers ( Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan) are getting price increases in the United States on March 4. Here’s what’s changing:</p> <ul> <li>Fan Tier – $9 a month (was $8)</li> <li>Mega Fan Tier – $14 a month (was $12)</li> <li>Ultimate Fan Tier – $18 a month (was $16)</li> </ul> <p>According to Crunchyroll, this is the first time since 2019 that the anime-on-demand service has raised the price of the Fan tier in the U.S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">Last time the service raised prices</a> in 2024, the increase didn’t affect the cheapest option, the Fan tier. But that’s not the case this time with next month’s price hike.</p>

 <h2>Why Crunchyroll’s price is going up in March</h2> <p>In an effort to help explain the price increase, Crunchyroll listed some features it’s working on adding or has already recently added to the service. These include profiles for teens, the ability to skip intros and credits, and support for multiple profiles.</p> <p>That’s nice, and I imagine Crunchyroll subscribers have been wanting some of these features for a bit now and are happy to have them or to be getting them in the near future. It doesn’t change that these days it feels like every app, service, subscription, and website is going up in price while not really offering much in exchange.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft recently announced it is raising prices on <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-big-shake-up-just-dance-price-increase-fans-screwed-2000663578">Just Dance’</a></em>s streaming service. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">PlayStation Plus keep going up</a>.

Welcome to the future: It costs a lot to own anything and just about as much to rent or stream it. Thanks, AI hyperscalers, greedy execs, and tariffs.</p>

Like all prior Chaos Vault drops, the cards and artwork is more random and experimental. However, this new drop isn't just experimenting with style, but with how it is sold.</p><h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault <em>Prints Charming</em> Announcement</h2><p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/a-charming-curiosity-comes-to-secret-lairs-chaos-vault" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast highlighted the experiment at play with the new <em>Prints Charming</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>At first glance, it appears to be no different from prior Chaos Vault releases. Instead of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-oishii-tokens-drop-brings-cute-food-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow">adorable foodstuffs</a>, moody sci-fi vistas, or friendly competition between <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-chaos-vault-secret-lair-is-for-cats-and-dogs" rel="nofollow">cats and dogs</a>, this drop will feature woodblock-inspired storybook art takes on cards from Lorwyn Shadowmoor. That artwork is provided by Kathleen Neeley, Roman Klonek, Pedro Oyarbide, and Sophy Hollington.</p><p>The drop features the following four cards:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="e5d643c74c7e5ba37739d0203b082dd1b"><em>Nature's Lore</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ebe7f7bade2228e8f1c3da7e52e98a5f2"><em>Skyshroud Claim</em></li><li data-list-item-id="ec4ab8aef8a6da3ce3878ae80b08bc278"><em>Wood Elves</em></li><li data-list-item-id="e50e5f77d0a1cb97043ccc3420f6c99cb"><em>Dryad Arbor</em></li></ul><p>&nbsp;On the surface, these cards appear no different from other alternative card artwork. There is some creative playfulness with the border and the rules text being incorporated into the artwork. Given the fairy tale sensibilities of the release of the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cards-to-upgrade-lorwyn-ecllipsed-commander-decks" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn Eclipsed</em></a> set, this drop of cards would be right at home.</p><p>Here's the twist. There are multiple price listings for the <em>Prints Charming</em> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This isn't an a la carte or a deluxe edition situation. You pay one of the listed prices, you get the same set of cards. Nothing more; nothing less. The post explicitly states this several times.</p><blockquote><p>All Prints Charming listings, including non-foil and foil editions, contain the exact same cards and contents at every price point. The only difference between listings is the price. Higher-priced listings do not include anything extra.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; The non-foil MSRP listings for the drop are $9.99, $19.99, $29.99, $34.99, and $39.99. If you want foil, your choices are $19.99, $29.99, $39.99, $44.99, $49.99</p><p>The business decision behind this Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop is questionable. From a certain perspective, it is a more restrictive version of the "Pay What You Want" option used by various independent artists and creatives on different platforms. But, it's a high profile product by one of the largest tabletop companies in the world. That usually implies a certain premium price on their product.</p><p>Regardless, the Prints Charming Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop has sold extremely quickly. At time of writing, there is only one batch available: a foil drop at the $39.99 mark.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a> set, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QG8ppE?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Lorwyn Eclipsed</u></a>, is here to kick off the game’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-full-release-schedule-updated-2026"><u>2026 release schedule</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This release marks the return to the classic fae and elf-heavy realm of Lorywn, last visited back in 2008. Recently, as I was perusing Instagram, I came across a video by Daniel Powell (aka JollySaintClick), who brought to my attention the new “<a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4ZrZ?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mirrorform</u></a>” card that is part of the latest set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This card, costing four colorless and two blue mana, reads as follows: “Each nonland permanent you control becomes a copy of target non-aura permanent.” JollySaintClick pointed out how the card can get out of hand with something like Coveted Jewel, and it got me thinking: What other cards would be great to copy with Mirrorform?”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mirrorform Explained</h2><div id="234979"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234979" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mirrorform</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Before I get into the list, let’s break down a couple of important things about Mirrorform:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It doesn’t say “until the end of the turn” anywhere on the card: </strong>Your cards won’t be changing back at the end of your turn, so take care when you drop Mirrorform, and just as important, make sure your hand is set up so you aren’t leaving yourself too restricted after playing it. You don’t want to put yourself in a rough spot after getting all your copies out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Legendary cards are out (mostly): </strong>Because Mirrorform is changing all nonland permanent cards, artifacts like Mirror Box that remove the legend rule will get overwritten, so making copies of legendary cards will be tough, though not impossible. If this is the route you want to take, you will need to find a way to remove the “Legendary” aspect of the creature in question; otherwise, all but one of your copies will be destroyed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tokens are okay to copy: </strong>Nothing in the card stipulates that your target has to be a nontoken, so just make sure you are aware that if you manage to make a really cool token of something, it is just as viable as anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It’s an instant: </strong>While Mirrorform may feel like it should be a sorcery, being an instant means you can cast it outside of your turn or in response to something else. This can be a big help and a great answer to a threat on the board or when you’re the target of an attack.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Cards To Use With Mirrorform</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">Giggling Skitterspike</h3></div><div id="234980"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234980" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Giggling Skitterspike</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Growing up, the spider-doll creature in the original Toy Story terrified me, and thanks to Duskmourn, that critter was turned into a nasty Magic card in the form of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqJ3N6?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Giggling Skitterspike</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turning a pool of dull random tokens or boring creatures into indestructible spider dolls that can dish out damage equal to its power to ALL opponents whenever it is targeted is especially scary. The fact that you can boost them to 6/6 with its Monstrosity 5 ability makes the Skitterspike a prime option to use with Mirrorform. Just be prepared for nightmares…</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ouroboroid</h3></div><div id="234981"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234981" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ouroboroid</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Feel like getting some +1/+1 counters? Then Mirrorform some <a href="https://zdcs.link/zE8mEM?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ouroboroids</u></a> onto the field, and you will have more counters to hand out than you will know what to do with. Throw in a card like Doubling Season to really up those numbers, and all of these giant space plants will be swarming the battlefield in no time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your opponents may give up, so they don't have to wait for you to tally up all the counters each turn.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mother of Runes</h3></div><div id="234982"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234982" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mother of Runes</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">An army of moms that can give each other protection of whatever colors you want? Sounds good to me! As each creature can be activated separately, this means that you can save their protection and use them on a case-by-case basis, depending on what your opponents do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you manage to power up one <a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRXmr?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mother of Runes</u></a> and make it stronger, that protection will also let them hit directly at your opponents, too, circumventing their blockers altogether.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Ruin Crab</h3></div><div id="234983"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234983" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Ruin Crab</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Honestly, this list could have been all Landfall, but I wanted to restrain myself a bit; <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8nxq?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Ruin Crab</u></a> is just too good not to include.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are running a deck with some solid token generation, which would be preferred if you are running a copy of Mirrorform period, having a ton of Ruin Crabs on the field will make every single land you drop an immense pain for every one of your opponents, thanks to each trigger of them having to mill on each land drop.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Consuming Aberration</h3></div><div id="234984"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234984" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Consuming Aberration</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My friends and I still can't believe that <a href="https://zdcs.link/91wKn3?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Consuming Aberation</u></a> isn't a legendary, but seeing as it matches a color with Mirrorform, this is one of the easiest recommendations on this list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Ruin Crab, as it deals with Mill, an army of this horror will not only terrify your opponents from a mill risk, but the massive amount of power and toughness they will all have, due to their strength coming from the number of cards in your opponents' graveyards. Every little spell you cast will spell terror for your enemies.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battletide Alchemist</h3></div><div id="234985"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234985" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Battletide Alchemist</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Who needs blockers when you can just prevent all the damage that you get hit with? The <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8nq1?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Battletide Alchemist</u></a> Kithkin Cleric has a compounding ability, as each card will be able to prevent more damage on its own from each copy Mirrorform creates, while also multiplying prevention by the number of copies you have.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if you only have 5 copies after Mirrorform resolves, that will still mean that each <em>source</em> (not total damage) will need to exceed 25 damage to deal any damage to you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm</h3></div><div id="234986"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234986" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Miirym, Sentinel Wyrm</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, before you go into the comments to explain to me how the Legend rule works and how all but a single copy would be destroyed, let me stop you and tell you that yes, you are right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we aren't using Mirrorform on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPZrn?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Miirym</u></a>; we are using it on a token of Miirym that it itself creates. A token, mind you, that specifically reads (thanks to Miirym's ability) "Except the Token isn’t legendary", and as I specifically pointed out earlier, Mirrorform doesn't stipulate your target has to be nontoken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So yes, there is a bit of a setup that you will need to do to get this to work, but once you have that non-legendary token out, having multiple copies of each dragon you cast is just far too tempting a proposition to deny. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Roil Elemental</h3></div><div id="234987"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234987" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Roil Elemental</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8Yko?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Roil Elemental</u></a> is another one of those fun Landfall trigger cards that will be great fun to have a ton of copies, but whereas Ruin Crab caused your foes to mill, Roil Elemental instead lets you steal their creatures instead for each land you drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upkeep of keeping track of which copy stole which cards might be annoying, but that delightful feeling of taking that annoying creature of your friends from them will more than make up for it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Admonition Angel</h3></div><div id="234988"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234988" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Admonition Angel</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A bit like Roil Elemental, since it allows you to mess with the board states of your opponents, <a href="https://zdcs.link/znBbwj?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Admonition Angel</u></a> has a nasty landfall trigger that allows you to exile any other nonland permanent for as long as the angel remains on the battlefield.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having a bunch of copies courtesy of Mirrorform would mean a single land allows you to wipe out boards in an instant, and if you have a way to make your permanents indestructible, protecting your copies, then you will really be putting yourself in a solid spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact that the cards exiled this way have the chance to return should the angel leave the battlefield does give your opponents hope that things can turn around -  hope that you can dash with that next land you play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Relentless Rats</h3></div><div id="234989"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234989" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Relentless Rats</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas Battletide Alchemist had a compounding effect that prevents damage, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QpBKng?object_uuid=87858ce7-cc38-4a6e-8f95-afea5538186a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Relentless Rats</u></a> is a sort of antithesis. Each copy of rats that your Mirrorform makes will empower every other copy that is made, leaving you with a swarm of cute little murderous creatures to sic on your opponents. It's simple, yet effective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With tens of thousands of cards in the Magic: The Gathering library, there are hundreds, if not thousands, more cards that would be great options to use with Mirrorform.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Geoff Keighley has already set Thursday, December 10, as the date for The Game Awards 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The show’s creator and host announced the “save the date” news in a post on social media today. It’s early confirmation for this year’s show, securing its spot at Peacock Theater in Los Angeles nine months before viewers tune into what Keighley has previously referred to as “<a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/804027837216739329?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming’s biggest night</a>.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/2018346170121146678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming fans often spend the months leading up to the award show predicting which titles will take home awards for major categories like Game of the Year, Best Narrative, Best Game Direction, and Best Performance. At just one month into 2026, you’d think there would be no reasonable predictions as far as the winners (and losers) go for this year’s Game Awards, but fans already have one game on their minds: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar Games has a history of big wins at shows like these (Red Dead Redemption 2 had the most awards at The Game Awards 2018), so the long-in-development sixth mainline GTA game is on everyone’s radar. Other highly anticipated titles, like Resident Evil Requiem, Saros, Fable, and Control Resonant have some expecting steep competition, especially when it comes to the Game of the Year award, but there are a few other issues to consider, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any other industry award show, The Game Awards has a cutoff date a few weeks before the event itself, keeping some games from being competing despite being released in the year the show is held. For The Game Awards 2025, the cutoff date was November 21, 2025, at 9 p.m. PT / 12 a.m. ET. GTA 6 has a release date of November 19, 2026 – and that’s if it can dodge <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>yet another delay</u></a>. Meanwhile, with so much time left in the year, there’s a high likelihood at some of the year’s best game may not have even been announced yet.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">“And the most anticipated game award in 2026 goes to GTA 6” <a href="https://t.co/CoHBHJtN1W" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/CoHBHJtN1W</a> <a href="https://t.co/GMslOQ90d8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GMslOQ90d8</a></p>— GTA 6 Countdown ⏳ (@GTAVI_Countdown) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTAVI_Countdown/status/2018356216045482318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 2, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s announcement arrives less than two months after Keighley hosted The Game Awards 2025 on December 11. The show brought <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced"><u>a number of bombshell announcements and reveals</u></a>, including Divinity, a first look at Leon S.

              <p><span>The largest manga piracy site in the world, BATO.TO, and “approximately 60 related sites” have been shut down, following a joint operation between the Shanghai Public Security Bureau of China and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://news.web.nhk/newsweb/na/na-k10015037931000"><i><span>NHK</span></i></a><span>, this news comes </span><a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/830/"><span>via a report</span></a><span> from the Japanese Content Overseas Distribution Organisation, also known as CODA, indicating that the home of a man “alleged to have operated the world’s largest manga piracy site” had been searched. Although the suspect in question, who was arrested on suspicion of copyright infringement, was detained on November 19, 2025, CODA’s report states that the BATO group of sites “continued limited operation” until January 19, at which point they confirmed that “all 60” of BATO.TO sites had shut down.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statement notes that the 60 sites combined pulled in an estimated 350 million visits in May 2025 alone, and alleges that the “resulting economic impact” supposedly “amounts to approximately 770 billion yen.” That’s just shy of 5 billion USD.</span></p> <p><span>This absurdly large loss matches up with a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/piracy-of-japanese-games-and-anime-has-tripled-over-the-past-3-years-government-acknowledges-need-to-expand-legitimate-global-distribution-channels/"><span>recently published report</span></a><span> from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which estimated that Japanese anime, manga, and video game piracy resulted in 5.7 trillion yen (roughly 37 billion USD) of damage in 2025. </span><span>CODA states that their investigation “was initiated following requests from Japanese publishers,” including several prominent video game publishers such as Square Enix and Kadokawa Corporation, the latter of whom entered into a “strategic capital and business alliance” with Sony </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation"><span>in December 2024</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>CODA also states that China Literature Limited, a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings, cooperated with the investigation “as part of its international collaboration efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures.”</span></p> <p><span>Funnily enough, the official BATO.TO mod team noted on the r/Batoto subreddit that a new clone of the site popped up on January 20, a day after “the closure of all 60 sites had been confirmed” by CODA. The original BATO.TO mod team notes in their post that they “have not been in contact with the original developers, have not been notified that the new site is legitimate, and cannot confirm any claims circulating online.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong>, like most major triple-A publishers and developers, gets its fair share of criticism, and since the company announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last month</a>, it's been getting far more than its fair share. The reset saw it cancel the long-awaited <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, among other projects, while others were delayed, and the company confirmed that there would not only be more layoffs coming, but it would end its remote work policies, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">instituting a <strong>return-to-office mandate</strong></a>.</p>



<p>All of this, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">the introduction of a voluntary layoff program</a> at Ubisoft's headquarters in <strong>Paris</strong>, has sparked heavy criticism from those outside of the company, and even those internally, including from Ubisoft Montreal team lead <strong>David Michaud-Cromp</strong>. Michaud-Cromp directly criticized the return-to-office mandate on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_why-companies-force-people-back-in-the-office-activity-7420149620619509761-ihnP?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">personal LinkedIn account</a> shortly after it was announced.</p>



<p>"<em>So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they 'believe in collaboration'... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office...(Spoiler alert: it's not about efficiency or collaboration)</em>," Michaud-Cromp wrote. </p>



<p>Not too long after that post, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-activity-7422041590854238208-HRdB?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">he shared that he was put on a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension</a>, writing, "<em>The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.</em>"</p>



<p>Now, Michaud-Cromp confirmed in yet <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_today-i-was-terminated-by-ubisoft-effective-activity-7424133083051978757-F2ho?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">another post on his LinkedIn account</a> that he had been fired from Ubisoft. "<em>Today, I was terminated by Ubisoft, effective immediately. This was not my decision. I won’t be discussing internal details or circumstances. I’m taking time to regroup and will share next steps when appropriate.</em>"</p>



<p>When Wccftech reached out to Ubisoft for a comment on the situation, a representative gave the following statement: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Sharing feedback or opinions respectfully does not lead to a dismissal. We have a clear Code of Conduct that outlines our shared expectations for working together safely and respectfully, which employees review and sign each year. When that is breached, our established procedures apply, including an escalation of measures depending on the nature, severity and repetition of the breach. We won't comment further."</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>With Michaud-Cromp and Ubisoft unwilling and unable to go into the details of his termination, we'll likely never know what about his comments crossed a line, or if something was said internally during his discussions with management that also impacted his termination. </p>



<p>What we do know is that Michaud-Cromp is an advocate for work environments with strong communication between team members, whether they're remote, in-office, or a hybrid. Speaking to Kotaku, Michaud-Cromp said, "<em>In my experience, whether remote or hybrid teams are effective has less to do with physical proximity and more to do with fundamentals like clarity of goals, trust, documentation, tooling, and communication practices. Teams that invest in those areas tend to function well regardless of location, while teams that struggle with them often face challenges even when fully co-located.</em>"</p>



<p>When Ubisoft announced the return-to-office mandate, it claimed it was "<em>to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams. In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity, and success in a persistently more selective AAA market</em>."</p>



<p>The new mandatory RTO and the layoffs already confirmed at multiple Ubisoft locations, including ones at the Paris branch, have already sparked demonstration responses from unions and Ubisoft employees, with unions representing Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/">workers in Paris calling for a company-wide strike set to take place next week</a>, and a rally that was held in Halifax last week <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shuts-down-ubisoft-halifax-claims-decision-had-nothing-to-do-with-studio-unionizing/">in response to the <strong>Ubisoft Halifax closure</strong></a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>When Luke wrote about a <a href="https://aftermath.site/we-need-a-word-that-goes-beyond-slop-for-this-one/"><u>new frontier in AI Slop deserving a new distinction</u></a> produced by one Darren Aronofsky, I sardonically responded in the Aftermath Slack, saying, “Good to know Darren Aronofsky is still a hack.” Luke, of course, linked to the <a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-real-history-of-perfect-blue?ref=aftermath.site"><u>director’s history of copying other people’s work</u></a>, but I’m still full of piss and vinegar after being reminded of Aronofsky’s past artistic faux pas. So allow me to shed some light on why anime fans in particular don’t fuck with Aronofsky and his egregious aping of legendary Japanese anime director Satoshi Kon.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVIYnvJzRMY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Similarities between Paprika (2006) and Inception (2010)"></iframe></figure><p>The phenomenon of a Hollywood director referencing another work isn’t unique to Aronofsky. After all, what is <em>The Matrix</em> if not the Wachowskis being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/oct/19/hollywood-ghost-in-the-shell?ref=aftermath.site"><u>forever indebted to Mamoru Oshii’s take on <em>Ghost in the Shell</em></u></a>? The cool factor of Quentin Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill</em> without <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/2028165/meiko-kaji-70s-japanese-action-star-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-inspiration/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Toshiya Fujita’s <em>Lady Snowblood</em></u></a> serving as the blueprint? Or the existence of Christopher Nolan’s gravity-defying hotel fight scene and cracked-mirror sequences in <em>Inception</em> had <a href="https://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/satoshi-kon-final-gift-how-paprika-rewrote-dreams?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Kon’s final film</u></a>, <a href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/paprika-15-year-anniversary?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Paprika</u></em></a>, not done it first. It’s cool to see how a creative found inspiration from other works.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qwVwKEVrvOE?start=1172&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Satoshi Kon: O Ilusionista"></iframe></figure><p>The difference between copying and paying homage is a precarious one that can shift depending on how you slept the night before. For me, the general rule of thumb is that recreating a cool scene from an older work is above board so long as you’re telling a different story. While there are arguments to be had about where each of the above-mentioned cases sits on the copying and homage scale, they’re all negligible in my book when compared to Aronofsky’s “hack fuck” brand of homage to Kon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aronofsky has made no secret of his influence from directors like Akira Kurosawa, Spike Lee, and Kon. However, his influence from Kon gestures toward a creative who is aware that anime isn’t as popular in the West, so he’ll steal it before anyone can notice. To his credit, Aronofsky says as much in the documentary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon:_The_Illusionist?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist</u></em></a>. In it, Aronofsky recalls how the two met at a tempura restaurant after the release of his 1998 movie, <em>Pi</em>. Afterwards, Aronofsky says he saw Kon’s 1998 film Perfect Blue while in the script process for his upcoming film Requiem for a Dream, starring Jennifer Connelly and Jared Leto. The film’s trailer famously recreates an emotional moment between its leads in a bathtub, which Aronofsky provides some backstory for in the documentary.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think I was looking for a scene to kind of get the internal mindset of Jennifer Connelly’s character, Marion, and probably at the same time, I saw <em>Perfect Blue</em>,” Aronofsky said. “I remember writing to Satoshi in Japan saying, ‘Hey, would you mind if I use one of your shots as an homage to you, but it would help this moment in my film?’”</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>(Images: Madhouse/Artisan Entertainment)</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>As Aronofsky recounts, Kon was “flattered,” “fine,” and “generous” in allowing Aronofsky to pay homage to Perfect Blue. This is why Connelly’s scene in <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> shows her submerged in a bathtub, shouting under the water’s surface, just as Junko Iwao as Mima Kirigoe does in <em>Perfect Blue</em>. Aronofsky went on to say that they’d eventually link up again in Japan, where Kon had told him he was “very proud” of the homage. But that’s just Aronofsky’s account of what happened in a 2021 documentary following Kon’s death in 2011. Kon’s living account of the events, however, is a very different story entirely.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Satoshi Kon talks about how Requiem for a Dream took from his film Perfect Blue (1997) <a href="https://t.co/apBQtPoY0W?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/apBQtPoY0W</a></p>— Animation Obsessive (@ani_obsessive) <a href="https://twitter.com/ani_obsessive/status/2017282870138569161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">January 30, 2026</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>In an <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2017282870138569161?ref=aftermath.site"><u>old TV interview snippet</u></a> that went viral on Twitter shortly after Aronofsky's AI show hit the internet, Kon broke out a VHS player to showcase the similarities between Requiem for a Dream and Perfect Blue. While yes, Kon did say the two got to speak when Aronofsky came to visit, his signing off on the homage was news to him. During his frame-by-frame comparison of the two films, Kon states that Aronofsky “used these two cut scenes, the same angle and pose and everything,” and when Kon asked him about it, Aronofsky said it was an homage. Kon and whoever else in attendance immediately laughed when he used a baton with a pointed finger to point at himself when he reiterated that it was an homage to him before diving into the real problem with Aronofsky's homage using his work as a storyboard and reaping the benefits.</p><p>“As a side note, last year I was on the same flight as Jennifer Connelly,” Kon said. “She was in first class with her entire family; I was in business class.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Kon concedes that the stories are pretty different, <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> does feature its older lead wearing a red dress while hallucinating characters spilling out of her TV screen. This prompted the interviewer to say that the detail sounds very similar to other parts of Perfect Blue, to the point of overlap.&nbsp;</p><p>“Overlaps or a ripoff?” Kon countered. “But when I asked him, he said it was an homage. I learned a lot.”</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A peek into Satoshi Kon's storyboarding for Paprika (2006), dir. Satoshi Kon, Madhouse <a href="https://t.co/W23Ey49pEu?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/W23Ey49pEu</a></p>— Animation Obsessive (@ani_obsessive) <a href="https://twitter.com/ani_obsessive/status/1919816635440914486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Charitably speaking, looking back, we could chalk this all up to a discussion lost in translation where Aronofsky assumed he got an enthusiastically ironclad go-ahead from Kon when Kon didn’t seem aware this all was happening until after the fact. But all of that gets muddled when you consider he didn’t just do this once. He did it twice.&nbsp;</p><p>The second time was in his 2010 film, <em>Black Swan</em>. In it, Aronofsky would go from a visual homage to blatant copying, lifting the plot of a ballerina afraid of losing her dying spotlight in an obsessive battle over identity and image, right into <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/8A9CN63YXJ4?si=vU7Tasr7disSopnm&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Perfect Blue</em>’s whole fucking flow</u></a>. In an interview with Dazed in 2017, <em>Perfect Blue</em> producer Masao Maruyama even said that before Aronofsky made <em>Black Swan</em>, he approached Maruyama and Kon about remaking <em>Perfect Blue</em> entirely.</p><p>“I met with [Aronofsky] alongside Kon,” <a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/film-tv/article/37923/1/darren-aronofsky-wanted-to-remake-perfect-blue?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Maruyama told Dazed</u></a>. “It wouldn’t have been a problem with an adaptation; we thought that a director of that status could have adapted the film and done it in his own way and that would have been fine. But I think that Aronofsky’s<em> Black Swan</em>, including the similarities it has to <em>Perfect Blue</em>, is a very interesting film.”</p><p>Like <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>, <em>Black Swan</em> also took home a bunch of awards, but as far as I’m concerned, that’s all stolen valor. Unlike Kon being able to speak for himself about <em>Requiem for a Dream</em> being a ripoff of <em>Perfect Blue</em>, there’s no gotcha interview clip of him calling out Aronofsky for ripping off his work, because the director passed away from pancreatic cancer a year after <em>Black Swan</em>’s release. In his wake is a fifth unfinished feature film anime, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreaming_Machine?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Dreaming Machine</u></em></a>, that, in retrospect, I’m glad I never saw the light of day because Aronofsky wouldn’t have it as something to strip for parts to elevate his meandering slew of films as of late.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dB3w1QwFg7g?start=43&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Paprika (2006) -  Ending scene"></iframe></figure><p>So you can forgive me for the lack of surprise that Aronofsky would throw his producer money at&nbsp;slop when he clearly already didn’t give that much of a fuck about it with Kon’s works. Once a lame, always a lame.&nbsp;</p>
