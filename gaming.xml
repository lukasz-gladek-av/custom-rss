			<p>Bungie debuted the first major look at Destiny 2's coming Star Wars-inspired expansion, Renegades, today during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwlUS_JcarQ">a live stream event</a>. It also unveiled and launched the latest update for Destiny 2, Ash &amp; Iron, which is the first major update to the game's current Year of Prophecy.</p>



<p>Renegades was first unveiled earlier this year when Bungie hosted a live stream event for <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-revealed-launches-in-july-next-three-expansions-including-the-star-wars-inspired-renegades-expansion-also-announced/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest Destiny 2 expansion that released this past July. Renegades is still planned for release later this year on December 2, but ahead of that launch, we got our first look at gameplay for Renegades, and just how closely it looks to Star Wars, complete with lightsabers, Imperial-style walkers, Star Wars-sounding blasters, and X-Wing fighters.</p>

<iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In Renegades, players will delve into 'The Lawless Frontier,' which will include a series of high-risk, high-reward contracts that'll have players undertake smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage missions that can be completed solo or with a full squad.</p>



<p>The missions will take you to one of three planets across six maps that all have a Destiny foundation with a new Star Wars coat of paint to them. It's all part of how Bungie is weaving Star Wars through Destiny in this expansion.</p>



<p>Besides the new Lucasfilm digs coming in Renegades, Bungie also launched the Ash &amp; Iron update today, which has Guardians travelling back to the Plaguelands for the first time since the original Destiny game.</p>



<p>There's a new three-person fireteam activity to complete, and the rewards pass for Edge of Fate has been given a refresh along with today's update. A new raid will also be added on September 27, with the epic raid for The Desert Perpetual going live.</p>



<p>In other Bungie news, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-studio-head-pete-parsons-leaves-23-years-justin-truman-take-over/">Pete Parsons</a>, the now former studio head, left the company and went into retirement after 23 years with the studio. He wasn't studio head for that whole time, but he has been the studio head for all of Bungie's recent woes in the last decade, since he took the role in 2015.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="8BitDo Ultimate 2 wireless review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f7b1cf58cf8e2/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: PJ O'Reilly / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've been putting a procession of 8BitDo controllers through the review process since Switch 2 launched. I've covered their excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-pro-3-bluetooth-controller-tmr-sticks-and-hall-effect-triggers-elevate-this-switch-2-compatible-pad">Pro 3 controller</a>, whilst Ollie has been all over the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-arcade-controller-for-switch-plus-switch-2-the-best-way-to-play-street-fighter-6">Arcade Stick for Switch + Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">Ultimate 2C</a>, which is the budget-friendly version of what I'm taking a look at today - the 8BitDo Ultimate 2.</p>
<p>First and foremost, for anyone who doesn't gel with the shape of the Pro 3 controller, what you've got here is one that suits those lovely, soft, Xbox-controller-shaped paws you've developed over the years. I know for some this can be a dealbreaker, especially with how the thumbsticks sit horizontally aligned on the Pro 3, so if that has been holding you back, this may be the pad you're after. Things under the hood aren't showing a lot of difference otherwise.</p>
<p>Indeed, my main positive talking points remain much the same as with the Pro 3. 8BitDo has put a lot of emphasis on having the latest tech in its gear recently, and here we once again get all the big 2025 buzzwords from the exciting world of controllers. TMR sticks make the cut — a feature which still usually sees the cost of a controller rocket — and they are a joy, giving you the smoothest sticks around with all of that fancy magnetic magic that goes into making them free from the bane of stick-drift.</p>

<p>For the triggers, we're looking at snazzy Hall Effect magnetic jobs, too. So you've got all the quality included with regard to sticks and triggers, exactly the same as with the Pro 3, which makes for a solid core. The d-pad sticks to the same style as the Pro 3, too, chunky and responsive and sitting out nicely as it clicks through all of its input points.</p>
<p>Sticking with similarities between this and other 8BitDo products, the number one drawback is, of course, that these controllers don't have the ability to wake the Switch 2 up. There have been some rumblings that they're working on a solution, and the pad received an update to make it compatible with Switch 2, so this is something we could see down the line, as some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/admin/edit/news/2025/08/gulikit-launches-new-budget-controllers-with-switch-2-wake-up-support">manufacturers have already managed it</a>. However, for now, I feel like I'm capping review scores for pads that make me walk to my console to an 8 out of 10. Not out of laziness, you understand; it's a function that simply should be there.</p>
<p>If you can make peace with this — if you can somehow work around the pain of turning the console on "manual-style" — well, there isn't really much more for me to follow up with in terms of negatives. If I had to get picky, NFC support isn't there (something that doesn't interest me at all, but it will do some), and I feel as though the extra programmable 'L4' and 'R4' shoulder buttons up top make the pad a tiny little bit clicky and less solid in form than it could be.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel bad at all. In fact, it feels much like the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller 2 from Nintendo</a>, and even beats it out in having nice grippy textures on the back of the pad, but they can occasionally feel a bit loose in comparison to the rest of the inputs. You do get a total of four programmable buttons out of this, mind, with two paddles on the grips, so all in all, a very minor issue.</p>

<p>The Hall Effect triggers can be switched between regular and macro-switch modes and there's some snazzy RGB lighting in the rather unfortunately named "RGB Fire Rings" around the bases of the sticks. I'm not a huge RGB guy, as hard as it may be to believe, but these are fine in my opinion - they give off a warming glow and can be switched on and off and cycled through colours and modes via the 8BitDo software available from their site.</p>
<p>Now, speaking of this software, you need to update the controller, should you pick one up, in order to have it work on Switch 2, so be aware of this and know that you'll need a laptop or whatnot to connect for a small download. Once in the 8BitDo app, you can also then set your lighting to whatever colour you want, switch it off, have it follow and change colours to your touch, and so on.</p>

<p>This controller also comes with a big brutalist charging dock, which I have to say I kinda love. Just like the Pro 3's base, here you find your all-important USB-C receiver tucked away in a compartment, and the dock has the same slick little bar of light running along its underside, which is a lovely detail in a darkened room.</p>
<p>Before I wrap up, and with regard to battery life, I drained my controller in about 14 hours, and I believe I could have got a bit more out of it if I had turned off the RGB. So, word of warning, it's not the very best battery out there, and those lights make it ever-so-slightly worse.</p>

<p>Otherwise, in terms of specs and price point ($59.99 / £49.99), features, comfort and design, it's all gravy, even if the budget 2C wins in the value department. Yes, it could be easier to update, there's a tiny little bit of clickiness out of the 'L4' and 'R4' buttons, and the battery is weaker than I'd like, but overall this is still a premium-feeling pad, stuffed full of the latest wizardry, at a reasonable price compared to some competitors.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/loot-boxes-might-be-coming-to-marvel-rivals.1292976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new datamine from <a href="https://x.com/RivalsInfo/status/1964735415929229504">RivalsInfo on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/marvel-rivals-could-soon-be-getting-loot-boxes-1598643/">GameReactor</a>, points to Marvel Rivals getting a new kind of addition in Season 4 that's not a new set of characters joining the roster, a new map, or balance tweaks. It's loot boxes, though in-game, NetEase seems to be calling them 'Mysteries.'</p>



<p>RivalsInfo discovered the loot boxes, codenamed under 'Mysteries,' in a datamine for Season 4, but that doesn't exactly mean they'll be arriving in a few days' time when Season 4 launches on September 12, 2025. It just means that they might be coming in a future update, even if it's not the next update. </p>



<p>"<em>In Season 4, logic for the 'Mysteries' player component was reintroduced</em>," RivalsInfo writes. "<em>'Mysteries' is the codename for loot boxes. Within this component, there are multiple references to mystery box logic, such as "cosmic mysteries number" and "BOX_OPEN_HISTORY_CHANGE", which further confirms that it relates to the old loot box system. The image below shows what it might have looked like when the logic was still in the game.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Loot boxes could be coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarvelRivals?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarvelRivals</a> at some point in the future:</p><p>In Season 4, logic for the "Mysteries" player component was reintroduced. "Mysteries" is the codename for loot boxes. Within this component, there are multiple references to mystery box logic, such as… <a href="https://t.co/QjYru0AmI3">pic.twitter.com/QjYru0AmI3</a></p></div>— RivalsInfo (@RivalsInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/RivalsInfo/status/1964735415929229504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As RivalsInfo points out, even if they are introduced, it's not exactly definitive that they'll only be available if players pay real-world money for them. They could also be acquired through gameplay, as is the case with multiple free-to-play titles that have similar systems.</p>



<p>If NetEase does introduce loot boxes, then it'll be interesting to see how it handles their monetization, and reward structures. It could easily create a similar issue that many other free-to-play games deal with, having high-tier rewards locked behind the gamble of acquiring them through loot boxes.</p>



<p>Though if players are vocal enough against them, they might not be introduced at all, or at least altered, or removed entirely, if NetEase realizes it's more of a hassle to have them if players really don't want them.</p>

Several changes to the grind to increase players' Power level--the measure of the strength of their gear that determines the difficulty of content they can handle--are being walked back or adjusted to make the grind less intense.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest of those changes should be an alteration to various activities to make them more viable as part of the grind to increase Power, including activities you'll do as part of the Renegades expansion's content, as well as legacy raids and dungeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, increasing your character Power beyond a certain level is done almost exclusively with the Portal, Destiny 2's new one-stop menu for various activities, which includes a scoring system that determines what loot you receive based on the difficulty you set for the activity you're playing. That means that players are disincentivized from playing activities on the Edge of Fate destination, Kepler, if they're looking to drive up their Power. Other previously high-level activities, like raids, have been similarly pushed aside by the Portal system. With Renegades, those activities should all be more viable as methods to climb the Power ranks.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is making adjustments to how Portal works too. Bungie is removing the "featured" gear element for many Portal activities with Renegades, allowing for many more builds to be viable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4564585"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4564585-2025_ash___iron_press_kit_activity_compressed_04.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Currently, you get a bonus to your points in Portal's scoring for using featured gear, which right now is exclusively new weapons and armor that were added with Edge of Fate. That means that using old gear and weapons is an automatic disadvantage in the Portal, which has been frustrating for players, since they're forced to chase new gear and create new builds around it to maximize their scores and earn higher-tier loot.</p><p dir="ltr">Some activities will still include a featured gear element, but Bungie is altering featured gear to include all Exotic weapons and armor so players can use more of their favorite builds in the activities.</p><p dir="ltr">Another new adjustment with Edge of Fate is the inclusion of gear "tiers," which run between Tier 1 and Tier 5. Items with higher tiers have better perks and stats, generally, but that has resulted in some endgame gear feeling less rewarding. For raids and dungeons, Bungie will up the tier of all gear that drops to Tier 3, with the higher tiers being accessible from tougher versions like the "epic" version of the Edge of Fate raid, Desert Perpetual.</p><p dir="ltr">In Renegades, you'll also have the option to increase the tier of Legendary weapons using a new currency and mechanic. Bungie didn't include all the details, but the idea is that, if you get a set of perks on a gun you particularly like but it's low-tier, you won't have to throw it away in favor of seeking out the same gun at a higher level. Instead, you can boost the tier of that gun. That'll likely be an arduous process so everyone doesn't immediately blast all their guns up to Tier 5, but it should be an option to make it so you aren't immediately deleting all loot below a certain tier threshold.</p><p dir="ltr">To accommodate hanging onto more good guns in hopes of increasing their tier later, Bungie said it'll increase players' Vault space with Renegades, too--although it didn't say how much more space players can expect.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie detailed a few balance changes. It's walking back some adjustments it made to Exotics like Queensbreaker recently, and it's putting a pause on all "noncritical" nerfs to weapons and armor while it evaluates its "philosophy" on making those changes. Critical adjustments, like banning certain gear during the world's first completion race for Renegades' dungeon, will still be on the table, but for the time being, developers are holding back on making major weapon changes unless they have a very good reason to do so.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie also means to buff a few things, including the original Super abilities that launched with Destiny 2 and their subclasses. Expect those adjustments to come in waves, with some happening in October and some with Renegades. Bungie said it's putting together a roadmap for those adjustments it'll release sometime in the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with balance changes and adjustments, Bungie also detailed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-regenades-everything-we-just-learned-about-the-star-wars-inspired-expansion/2900-7004/" data-ref-id="2900-7004">what's coming in the Renegades expansion</a> and mentioned some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-festival-of-the-lost-is-getting-new-activities-check-out-the-armor/1100-6534597/" data-ref-id="1100-6534597">changes to Destiny 2's Halloween event</a>, the Festival of the Lost--and showed of this year's spooky armor sets.</p>

                <p>Some of the best games around borrow from those that set the standard before them, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311"> Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel, is no exception. Protagonist Hornet differs from the first game's Vessel in a number of ways but also features some familiar-looking animations that might remind you of one of the most influential metroidvanias of all time.</p><p>If you've enjoyed flicking Hornet about on the screen, you may have noticed a curious movement she makes when changing direction. Instead of the character model flipping to the new direction you're moving in, Hornet backsteps and looks like she's turning to face it instead. Line that up against Alucard in<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/" data-ref-id="5000-632"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>, and it's obvious where this inspiration came from.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was going to praise Silksong for having animations similar to Alucard's, but seeing them side by side, it's the same character controller lol (I love that, by the way) <a href="https://t.co/gQLJ2yNlwS" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/gQLJ2yNlwS</a></p>  — Wallace Pires (@h_wallacepires) <a href="https://twitter.com/h_wallacepires/status/1963958435487088678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>More of Hornet's animations, such as her standard and diagonal air attacks, bear some similarity to Alucard's own, but it's the backstep that looks almost ripped out of Konami's classic and endearingly recreated in its modern contemporary. Team Cherry hasn't commented on the comparison yet, but it's a nice touch that longtime fans of the genre are bond to appreciate the most.</p><p>Hollow Knight: Silksong hasn't been out for a week yet, but it's already made a massive impact, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/" data-ref-id="1100-6534478">bringing down several storefronts</a> at launch before going on to secure more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-over-5-million-players-after-just-a-few-days-analyst-says/1100-6534584/" data-ref-id="1100-6534584">5 million players in total</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Deep Silver and developer Dambuster Studios have announced that Dead Island 2 has broken through the 20 million player milestone. This comes after the game immediately turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-sales-exceed-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep Silver's best-ever launch</a>, with two million units sold in less than two months. Later, the player base expanded even more thanks to the launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Game Pass</a>, and more recently, it was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">given away for free</a> during the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA Sale. Both promotions inevitably greatly helped inflate the player figures.</p>



<p>Still, today, the publisher-developer duo also confirmed that a new franchise entry is already in development. As teased by the image, it will likely take place elsewhere, abandoning the Los Angeles setting for somewhere else.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 was released in April 2023 after a very troubled development. It changed hands not once but twice; the original project was being handled by Yager (Spec Ops: The Line, The Cycle) and was scheduled to launch in Q2 2015. However, that year, Deep Silver announced it had decided to change the development studio. In 2016, that studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/">was confirmed to be Sumo Digital</a>.</p>



<p>That didn't pan out, either. Three and a half years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was put into the hands of the internal team Dambuster Studios</a>. That was just a few months before the pandemic, which would inevitably delay the project (as it did for literally everything) even further. After all this ruckus, Dambuster's game inevitably raised some eyebrows when it approached the launch window. However, it proved everyone wrong by delivering a solid and fun core experience.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review</a>, Francesco De Meo rated Dead Island 2 7.5 out of 10:</p>



<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>

These energy-based weapons draw ammo directly from your reserves and feature a unique heat management system.</p><p>In the Lawless Frontier, Guardians will take on high-risk, high-reward jobs to complete contracts—smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage—either solo or with a fireteam. These missions span three planets and six maps inspired by iconic Star Wars locations. One feature, Invasion, allows players to opt in for additional challenges and rewards by enabling other Guardians to invade the battlefield. This introduces a layer of strategic unpredictability, where greater risk yields greater rewards.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>As part of Apple's big September event today, the company did what it usually does in September: announced a new iPhone. In fact, Apple unveiled four new iPhone models, including the "impossibly thin" iPhone Air and the more powerful iPhone 17 Pro. The others include the iPhone 17 Pro Max and a new base-model iPhone 17. All of them are launching on September 19, with preorders opening September 12.</p><p>Here are the starting prices at a glance, but note that prices go up based on the storage space you choose:</p><ul><li><strong>iPhone 17</strong> -- $800</li><li><strong>iPhone Air</strong> -- $1000</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong> -- $1,100</li><li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong> -- $1,200</li></ul><h2>iPhone Air</h2><p>At 5.6mm, it's the thinnest iPhone that Apple has ever made. It features a 6.5-inch screen and is said to be durable thanks in part to being made with titanium (80% of which comes from recycled sources).</p><p>The iPhone Air comes in black, white, gold, and blue. It runs on the A19 Pro processor, which sets new stands for mobile phones, Apple said. The GPU, meanwhile, gets improved with a 5-core setup and baked-in AI acceleration features. Users can expect "Macbook Pro levels of compute," Apple said.</p><p>The camera takes 48 megapixel photos with one lens and an 18mp front-facing camera that includes a "center stage" feature that uses AI to find the best angles. A new feature, dual capture video, allows you to record yourself with the front-facing camera while recording with the back camera.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580" data-ratio="0.56631171345595" data-width="2066" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564580"></a><figcaption>The iPhone Air.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564580-screenshot2025-09-09at1.43.26pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of battery life, Apple said the internal design has been "completely redesigned" to maximum space for the battery itself. Apple promises "all-day battery life" for the iPhone Air. There is also a MagSafe battery accessory that people can buy to extend battery life.</p><h2>iPhone 17 Pro</h2><p>The iPhone 17 Pro has the biggest battery in any iPhone, a new camera system with "breathtaking range and resolution," and the most powerful chip Apple has ever made for an iPhone, the A19 Pro. It's designed to be extremely durable, Apple said, with new protections for the front and the back. It also has a better battery that can support up to 39 hours of video playback on a single charge.</p><p>Take a look for yourself:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586" data-ratio="0.57430488974113" data-width="2086" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564586"></a><figcaption>The iPhone 17 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564586-screenshot2025-09-09at1.57.20pm.png"></figure><p>In terms of the new cameras, they include the "best camera system we've ever made," Apple said, and they include the 18mp "center stage" camera on the front and three rear cameras--all are 48 megapixels. The "extended plateau" for the camera allows for the longest optical zoom Apple has ever made.</p><h2><strong>iPhone 17 base model</strong></h2><p>The new line of iPhone 17 base-model phones will run on a new processor called A19, which is "faster and more efficient," Apple said. The new iPhones will come in five different colors: lavender, mist blue, black, white, and sage.</p><p>The new phones support 120Hz ProMotion and a larger 6.3-inch display, which Apple said will be beneficial for gaming. NetEase's Destiny: Rising will be among the games to support the 120Hz feature.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576" data-ratio="0.58842443729904" data-width="1866" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564576"></a><figcaption>The four new iPhone 17 colors.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564576-screenshot2025-09-09at1.31.45pm.png"></figure><p>A big part of having a phone is taking photos of your dog with it, and the new iPhone 17 will feature a better camera that should take more impressive photos than before, Apple said. There is a new "center stage" camera, too, to help people take better selfies, videos, and more. You also no longer need to rotate your phone to take a selfie, and the camera uses AI to automatically select the best angles.</p><p>Below you can see a rundown of the iPhone 17 base model.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578" data-ratio="0.58230256898192" data-width="2102" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4564578"></a><figcaption>A quick look at the special features of the iPhone 17.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4564578-screenshot2025-09-09at1.40.47pm.png"></figure><p>Also during the Apple event, the company announced the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Watch Series 11</a> and the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/introducing-airpods-pro-3-the-ultimate-audio-experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AirPods Pro 3.</a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>The ambitious mod <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-the-fan-remake-of-oblivion-in-skyrims-engine-will-launch-in-2025/1100-6529672/" data-ref-id="1100-6529672">Skyblivion is still aiming to release in 2025</a>, according to the mod's developers, even as one former developer on the project called it quits after nine years, claiming it's "less of a passion project and more of a crunch project."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, which has been in development for 13 years, looks to recreate Bethesda Softworks' Oblivion in the more modern engine of its sequel, Skyrim. However, far from just an engine port, Skyblivion has been described by the TESRenewal mod development team as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skyblivion-devs-make-its-case-in-light-of-oblivion-remastered-its-a-full-scale-remake/1100-6533675/" data-ref-id="1100-6533675">"a full-scale remake" of Oblivion</a>, one that features new areas, dungeons, music, gameplay enhancements, item changes, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1961922524700151893" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a> on August 30, former Skyblivion level designer Dee Keyes aired a list of grievances against those in charge of the mod's development, stating the 2025 release date first announced in 2023 was a "massive mistake" and that the project was "never in the state that the videos would show off."</p><p dir="ltr">According to Keyes, the team did what he described as "fake" polish on parts of the game featured in the trailers, but it became clear that the team was "never gonna be allowed" to achieve that same level of polish across the entire project. He said voicing concerns to those in charge fell on deaf ears, and that those came from a place of realism rather than pessimism.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are unpaid and part time: This would be a massive undertaking for a paid dev team and yet every attempt we make to beg them to postpone we are ignored," Keyes said. "It's a sad time when even passion projects are getting rushed and have devs crunching."</p><p dir="ltr">Keyes finished his statement by comparing Skyblivion to Game of Thrones' infamous Season 8, stating two lead developers, one of them being project lead Rebelzize, are "forcing it out the door before it's finished despite everyone else on the team looking to do their best."</p><p dir="ltr">While the Skyblivion team has not addressed Keyes' concerns directly, communications lead Evan Flatt said on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skyblivion/comments/1n4iqne/comment/nbly5os/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> in response to a concerned fan that the project is still aiming to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," Flatt said. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it--our goal has been to have it ready to release this year.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now, what is 'ready?' That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7ATiEK31Tqo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest development diary video, titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MH-BqXk2WA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"The Final Stretch Towards Release"</a>, looked to make a case for the mod's existence in light of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-official-oblivion-remastered-release-skyblivion-mod-dev-says-its-a-win-win/1100-6530951/" data-ref-id="1100-6530951">official Oblivion Remastered</a> releasing in April, emphasizing how the mod "reimagines Oblivion from the ground up, bringing it in line with modern RPG standards." The team most recently released a video spotlighting the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ATiEK31Tqo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first 15 minutes of Skyblivion</a>, once again describing it as an Oblivion remake. The trailer was uploaded a day after Keyes' statement.</p><p dir="ltr">In the video's description, Rebelzize said Skyblivion development has been an "uphill battle."</p><p dir="ltr">"This last leg of development has sometimes been harder than the totality of our previous years combined," Rebelzize said. "The team is not quitting until we have a game for you all to play and neither am I."</p><p dir="ltr">Skyblivion, when it does arrive, will be free to download for those who own Skyrim: Special Edition and Oblivion: GOTY Deluxe on PC.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2's latest DLC expansion, Legacy of the Forge, is now out across all platforms, alongside a new patch for the game from Warhorse Studios, <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/patch-14">Update 1.4</a>, which includes several quality of life changes, balancing tweaks, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>



<p>The DLC's release also came with a new trailer, showcasing a bit more of the new storyline that players will be able to delve and forge their own path into. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The new DLC sees Henry join the Kuttenberg Blacksmith Guild, following in his adoptive father's footsteps by not only taking up smithing, but by attempting to complete what his adoptive father, Martin, could not. Fix the town's broken astronomical clock.</p>



<p>As Henry embarks on the journey to fix the clock and repair his adoptive father's legacy, he brings Martin's colleagues back together to get the job done. Along the way, the forge becomes a new home for players and for Henry, as you're able to decorate and build out your workshop, living quarters, and nearly every inch of the forge to your liking. </p>



<p>The expansion adds at least 15 more hours of game time for players who've rinsed everything else that Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has to offer. While Update 1.4 adds a few welcomed balance tweaks, like halbreds being "<em>twice as durable</em>" now, and increased quality for the Trollbane hammer.</p>



<p>If you've purchased the Gold Edition of the game or the Expansion Pass, then all you need to do is update Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to start playing the DLC. Otherwise, you'll have to grab it separately for £11.49.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jump-ship">Jump Space</a>! It's a game with a name that'll have you thinking, "wait, that's not what it was called, was it?" And you'd be right about that, as due to some trademark problems, the game was <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506209223025108363">rebranded</a> from Jump Ship to its new name Jump Space back in August. Later that same month, developer Keepsake Games announced the game would be launching into early access September 19th. And now, as in today September 9th now, Keepsake Games have shared an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1757300/view/506212394141221550">early access roadmap</a> for the game, as well as how much it'll cost you.
</p>
<p>
Right, let's get the pricing out of the way. It'll be a pretty reasonable $19.99 / £16.75 / €19.50, making it the latest anticipated September release to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-wont-cost-nearly-as-much-as-they-could-probably-charge-for-it">priced in a way that'll have you wondering why they're not charging more</a>. On to the roadmap!
</p>
<p>
At launch, the sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> will include nine mission types. These include one where you'll try not to kick the bucket while fending off a bunch of robots, where you have to hunt for loot, and another where you'll be raiding some baddies' bases. There'll be more than 50 sectors to play in four galaxy regions, and you'll have two ships to choose from with 26 ship components to make them a bit more custom.
</p>
<p>
That's all a part of Chapter 1, The Resistance Coalition. Chapter 2: Atira Strikes back will bring a lot more to the game like multiple endless modes, sector modifiers, melee weapons, more story and sectors, new enemies, mission types, a photo mode, offline support and a lot more. These will be coming through multiple updates through to Q1, 2026, but a couple of features from this chapter, text chat and lobby browser, will be available at launch.
</p><p>
Then after that, Chapter 3: Secrets of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/telmari">Telmari</a> will add in a first-person pilot view, a scanner revamp, even more new enemies and mission types, a new ship, ground boss, and again, even more. These will start to be added from Q1 2026 onwards until Chapter 4: Heart of Corruption, which doesn't have a release window or any revealed features just yet. That's a lot of bloody stuff!
</p>
<p>
As of now, Keepsake doesn't know when early access will end and the 1.0 release will release, so you'll just have to join them for the ride in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
Jump Space launches into early access September 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">Steam</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2%E2%80%99s-most-visually-impressive-port-just-got-better.1292892/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> recently landed on Nintendo Switch 2, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-assassins-creed-shadows-framerate-2000621760">despite some initial fears</a> that it would look and run terribly, the game is a bit of a technical marvel and easily the most impressive Switch 2 port yet. And now, a new update has improved this already wonderful-looking open-world action game on Nintendo’s hybrid console. Plus, a demo is coming, too.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123">Ubisoft and Massive’s open-world <em>Star Wars: Outlaws </em></a>was an incredibly gorgeous game when it launched last year. Sure, stealth sections could be annoying and combat could feel a bit stiff, but getting to walk around a perfectly recreated section of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe freely was amazing. <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-patch-stealth-speeder-softlock-1851665149">And some later updates improved the game a lot</a>, introducing some visual improvements on top of some significant gameplay tweaks.&nbsp; So I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted up <em>Outlaws</em> on a Switch 2. Turns out, Ubisoft Red Lynx, who ported the game, did an amazing job. While it’s capped at 30FPS and lacks some of the higher-fidelity assets from the bigger console ports, this version of <em>Outlaws</em> is extremely playable, looks sharp, and feels great in handheld mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/XlKCBGzrB1I">As explained by Digital Foundry, it’s truly an extraordinary port.</a> Now, Ubisoft has made it look even better with the game’s first Switch 2 update.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/5d48mFSwXrfRnDvvBmOl7F/nintendo-switch-2-title-update-1">On September 8, Ubisoft put out a patch for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em> on Switch 2</a> that features numerous visual improvements. Players should now see less “pop in,” less flickering smoke, better shadows, nicer-looking leaves, and a host of other “small visual fixes.” For a game that already felt like it was pushing the Switch 2’s hardware to its limits, I’m impressed by Ubisoft cranking the knob a bit more to eke out an even nicer-looking port.</p> <p>Oh, and if you want to see the game in action on your Switch 2 without buying it, good news: <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/1kKhQ1Heps7YmSJdFiV87L/switch-2-release-faq">Ubisoft has updated the game’s FAQ page</a> to confirm that a demo for <em>Outlaws</em> is coming. Ubisoft says it will “share more information soon” about this upcoming demo.&nbsp; Anyway, here’s the full patch list for the new <em>Outlaws</em> update on Switch 2.</p> <p><strong>General Gameplay</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed several issues where NPCs would not spawn, e.g. when chasing Kay during the ‘Crashed’ quest on Toshara</li> <li>Reduced likelihood of Kay being stuck when traversing the environment</li> <li>Improved hiding and detection when in tall grass on Akiva</li> <li>Various stability improvements and other minor fixes</li> </ul> <p><strong>Graphics</strong></p> <ul> <li>Improvements made to visual quality when moving quickly through the world or using binoculars, with less “pop in”</li> <li>Reduced flickering with smoke and lighting</li> <li>Improved shadows at the edge of the screen when moving in cities and stations</li> <li>Improved quality of leaves, cloth and other things that let light through</li> <li>Various other small visual fixes and improvements</li> </ul> <p><strong>Camera</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed camera movement when traversing certain objects in certain ways with Kay</li> </ul> <p><strong>UI</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed controller image types and directional button prompts when switching between Joy-Con and Pro Controller</li> <li>Fixed the gadget inventory HUD not resizing when using the handheld preset custom scaling settings</li> </ul> <p><strong>Wild Card Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Fixed an issue where NPCs would not be highlighted when using Nix to plant a card</li> </ul> <p><strong>A Pirate’s Fortune Story Pack</strong></p> <ul> <li>Mynocks are now visible when attached to your ship</li> </ul>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I thought it had been rather quiet round these parts lately. It turns out it's been several months since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</a> creator Hideki Kamiya had a tantrum about anything on social media. What are you steamed up about today, Kamiya-san? Ah, of course, Hideo Kojima. Specifically, Kojima's long-lost horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pt">P.T.</a> - a collaboration with movie-maker Guillermo del Toro which Konami banished from PlayStation Network in 2015, after cancelling Kojima's associated Silent Hills project.</p><!--more-->
<p>That P.T. is one of the finest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror games</a> ever made and also, no longer officially available online is one of the better arguments for the wholesale nuking of the games industry. Seriously, if this is how you're going to behave, Konami, let's tear it all down and put the cockroaches in charge. Norman Reedus wept like a seal the night you deleted the storepage. Fortunately, he's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">found other work since</a>.</p>
<p>How does Kamiya propose to set the world to rights? By making his own new version of P.T., except that his version wouldn't be a horror game, because Kamiya hates horror, even though he directed the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>. Erm.</p>
<p>One inclines to suspect that this Hideki Kamiya man may not be entirely serious in the things that he says on yonder <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633">TwiX</a>. Here's the full quote, anyway, as translated and passed along by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-should-make-a-new-pt-style-game-or-maybe-i-will-says-bayonetta-and-devil-may-cry-creator-hideki-kamiya">IGN</a>. "[I]f it's impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style," Kamiya wrote, adding: "if Kojima doesn't do it, maybe I'll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn't be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</p><p>I'm propagating Kamiya's bullshit because it's an excuse to start a comments thread discussion about P.T. If you never played it, allow me to sum it up the same way I summed it up to some party guests back in 2014, after they had the insolence to defeat me at Scrabble: there is an L-shaped corridor, and all you have to do is exit through the other end. My guests left that night white-faced and falsetto, shortly after getting the initial radio puzzle wrong. That'll learn the bastards to pop a cheeky "Quoth" on a triple-word tile.</p>
<p>P.T. may be long gone, and also, never actually released on PC, but it has spawned many imitators. There are the fullscale fan clones knocked together in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/of-course-somebody-recreated-pt-in-vr-using-half-life-alyx">the Half-Life: Alyx engine</a> and, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pt-is-even-creepier-as-an-old-macintosh-game">Hypercard</a>, and also, chilly apartment tours like <a href="https://shop.redcandlegames.com/app/devotion">Devotion</a> that apply something of the same claustrophobia.</p>
<p>Swivelling back to Kamiya in closing, the absolute best thing that can come of all this foolery is for Kojima to respond to Kamiya on Twitter, so that Kamiya can block him immediately. Kamiya does so love doing that.</p>
<p>Further reading: Philippa Warr's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/horror-games-silent-hill-2">very old ruminations about trying to get into horror</a>. Fortunately for Pip, Alice O (also RPS in peace) found a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/qt-is-pt-but-cute-see-and-its-free">cute version of P.T. in 2019</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-car-cloud-gaming-lg-kia-2000624462</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98everything-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-crusade-is-coming-for-your-car.1292856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft wants to turn your car <a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984">into an Xbox, too</a>. Not content just to stream Game Pass to your TV, laptop, or smartphone, it’s also aiming to beam hits like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> directly into your Kia Sportage. Microsoft and LG announced a new partnership on Tuesday to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to over 20 million internet-connected vehicles by 2030. Who’s ready to play <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> in the back of their Uber?</p> <p>“Our work with LG is the latest example of Xbox expanding to new places, building on partnerships that already bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to mobile devices, PCs, and TVs,” Xbox marketing VP Christopher Lee <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/09/xbox-cloud-gaming-vehicles-cars-lg/">said in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;“By adding vehicles to the mix, we’re giving players more choice than ever in how they enjoy their games.”</p>  <p>The initiative only pertains to EVs that support LG’s webOS Automotive Content Platform (ACP) which at this point is primarily Kia and mostly not in the U.S. But LG exec Eun Seok-hyun is promising there will be 20 million of these vehicles on the road&nbsp;<em>somewhere</em> in the next five years. Whether that includes the country where Microsoft is headquartered or not will depend on whether Congress ever revives the electric vehicle tax credit program it recently killed. Otherwise anyone who wants to make their car into an Xbox will have to do it <a href="https://xboxfreedom.com/xbox-360-game-car-installation-2265">the old-fashioned way</a>.</p> <p>Xbox’s recent pivot to being hardware-agnostic comes as it’s developing dedicated gaming OS layers for Windows on PC handhelds and bringing more of its exclusives to PS5 and Switch 2. It’s unclear if that will move the needle much on the overall growth of Game Pass, which hasn’t announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-game-pass-xbox-podcast-date-1851261824">new subscriber numbers in over a year</a>. This new campaign to turn cars into Xboxes comes just as Microsoft announces <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">a mandatory return</a> to the office for all employees within a 50-mile radius of its Redmond campus. Now they’ll have something new to do while sitting in traffic, at least eventually.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s home for you? For much of my childhood, the back of a station wagon on the road between wherever the Navy stationed my old man. Then it was Florida. After I escaped, it was a small apartment in New York, then a slightly bigger apartment, and finally, a house. We tend to define ourselves by where we live at any given time, our memories of a time, of who we were, of the people who made those moments memorable, tied with a cord of steel to a specific place, for both good and ill. People fight for their homes. They rebuild after wars, famine, natural disasters. They preserve places, because those places are a part of us. What wouldn’t you do for your home, your community? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven’t played a ton of Octopath Traveler 0 yet, but from the jump I know the ideas of home and community were core to Square’s latest entry in the venerated HD-2D series. That’s probably because the first thing I did was build a house. Octopath Traveler 0 is a revenge story. See, your hometown of Wishvale was destroyed, and you’re (understandably) real mad about it, so you set out to get them who wronged you and restore Wishvale to its former glory. That means literally rebuilding the town, so that was the first thing I did.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Octopath Traveler 0 Nintendo Direct July 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Octopath Traveler 0’s townbuilding is honestly pretty neat. <em>[Editor's Note: We have since learned that the size of your town will have </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/octopath-traveler-0-platform-specs-reveal-town-size-limitations-on-some-devices">different limitations depending on which platform you're playing on</a><em>.]</em> I’m the kind of guy who spent a lot of his time in Age of Empires building beautiful cities, so it clicked with me immediately. You can build houses and other buildings of different design, assign who’s going to live where, make cobblestone paths, plant flowers and place benches, craft gardens to tend to, and find just the right place for storage crates to hold the lumber and other materials you’ll need to make stuff. There’s also trees, wells, chests, and all kinds of other things, and there’s plenty of freedom to make the town you want.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But rebuilding Wishvale is only part of it. You can also do stuff in town, too, like cook food that you can use later and chat with the townspeople, and even upgrade the buildings for additional functionality. It’s pretty neat, and even though I only spent about ten or so minutes with it, I appreciated the joy (and serenity) of building a neat little town.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that, it was time for a more traditional Octopath experience. My assigned protagonist, who is the only character that can change classes in Octopath Traveler 0, and seven of his closest buddies were in the sandy town of Sunshade looking for a merchant named Ludo. The long and short of it was that we needed a merchant to help us establish trade. After my buddy Phenn put his foot in his mouth and mistook Ludo for some random kid, which went about as well as you’d expect, he turned us down flat. Not because he was still mad, but because Wishvale had been destroyed before. Why do business with a town that couldn’t protect itself?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, Ludo made us a deal: if we took out the pack of lizardmen that had been terrorizing the new trade route, he’d consider helping us out. With no other options before us and a love for our town as motivation, my merry band set out to do just that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was only one problem. As we made our way out of Sunshade, I saw a woman hanging out by herself. When I preview a game, I try to play it like I would if I were playing normally. And years of JRPG-playing have taught me that if you see someone, you should chat with them. So we sauntered on over. The woman in question asked to see my protagonist’s ring. A little weird, but okay. After admiring it, she asked if she could keep it. Uh oh. I knew where this was going, but there was no way out of it. I said no, and then she said she’d take it from us anyway. Cue fight.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo1-1757372112185.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where I got my first glimpse of Octopath Traveler 0’s combat system. If you’re played the previous two Octopaths, you know how 0 works. Essentially, your job is to find out what attacks your opponent is weak against, use those to wear down their defenses until they break, and then use limited boosts to charge up your attacks and lay on the hurt while they’re vulnerable. It’s a good system, but 0 adds a couple of unique twists on top of that. First, like I said earlier, the protagonist is the only one who can change their class. Everyone else comes with their class, and it doesn’t change. Like Henry Ford said about the Model T, “you can have it in any color you want as long as it’s black.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other big change is the ability to swap characters from your front to your back line at will. Characters in the back line can’t attack, but they regain health and skill points every turn. So if someone's taking a beating, it’s probably a good idea to swap them to the back line and let them catch their breath. This required more micromanaging on my part, but when I got the hang of it, it reminded me of getting into a groove when you’re bowling and everything you throw is a strike. You just <em>flow</em>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo2-1757372159854.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The other benefit of this system is that, because every character comes with their own boost charges, you have a lot more opportunities for big damage when you finally break someone’s defenses. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. I spent so long on the Woman Who Really Wanted My Ring that I was beginning to worry I wouldn’t have enough time to play the actual demo I’d been sent here to play. But eventually, she went down and I sprinted off to deal with the lizardmen, who were holed up in some nearby ruins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These fights went much more smoothly. After my would-be Ring Thief, a bunch of lizards who walk on two legs wasn’t that big of a deal. Through it all, I was impressed by how fast Octopath managed to feel without ever sacrificing how good its tactical gameplay feels. I was always making interesting decisions, even in more minor fights. And that battle theme had me vibing in my chair as I played.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/08/octo3-1757372256593.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I got to the Lizardmen Leader, who looked like he wandered in out of a Ray Harryhausen joint, and I was like, “Oh.” And man, that fight was tough. He had two minions, a ton of health, and he hit hard. But I stuck to what had gotten me to the dance. I found his weaknesses, exploited them, and when his defense was broken, I hit him with boosted attacks or a flashy Ultimate Technique. I wanted to pour it on as much as I could before he could shore up his defenses again. It wasn’t easy; several of my party members fell, and I had to use my items to bring them back, but he hit the floor just as my demo wrapped. Oh, and we earned the respect of Ludo, who followed up and stepped in to help when things looked bleak. Put one on the board for the good guys.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I put my controller down, I was really impressed with Octopath Traveler 0. Its combat feels like a step above its already excellent predecessors, it still has that gorgeous HD-2D look, and the soundtrack is fantastic based on what I’ve heard so far. All of those things are great, and I hope the whole game is as good as the little slice I got to sample, but honestly, the thing that stuck with me was Wishvale. Often, RPGs have enormous stakes. The fate of the world is on your shoulders. Here, I was just trying to rebuild my village and punish the people responsible for what happened to it. I like how much smaller that focus is, how much more intimate. Maybe it doesn’t stay that way. But as far as motivations go, fighting for your home is a good one, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t interested in rebuilding Wishvale when the time comes.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/in-octopath-traveler-0-revenge-is-a-dish-best-served-in-hd-2d]]></content:encoded>

We've broken down all of the details of everything included in this new addition below, alongside where you can preorder it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Preorder Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Ultima Limited Edition</h2><div id="227782" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="b4bce810-e6f3-40f6-83ac-b989e2978955"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Ultima Limited Edition - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><div catalogid="b4bce810-e6f3-40f6-83ac-b989e2978955" id="227783"><div id="227783" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - Ultima Limited Edition - Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the main Space Marine 2 game and a very cool white and gold steelbook that features Lieutenant Titus on the front and a Tyranid on the back, the Ultima Limited Edition also comes with exclusive artwork, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-year-2-roadmap-reveals-content-plan-for-patch-10-right-up-to-2026s-patch-15-including-new-weapons-a-new-class-and-much-more">Season Pass 1 and 2</a> (which comes with a wide variety of decals, colors, armor pieces, and champion skins) and the Macragge's Chosen DLC.

IGN's Chris Reed said in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">Space Marine 2 review</a> that it's "a terrific third-person shooter with a compelling story, loads of weapons that are a blast to use, and a healthy variety of enemies to use them on. It once again borrows many of its ideas from the Gears of War series, but they’re good ideas, and Space Marine 2 does a fine job of making them its own."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">Space Marine 3 officially in development over at Saber Interactive</a>, there's truly no better time to jump back into this world and savor everything available in it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Silksong's map dwarfs Hollow Knight in comparison.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you thought Hollow Knight's depths were vast, Hollow Knight: Silksong easily surpasses the original game. Team Cherry's long-awaited and highly anticipated sequel takes place in Pharloom, a new location that completely dwarfs the original in scope. We've visualized the difference and built a Silksong interactive map so you can explore it yourself at your own pace without getting completely lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Big is Silksong? Map Size Compared to Hollow Knight</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">When you first dive into Silksong, its map might not feel much different from Hollow Knight's; both have many locations to discover and plenty of hidden areas and tunnels begging to be explored. But when you look closer, you realize just how dense Silksong is in comparison.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/silkmap-vs-hollowmap-1757424043958.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Silksong's map (left) vs. Hollow Knight's map (right)</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight features around 15 distinct areas across the Hallownest. By comparison, Silksong's Pharloom features <strong>around 29 distinct areas</strong>, almost doubling the map size. When viewed at the same scale, as shown in our image above, Silksong's map (left) is clearly much denser and taller, with stacked vertical layers and endless sprawling passages and tunnels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More areas means more to do, meaning the larger world of Silksong brings a much longer playtime than Hollow Knight, over 200 enemies, and tougher bosses to defeat. Exploration feels much deeper too, with vertical paths that put your navigation (and jumping) skills to the test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you enjoyed the sense of discovery in Hollow Knight, Pharloom promises even more out-of-the-way quests and plenty of secrets tucked into hidden corners, though this means it's easier to get lost in, especially when trying to track down collectibles or side quests.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Explore Pharloom With IGN's Silksong Interactive Map</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">This is where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/hollow-knight-silksong/pharloom"><strong>IGN's Silksong interactive map</strong></a> comes in, an essential companion tool for any player looking to explore the world of Pharloom. You can zoom in on each location, check the layout of different areas, and track your progress as you play using our handy map markers and checkmarks.</p><output><figure><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ign.com/maps/hollow-knight-silksong/pharloom"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Click on the image above to go to IGN's Silksong interactive map!</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Want to focus only on bosses? Toggle the Boss filter to see exactly where they are. Hunting down side quests? Switch on the Wish and NPC filters to reveal quest and character locations. If you're tracking down collectibles, we have an entire section for that, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Mask_Shard_(Health_Upgrade)_Locations"><strong>Mask Shards</strong></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Lost_Flea_Locations"><strong>Lost Fleas</strong></a>, and much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our built-in checklist system lets you mark off your progress as you play right from the map itself, turning it into a living guide. Finished a quest? Check it off. Unlocked a new Tool or Crest? Mark it as complete. The map automatically updates as you go and saves your progress, so you always know what's next on your adventure through Pharloom.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hollow Knight: Silksong Guides</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While our Silksong interactive map is an indisposable tool for your adventure, it can't answer every burning question you may have. That's where our Silksong wiki comes in! We've got plenty of useful guides to assist you, whether it's teaching you a strategy to defeat a certain boss or simply listing off tips and tricks to help you survive for longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our Hollow Knight: Silksong guide coverage includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks">Essential Tips and Tricks</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Walkthrough">Walkthrough</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Wish_Sidequests">Wish Sidequests</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/How_to_Unlock_Double_Jump_(Faydown_Cloak)">How to Unlock Double Jump (Faydown Cloak)</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Cheats_and_Secrets">Cheats and Secrets</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Boss_Guides">Boss Guides</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/List_of_Tools">List of Tools</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong/Spool_Fragment_Locations">Spool Fragment Locations</a></li><li>And much more!</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Visit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong"><strong>our Silksong Wiki</strong></a> for more Hollow Knight: Silksong game help.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Meg Koepp is a Guides Editor on the IGN Guides team, with a focus on trends.
