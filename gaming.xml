		<p>The Pokémon Day stream gave us a first gameplay trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, including some huge changes for Pokémon battles and returning fan-favourite features. They’ve also re-confirmed that the game will launch this year for Nintendo Switch with a Late 2025 release window.</p>
<p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M_KNDtKJJ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The “extended” look at the game amounted to a three and a half minute narrated walkthrough of the game’s setting and key features.</p>
<p>it’s set in Lumiose City from the Kalos region of Pokémon X&amp;Y with Prism Tower at its heart while the urban landscape undergoes a redevelopment plan to make it better for Pokémon and people to share. Once you reach the city at the start of the game, you’ll be able to choose from Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile as the three starters – pour one out for Cyndaquil fans, as Tepig replaces him in the Gen 2 line-up.</p>
<p>Naturally there’s a new frenemy to be your rival, either Urbain or Taunie, depending on the appearance you choose for yourself in the game. The hotel you stay at is run by AZ and his partner Pokémon Floette, returning from Pokémon X&amp;Y. At the head of the redevelopment plan is Quasartico Inc. and their CEO Jett and her subordinate Vinnie.</p>

<p>Throughout the city are wild zones for Pokémon to thrive, locked off by numbered green gates. Here you’ll use the same style of catching mechanics as in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>, just throwing Poké Balls at creatures, and using your Pokémon’s abilities to weaken tougher targets.</p>
<p>Pokémon battles have been given an overhaul so that both the player and Pokémon can move around in the battle arenas, dodging incoming attacks and then triggering moves in real time – this is a huge change up from the turn-based battles that have been the series staple. The fan-favourite Mega Evolution system returns from X&amp;Y with Pokémon unlocking a new level of power when triggered.</p>
<p>There’s no sign that the gameplay here was captured on anything but a base Nintendo Switch. The trailer only mentions the Switch and uses only the first generation Switch console logo. We obviously expect the game will run on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> – Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility – but there’s no mention of Switch 2 enhancements at this time. Maybe in April?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-%E2%80%9Cdisappointing%E2%80%9D-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall.1120719/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-gaming-financial-reports-disappointing-2024-revenue-continues-to-fall/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. has released its <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">financial summary</a> for the final quarter of 2024, as well as an overview of the year as whole. While most of it does focus on its other subsidiaries, such as television and film, it does discuss the earnings of the gaming division.</p>
<p>For many, it doesn't come as a surprise to find that Warner Bros.'s Gaming division did not have a good financial year at all, and revenue was down overall. According to the report, the game division's revenue had decreased by 29%, which isn't too surprising considering that the company didn't have any major releases compared to when Hogwarts Legacy and Mortal Kombat 1 were released in the prior year quarter.</p>
<p>Aside from the company's revenue, it has released some devastating news as of late, where it was announced that three of its studios were going to be closed. These studios are <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/">Monolith Productions</a>, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. Thus far, the reception to this announcement has not been taken well, as these studios had incredibly talented teams that produced some great games over the years, including F.E.A.R. and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, for example. A lot of the fan irritation comes from the fact that these companies were never given the opportunity to make further brilliant games like the Middle-earth titles and instead felt that they were being "sat on." Along with the news of the studio closures came the news that the Wonder Woman game that was in development would no longer be released.</p>
<p>The two major Warner Bros. games that were released in the last year both did not perform to expectations. So much so that both <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/">MultiVersus</a> are both closing down as a result of this before the games had even been in general release for a year. Moreover, MultiVersus was technically in a bizarre beta-early Access limbo phase for a long period of its lifespan and spent even less time fully released to the gaming market.</p>
<p>In the report, it's also mentioned in the Q4 2024 highlights that Games content expense had decreased 20% ex-FX, which was driven by lower revenues, with it being partially offset by additional impairments. In total, it came to $50 million for the quarter, and $384 million for the year.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has been having an incredibly tough time with its gaming division as of late, and it'll need a really magnificent game to help the company pull through. There is the possibility of more potential Batman games, as James Gunn recently mentioned that he has been in talks with Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop further <a href="https://wccftech.com/dc-studios-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-for-new-dc-video-games/">DC games</a>. However, it has not been stated what these games could be.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-console-versions-coming-in-summer-updated-roadmap-reveals.1120716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>console ports will be arriving in summer, and that you can look forward to a major free update for the game in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>Back in November, 11 bit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">shared the first</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, which promised a free update, console ports, and the game's first major DLC sometime this year. Now, the studio has released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised roadmap</a> that gets much more specific.</p>

<p>First up, a major update is coming on May 8th. 11 bit simply says this update will "adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners". How mysterious!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=jlHnQTFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=P0dX5UaI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s console ports are officially coming in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the major new update and the console port release timing, 11 bit studios also announced a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s first DLC&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>. It's launching in fall, apparently.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both the&nbsp;<em>Aurora&nbsp;</em>DLC and&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s as-yet-unnamed third major expansion still don't have release windows more specific than this year and next, respectively, but at least we know roughly when the first one's coming.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive on consoles, it'll be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. You won't be getting any last-gen ports of the game, unfortunately, so PS4, Xbox One, and Switch owners are out in the cold (or not, as the case may be).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's the followup to 11 bit studios' 2018 city-building survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>tasks you with building a city and tending to its citizens' needs amidst a harsh, everlasting winter.</p>




<p>Released in September, the game took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days to become profitable</a> for 11 bit studios, so it's no wonder console ports and DLC are proceeding apace.</p>

<p>However, things aren't quite as rosy elsewhere in 11 bit land; back in December, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">canceled its console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em></a>, while ambitious-looking upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-again-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to a nebulous point in 2025</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are due to arrive in summer.

<p>Some things I have smashed through in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/">the demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deliver-at-all-costs">Deliver At All Costs</a>: fire hydrants, surf boards, barns, an entire laundromat, street lamps, palm trees, garbage cans, several pedestrians, mailboxes, food stalls, fish markets, brick walls, a lookout tower, dumpsters, housewives, the city fountain, and a row of unsuspecting sunbathers. This toy-like messabout is proof of one thing. Almost every problem can be solved by driving a 1950s truck straight through it. </p>

<p>Deliver At All Costs was announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deeply-destructive-driving-game-deliver-at-all-costs-will-see-you-smashing-1950s-america-to-pieces">in September last year</a>, a delivery game that's part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, part <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a>. You play as underemployed courier boy Winston, who is running odd jobs for a delivery company with some eccentric management. The trailer showed enough wanton environmental destruction that the heinous sandcastle kicker inside me was intrigued. Now it has a demo out for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a>, and I can confirm: it feels good to smash.</p>

<p>That's in large part thanks to the driving. An isometric-ish perspective can work a certain magic on a driving game, I've often found. It makes vehicles feel toy-like, as if you're a nipper racing your Hot Wheels around from on-high. That's the case here. It helps that the car movement itself is smooth and satisfying. You drift in gratifying curves, your speed is never so fast you can't keep an eye on what's coming, and a certain amount of helpful braking is automatically applied just in the act of turning. </p>
<p>There's a little bit of story leading you through your time on the island of St Monique - a fictional tropical territory of the United States in the 1950s. The first mission will see you delivering a case of exploding fireworks across the island, dodging the explosions that threaten to pop your wheels if you hit a runaway firecracker. But it's fine. You can get out and repair your wheels with tools easily enough.</p>
<p>That and the forgiving respawn gives me the feeling this tire smoker is more interested in the gags it can create through reckless deliverymanship than in actually throwing big challenges your way. But the next mission is at least a little trickier. You've got to drive 60 stinking watermelons to an insecticide plant without too many flying overboard when you rush over potholes or take a corner too fast.</p>
<figure>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>I spent a big chunk of the demo ignoring the story mode entirely, choosing instead to drive around and explore the five zones of the island already open in the demo. I smashed through greenhouses along the tropical coast of one region and blazed through the trainyards, factories, and sheds of another more industrial district. There are also side missions you can pick up by chatting to civilians (the mayor wants me to find his body double because he can't be arsed going to budget meetings himself).</p>
<p>As for how GTA-like it gets, well, it doesn't have the same hunger for raw violence. You can run over pedestrians but they bounce harmlessly around as immortal ragdolls. Although, they will get furious and chase you down with baseball bats, and will shove you onto the ground if you step  outside the car to face them. You can't hijack any car driving around the streets, but any parked car is fair game. I could've also hopped into a phone booth and used it to recall the company truck, but by this stage it was more chaotic just to source my next fencewrecker from the streets.</p>
<p>I very much admire when a game smashes the right "gamefeel" for its theme, and going by the demo Deliver At All Costs has some of that slip-slidey <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> goodness. The full game doesn't have a release date yet. But we'll let you know when it's out for delivery.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is just getting into the hands of players, but Capcom has already revealed its plans for the game’s first title update.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the developers gave a first look at what players can expect when Title Update 1 releases. </p>



<p>Right off the bat, Capcom says that the update will arrive sometime in early April and will be free for all players. The timing, they say, allows players to have “enough time to prepare for the new content, and challenges”.</p>



<p>Speaking of challenges, the update will introduce a new monster “at a level above Tempered”. There will also be a new place for players who’ve completed the game’s main story to gather with other hunters.</p>







<p>More information on what else is coming in the update will be revealed as its release gets closer.  That will include any other new features being added as well as any fixes or changes to the game.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is available for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think of the first details for Monster Hunter Wilds Title Update 1? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>GOG is adding FEAR Platinum to its Preservation Program "by next month".</p>
<p>GOG announced the upcoming addition following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Warner Bros' shock closure of its developer Monolith Productions</a> this week.</p>
<p>The team at GOG stated it was initially planning on bringing  FEAR Platinum - which along with the base game also includes both expansions - to the program at a later date, but due to the studio closure it wanted to "accelerate this release to properly recognise Monolith's contributions to gaming".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-vr2-price-has-been-permanently-reduced-to-399.1120632/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-price-reduced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The price of the PlayStation VR2 headset has been permanently cut in all regions, Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/?sf276497679=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> today.</p>
<p>From March, the virtual reality headset will be available for $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle, which includes the headset, the Sense controller, stereo headphones, and a voucher code for the Horizon Call of the Mountain game, will also be available for the same price. The lower price also makes it a more enticing buy for those looking for a PC VR headset, as the PlayStation VR2 headset can be used on PC with the adapter that was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">last year.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 launched two years ago but failed to significantly impact the market, mostly due to its high launch price, which has essentially stayed the same until now, not counting temporary price drops and deals. Still, the high price was worth it for VR aficionados, as the headset delivered a next-gen VR experience that is significantly superior to that offered by its predecessor, as Kai highlighted in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Sony’s PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation console’s power.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-staff-the-day-off-for-monster-hunter-wilds.1120629/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced that it's giving most of its staff the day off on Friday, and while a concrete reason isn't stated, it's almost certainly because that's the day on which&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>comes out.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a notice on the Japanese Pocketpair X account states that the studio's bosses have been receiving "mysterious" messages from staff, who claim they'll be "unwell tomorrow".</p>

<p>Pocketpair then says that because it's expecting a large volume of employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">call in mysteriously sick on Friday</a>, it's decided to give the majority of its staff the day off. However, the studio also says that updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and <i>Craftopia</i>&nbsp;will be unaffected by this holiday.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=m-gZo3Mr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=wVW-pyUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is probably what a lot of Pocketpair employees will be seeing on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, Pocketpair actually did the same thing back in 2022 for the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>release date, so it's clear the studio understands just how badly its staff is going to want to play these massive, time-consuming epics.</p>

<p>It looks like Pocketpair isn't the only one that wants to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, either. The game's first open beta, which took place in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam records</a> for the franchise, and that's including fully-released games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of, er, monster-hunting action RPGs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/618705/pokemon-legends-z-a-chikorita-tepig-totodile-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/charles-pulliam-moore">Charles Pulliam-Moore</a> <span>is a reporter focusing on film, TV, and pop culture. Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Like its predecessor, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> </em>is bringing back three classic starter pokémon to get you started on your next adventure.</p><p>Though <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>will likely introduce a number of new creatures, Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile will be the first three partner pokémon you can choose between as you journey into the depths of Lumiose City. The starters were the stars of the <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>teaser The Pokémon Company debuted during this year’s Pokémon Presents. Details about the game are still sparse, but we now know a little bit more about how its battles will work.</p><p>Like other <em>Pokémon </em>games, you will be able to fight wild pokémon found throughout certain areas, but rather than just launching attacks turn by turn, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>will require players to think strategically about the range moves have and where their monsters are on the battlefield. The video — which focuses on how moves can have different effects and levels of damage depending on a pokémon’s position on the field — makes <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s battles look a bit like fighting in <em>Diablo</em>. </p><p>The video also emphasizes how, because the game is set entirely in Lumiose, many of the areas where wild pokémon can be found are special locations like alleys and rooftops, where the creatures are learning to cohabitate with humans. Like in <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a></em>, players will be able to catch monsters <em>without </em>battling in some cases by simply throwing pokéballs at them from a distance.</p><p>That mechanic, in particular, should make the game feel much more fluid than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet, </em>but we won’t know for sure until <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>debuts for the Switch family of systems sometime later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

From the trailer, we've seen it will definitely include both Mega Evolution and Terastalization, and the reveal suggested it will canvas all different types and eras of Pokémon battles.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Pokémon Champions will connect with Pokémon Home, allowing players to transfer Pokémon from all other games to battle in it and finally giving fans something to do with the hundreds of Pokémon just sitting in their boxes from past generations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Champions is "now in development" for both Nintendo Switch and mobile, but did not get a release date. It will be playable in Latin American Spanish at launch in addition to other languages previously available in Pokémon games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/27/pokmon-presents-2-27-2025-4-1740667969476.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Key art for Pokemon Champions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Champions appears to be the same as Pokémon Synapse, a game that first leaked last year as part of the larger "Freak Leak" that saw tons of internal Game Freak info drop online, including unreleased games, meeting notes, Pokémon designs, and more. At the time, the most firm details we had were that it was being co-developed by Game Freak and ILCA, while everything else seemed to be a work-in-progress and a bit speculative. Those who looked into the leak suggested it was a multiplayer game of some kind and some compared it to Splatoon, but that comparison seems to have been slightly off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything else we saw at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-presents-february-2025-everything-announced">today's Pokémon Presents right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Luimiose City is undergoing a "high-tech urban redevelopment plan" that aims to turn the city into a place people and Pokemon can share together. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like Pokemon Legends: Arceus, players will run around big open spaces and encounter Pokemon they can run into and try to catch or battle to weaken. However, battles will be a bit more advanced this time around. Moves now have shorter and longer reach and an area of effect, meaning position is very important. Mega Evolution will also be part of this game and can change the tide of battle at any time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There also seems to be a lot of verticality in Pokemon Legends: Z-A, as the player is seen zooming up to the top of a building, exploring rooftops, and even jumping from building to building.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokemon live in places called Wild Zones, which appear to be gated by level or something similar, and this is where the majority of your encounters seem to take place.

More PokéCoins, less money spent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you’re sitting on 7,000 PokéCoins, you might be wondering what to spend them on. Should you hoard them for future boxes? Blow them all on Remote Raid Passes? Maybe finally invest in that Pokémon Storage upgrade so you don’t have to suffer through constant “Your Pokémon Box is full” notifications? Decisions, decisions.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What can you buy with 7,000 PokéCoins?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">To make things easy, here’s a breakdown of what 7,000 PokéCoins can get you in Pokémon GO right now:</p><p><strong>Pokémon Go Shop Boxes</strong>Box NamePrice (PokéCoins)What’s InsideSpecial Offer?</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Explorer Box</strong></td><td>5,250</td><td>20x Super Incubator, 30x Egg Incubator</td><td>39% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Voyager Box</strong></td><td>6,500</td><td>100x Lucky Eggs, 50x Star Pieces</td><td>50% off</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Starter Box</strong></td><td>100</td><td>10x Pinap Berry, 1x Lucky Egg, 30x Poké Ball</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Beginner Box</strong></td><td>150</td><td>15x Poké Ball, 5x Great Ball, 1x Lucky Egg, 1x Super Incubator</td><td>One-time only</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pokémon GO Individual Items</strong>ItemPrice (PokéCoins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Remote Raid Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>525</td><td>Join Raid Battles remotely</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Premium Battle Pass (x3)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Raid or get premium Go Battle League rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Super Incubator</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Hatches eggs 33% faster</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Egg Incubator</strong></td><td>150</td><td>Hatches eggs (3 uses)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Lure Module (x8)</strong></td><td>680</td><td>Attracts more Pokémon to a PokéStop</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Incense (x8)</strong></td><td>250</td><td>Lures wild Pokémon to your location</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon Storage Upgrade</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pokémon capacity by 50</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Pokémon GO Upgrades</strong>UpgradePrice (PokéCoins)What It Does</p><table><tbody><tr></tr><tr><td><strong>Item Bag</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max item storage by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pokémon Storage</strong></td><td>200</td><td>Increases max Pokémon capacity by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Postcard Pages</strong></td><td>100</td><td>Increases max saved Postcards by 50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Team Medallion</strong></td><td>1,000</td><td>Lets you change teams (once per year)</td></tr></tbody></table><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had 7,000 PokéCoins burning a hole in my trainer bag, I’d probably go straight for the Voyager Box at 6,500 coins. It’s a ridiculous deal with 100 Lucky Eggs and 50 Star Pieces at 50% off, meaning I’d be set on XP boosts and Stardust bonuses for months. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If raiding is more your thing, stacking up on Remote Raid Passes (525 coins for three) is a solid move if you want to farm Legendaries without leaving your couch. And for anyone who’s perpetually running out of space (guilty), throwing a couple of Pokémon Storage and Item Bag upgrades into the mix would make life way easier.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Claim three free Pokémon in Pokémon Go</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re grabbing this PokéCoin deal, you might as well snag some free Pokémon while you’re at it.

Sadly, the game doesn't really give you all the information that you need. Managing your inventory can also be an arduous task, leading to a bit of confusion.</p><h3 id="How_to_craft_traps_and_tranquilizers">How to craft traps and tranquilizers</h3><p>Here's how to make traps in Monster Hunter Wilds:</p><ul><li>Purchase a Trap Tool from the Provisioner NPC at any base.</li><li>Go to your tent to craft either a Pitfall Trap or a Shock Trap:  <ul><li>Pitfall Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Net - You can craft a Net by using 1x Ivy and 1x Spider Web.</li><li>Shock Trap: Requires 1x Trap Tool and 1x Thunderbug Capacitor.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Before you head out, make sure you have multiples of any tranquilizer-type item as well. These include:</p><ul><li>Tranq Bomb: Requires 1x Sleep Herb and 1x Parashroom</li><li>Tranq Blade: Requires 1x Tranq Bomb and 1x Throwing Knife (you have an infinite number of these).</li><li>Tranq Ammo: Requires 1x Tranq Bomb and 1x Normal Ammo (you have an infinite number of these).</li></ul><p>Having several Tranq Bombs should be fine. Just remember to have your Pitfall Trap/Shock Trap and Tranq Bomb in your item pouch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451163" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451163"></a><figcaption>Don't forget your traps and tranquilizers before you leave your base.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451163-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-1.jpg"></figure><h3 id="How_to_set_up_traps">How to set up traps</h3><p>Now, all that's left is to battle a particular beast until they're severely weakened. You'll notice this once you see a notification at the right-hand side of your screen telling you that you should use traps. You'll also see the creature limping away to another location. Follow it and, in most cases, you'll see it resting due to its injuries.</p><p>Place a trap nearby and attack the monster once. Move near the trap to lure the creature toward you. Once the trap has been activated, use several of your Tranq Bombs via your item pouch until the beast is incapacitated.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Once a creature has been weakened it's important that you dismiss any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-ai-companions-sos-flare-guide/1100-6529744/" data-ref-id="1100-6529744"><strong>AI companion</strong></a> that's with you on a quest, since the damage that they deal might kill the monster instead. You can dismiss companions by pressing Start and going to the Missions &amp; Quests tab. Then, Select Support Hunter Info and remove the AI teammates from your party.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451164-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451164" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4451164-monster-hunter-wilds-capture-monster-trap-monster-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4451164"></a><figcaption>Place down a trap once a beast has been weakened.

The difference between this process and slaying a creature is that you won't get to carve its carcass. Also, the vast majority of main quests simply require you to "hunt" or "slay" beasts. You wouldn't need to worry about capturing creatures alive except in certain missions that have this particular requirement.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to trap and capture monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds. </p><p>Need more tips as you continue fighting deadly creatures and venture into lands unknown?

		<p>The Ukraine-based developers behind the acclaimed Metro series have announced La Quimera, a brand new sci-fi shooter set in a world created by Nicolas Winding Refn and E.J.A. Warren.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8u_qFKhoB8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>La Quimera (which translates to The Chimera in English) takes players to a Latin American megalopolis with a lush jungle setting, casting you as a down-on-their-luck PMC soldier caught up in the battle between rival factions. All you really have is a customisable exosuit that enhances your mobility and abilities in combat, alongside sci-fi energy weapons, those robot dogs and other drones. The intention is to combine the tense gunplay of the Metro series with in-depth storytelling from this new setting.</p>
<p>You won’t have to go it alone, with La Quimera featuring support for up to 3-player co-op through the story.</p>
<p>From the trailer and imagery released today, there’s a great look to this game, both on a technical level, and stylistically. There’s a classic Killzone vibe to seeing enemy soldiers with the glowing eyes on their armoured masks.</p>

<p>“Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series,” said Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn. “We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.”</p>
<p>La Quimera is coming from Reburn, the studio formerly known as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/4a-games">4A Games Ukraine</a>, while the 4A Games brand, 4A Games Malta studios and the Metro series all remain with Embracer Group and its publishing label Plaion. Reburn is a team of over 110 developers that previously worked on that Metro series, with a wealth of experience going back through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metro-exodus">Metro Exodus</a>, Metro: Last Light and Metro 2033, and even back to the founders working on the original STALKER. La Quimera’s development is being led by Sasha Kostiuk, who served as gameplay and AI designer on Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light.</p>
<p>While the setting will be completely different, let’s look back at this team’s most recent work. Metro Exodus released in 2019, taking the post-apocalyptic tale out on the tracks to head across Siberia. Nicole scored it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">an excellent 9/10</a>, saying, “Metro Exodus provides an immersive FPS experience that marks a new milestone for the franchise. Its survival-horror, sandbox and shooter elements are remarkably well balanced, constituting an engaging and thrilling game that’ll leave you no stranger to a good jump scare. The once linear horror franchise has been reformed, introducing expansive environments to indulge in without derailing the narrative. Metro Exodus is a must play.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/la-quimera-is-a-new-co-op-sci-fi-fps-from-reburn-formerly-4a-games-ukraine/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, 4A Games Ukraine made two big announcements: one, it's being rebranded to Reburn; two, it is developing a new cooperative sci-fi first-person shooter game called La Quimera.</p>
<p>First things first. Metro fans were probably puzzled by the aforementioned sentence, just like I was when I got the news. Let's clarify things right away, then. Following the beginning of the political instability in Ukraine, dating all the way back to 2014, part of the team at 4A Games moved to Malta. Back then, both studios still worked together on Metro Exodus.</p>
<p>After the launch of Metro Exodus in 2019, 4A Games Malta and 4A Games Ukraine were both big enough to handle projects separately. A few months later, the Malta office <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-acquires-4a-games-new-world-interactive-and-four-more-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was acquired by Embracer</a>, while the Ukraine office remained independent and received unrelated investments to make its own IP, which would become La Quimera. The studios are effectively separate now, as reflected in the rebrand, although they are both allowed to use the 4A Engine seen in Metro titles.</p>
<p>Dmytro Lymar, founder and CEO of Reburn, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Reburn is proud to introduce La Quimera, which draws upon our success crafting narrative-driven shooter games for the Metro series. We look forward to sharing this mysterious new world with players and hope they revel in suiting up to join the fight.</em></p>

<p>The game is set in a Latin American megalopolis and lush jungle environments. Players will step into the customizable exosuit of a down-on-his-luck PMC (Private Military Company) soldier battling rival factions. The world and story of La Quimera were written and created by movie director Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive, The Neon Demon) and E.J.A. Warren. Combining Latin American folklore with advanced weaponry and technology, La Quimera will be playable in single-player mode or with up to two friends in co-op for a total of three players.</p>
<p><iframe title="La Quimera Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mRoLav0VCYk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Reburn promises that fans of the Metro franchise will enjoy the familiar tense gunplay and intimate storytelling mixed with new gameplay experiences through unique and highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons. There's no release date yet, but Reburn said more about the game will be revealed in the coming months.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-games-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1120545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Games has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Games' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Games).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>It's likely that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">two AAA titles</a> that 4A Games is apparently working on for its parent company Embracer Group, with the other presumably being the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metro-exodus-developers-still-working-on-next-game-despite-war-in-ukraine-sdk-released" rel="nofollow">next game in the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
