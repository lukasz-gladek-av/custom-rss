			<p>When Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> last year, it came out of nowhere and immediately captured the attention of role-playing game enthusiasts. With traditional party-based role-playing games finding less and less representation in the AAA space, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive looked like the game that could bring the genre into the spotlight without being a nostalgia-fueled experience, as the setting, story and main cast of characters looked very unique, and far removed from those we are now used to see in similar games. In the end, the game's dark fantasy Belle Époque setting, the members of Expedition 33, and the turn-based combat system with a twist weren't just a fluke meant to lure in jaded fans of classic RPGs. They are the well-developed elements that make up one of the best role-playing games released recently.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425004620_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Clair Obscure: Expedition 33 is set in a ruined world where the mysterious goddess known as the Paintress holds sway over the people of the isolated island of Lumière, a beautiful place inspired by Paris, which broke off from the rest of the Continent following the Fracture. For the past 67 years, the inhabitants of the island have been subject to the Gommage, a twisted ritual where the Paintress draws a decreasing number, which causes the death of every human with an age above that number. To stop the Paintress from decimating humanity, the people of Lumière send expeditions into the continent, which often end in ruin, but not before they manage to leave behind something that could be for those that will come after.</p>
<p>Following yet another Gommage where the Paintress painted the number 33, the members of Expedition 33 head over to the Continent, hoping to achieve what the previous Expeditions couldn't. Unfortunately, the group is decimated as soon as it lands on the continent by a mysterious man who has evidently lived well past 33 years. The few survivors, who include the engineer Gustave, his foster sister Maelle, the scholar Lune, and the warrior Sciel, following protocol, continue nonetheless towards their objective, not knowing that the world dominated by the Paintress and the Gommage is a lot more complicated than they initially thought.</p>
<p>The Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's setting and story have been influenced by NieR Automata, with its ruined world inhabited by some rather unique creatures, and Xenoblade Chronicles 3, with humans whose life has a set duration dictated by some higher power, but even so, they are fascinating and engaging. Much of the enjoyment of the game's story, which manages to convincingly alternate between world-building, intimate character development, fist-pumping epic confrontations, mystery, and heartbreaking tragedies, comes from the excellent pacing that somewhat reminded me of what I consider the best-paced role-playing games ever made: Chrono Trigger.</p>
<p>Like the Square Enix classic, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 doesn't inflate the play time. Every little story development serves a purpose in the grand scheme of things, like the strokes from a brush. Everything comes together extremely well when the adventure ends, ultimately making the 40 or so hours needed to clear the game an enjoyable rollercoaster of emotions that is hugely satisfying, if not a little emotionally draining, like only the best of stories manage to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250425014015_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Besides the excellent pacing of the story, the characters are the reason Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is so enjoyable. Even though the members of the Expedition 33 and a few others met during the journey on the continent get the most development, which is greatly enhanced by the tapestry their relationships wove, even those that only appear briefly manage to leave an impact. For example, it is tough to forget about the characters met before the Gommage, and remain indifferent as the ritual concludes. The excellent writing and the stellar performance of the English voice cast, including performances from Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, and Ben Starr, are the cherry on top of the most interesting setting seen in role-playing games in a long time.</p>
<p>Following in the footsteps of classic franchises like the Final Fantasy series, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 plays a lot like a traditional Japanese role-playing game, although with many twists that make both exploration and combat extremely engaging. Of the core gameplay elements, exploration and traversal are the most straightforward. Controlling characters from a third-person perspective, players explore a variety of locations scattered all over the world map, featuring multiple paths to the location's main objective, usually an intense boss battle, filled with secrets to discover, shortcuts, and so on. The game doesn't feature any navigational pointers or location maps, which makes exploring more immersive and organic than similar games, though some sort of navigational pointer would have been welcome.</p>
<p>Unlike most modern role-playing games developed in Japan and those inspired by them, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also features a proper world map, much like each location, filled with optional locations and secrets to discover. At the very start of the adventure, the game feels a little too linear with little to do other than go from one main story location to the next, but after only a few hours in, the game opens up, providing players with plenty of opportunities to unlock new content such as outfits and hairstyles for all characters, additional weapons with different elemental properties and passive skills, Pictos to customize their abilities, and take down more Nevrons roaming the map. On the main world map and inside locations, enemies are visible and generally very easy to avoid, which is a definite plus, as random encounters tend to impact the experience negatively if not appropriately handled.</p>
<p>Though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's turn-based combat system doesn't appear to be much different from any other similar system, Sandfall Interactive has done an incredible job making it highly engaging and satisfying within the boundaries of the classic mechanics. Except for regular attacks with the equipped weapons, items, and a few skills, every combat action requires some involvement from the player besides selecting the command. Almost every skill, of which every character can equip up to six, comes with a simple QTE event that, once cleared correctly, increases its efficacy. It's during defensive actions, however, that clearing QTE becomes more important, as the game offers multiple defensive options that expand as the adventure proceeds, which are more or less effective depending on the situation and the enemy. Dodging attacks is the easiest option that doesn't offer too many rewards besides negating all damage; parrying, on the other hand, is more challenging to pull off consistently, but it's infinetly more rewarding, as characters that parry attacks not only negate any damage, but also restore AP, which are used to perform the aforementioned skills, and Aim attacks, which can be customized to deal status effects alongside damage and more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427131135_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even if all characters played the same in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, these mechanics would have been more than enough to make each battle thrilling and exciting, but the developer went the extra mile to give each one of the playable characters some very unique playstyles. Gustave, for example, accumulates charges for his mechanical arm, which can be then used once charged to deal massive damage and stun enemies if the Break gauge has been filled; Maelle, to make another, can enter three different stances that grant offense and defense bonuses and can enhance the effects of specific skills; Lune acquires Essences when using her elemental spells, which can be consumed to enhance the effects of every spell.</p>
<p>Each character's unique playstyle includes a massive selection of skills learned via individual Skill Trees that further define how each character is played, in conjunction with the passive abilities learned via Pictos, which are incredibly varied and can enhance pretty much every aspect of a character both offensively and defensively, and even the order in which each character attacks. Verso, to make an example, is extremely good at restoring his own AP, and has skills that allow him to act twice in a turn, and restore the AP of the other party members, so the other party members skill loadout can be built around this mechanic with powerful skills that require a lot of AP.</p>
<p>Sciel, whose unique Foretell mechanics make her extremely powerful, has a skill that can stack Foretell on multiple enemies if they are afflicted by Burn, so building the party around this skill can be highly effective. The game is filled to the brim with these options, and even a single playthrough may not be enough to discover all of them, something that lends extremely well to the extensive endgame and New Game Plus, which offer additional challenges beyond Expert difficulty, which, by itself, is pretty challenging even on a first playthrough, requiring perfect execution of the defensive options to clear even regular enemy encounters.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's intriguing setting and charming characters are made even more so by the game's visuals. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game emnploys all the core rendering techniques offered by the engine like Lumen and Nanite - to deliver dense environments with a clear visual identity, tons of detail and generally accurate lighting, though some imperfections creep in now and then, and bloom is maybe a little excessive at times. Character models look as good as the environment, if not even better, thanks to some great animations (especially facial ones) that make each character strikingly believable, even with the average lip-syncing on display. Taking full advantage of all the above are the masterfully directed cutscenes, with a high-quality level that wouldn't look amiss in a proper movie or TV show.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250427133400_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Though games powered by Unreal Engine 5 usually suffer from considerable performance issues on PC, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is among the few that don't, at least not massively. On the system used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM), at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality mode and Epic settings, the game ran at an average of 61 FPS, 24 FPS 1% low during a benchmark session held on the world map and the Monoco's Station and Frozen Hearts locations which feature tons of particle effects, complete with some battles. Things fared slightly better turning down every setting to High, as in the same scenario, the game ran at an average of 75 FPS, 28 FPS 1% low with minimal differences in visual quality. During traversal, I experienced minimal stuttering, and the most noticeable drops happened during combat, thankfully not when the enemy was about to attack my party, so generally they weren't too bothersome.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 4K PC Gameplay - DLSS Quality, Epic Settings" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AJtfNqJNxXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even more than visuals, the Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soundtrack and voice acting are top-notch. The adventure's main theme, which is woven into multiple tracks, is immediately recognizable and sets the melancholic tone of the adventure incredibly well. That is not to say that the entirety of the soundtrack is composed of sad, haunting pieces influenced by the NieR series soundtracks, as there are some surprisingly upbeat and catchy tunes, like the Gestral Beach themes, that are difficult to resist tapping a foot in time with. Likewise, while playing the game with the French voice acting makes for a more authentic experience, given the game's setting, the quality of the English voice acting is, as already mentioned, stellar. Every voice actor clearly poured their hearts into their performance, often surpassing everything they have done before bringing these characters to life.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 may not be the most innovative role-playing game, but its core elements come together beautifully, delivering an emotional journey that is as moving as it is engaging and fun. It may be Sandfall Interactive’s first expedition, but the French developer has shown it has the passion and the chops to craft a memorable experience worthy of a Game of the Year nomination, if not the award itself.</p>

<p>Polygon was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/polygon-com-its-a-website.1185405/">founded in 2012</a> when Vox Media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/">spent significant money</a> to poach top journalists from popular gaming blogs like Kotaku, Joystiq, and The Escapist. After initially publishing as the Gaming section of Vox.com for a few months, the Polygon domain <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/24/3547938/welcome-to-polygon">launched</a> alongside <a href="https://botherer.org/2012/08/23/polygon-and-the-documentary-that-cured-cancer/">a series of flashy videos</a> hyping up the staff's lofty goals for video game journalism.</p>
<p>In the years since, Polygon has become a respected source for news and views on the gaming and entertainment industries—one that Ars Technica has cited frequently during my tenure as senior gaming editor.</p>
<p>"Just completely sickened by this news," Polygon cofounder Brian Crecente <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/crecente.bsky.social/post/3lo4nrllxuc25">shared on Bluesky</a>. "Mostly for those so suddenly and deeply impacted, but also for the dwindling number of publications seriously covering video games."</p>
<p>New Polygon owner Valnet publishes dozens of Internet content brands<span>, which collectively have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.valnetinc.com/en/screen-group" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 260 million page views</a></span>. But the publisher, founded by Pornhub co-founder Hassan Youssef, <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">has earned something of a reputation</a> over the years for exploitative work conditions and quick-churn, clickbait content. One contributor to Valnet-owned Collider <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">told The Wrap</a> last year that the site runs as "a content mill, borderline like almost sweatshop-level," with writers "constantly being pushed to write more, to do it quicker."</p>
<p>"We’re proud to have built Polygon into the gaming authority for both experts and casual fans alike, a publication that has informed and delighted tens of millions of gaming enthusiasts since its founding at Vox Media more than a decade ago," Vox Media co-founder, chair, and CEO Jim Bankoff <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">said in a statement</a>.</p>

                <p>Microsoft's strategy of releasing first-party Xbox games on PlayStation looks to be working, as Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced during its Q3 FY25 earnings call that the company was recently the top publisher on the PlayStation Store when it came to preorders.</p><p dir="ltr">The period Nadella referred to was January through March 2025, when he said Microsoft ended the quarter as the top publisher by preorders and preinstalls on both Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Other stats Nadella highlighted included news that PC Game Pass revenue was up 45% year-over-year, and that while Xbox hardware revenue declined 6% over the previous year, it saw gaming revenue increase 5% and Xbox content and services revenue increase by 8%. Those numbers were thanks to growth in Xbox Game Pass, Call of Duty, and Minecraft, Nadella said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what Xbox games available on PlayStation led to so many preorders, Microsoft had several big titles set to release shortly after the time period Nadella cited. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5s-indiana-jones-was-the-weeks-top-seller-but-it-wasnt-in-the-top-15-most-played/1100-6531178/" data-ref-id="1100-6531178">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle released April 17 and became the best-selling PS5 game</a> for that week (even if it wasn't in the top 15 most-played games). <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-performance-on-ps5-pro-is-a-compromise-free-experience-experts-says/1100-6531102/" data-ref-id="1100-6531102">Forza Horizon 5 released for PS5</a> shortly after on April 29 (or on April 25 for those who bought the premium edition). Last but not least, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, set for release on May 15, is likely also driving preorders for Microsoft on Sony's platform.</p><p dir="ltr">While Nadella didn't mention it during the investor call, Microsoft the following day announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">sweeping price increases for Xbox consoles</a>, accessories, and games. All Xbox Series consoles, including the Series X, saw price jumps of up to $100, while controller prices increased between $5 and $10. Microsoft additionally announced select first-party games will cost $80 starting this holiday season, but did not name specific titles.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Microsoft, the price hikes were made with "careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development."</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft didn't cite recently enacted US tariffs as the specific reason for the price increases, but it wouldn't be the first video game publisher affected. Nintendo delayed Switch 2 preorders in order to assess the impact tariffs might have, announcing several weeks later it would increase the price of Switch 2 accessories (but not the console itself, at least at launch) due to "market conditions."</p>

                <p>Amazon has revealed the PC games that'll be coming to Prime Gaming in May, and this month celebrates May The 4th with some Star Wars games, brings one of Xbox'ss top shooters, and delivers an indie darling that recreates the feelings of late-'90s Internet culture.</p><p>As a reminder, all of the free games that you claim through Prime Gaming are yours to keep forever, even if your subscription expires. If you aren't a member, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" rel="nofollow ">you can sign up for Amazon Prime</a> for as little as one month to take advantage of the subscription and the freebies offered through it.</p><p>With May The 4th approaching at the beginning of the month, there is plenty of Star Wars representation in the first batch of free Prime Gaming titles. Both Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds and Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga will be available on the first week of the month, and each offers a unique gateway to fun Star Wars action--Galactic Battlegrounds for the real-time-strategy fans, and Lego Star Wars for those looking for something silly and lighthearted.</p><p>Outside of Star Wars, one of the marquee games on this month's free lineup is Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus. You'll be able to get ready for the Doom Slayer's next adventure by leading his canonical great-great-grandfather B.J. Blazkowicz take on the Nazis in an alternate version of America.</p><p>If you're looking for something you've never played before, Hypnospace Outlaw will certainly fit the bill: It simulates the Internet of the late 1990s, as you try to surf the web in order to solve mysteries and thwart criminals from wreaking havoc on the World Wide Web. Saints Row: Gat Out Of Hell, meanwhile, features an entire musical number in the middle of the game, and that alone is worth checking the Saints Row sidestory out for yourself.</p><h2>Prime Gaming free games for May 2025</h2><h3>Now available</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Styx: Master of Shadows [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">The Invisible Hand [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 8</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus Digital Deluxe Edition [Xbox and PC via Microsoft Store Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: Rebirth [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Hypnospace Outlaw [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Doors - Paradox [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 15</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Saints Row: Gat out of Hell [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Endless Legend Definitive Edition [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Golf with Your Friends [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Legacy of Kain: Blood Omen 2 [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Mail Time [GOG Code]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 22</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Fate [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Thief 2: The Metal Age [GOG Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Everdream Valley [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Chessarama [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">The Lost Ashford Ring [Legacy Games Code]</li><li dir="ltr">Samurai Bringer [Amazon Games App]</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr">May 29</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Trinity Fusion [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Masterplan Tycoon [Amazon Games App]</li><li dir="ltr">Liberté [Epic Games Store]</li><li dir="ltr">Jennifer Wilde Unlikely Revolutionaries [Epic Games Store]</li></ul><p>Prime subscribers will also be able to play the following games in May via the Prime Gaming Luna channel:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars III - The Clone Wars</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga</li><li dir="ltr">Disney Planes</li><li dir="ltr">Death Stranding Director's Cut</li><li dir="ltr">Lawn Mowing Simulator: Landmark Edition</li><li dir="ltr">House of Golf 2</li><li dir="ltr">RiMS Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Haven</li><li dir="ltr">Star Wars Pinball</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite OG</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Ballistic</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Brick Life</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Battle Royale</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite Festival</li><li dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Odyssey</li><li dir="ltr">Rocket Racing</li><li dir="ltr">Fortnite</li><li dir="ltr">Trackmania Starter Access</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout New Vegas: Ultimate Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Fallout 3: Game of the Year Edition</li></ul>

            <p>
Somehow we've made it to May already, and with the month of maypoles, mayflies, mayflowers, and mayonnaise upon us, it means there's fresh batch of Prime Gaming offerings for members to enjoy - which this time includes a smattering of Star Wars, Nazi-pummelling in Wolfenstein 2, orifice-clenching horror in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/amnesia-rebirth">Amnesia: Rebirth</a>, and more.
</p>
<p>
As is tradition, Prime Gaming's May titles arrive across four scheduled content drops, and Amazon's first batch of games is available to claim right now. It's here we get a little May the Fourth, with Star Wars Galactic Battlegrounds Saga and Lego Star Wars — The Complete Saga, both in the initial line-up. That's alongside some old-school goblin stealth in Styx: Master of Shadow and a bit of satirical stock trading simulation in The Invisible Hand.
</p>

The company is announcing the changes less than a day after a major court ruling that mandates that Apple can’t collect fees on purchases made outside of apps or restrict how they point to off-platform payments, meaning that more developers may choose to direct users to other payment options.</p><p>Beginning in June, Epic says that for any payments processed via the Epic Games Store, developers will pay a zero percent revenue share – meaning developers themselves will keep all of their revenue – “on their first $1,000,000 in revenue per app per year,” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/new-epic-games-store-webshops-and-revenue-share-update">according to a blog post</a>. After that, Epic’s typical 88 / 12 percent revenue share will kick in. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars">Google</a> offer a lowered commission rate on sales below $1 million, too, but only to 15 percent versus Epic’s zero. </p><p>Also beginning in June, Epic will launch a new feature that lets developers launch Epic Games Store-hosted “webshops.” These webshops “can offer players out-of-app purchases as a more cost-effective alternative to in-app purchases, where Apple, Google, and others charge exorbitant fees,” Epic says.</p><p>To incentivize buying things from webshops, Epic says that player spending will accrue 5 percent Epic Rewards “on all their purchases.” <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/features/epic-rewards">Epic Rewards</a> can be applied to future purchases from Epic’s store.</p><div><p>Shortly after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659246/apple-epic-app-store-judge-ruling-control">ruling last night</a>, CEO Tim Sweeney also announced that Epic plans to bring <em>Fortnite</em> back to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/659271/fortnite-ios-apple-app-store-us-return">US iOS App Store next week</a>.

            <p>
You know, at this point I'm not sure if games, or even just aspects of games, that rely on licensing other works, is really all that good of an idea. It's probably part of why there are some Fortnite skins you never see in the shop anymore, it's absolutely why the Friday the 13th game shut down, and I have a hunch that that's what has happened to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evil-dead-the-game">Evil Dead: The Game</a>. Recently, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game disappeared from both the PlayStation Store and Epic Games Store, leading to a bit of confusion as to its status. Now, the game is no longer purchasable on Steam, and developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/saber-interactive">Saber Interactive</a> have put out a comment addressing the situation.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"We can confirm we've begun the process of removing the game from digital storefronts," wrote Saber in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1493750/view/501697399294526021">Steam post</a>. "Anyone who has purchased the game will still be able to play it as we plan to keep our servers online for everyone. We want to extend a sincere thank you to our community, to those who have been part of the game from the very beginning, and those who have recently joined us. We appreciate all of your support."
</p>
<p>
My guess is that despite only being a three year old game, it hasn't done well enough to keep it going, and something related to licensing out the Evil Dead universe has fallen through. I honestly can't tell you, and I doubt Saber will confirm anything, so your guess is as good as mine. None of this is surprising though, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evil-dead-the-game-studio-halts-development-of-new-content-just-16-months-after-launch-but-servers-will-stay-up-for-now">new content for the game was stopped back in 2023</a>, only 16 months after the game launched.
</p>
<p>
The fact that servers are still being kept online is a welcome surprise, but ultimately the game's death warrant has been signed. Obviously the irony of a game with the word dead in its title dying like this isn't lost on me. You don't need to post your witty "Evil Dead game" comments, I'm one step ahead of you.

After its first expansion, The Sins Of New Wells, cast a new perspective on certain endgame events in The Rise Of The Golden Idol, Color Gray is back with Golden Idol Investigation: The Lemurian Phoenix, which will launch May 13.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lemurian Phoenix will add five new scenarios to Rise Of The Golden Idol, which will make it the largest expansion to date.

And how they do it in a way that ensures the player understands the cause-and-effect of the world around them? According to the them, it all starts with in-game elements like warning labels on objects, and scales up to complex "event logs" essential for players and designers alike.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/is-blue-prince-s-success-due-to-social-play-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Is Blue Prince's success due to 'social play?'</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Skin Deep wants players to read warning labels">Skin Deep wants players to read warning labels</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let's say a player needs to liberate a key from a space pirate in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

If the explosion blew a fuel line in the wrong spot at the wrong time, it might launch a basketball at the player's head.

He and Michet said that in a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, helping players understand those systems-driven escalating incidents starts with good old-fashioned warning labels... the kind many people ignore in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most objects in the game have a warning label of some sort that can be viewed by holding down the "shift" key or a controller button. Deodorant boxes, for instance, have a warning explicitly calling out their flammability. It's a quick way to introduce what he called "cartoon logic" not seen in other games in the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Labels like these are unusual for the immersive sim genre, which usually put players in the roles of spies and assassins in hostile environments. Players are usually briefly introduced to separate game systems and then expected to discover other interactions on their own. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s labels also aren't necessarily "realistic," often taking up excessive physical space on the object in question, again hewing closer to cartoon logic over real-world logic.</span></p><p>Image via Blendo Games/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to be pretty forgiving," Chung said when referencing the myriad interactions, saying Blendo's goal was for players to find the consequences of their actions more "interesting than painful." For instance, the game cuts off the risk of explosive decompression by letting the player character breathe in outer space. If they get blown out a window, the guards will likely just think they're dead while they circle around to find an airlock.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mario-kart-world-features-missions-for-the-first-time-in-20-years" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mario Kart World features missions for the first time in 20 years</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chung said that this kind of "Looney Tunes"-style thinking helped the Blendo team design the myriad interactions, because it turns out players are more familiar with cartoon logic than you might think. "People have an understanding of how things work with exaggerated physics," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But before you expect players to embrace the full ethos of the Acme Corporation, be aware that you've got to keep the Rube-Goldberg machine in check.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;The game was too chaotic for a while&quot;">"The game was too chaotic for a while"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The chain reactions and surreal setting of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be a lot to take in, and according to Michet, the biggest challenge of finishing the game was that for a while, it was just "too chaotic."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Everything is systemic," added Chung. "An issue that we had for a while was when anything happened, it caused a Rube-Goldberg chain reaction of events to [take place], and then the chain reaction went on for so long that at the end of the chain, it was just completely incomprehensible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players might toss an object in one room and minutes later, find a dead guard a guard in another room, with zero context for what caused their untimely demise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One way this reigned in was through extremely obvious "signposting." When players knock down a guard, the game freeze-frames to show the precise object interaction that incapacitated them. Toss a lighter at a leaking fuel vent, and when the guard goes down, the game freezes, letterboxes pop up, and they'll see arrows pointing to both the lighter and the vent. If they shoot a guard and a bullet does them in, it will only label the bullet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, the Blendo team cooked up an "event log" that kept a longer record of the interactions leading to that freeze-frame moment. There are two versions of that log in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skin Deep</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. One is visible to the player, and one kept invisible for all but the developers. The visible one can be seen in full while the game is paused, but a short record of recent events pops up in the player's view as they navigate the space. It's useful for more subtle interactions, like if a player drops a can, and a guard hears the noise, but the player doesn't hear the bark playing due to another audio cue.</span></p><p>Image via Blendo Games/Annapurna Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, the second version of the log is reserved for Chung, Michet, and the collaborators. There are an intense number of subtle interactions that the player doesn't need to know about, but the Blendo team would for bugfixing.

                <p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 released just a couple days after Microsoft surprise-released Oblivion Remastered, prompting some to wonder why two Game Pass games heavily promoted by Xbox might release so close to each other.

"We felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game," he said.</p><p>To sum up, Handrahan said, "Proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p><p>Research firm Ampere Analysis said 35% of Expedition 33 players overall also played Oblivion Remastered, with 55% of Expedition 33 players on Xbox also spending time with Oblivion Remastered. The crossover was more limited on Steam (22%) and PS5 (16%).</p><p>Xbox was also the most popular platform overall for Expedition 33, Ampere found, saying 45% of all players came from Xbox, with 47% of Oblivion Remastered players on Xbox. PS5 was No. 2 for Expedition 33, making up 30% of players, with Steam following as the third-biggest platform (25%).</p><p>For Oblivion Remastered, Ampere's data said Steam was No. 2 (34%) followed by PlayStation (19%). The preference for Xbox for both titles was attributable in part to both games being included with Game Pass, the report said.</p><p>While Xbox was the top platform for both Expedition 33 and Oblivion Remastered, it wasn't the biggest platform for either title based on playtime. Ampere said the average playtime for Expedition 33 on Xbox was 2.2 hours, compared to 4.4 hours on PlayStation and Steam. For Oblivion Remastered, PlayStation users played an average of 3.8 hours, compared to 3.6 hours on Steam, and 2.2 hours on Xbox.</p><p>All of the figures here from Ampere cover data from the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Europe, from each game's launch through Sunday, April 27. Oblivion Remastered, of course, came out two days before Expedition 33, which no doubt had an effect on Ampere's findings.</p>

			<p>This GeForce NOW Thursday coincides with the beginning of a new month, so NVIDIA provided users of the popular cloud gaming platform with an outlook on which PC games will be available throughout May. Once again, most of the big titles will be supported, starting with id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. That's not surprising, as all Bethesda (and Microsoft) games are supported. Moreover, DOOM: The Dark Ages will support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS, and those with a GeForce NOW premium subscription will be able to take advantage of those technologies.</p>
<p>On that note, id Software posted a little tease of how path tracing can improve the visuals of DOOM: The Dark Ages. You can check out a teaser screenshot below; unfortunately, NVIDIA also said that path tracing won't be available at launch but will be added with an update 'shortly after launch'.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horror-at-highrook-review-haunting-narrative-indie.1178961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/horror-at-highrook-review-haunting-narrative-indie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> is the first title from indie developer Nullpointer Games. A narrative-focused horror game, it combines board game mechanics with card-crafting gameplay. The story is woven through each part of the gameplay, and the dialogue segments really highlight the important aspects of the plot. A strong opening for Nullpointer Games,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;offers a completely new gaming experience that will stay with you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Card-Based Gameplay</h2>

<p>You’re in control of four investigators as they explore Highrook, an abandoned estate on the coast. The noble Ackeron family has disappeared amid rumors of occult activity. Tasked with finding the missing residents, strange occurrences happen soon after their arrival.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horror-at-highrook-gameplay.jpg?itok=CWJOS3pT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horror-at-highrook-gameplay.jpg?itok=lAtQg0uV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay revolves around using cards to have the investigators execute different actions. Drag actions to the corresponding room, then drag someone who’s skilled in that area to start working. Open packages in the Machine Room, create potions in the Laboratory, or cook meals in the Kitchen. Some actions keep your investigators alive and sane, while others turn up usable items and boosts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you progress through the game, you'll be aided by Mr. Tubbs, the cat, and Stokes the Raven. Mr. Tubbs moves where he wills, but offers a boost for certain rooms. Interacting with him lowers Madness, just like petting a cat in real life can soothe a worried heart. Stokes, on the other hand, can be moved around the board, but only offers assistance in the Chapel and Courtyard. Using them wisely can really make a difference in your gameplay, especially when you've run out of Moonshine to keep your investigators sane.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>An Atmosphere of Intrigue in <em>The Horror at Highrook</em></h2>

<p>I really enjoyed the story of The Horror at Highrook. It’s easy to digest, yet pulls at the heartstrings. It’s presented through journal entries, notes you find in locked rooms, and dialogue moments between the characters.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=huY5wpuU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-horror-at-highrook-key.jpg?itok=wW65bg1J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You discover that the father and son are in this other realm, with other residents pulled into the madness as it spreads through the estate. By the middle of the game, I wanted to know what happened to this family, especially Simon. This is a world I became invested in. Each dialogue built a web of intrigue that lasted throughout the story.</p>

<p>The art and the music perfectly complement the narrative that’s established. Eerie music begins as the occult occurrences ramp up. Eldritch horrors with no faces and extra teeth appear at the end of rituals. I tensed up as soon as the music started, and those creatures will haunt my nightmares.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You work through eight chapters of eldritch narrative and card creation to reach the culmination of the title. Pausing to read everything during my first playthrough meant it took me nine hours to finish. My second playthrough, so I could see all the ending summaries (and hit 100%), only lasted four hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once fully complete, there’s no real incentive to play the title again. The ending summaries don’t change, and the steps to finish the side quests stay the same. The story is static. No matter how good the narrative is, there are so many ways you can play it.&nbsp;This is great for those with restricted time for gaming. A single weekend will give you the complete experience.&nbsp;</p>

It's stayed with me well past the last time I played, living rent-free in my head. There is much more about this world I'd like to learn about beyond what's presented. Nullpointer Games developed interesting game mechanics along with an invigorating world that can be the setting for future titles. I know I'd buy another game set around Highrook just to experience more of the world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the length of the title can be seen as a negative, the only real issue I take with the game is the abundance of spelling and grammatical errors found throughout. This could be due to being a writer or a former English major in college. However, some of the mistakes can cause slight confusion when read. Aside from that, I encountered no bugs or glitches, my game never crashed, and the audio always played correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>The Horror at Highrook</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;was an experience I really enjoyed. Figuring out how to craft the boost I needed or trying to complete side quests while the investigators went insane solidified the indie game as one of my favorites of the year. The lack of bugs paired with a well-written story that sticks with you and unique card mechanics makes it stand out among other horror games releasing. If you're interested in Eldritch horror stories,&nbsp;<em>The Horror at Highrook</em>&nbsp;is a game you need to check out.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>The Horror at Highrook</strong> was reviewed on PC over 13 hours with a code provided by Nullpointer Games and Outersloth. All screenshots were obtained over the course of review.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <p>
I really quite like how simple a title <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/ratopia">Ratopia</a> has. It's a 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategic</a> survival city builder, where you have to build a nice place for rats to live. Ratopia! It gets straight to the heart of it, and it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2244130/view/538852710067208196?l=english">just received its 1.0 release today</a> after an early access period of 18 months. The game has had a lengthy development time too, starting way back in 2020, and in a Steam post discussing the 1.0 release, developers Cassel Games left a nice and lengthy list covering everything that's been added across its early access release.
</p>

<p>
That includes things like a diplomacy system, character customisation, even a disease system, which does make me sad, but rats are generally known for being carriers of all sorts. In terms of gameplay, there's definitely a bit of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terraria">Terraria</a> vibe to it given that your rats walk around 2D landscapes, digging at squares to build settlements. All the rats apparently have their "own wealth and unique characteristics", though, I have to say, developing capitalism but for rats doesn't seem very utopic.

<p>
This 1.0 update also adds in a new leader perk system, which offers, you guessed it, perks for your leader rat. That can be for things like recovering health at certain times of day, or to help you cultivate plants. Those that like to tweak their challenge to suit them have some new options to tweak things like choosing which kinds of enemies invade, changing the season order, or just outright turning crime off. There's the utopia I'm looking for!
</p>
<p>
There's a lot more than that too, and Cassel Games did say that they plan to release more updates in the future too, as well as Steam Deck improvements. It's also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244130/Ratopia/">currently 20% off</a>, which technically is just keeping it at it's early access price more or less, so you've got until May 14th to get it slightly cheaper than you will pass that point. Oh, and there's a demo too! Lots of options for you.

It’s easy; Spellsword is the best of both worlds. While you may not specialize in one or the other outright, the class allows you to mix and match, combining a sword and shield with an appropriate Restoration or Destruction spell that makes quick work of enemies or allows you to keep on kicking. </p><p>With a focus on Heavy Armor, Destruction, Restoration, and Blade, and attributes revolving around Endurance and Willpower, the Spellsword is a versatile class that’s quick-footed yet durable. </p><figure id="" data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-recommend-id="image://e77abc957b6d157f0d169807a49848fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lightning touch spell in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sure, a Mage is cool, and often quite powerful in the late game.

Here, you can mix and match skills to craft a one-of-a-kind playstyle that feels unique without changing the game overwhelmingly.

If you want a fighter-type class, opt for Blade. If you’re a mage-type, I recommend Destruction.

Rather than offering full-scale, action-packed battles across the universe, Trinket Studios' next game instead boils things down to a sleek, card-based battle system, which focuses on resource management and strategy rather than brute force action--all while adding dozens of interesting characters with fully voiced dialogue on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">After playing an hour-long demo, it's immediately clear that Trinket is on to something with this unique approach, but it's too early to tell if the experiment will stick the landing. Battle Suit Aces is trying something different, and so far, the results are worthy of your attention.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battle Suit Aces - Official Reveal Trailer | Future of Play 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Aces high</h2><p dir="ltr">Battle Suite Aces follows a simple premise: A group of spacefarers called the Patchworks travel the universe in a massive spaceship called the USS Zephyr, as they explore planets looking for ancient tech. In their travels, they have found and commandeered a Gundam-adjacent mech suit, and eventually they meet other characters with mech suits of their own.</p><p dir="ltr">The crew fights against the Frenzied, mysterious monsters that can attack without notice and devastate everything in their path. The Zephyr and its crew meet the Frenzied multiple times throughout the demo, an excellent introduction to Battle Suit Aces' novel battle system.</p><p dir="ltr">Fights take place via a card-battling system, where each character you've recruited is represented by a card featuring their mech. There are also secondary cards--in the demo, for example, these are all attack drones--which can attack for you as needed. The USS Zephyr, meanwhile, is the "player" of these cards, but it has a set life total--if enemies attack enemy spaces on your side of the board, the Zephyr will take damage.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485595"></a><figcaption>Battle Suit Aces uses cards to depict space battles between mechs, ships, and drones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485595-battle4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the board, the battlefield is a single row containing five slots, and only one card can fit in a slot at a time. As you fill slots in the row with cards, you accrue energy in whichever color is represented on the card--the deck in the demo contains blue and red energy (the full game may have more), so you'll accrue one energy of a certain color for each card in your row. After energy is accrued, you can choose how to spend it on attacks and other abilities, and you can also move cards to different slots once per turn in order to maximize the turn's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">This is where the full strategic prowess of the Battle Suit Aces fighting system comes into play. Each battle is won by reducing the HP of the main enemy to zero, and you damage that enemy the same way they can damage the Zephyr--by firing a card's weapon into a slot not occupied by an enemy card. If the opponent places a card in an empty slot, damage will be taken by that card before the main enemy will, meaning that each card is "protecting" its leader when placed.</p><p dir="ltr">Every battle in the demo offered multiple different paths to victory, creating an engaging and sometimes stressful experience. Early battles are easy, as they're normally won by moving a powerful mech to empty slots as needed. Later on, the demo throws a couple of curveballs into the battle mechanics; one battle creates more enemy cards whenever one of their own is killed, while another places shields in each slot which need to be broken before the main enemy can be damaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485596"></a><figcaption>Between missions, you can customize your deck of cards.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485596-batlle3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After a battle, you can visit different rooms on the USS Zephyr and make changes to your mechs, drones, and more in different rooms of the ship. This adds an air of customization to the experience, as it lets you throw your ideal curveballs at an enemy ship depending on your chosen loadout. I really like the way Trinket Studios has already shown it can tweak the battle system on the fly, and I'm excited to see what sort of mad scientist experiments later battles in the game will present.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The heart of the cards</h2><p dir="ltr">Battling in Battle Suit Aces is fun, but the real joy comes from listening to the characters interact with one another. Each character is fully voiced, and unique personalities burst from each of those voices. Heathcliff is the leader of the crew and an adept engineer in his own right. Daciana is a fiery mechanic with a seedy backstory. Jules is a researcher obsessed with analyzing every last inch of ancient tech--and he drinks a <em>lot</em> of coffee. The dozen or so characters I met in this demo all burst with personality, and their back-and-forth banter elicited more than a few laughs. There were a few references to potential plot points in the main game too.</p><p dir="ltr">These characters are the emotional heart that brings the rest of Battle Suit Aces to life, and listening to their stories unfold is very cool. However, this demo is heavily unbalanced in terms of "dialogue time" versus "gaming time." There is a hefty amount of dialogue that you have to skip through, and while it's all important and worthy of your attention, it does mean it will take a while to get from one card battle to the next.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4485597"></a><figcaption>Like Battle Chef Brigade, Battle Suit Aces' biggest strengths are its gorgeous art and intriguing characters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4485597-battle6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you do decide to listen, there's also a ton of information being thrown at you all at once, and it may leave you wondering what the heck is happening in this game. Some of the terms are easy enough to pick up--Blue Crest is the name of the ancient mech, the Pholians are the ancient race who developed the tech, etc.--but there are some sentences that sound like complete rubbish out of context. If you're the type that likes to have all of the information all at once, you may experience an overload of that info before long, especially in the time constraints of an hour-long demo.</p><p dir="ltr">Battle Suit Aces smashes a bunch of different elements together--mech suits, spaceships, card battles, upgrade systems, dialogue trees, and more--into an interesting package. Card battles are fun and engaging, especially when extra wrinkles are thrown in to challenge you in new ways. The crew of the Zephyr are shaping up to be the emotional weight of the story, with a few interesting details already spilling out in this short demo playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo only offered a limited amount of time with Trinket Studios' latest, but despite the brevity, I'm hopeful that the full experience will come up aces.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo for Battle Suit Aces is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870530/Battle_Suit_Aces/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p>

It's been discovered that the patch has made a key change to how the eShop charts work, with the apparent aim of de-prioritizing so-called "shovelware."</p><p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-has-changed-its-eshop-charts-in-an-apparent-move-to-hide-shovelware/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> reported that the update changes the eShop charts such that it now ranks games based on revenue from sales in the past 72 hours. Previously, the ranking was based on total sales volume over the past 48 hours.</p><p>The eShop--and Xbox, PlayStation, and PC digital storefronts--are filled with shovelware-type games that are known to be misleading, low-quality, and inexpensive. One popular theory is that the publishers of these types of games sell their titles at low prices to help them rank higher in the charts. Under the new eShop ranking system, this might not be as effective.</p><p>VGC and others have pointed out how this new system could negatively impact higher-quality lower-priced games. But it remains to be seen how it'll all shake out in the end. Also unknown is how the eShop might work on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, which launches in June.</p><p>The Switch's ver. 20.0.0 update arrived earlier this week, introducing the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a> feature announced during the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6377/" data-ref-id="2900-6377">March 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/" data-ref-id="1100-6530545">GameShare</a> support and other compatibility with the upcoming Switch 2 system.</p><p>After installing the update, digital titles and DLC you've purchased will now be converted to Virtual Game Cards. These function similarly to physical game cards. You can load and share your digital games between two Switch systems, making it easier to manage your digital library. You can also loan out digital games temporarily to other users within your family group.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">full rundown of the 20.0.0 Switch update.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming site Polygon has been sold to Valnet, Kotaku first <a href="https://kotaku.com/polygon-sold-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-digital-gaming-1851778655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> this morning. Multiple staff members have confirmed they've lost their jobs on social media.</p><p>Former editor-in-chief Chris Plante referenced a sale on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, writing in part "I won't be talking more about the sale because I wasn't involved." Valnet confirmed the sale in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a>, writing that "The acquisition, an asset deal, closed today." Valnet writes that "Polygon will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio."</p><p>In a statement in the press release by Jim Bankoff, CEO of Polygon's former owner Vox, Bankoff says, "This transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio/video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” </p><p>Numerous staff members have lost their jobs due to the sale. A former employee tells us they believe at least 25 people have been let go. They note that many of those let go were union members; the Vox Media Union, under the Writers Guild of America East, is currently in contract bargaining.</p><p>Workers from Polygon tell us a small number of staff have received offers to stay on. One tells us that eight editors have received this offer, though they don't know how those people were selected over others who lost their jobs. They said, "I am incandescently angry that Vox Media did this to us. I personally believe that, in the immediate, Vox should be the target of blame for this decision."</p><p>According to a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nymagunion.bsky.social/post/3lo4u5jx7b22d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> post by the New York Magazine Union, another site owned by Vox, their site "also had members impacted by layoffs at Vox today."  </p><p>Valnet owns multiple gaming sites, including GameRant, Dualshockers, The Gamer, and review score site Open Critic. Recently, Valnet <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-sues-thewrap-libel-hassan-youssef-sweatshop-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued The Wrap</a> over a March story regarding allegations about labor conditions at the company.</p><p>Polygon was founded in 2012 and has been one of the biggest sites in gaming, boasting a team of talented editors, writers, reporters, video producers, and more. The site has been at the forefront of labor and culture reporting, as well as innovative guides content. It's full of people we at Aftermath know and love, and who didn't deserve to lose their jobs today.  </p><p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1917959352243098073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Apex Legends: Prodigy season will begin on Tuesday, May 6, delivering a new playable hero called Sparrow.</p>
<p>His real name is Enea Davide Guarino. According to the lore prepared by the developers, he was born into the most respected bounty hunter clan in the Outlands, renowned for their unparalleled archery skills and dogmatic moral code. Guarino, a young and irreverent rogue, quickly became the black sheep of his clan. After a particularly reckless decision, it became clear they would never see eye to eye, and his family shunned Enea.</p>
<p>Despite this, Sparrow is determined to figure out how to have it all—a life on his own terms and his family's acceptance. The child prodigy hopes to regain his family's respect by participating in the Apex Games. For the first two weeks of the Apex Legends: Prodigy season, Sparrow will be temporarily unlocked for all players. Players will have the opportunity to add Sparrow to their permanent pantheon of Legends by completing challenges that will test their skills with Legends, weapons, and damage.</p>
<p>Sparrow's passive is Double Jump. Players can jump twice as high by pressing the button a second time while in the air. Moreover, when climbing a wall and hitting a double jump, they'll launch right up to the top of that wall. His tactical ability is a Tracker Dart that reveals all enemies passing through the area. Lastly, his Ultimate is Stinger Bolt. This ability lets Sparrow wreak havoc on multiple targets simultaneously with a large arrow that creates a damaging energy field. Anyone caught in the open and within line of sight is affected. More information about Sparrow will be released in a dedicated blog scheduled to go live tomorrow.</p>

<p>Apex Legends: Prodigy also sees the return of the Bocek Compound Bow, which can be loaded with Frag Grenades and energized to create Explosive Arrows. Arena matches also return, albeit with some differences. Firstly, they are shorter, as the first team to win three rounds will be crowned champion. Throughout the season, weapons in the store will be banned for some time after being selected by a player, and a discount will kick off in certain rounds to tempt players away from their preferred weapons. Finally, Health items will be available at the beginning of the round. Later in the season, a new 1v1 Arena variant called Duels will make its debut.</p>
<p>Ranked mode is getting tweaked, too. The player's starting Rank Tier and Division will now be based on their (hidden) skill value from past seasons, and the Bronze reset rule for those who missed a season has been removed. The season also introduces Ranked Challenges and Ranked Ladders, giving players more stuff to chase. More details will be shared in the patch notes.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi teams at Respawn Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were just hit by significant layoffs</a>. This also caused the cancellation of two early projects at the incubation stage, one of which would have been a Titanfall extraction shooter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA "Pausing Development on Future Rally Titles"]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced it will be "pausing" development on future rally racing games, including the <em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, which has been running in one form or another since the early 2000s.</p>

<p>In a development <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-wrc/wrc-24/news/wrc-development-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on its website, EA says that "every great journey eventually finds its finish line", and that it's "reached the end of the road working on <em>WRC</em>". As such, the 2024 season of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">released back in 2023</a>, will be both the game's last expansion and the last&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>-related thing you'll see from EA, at least for a while.</p>

<p>The studio says it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles", so it sounds like it's not just&nbsp;<em>WRC</em>, but also games like the&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>series that won't be getting any future installments for the time being.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=0HBHh69H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-rally-games-ending-development-car.jpg?itok=BZ9KAiW0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA is pausing development on its rally games.</figcaption></figure><p>EA says its time with&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>was a "culmination of sorts for [its] Codemasters journey", and that it's "provided a home for every rally enthusiast" over the course of its&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dirt&nbsp;</em>franchises.</p>

<p>News of EA pausing its rally games comes a year or so after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/layoffs-codemasters-tinybuild-new-world-interactive" rel="nofollow">layoffs at Codemasters</a>, the studio responsible for the aforementioned franchises (as well as the&nbsp;<em>GRID&nbsp;</em>series and the official&nbsp;<em>F1&nbsp;</em>tie-in games, neither of which appear to be affected by this announcement).</p>

<p>The news also follows yesterday's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">report that EA will lay off around 300 to 400 of its employees</a>, around 100 of whom work on games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>for EA subsidiary Respawn. Both franchises remain active, however.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the official Codemasters <a href="https://x.com/Codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a> appears to have been scrubbed of all of its posts, suggesting that there may be a less-than-heroic end for the studio waiting in the wings following this announcement.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/659575/polygon-vox-media-sold-valnet-gamerant<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Polygon</em>, <em>The Verge’s</em> sister site dedicated to gaming and entertainment, has been sold by Vox Media to Valnet, a company that owns brands like <em>ScreenRant</em>, <em>GameRant</em>, and <em>Android Police</em>. Some <em>Polygon</em> staffers will continue with the publication under its new owner, while others have been laid off, according to posts online and an internal message sent to Vox Media employees.</p><p>Valnet owns more than 27 different brands that cover areas like entertainment, gaming, sports, and travel. A recent report <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/">from <em>TheWrap</em></a> includes one former contributor to a site under Valnet’s purview describing conditions as “almost sweatshop-level.”</p><p>“Perfectly aligned with Valnet’s long-term growth strategy, <em>Polygon</em> will now integrate Valnet’s Gaming Portfolio, which includes industry-leading publications such as <em>Game Rant</em>, <em>TheGamer</em>, <em>Fextralife</em>, <em>OpenCritic</em>, <em>DualShockers</em>, and <em>HardcoreGamer</em>,” <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250501630767/en/Valnet-Acquires-Premium-Gaming-Publication-Polygon-from-Vox-Media">the company said in a press release</a>. “This addition follows Valnet’s recent acquisition of <em>FextraLife</em> earlier this year, further strengthening its position in the gaming media landscape. With Valnet’s proven operational excellence, <em>Polygon</em> is poised to reach new editorial heights through focused investment and innovation.”</p><p>Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff said in a statement that “this transaction will enable us to focus our energies and investment resources in other priority areas of growth across our portfolio of iconic digital publications and audio / video programming, while enabling Valnet to grow their leadership and authority in the gaming information category.” In his message to staff, Bankoff also cited the current “uncertain economic outlook” and broader changes in the gaming industry as contributing reasons to the sale.</p><p>“I’m no longer with Polygon,” says former <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26">editor-in-chief Chris Plante</a>. “If you’re hiring, please consider the many talented writers and editors now on the market. Every one of them deserves a spot on your staff. I won’t be talking more about the sale because I wasn’t involved.”</p><p>We’ve collected additional posts from some affected staffers below.</p><p><em><strong>Update, May 1st</strong>: Added posts from more Polygon staffers.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
