Normally $60 at full price, it’s currently just $15 with a 75 percent discount. Meanwhile <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, last year’s excellent sequel that changed up the grim city management sim’s mechanics and story, is currently just $36 (20 percent off). </p><p>Here are some other highlights from the sale which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/grab-some-hot-bargains-in-our-epic-games-store-2025-winter-sale-buyer-s-guide&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/grab-some-hot-bargains-in-our-epic-games-store-2025-winter-sale-buyer-s-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">runs February 10 to February 24</a></span>:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Cyberpunk 2077 - $27 (55 percent off) </li><li>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor - $17.50 ( 75 percent off) </li><li>Mass Effect Legendary Edition - $6 (90 percent off) </li><li>Manor Lords - $28 (30 percent off) </li><li>Mafia: Definitive Edition - $8 (80 percent off) </li><li>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands - $12 (80 percent off)</li><li>Outer Wilds - $15 (40 percent off) </li><li>Homeworld 3 - $30 (50 percent off) </li><li>Sifu - $16 (60 percent off) </li><li>Star Wars Outlaws - $42 (40 percent off) </li><li>Hogwarts Legacy - $21 (70 percent off) </li><li>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - $36 (40 percent off)</li><li>Going Under - $5 (75 percent off)</li><li>Planet of Lana - $10 (50 percent off) </li><li>Dredge - $15 (40 percent off) </li><li>Blasphemous 2 - $15 (50 percent off) </li></ul></blockquote><p>The latest batch of free games have also arrived on the Epic store. Deep sea exploration adventure <em>Beyond Blue </em>and tile-based strategy sim <em>Humankind</em> are both available to claim now through February 13 on PC for anyone with an Epic account. And while the current discount on it isn’t very notable (only 10 percent off), roguelike survival sim <em>Tankhead</em> is also worth a look. The game about using junk to craft the ultimate killing machine and take down giant<em> Shadow of the Colossus</em>-style bosses has plenty of rough edges, but also some really cool ideas and a beautiful visual style. </p><p>The only real bummer is that the Epic Games Store coupon hasn’t returned with the new winter sale. In the past, users got access to a re-usable coupon for $10 off anything in the store that was over a certain amount. Then it changed to a percentage discount. And now it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/1hcoelj/no_coupon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EpicGamesPC/comments/1hcoelj/no_coupon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seems to have been abandoned altogether</a></span>. Epic’s desire to bootstrap the process of creating a meaningful rival to Steam has been expensive. The coupons perk was seemingly the latest casualty of the company cutting back on giveaways. </p><p>The good news is that you can still get 5 percent back on all Epic Games Store purchases to spend on additional games (or <em>Fortnite </em>skins). </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>2025 is shaping up to be a big year for Nintendo, as the Mario company is launching a highly anticipated new system, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>. But the company isn't going to rely only on traditional hardware and games to find success. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has opened up on why Nintendo must push "beyond video games" to encourage people to engage with Nintendo.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250205e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's latest earnings report</a>, Furukawa said Nintendo is making use of theme parks, official stores, "visual content," and mobile experiences to "generate interest in our core business." In case there was any doubt, Furukawa stressed that the "dedicated video game platform business" is Nintendo's core business, and efforts outside of that are being undertaken to funnel people back there.</p><p>"Going forward, even as we transition to Nintendo Switch 2, it remains important to increase touchpoints beyond video games," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive said content and experiences for smart phones will play a "very important" role in this effort, and Nintendo will continue to push in this area, Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo's push into the mobile market has already reached some 900 million cumulative downloads, Furukawa said, noting that some of Nintendo's success in the smartphone business has come in countries and regions that don't have support for Nintendo's traditional game consoles.</p><p>"I believe this has increased the opportunities for more people to access Nintendo IP and characters," Furukawa said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="315911290"

with Pokemon Go company Niantic. Nintendo shut down online services for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp at the end of 2024 amid a transition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-pocket-camps-microtransaction-free-version-is-out-now-for-10-doubles-soon/1100-6528152/" data-ref-id="1100-6528152">making it a paid game called Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete.</a></p><p>"Although we cannot provide details on future application releases, we are continuing to develop new game applications," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo also has the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo Music app</a>, which launched in 2024 and continues to get updates that add new tracks. In general, Furukawa said Nintendo's aim is to use smartphone apps to "create opportunities for consumers to come into contact with Nintendo game worlds and music even outside of dedicated game systems."</p><p>He added: "Going forward, we would like to continue to develop these types of initiatives, including integration with games, for individual titles."</p><p>Furukawa acknowledged that, for many people, their first gaming platform is not a traditional console but rather a smart device. So Nintendo is trying to meet people where they are, with the assumption being that one day they might pick up a Switch console and games, in addition to whatever they might use and enjoy on their smart phone.</p><p>"We will continue to deliberate on this topic," Furukawa said.</p><p>Even before Furukawa was named president of Nintendo, the company acknowledged that a growing percentage of people first encounter Nintendo experiences outside of a platform that Nintendo sells. For example, previous president Tatsumi Kimishima said fewer and fewer young people are finding out about Nintendo games through... games. Instead, they're discovering Nintendo and its characters through things like <a href="http://www.armandhammer.com/personal-care/kids-toothbrushes/Products/spinbrush-mario.aspx" rel="nofollow ">officially licensed Mario toothbrushes</a>. He <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-mario-toothbrushes-and-other-licensing-de/1100-6434624/" data-ref-id="1100-6434624">said in 2016</a> that people can expect these kinds of licensing deals to continue and possibly increase, and indeed they have.</p><p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie, released in 2023, is perhaps Nintendo's biggest non-gaming success story so far--it brought in more than $1.3 billion at the box office. It is one of the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross/?area=XWW" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 20 highest-grossing movies in history</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 1 video game movie of all time</a>. Multiple more Nintendo movies are on the way, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-planned-to-come-out-this-decade/1100-6527603/" data-ref-id="1100-6527603">live-action Zelda film</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-gets-exciting-update-about-its-characters-and-world/1100-6526856/" data-ref-id="1100-6526856">The Super Mario Bros. Movie 2.</a></p><p>Then there is the Super Nintendo World theme park attraction, which expands in a big way this May when it opens at Universal Studios in Orlando. And anyone who's been to a grocery store or a department store knows full well how many licensed Nintendo toys there are.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, the new console launches later this year. Nintendo will share more details about the system during a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Nintendo Direct in April. </a></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Those waiting for the Black Hawk Down campaign for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force/" data-ref-id="5000-621469">Delta Force</a>, the modern free-to-play revival of the classic FPS series, won't have to wait much longer. Developer Team Jade, a subsidiary of Chinese gaming giant Tencent, announced the paid DLC will launch February 21.</p><p dir="ltr">Delta Force's upcoming Black Hawk Down campaign is a remake of the 2003 shooter of the same name, it in turn based on a book documenting the real events involving a US military task force during the Somali Civil War in 1993. Team Jade released a brief teaser trailer alongside the release date to give fans an idea of what to expect, showing battles through the destroyed streets of Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXnHhjWNxds" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pXnHhjWNxds" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The Black Hawk Down campaign for Delta Force was originally slated to arrive in January, so its new February release date is actually a delay. As for how much the campaign will cost, Team Jade has not officially said just yet. Team Jade states in the description for the campaign's launch teaser trailer that more details will be coming in the following days. In a development diary Q&amp;A from last year, Team Jade said the campaign DLC will not feature microtransactions and can be played co-op.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/delta-force-black-hawk-down/" data-ref-id="5000-4624">Delta Force: Black Hawk Down</a> was the sixth game in developer NovaLogic's Delta Force tactical FPS series, and released on PC in 2003 before being ported to PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2005.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't interesting in checking out Delta Force's campaign, its free-to-play multiplayer offerings have been regularly updated in the weeks following its December 2024 release. The game has drawn comparisons to EA's Battlefield series for the large player counts and vehicle gameplay seen in its Warfare game mode, but additionally includes an extraction-style mode and a 3v3v3 squad-focused game type called Hot Zone. Though Delta Force is currently only available on PC, it is slated to release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile sometime this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of Battlefield, EA recently gave fans a first-look at gameplay for the next entry in the series alongside announcing a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">community testing program called Battlefield Labs</a> intended to help it avoid some of the pitfalls of Battlefield 2042.</p>

                <p>EA has called on fans to provide feedback on the art direction of the reimagined of Plants vs. Zombies 3.</p><p>"We ran some external tests to gather insight into which art styles sparked interest among participants in our focus groups! We’re actively gathering that data, but we also know that there’s no better feedback than yours--the passionate PvZ community," EA said in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-3/news" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new blog post</a>.</p><p>EA showed three images of the same plant punching a zombie but in three different art styles and is asking fans to share their thoughts on social media with the hashtag #PvZ3 and which one they prefer. The first one is a slightly 3D cel-shaded art direction compared to the second one.

                <p>The Order: 1886 developer Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel to Sony but was ultimately rejected. While the reason was unclear, the developer thought that had the game's critical reception been higher, there would've been a better chance.</p><p>"We really thought that with The Order, we had set up such a unique and appealing baseline that people were going to forgive some of its shortcomings," Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0&amp;t=2s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with MinnMax</a>. "It would've been an incredible sequel, I can tell you for a fact."</p><p>Despite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-order-1886-review/1900-6416033/" data-ref-id="1900-6416033">The Order 1886's lukewarm critical reception</a>, sitting at a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-order-1886/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">63 on GameSpot's sister site Metacritic</a>, Ready at Dawn pitched a sequel. Pessino explained that it was actually better that Sony passed on the sequel because the budget would've been small and the studio didn't have any leverage to negotiate a better contract. However, Pessino said that the team would've taken the opportunity anyway in order to redeem The Order: 1886.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rFmUHo_pJJ0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Pessnio didn't divulge any details about where the sequel would take place, as the IP belongs to Sony and not Ready at Dawn. One of the problems during the development of The Order: 1886 was the pressure to ship so content was cut--interactive elements became cutscenes and movies. "We were desperate, you know, we had to ship," he said. "We need at least one more year and we didn't get it."</p><p>Pessino didn't reveal how much The Order: 1886 sold, but thought Sony's rejection was based on critical reception rather than sales numbers. Interestingly, he said that internal mock reviews placed the game's score at around the 70s range, yet when the game was released, the critical reception ended up being lower. Had it actually scored somewhere in the 70s, then Pessino was convinced there could've been a sequel.</p><p>A sequel to The Order 1886 isn't the only one that Sony passed on. Last week, it was revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resistance-4-was-pitched-but-didnt-work-out-says-former-boss/1100-6529337/" data-ref-id="1100-6529337">Sony passed on Resistance 4</a> when it was pitched as well. Ready at Dawn was acquired by Meta in 2020, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-order-1886-and-lone-echo-developer-shuts-down/1100-6525619/" data-ref-id="1100-6525619">was shut down last August</a>.</p>

Although the team has yet to spill the beans on what exactly this Season 1.5 update has in store, <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a Dev Talk blog post</u></a> on the Marvel Rivals website teased “major balance adjustments.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for The Thing and Human Torch, we have yet to see exactly how the two classic heroes will light up the roster with their new moves and abilities. Mister Fantastic and the Invisible Woman were introduced as the first post-launch Marvel Rivals heroes when Season 1 launched last month. Both characters brought along unique tools to shift the multiplayer game’s meta in a new direction, with Reed Richards able to take stretchy (and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-fans-are-stretching-mister-fantastics-meme-potential-to-its-limit"><u>goofy</u></a>) swings at enemies thanks to his elastic powers while Sue Storm introduced invisibility mechanics to the battlefield. Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm will surely do the same when they launch in a few weeks, but let’s hope NetEase reveals some gameplay before then.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upcoming Marvel Rivals Season 1 update will also see Ranked players hit with a rank reset. Come February 21, expect to see your Rank drop four divisions, meaning if you’re a Diamond I player on February 20, you’ll be brought down to Platinum II the following day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase explained how this process will carry on in the future, saying that brand-new seasons will hit players with a six-division drop, while half-season updates will bring a four-division drop. As Marvel Rivals continues to tweak its Ranked offerings to players’ desires, NetEase said it will “tune this as necessary.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all doom and gloom, though, as competitive Marvel fans in the Gold rank can look forward to new costume rewards with the launch of the second half of Season 1. NetEase will also be introducing new Crests of Honor to “recognize players at Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All (the top 500).”</p><div id="marvel-rivals-tier-list-best-heroes" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3><h3>Marvel Rivals Tier List: Best Heroes</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Superhero fans had been not-so-patiently waiting to hear more about how Marvel Rivals will continue its post-launch plans, and The Fantastic Four is just the beginning.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission has confirmed that Roblox is "part of an active and ongoing investigation."</p><p><a href="https://hntrbrk.com/roblox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hunterberg Media</a> originally reported last fall that Roblox was under investigation by the SEC over charges that it "inflated key metrics" for investors on Wall Street and for its lax safety measures regarding potential child predators on the platform. The SEC did not confirm that Roblox's parent company, The Roblox Corporation, is under investigation. However, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> has confirmed that the SEC refused to provide details of its investigation because it may "harm... the ongoing enforcement proceeding."</p><p>In November 2024, The Roblox Corporation laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-putting-restrictions-on-kids-in-social-hangouts/1100-6527648/" data-ref-id="1100-6527648">new safety guidelines for children</a> on the platform. Children under the age of 13 are no longer allowed access to unrated experiences created within Roblox, and only children 13 and older will be allowed to utilize the social hangouts and free-form user-creation experiences. That move came after a previous <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> story which noted that The Roblox Company reported over 13,000 instances of child exploitation to authorities in 2023. Moreover, two dozen people were arrested for abusing children after making contact with them through the platform.</p><p>The Roblox Corporation <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/07/driving-civility-and-safety-for-all-users" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to that report</a> by touting its cooperation with law enforcement to combat illegal activity on the platform. It also suggested that Bloomberg's report didn't contextualize the scale of the child exploitation problem with Roblox's large user base.</p><p>During last year's Roblox Developers Conference, The Roblox Corporation reiterated its plans to reach <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-corp-eyeing-1-billion-daily-players/1100-6516723/" data-ref-id="1100-6516723">1 billion daily active users</a>. If it's proven that The Roblox inflated its current estimate of daily Roblox users to investors, that could potentially lead to severe penalties from the SEC.</p>

NetEase said players will need to complete 10 matches in competitive mode in order to claim the rewards for any given season.</p><p dir="ltr">What balance changes are in store for Marvel Rivals is still under wraps, but NetEase did confirm that the Human Torch and The Thing will be making their debut alongside the mid-season update. The Thing will be a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-best-vanguard-tank-heroes/2900-6103/" data-ref-id="2900-6103">Vanguard character</a>.

Given how dominate Strategists and their game-halting healing ultimate abilities currently are, it's likely nerfs are incoming for characters like Cloak &amp; Dagger and Luna Snow. However, players will have to wait for the official patch notes to see what's in store for Marvel Rivals mid-Season 1 update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/609367/roblox-discord-openai-google-roost-online-safety-tools<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Google, OpenAI, Roblox, and Discord have formed a new non-profit organization to help improve child safety online. The <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/leading-technology-companies-and-foundations-back-new-initiative-to-provide-free-open-source-tools-for-a-safer-internet-in-the-ai-era-302371243.html">Robust Open Online Safety Tools (ROOST</a>) initiative aims to make core safety technologies more accessible for companies and provide free, open-source AI tools for identifying, reviewing, and reporting child sexual abuse material.</p><p>The initiative was partially motivated by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24138356/ai-companies-csam-thorn-training-data">changes that generative AI advancements</a> have made to online environments and aims to address “a critical need to accelerate innovation in online child safety,” according to founding ROOST partner and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Details about the CSAM detection tools are slim beyond that they will utilize large language AI models and “unify” existing options for dealing with the content.</p><p>“Starting with a platform focused on child protection, ROOST’s collaborative, open-source approach will foster innovation and make essential infrastructure more transparent, accessible, and inclusive, with the goal of creating a safer internet for everyone,” said Schmidt.</p><div><p>The <a href="https://roost.tools/">ROOST</a> announcement comes amid a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa">huge regulatory battle regarding child safety</a> on social media and online platforms, with companies seeking to appease lawmakers with self-regulation methods.</p></div><div><p>The <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/cybertiplinedata">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC) reports that suspected child exploitation increased by 12 percent between 2022 and 2023. As of 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite">over half of US children were on Roblox</a>, and the company has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse">repeatedly criticized</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">failing to tackle child sexual exploitation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/21/24296652/new-york-childrens-online-safety-act-gounardes-privacy">exposure to inappropriate content</a> on its platform. Roblox and Discord were also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23390796/roblox-discord-facebook-snapchat-social-media-lawsuits-addiction-child-abuse">singled out in a social media lawsuit filed in 2022</a> that alleged the platforms failed to stop adults from messaging children without supervision.</p></div><p>Founding members of ROOST are variously providing funding and offering their tools or expertise to the project. ROOST says it’s partnering with leading AI foundation model developers to build a “community of practice” for content safeguards, which will include providing vetted AI training datasets and identifying gaps in safety.</p><p>The initiative says it will be making “tools that already exist” more accessible, effectively combining various detection and reporting tech from its member organizations into a unified solution that’s easier for other companies to implement. Naren Koneru, Roblox’s vice president of engineering, trust, and safety, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91275256/roblox-joins-27-million-industry-nonprofit-to-support-online-safety">told <em>Fast Company</em></a> that ROOST may host AI moderation systems that companies can integrate through API calls. There’s some ambiguity about what ROOST’s AI moderation tools will include, however.</p><p>For example, Discord says its contributions will build on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/7/23950604/lantern-program-csam-child-exploitation-google-meta-discord-privacy">Lantern cross-platform information-sharing project</a> it joined in 2023 alongside Meta and Google. It could also include <a href="https://github.com/Roblox/voice-safety-classifier">an updated version of Roblox’s AI model</a> for detecting profanity, racism, bullying, sexting, and other inappropriate content in audio clips, which the company is planning to open-source this year. It’s unclear precisely how the tools will intersect with existing first-line CSAM detection systems like <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna">Microsoft’s PhotoDNA image analysis tool</a>.</p><p>Alongside <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">its participation in ROOST</a>, Discord has released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/609310/discord-ignore-mute-users-feature-block">a new “Ignore” feature</a> that allows users to hide messages and notifications they receive without notifying the people they have muted. “At Discord, we believe that safety is a common good,” Discord’s Chief Legal Officer Clint Smith said in the ROOST announcement. “We’re committed to making the entire internet - not just Discord - a better and safer place, especially for young people.” </p><p>ROOST has raised more than $27 million to support its first four years of operations, backed by philanthropic organizations including the McGovern Foundation, Future of Online Trust and Safety Fund, Knight Foundation, and the AI Collaborative. The ROOST organization will also be supported by experts in child safety, artificial intelligence, open-source technology, and “countering violent extremism” according to the press release.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
