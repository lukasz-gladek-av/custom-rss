<div>
<div><p>Yesterday afternoon the <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/changelog#BackwardsCompatibilitywith2014Material">Changelog for D&amp;DBeyond</a> was updated to highlight what changes would be taking place with the launch of the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024</a> Core Rulebooks</em>, such as the <em>Player Handbook </em>releasing in September. One aspect that has caught everyone's eye is the section on 2014 Spells and Magic Items which stated that Magic Items and Spells that have a 2024 counterpart would replace their 2014 version.</p>
<p>In the changelog it is suggested that if a player wants to use the 2014 version of a spell or magic item that they use D&amp;DBeyond's Homebrew Tool to create those versions and add them to your character in that way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dndbeyond-changelog-magic-item.jpg?itok=v6ofPv-J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dndbeyond-changelog-magic-item.jpg?itok=OWXx65q5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The highlighted text is important that if there was a 2024 counterpart and you want to use the 2014 edition you'll need to create it yourself​​​​​</figcaption></figure><p>D&amp;DBeyond's homebrew functionality at it's most base functionality, creating Homebrew items for you alone to use, is a free feature.</p>
<p>If you are a subscriber at the Hero or Master Tier it offers additional functionality. As a Hero subscriber you can access all published homebrew material of other users, and as a Master Tier you have the same homebrew access but you can also share items in your Homebrew collection with members of your campaign. This is a way to create magical items or spells and allow your characters to simply add them to their character sheet.</p>
<h2>How Different Are Spells In <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e 2024</em>?</h2>
<p>Reviewing these changes I was interested to understand what kinds of differences there are between Spells from 2014 and Spells from 2024 so I spot-checked a number of spells that are commonly used. I've listed the Spell names and any differences below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Acid Splash</strong>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Difference: The 2014 Acid Splash can only target 1-2 creatures, the 2024 Acid Splash targets all creatures in a 5-foot-radius Sphere</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arcane Lock</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: The 2014 Arcane Lock can be suppressed by Knock for 10 minutes and when affected by the spell the DC to pick the lock increases by 10, the 2024 Arcane Lock states "This lock can't be unlocked by any nonmagical means" but does not specify the effect of Knock</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Faerie Fire</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>The description is different, but there is no mechanical change</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fireball</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: The 2014 edition specifies that "The fire spreads around corners", the 2024 version does not</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goodberry</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Somewhat Mechanical Change: The 2014 edition states that "up to ten berries appear..." whereas the 2024 version states outright that "ten berries appear in your hand"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 edition it takes an Action to eat a berry, in 2024 it takes a Bonus Action to eat a berry</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<p><strong>Heroes Feast</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanic Change: Heroes Feast can be cast by a Bard in 2024</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 edition the spell gives the effects of being "cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with Advantage", the 2024 edition instead gives you "resistance to Poison damage, and Immunity to Frightened and Poisoned condition."</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Inflict Wounds</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Major Mechanical Change: In 2014 this is triggered by a melee spell attack that on success deals 3d10 Necrotic damage, in 2024 this is a Constitution saving throw that on success deals 2d10 Necrotic damage</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Invisibility</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>No mechanical change, but some text difference</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mass Cure Wounds</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 it is specified that Mass Cure Wounds has "no effect on undead or constructs", that restriction is not specified in the 2024 book</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Otto's Irresistible Dance</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Text Change: The text for the 2024 edition of the spell is quite different, but the mechanics are mostly the same</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In the 2024 edition of the spell the target is additionally charmed for the duration of the spell</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pass Without A Trace</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Component Change: In 2014 ashes from a burned leafe of mistletoe and a sprig of spruce is required, in 2024 only the ashes are needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text Change: In 2014 there is specification that affected creatures "can't be tracked except by magical means", in 2024 there is no explicit mention other than the affected creatures "leave no tracks"</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Power Word Kill</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Mechanical Change: In 2014 if the target has more than 100 HP the spell has no effect, in 2024 if the target has more than 100 HP the target takes 12d12 Psychic damage.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revivify</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Availability Change: In 2024 this is available for Druid and Ranger</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Spirit Guardians</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Component Change: In 2014 it uses a holy symbol, in 2024 it uses a prayer scroll</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>From the above we're able to see that even from a spot check there are a lot of tweaks that spells have taken on from the 2014 to the 2024 release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em>.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Wizards of the Coast for a comment on why the 2014 edition of a spell would be removed instead of being labeled as legacy, as well as how many spells have been altered from their 2014 rendition.</p>

In addition to giving a release window of early 2025, the footage highlights seemingly every major system you’ll be dealing with in the sandy survival MMO.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197209" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here are the biggest things we saw during <em>Dune: Awakening</em>’s massive gameplay look.</p><h2 id="h119946"><a id=""></a><strong>Character creation gives you lots of sliders</strong></h2><p>The first thing the new gameplay footage showed off was <em>Awakening</em>’s character creation process. It begins with your protagonist’s appearance which you can finetune or choose from a series of presets. The preset characters feel like they would fit right at home in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-part-2-review-1851275251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-part-2-review-1851275251">Denis Villeneuve movies</a></span>, and the developers say that is intentional. But if you want your hero to be your own then you will have a ton of sliders to customize to your heart’s content. That includes age, height, and more granular features like neck length. </p><p>Character creation really gets into the larger <em>Dune </em>lore in its second part, which tasks you with choosing your history. The biggest choice will be who your mentor is as this will determine your starting stats when you finally enter the world. While the mentors were quickly cycled through, it appears that there will be one for every potential playstyle you might want to try out, like the melee-focused sword master that gets up close and personal with enemies. </p><h2 id="h119947"><a id=""></a><strong>The world wants to kill you</strong></h2><p>After character creation we see what will be our first steps onto Arrakis. Awakening (pun intended) in a cave, you’ll get a chance to adjust to the game’s movement and basic crafting before getting pushed out into the dangerous desert. Once you do venture out into the sun you’ll be faced with a series of environmental challenges to constantly juggle. Heat, sun exposure, and hydration are all going to affect how you move and fight in the world. </p><p>Navigating in the shadows of the desert is a necessity, as the longer you are in the sun the closer you are to getting one of many debuffs the game can inflict on you. You’ll also have to look out for ways to scavenge water from plants and even the blood of your enemies to stay alive. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> is a survival game at its core so you should be ready for the world to fight back against you at all times. That includes giant sandworms that can show up while you walk around the desert. Like in established lore, it looks like there isn’t much to do when these giant beasts show up (not at first), so you simply need to rush to safety as fast as you can.</p><figure id="" data-id="0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-recommend-id="image://0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-recommend-id="image://0996cd5e999b8b2c9f763ee1cd4a65b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures in a helicopter look as a giant sand worm arises out of the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h119948"><a id=""></a><strong>The spice will flow</strong></h2><p>One status effect that <em>Dune: Awakening</em> teased is related to spice. You can get overexposed to the drug of Arrakis and succumb to some mysterious effect that the developers only teased in the preview. Due to how spice is connected with the more mystical side of the <em>Dune </em>lore, I would theorize that spice might unlock special powers or narrative secrets, though there will likely be some price you have to pay for such forbidden knowledge.</p><h2 id="h119949"><a id=""></a><strong>Movement mechanics let you zoom all over the place</strong></h2><p>One of the coolest parts of the gameplay showcase was seeing all the movement tech <em>Awakening </em>has both in and out of combat. There is freeform climbing that lets you scale any surface you see, grappling hook-like tools that let you zip up and across large spaces, and the suspensor belt that lets you hover over gaps. </p><p><em>Dune: Awakening</em> looks to be an extremely fluid game with a surprising amount of verticality. That extends to combat, which lets you zip around arenas to get the jump on enemies. Even out in the desert, which you might expect to be flat as far as the eye can see, you can use movement tech to scale the rocky outcroppings scattered across the map.</p><figure id="" data-id="c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-recommend-id="image://c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-recommend-id="image://c2b28f8beecc6bb76c7ea20312df0a35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two figures shoot guns and a flamethrower at oncoming enemies" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h119950"><a id=""></a><strong>Combat is all about customization</strong></h2><p>When fighting enemies (NPCs or other players, as this is an online game) you’ll have a wealth of different ways to approach combat. There various classes focus on melee, firearms, or mystical skills that give you special insight into your opponents’ abilities. There are some extensive skill trees and it looks like you can pick and choose abilities on the fly to tackle any situation.. </p><p>For example, shields are a big part of combat. Traditional firearms that use bullets aren’t effective against shields so you’ll need to craft dart weapons or focus on up-close melee combat. Some enemies will be shielded so you’ll need to constantly be aware of changing out your skills and arsenal of weapons.</p><h2 id="h119951"><a id=""></a><strong>Build for yourself or for friends</strong></h2><p>Once you get the hang of surviving you’ll want to stake your claim in the land in order to build a base of operations. First you need to craft a special item that lets you build on a plot of land, a plot that you will then need to pay taxes to the emperor for. Building can be visualized with holographic 3D plans and can be built by either you or an online friend. Your favorite designs can be saved and used anywhere else you decide to build, or you can sell them to other players.</p><p>Once you have a base you’ll start crafting machines that allow you to purify blood into drinkable water or build vehicles. Land vehicles make traversing the desert faster and flying vehicles will unlock even more of Arrakis.</p><figure id="" data-id="e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-recommend-id="image://e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-recommend-id="image://e613c8a2222a3d54898c8be8cf16d4ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters stand before a large holographic structure in the desert" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h119952"><a id=""></a><strong>The wider world of <em>Dune</em></strong></h2><p>Once you have a flying vehicle you’ll get access to player hubs. These are larger social spaces in the cities of Arrakis. Player hubs let you connect with other players to trade or form guilds with. There are also vendors to buy from and story-oriented quests to pursue in these hub areas.</p><p>Hubs are also the home of the game’s main two factions: the Harkonnens and the Atreides. You’ll be able to pledge allegiance to either faction in order to shape the future of Arrakis.</p><p>While grouped up with friends you can tackle testing stations. These are <em>Awakening</em>’s version of dungeons and offer a challenge to tackle with friends. In addition to some of the best loot and resources, each testing station also has its own story to unravel as you take down enemies. </p><h2 id="h119953"><a id=""></a><strong>This is the endgame</strong></h2><p>The final part of the gameplay showcase teased <em>Awakening</em>’s tough as nails endgame. This will center around large explosions of spice in the deep desert. As spice is a sought-after resource, these explosions will call every player around to come collect, turning the race for the resource into massive high level battles against players and the environment. If things go south for you and you want to throw a wrench into the fight for spice you’ll even be able to call in one of the game’s massive sandworms to put a timer on how long players can stay around before getting eaten. These large scale events look to be the highlight of <em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p><hr><p>You’ll be able to conquer the deserts of Arrakis for yourself when <em>Dune: Awakening</em> launches early next year on PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With its release just weeks away, Saber Interactive <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4238536974129469039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has released full</a> details about how customization works in Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p>



<p>Players will be able to customize their characters in the game within the Armouring Hall. Within the Hall, players can select their class, equipment, perks, and more. But how can you make your character truly unique?</p>



<h2 id="h-customization-in-space-marine-2">Customization in Space Marine 2</h2>



<p>According to Saber Interactive, each class will come with a number of pre-made armor sets that get unlocked by playing in either PvE or PvP modes. You can also create custom armor sets.</p>



<p>“This is where your creativity shines,” they said. “Various designs of helm, pauldrons, breastplate, wargear, gauntlets and greaves&nbsp;can be unlocked by playing in multiplayer modes.”</p>



<p>Within the customization options in Space Marine 2, there is an “Astartes Chapters” tab. This tab lets you access different presets that represent Space Marine Chapters. Customizing your armor allows you to choose different paint, emblems, and color patterns. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game also allows customization for Heretic Astartes characters in the game. </p>



<p>“Each class corresponds to a&nbsp;specific Traitor Legion&nbsp;(for example, Assault will always be represented by a Night Lords Raptor), but you can change the colours and apply different emblems,” they said.</p>



<p>The last thing detailed are unique customization elements that are able to be unlocked with each trailer. Emblems, armor parts, and colors are all able to be unlocked for Adeptus Astartes, Heretic Astartes, Unknown Foundings, First Founding, Second Founding and Successor Chapters.</p>



<p>“On launch,&nbsp;over 30 different Chapters have their colours and heraldry available to unlock,” they said.&nbsp;“Whilst some of them are exclusive to the Season Pass, the majority of them are available to unlock through game progression.”</p>



<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 launches on September 9 of PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/23/24226834/black-myth-wukong-hands-on-impression-game-science<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a hit: breaking all-time peak player count records on Steam, beating out <em>Counter-Strike</em> and <em>Palworld</em> to become the second most-played game on the platform, and <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599">selling more than 10 million copies across all platforms</a>. In the few days after its release, it has become one of the most talked-about games of the summer — but for all the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussion of <em>Wukong</em> on social media has been dominated by people arguing about what constitutes a valid criticism of a piece of art. Reviewers of the game have become the target of harassment, and the general tenor of conversation has reached a level of toxicity that would likely make any potentially curious player run screaming for the safety of yonder <em>Fortnite</em> hills — myself included.</p><p>Despite that trepidation, I wanted to know what, if anything, about <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> as a game was worth all the digital ink being spilled on its behalf. And while no game is worth any kind of harassment, a few hours with <em>Wukong</em> have left me wondering: this is it? <em>Wukong</em> is a gorgeous game, but its simplistic combat drags down the experience into something that’s beautiful to look at but aggressively just OK to play.</p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> is a retelling of the classical Chinese fantasy novel <em>Journey to the West</em>.&nbsp;Its opening moments feature a flashy combination of cinematics and gameplay that has Sun Wukong, the monkey king, facing off against a godlike foe while a pantheon of Chinese gods and their celestial armies observe menacingly in the distance. It goes <em>incredibly</em> hard and tickled all my wuxia / Chinese historical drama-loving bits. However, Sun Wukong is defeated, and the game starts in earnest with the player being given control of a new character tasked with finding the relics that will awaken the monkey king from his centuries-long slumber.</p><p>Wukong has some elements of a soulslike game. There are various user interface elements that remind me of <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Death causes enemies to respawn and resets player progress back to checkpoints called shrines, but it does not cause the player to lose leveling-up currency. The Destined One (DO), as he’s called in the game, can string together combos of light and heavy attacks. There’s a dodge system that rewards you with essentially more powerful attacks when executing perfect dodges. You also have magic at your disposal that lets you freeze enemies for a short amount of time or transform into creatures that have their own combat capabilities.&nbsp;</p><div><p>I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty</p></div><p>I’ve been playing on the Steam Deck, which probably isn’t the best device for the game. (<em>Wukong</em> isn’t labeled as Steam Deck certified, but that hasn’t stopped it from being <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcharts%2Fsteamdecktopplayed">the most-played game on the platform</a> over the last week.) In some spots, it chugged ferociously, even at the lowest settings. Nevertheless, the game’s environments are wonderful to behold, and I respect that the developers built moments into the game specifically to appreciate that beauty. Early on, I found a spot where DO can meditate, and the camera pulled back to show off an utterly gorgeous vista of a mountainous forest.</p><p>Despite its bombastic opening, the next few hours of the game did not come close to those initial heights — and combat is to blame. Enemies were trivially simple, and beyond one aberration of an encounter very early in the game, the bosses were, too. </p><p>After suffering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">ass-beating after ass-beating in <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>, I didn’t mind <em>Wukong</em>’s button-mashy combat style, but after a while, it got boring. The game’s narrative offset my boredom enough to keep me going. There’s a bestiary with highly descriptive entries that read like fairytales. Every time I defeated a new enemy, I’d immediately pause to read the new entry and see the enemy’s portrait that looked like a traditional woodblock painting.</p><p>It’d be nice if the conversation about the game ended here, but unfortunately, <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> has launched with a lot of baggage. In 2020, the game was introduced in the West with <a href="https://youtu.be/oRLhCxC886o?si=2ymVln2YCX0R0Gh2">a slick, 13-minute trailer</a> highlighting graphics and action that were impressive for a game still early in development. However, in November of last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west"><em>IGN</em> released a report on Game Science</a>, the studio making <em>Wukong</em>, that featured sexist comments from the game’s developers made on Chinese social media. When asked about those comments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jul/25/black-myth-wukong-the-summers-most-exciting-and-most-controversial-video-game">in recent interviews</a> <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/">with other outlets</a>, Game Science’s response has been “no comment.”</p><p>Then, in the run-up to the game’s launch earlier this week, screenshots of a document from Game Science began circulating on social media <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/08/18/the-black-myth-wukong-no-feminist-propaganda-no-covid-19-discussion-email-is-real/">featuring instructions on what influencers were and were not allowed to discuss</a>. The prohibited topics included covid-19, politics, the Chinese game industry, fetishization, “feminist propaganda,” and “other content that instigates negative discourse.”</p><p>Prerelease embargoes are common, though they’re usually limited to things like special character appearances, boss fights, plot twists, or anything the developers want to keep as a surprise for players. But it’s odd for a developer to dictate <em>how</em> a reviewer can talk about a game.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Some of the interesting monster designs from </em>Black Myth: Wukong<em>.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Game Science</cite></p></div><p>This strange move has made <em>Wukong</em> a cause celebre within certain video game communities on social media. There is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104799/gamergate-2024-sweet-baby-inc-diversity">a small but loud contingent of gamers</a> who applaud Game Science’s refusal to speak on the sexist comments made by its employees, seeing the game’s success as a repudiation of what they call the “woke” video game industry and its concerted efforts to include the opinions and perspectives of marginalized identities. So much so that reviewers who don’t enthusiastically praise the game, or bring up its developers’ history of making sexist comments, have received Gamergate-levels of harassment.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Screen Rant</em>’s review, <a href="https://screenrant.com/black-myth-wukong-review/">the author’s byline was removed “for their safety</a>.” The <em>IGN</em> reporter who wrote the initial report on Game Science was also subject to harassment, including since-deleted fabricated quotes saying they were “devastated” <em>Wukong </em>had amassed so many players. This level of violent response feels really silly for a game that’s already sold millions and is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/black-myth-wukong/">sitting comfortably at an 81 on Metacritic</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Curiosity is a powerful enticement, and I’m glad mine led me to try <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> rather than dismissing it out of hand for the unfortunate discourse. As I’ve said earlier, I love Chinese historical dramas, consuming them voraciously wherever I can get them. They have a tendency to run <em>long</em> — sometimes upwards of 100 episodes — and, unfortunately, not all of them can be bangers.</p><p>Playing <em>Wukong</em> felt like those middle episodes of a Chinese drama when the plot is spinning its wheels on the same conflict between the heroine and her evil stepmother / empress / sister / concubine. Nothing’s happening, but it’s still too damn pretty to put down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/madden-nfl-25-review-mut-boom-tech-franchise-1851630302<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Madden </em>needs a year off. </p><p>The annual NFL simulation juggernaut has been a late-summer mainstay for the video game industry for over 30 years now, bringing with it the most realistic portrayal of National Football League action there is to be found. The teams are here, the players are here, everything a football fan could want from an official simulation is here in<em> Madden NFL 25</em>.<br></p><p>As an avid fan myself—which reminds me, Go Birds—the yearly <em>Madden </em>drop should jazz me up for the upcoming regular season. As recently as a few years ago, it did; <em>Madden </em>was the signal that the NFL season was on the horizon, and the digital version would make the last month of waiting for the real thing easier.</p><p>Now though, as I sit here ready to watch some real Eagles football come September, my attitude toward <em>Madden </em>rests where no video game, much less the official simulation of one of the most popular sports in the country, should ever put its audience: Apathy. </p><h3 id="h122921"><a id=""></a>Bringing the boom</h3><p>The main addition to<em> Madden 25</em>'s football mechanics is Boom Tech, a complete redesign of the physics portraying the physicality on the field. Hundreds of small, subtle animations have been added to every point of contact during a game, and the results are tangibly better than previous years. In fact, I’d say this is the best on-field experience <em>Madden </em>has ever presented.</p><p>Every little detail—the angle of the defender, the speed of the ball-carrier, the hand the runner is using to hold the ball, etc.—-affects the results of each play thanks to this redesign. Football is a game of inches, so they say, and these extra physics-based additions make it feel like I’m earning that extra yard while being pulled down.<br></p><p>It’s neat to watch in motion, and precise execution garners some truly satisfying results. Pulling an opponent down in the open field brings a satisfying pop, to the point I can hear John Madden himself yelling “BOOM!” in my ear when I time the hit just right. Fighting through the offensive line and sacking the quarterback feels earned and worthy of the silly celebration that follows.<br></p><p>Speaking of, even celebratory moments like that offer an extra hint of authenticity through this new system. During one drive, DeVonta Smith caught a pass for 30 yards and a first down, and when the prompt appeared, I selected that he do a little dance. The dance ended with the traditional hand signal for first down–arm extended in a single chopping motion, for those unaware.<br></p><p>However, as Smith fully extended his arm, a defending player walked through the shot and into Smith’s arm. Suddenly, the two players started jawing at one another, Smith’s hand still resting where it touched the defender. It sounds small, and the moment was fleeting, but little encounters like this bring <em>Madden </em>closer to feeling like an actual NFL TV broadcast.<br></p><p>(Also, while I’m talking about celebratory dances: After a fumble recovery for a touchdown, the scorer and another defender did the Fusion Dance from<em> Dragon Ball Z</em> as a celebration. This isn’t a big deal, but it got a big cheer out of me.)<br></p><figure id="" data-id="5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-recommend-id="image://5ac0ee2a1c91e306da5be8d407a04d6f" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nick Sirianni answers a question.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h122922"><a id=""></a>Wait, what did he say?</h3><p>One thing that does pull me out of that “actual TV broadcast” feeling, however, is the broadcasters themselves. Three different teams of commentators are included in this year’s game, including the first-ever female commentator, Kate Scott. For the most part, they do a good job calling the action, even though it’s painfully obvious how the game is pulling audio files to string sentences together. Mike Tirico’s tone at the end of a quarter is particularly weird, as he says “We’re Back! [slight loading] From Philadelphia! [slight loading again] After this!”<br></p><p>Sometimes, though, the game loads up the wrong situation and the commentary ends up being completely wrong. During an exhibition against the Vikings, I managed to sack Sam Darnold for a big loss. Both Mike Tirico and Greg Olsen started talking about how that was my “third consecutive sack,” implying I’d scored sacks on the previous two plays, and how devastating that was for the offense.<br></p><p>The problem is, the sack occurred on 2nd and 2, meaning the previous play was a positive one for the offense and definitely not a sack. When I paused and checked the stats, I found that it was indeed my third sack <em>of the game</em>, but they weren’t on consecutive plays. It’s a small misstep, but one that makes <em>Madden</em> feel less authentic.<br></p><p>Commentary aside, I just spent a good chunk of time praising <em>Madden 25</em>'s gameplay right after saying the franchise needs a break, and that may cause some confusion. However, that’s what makes the lack of depth across the rest of the game so damn frustrating. The <em>core</em> <em>product</em>– simulated football—is great; it’s the rest of the package that’s stuck in a rut. </p><p>Franchise and Superstar modes shine a spotlight on this issue. Franchise lets you run an NFL franchise while managing all of the spinning plates that entails, from building a roster to managing a coaching staff to fighting out my team’s overall strategy and schemes on the field. Superstar, meanwhile, shifts the focus to a single player, where you start as a rookie fresh out of college, drafted to an NFL team, and play through the created player’s career. Both modes, inherently, are a series of menus, as most of the decisions made off the field in both modes are handled via menu screens. The few times they do offer something different, other than playing football, they’re fleeting and don’t offer much of interest.<br></p><p>Take, for example, Franchise mode: As I start my franchise with Nick Sirianni and my Eagles, I’m given the option to take a sideline interview from the practice field. The reporter asks me which part of the team concerns me the most going into the season, and I’m given the option to choose “the offense” or “the defense.”<br></p><p>Now, perhaps I’ve played too many RPGs in my time, but with those dialogue choices presented to me, I’m expecting that whichever I select will be elaborated on in the next bit of dialogue. I might choose “the offense,” but Sirianni might say something like “The offense suffered toward the end of last season, but I’m hoping we can work hard and get back to the success we’re used to” or something like that.<br></p><p>Nope. I select “the offense,” and then big white letters flash “THE OFFENSE” on screen, implying Sirianni replied with just two simple words, no elaboration. For a franchise that strives on creating authentic experiences, that is simply <em>not</em> how many NFL coaches—outside of maybe <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/0GaUO67FYok?si=ZinQFLlQF_i0keG8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Belichick preparing for Cincinnati</a></span>—would answer that question, and I couldn’t help but laugh. Both Franchise and Superstar modes have weird conversations like this, and they feel more awkward than anything.<br></p><p>I understand these things aren’t the core focus of <em>Madden</em>, but for a franchise that promises authenticity, not applying it to these moments makes those claims feel disingenuous. Furthermore, while Franchise and Superstar are lacking in focus, another mode <em>definitely </em>isn’t.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Jason Fanelli</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-recommend-id="image://c75427c6161464c404fa4c16f6fe58c6" data-format="png" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Eagles player avoids a tackle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h122923"><a id=""></a>MUT MUT MUT</h3><p>Madden Ultimate Team is clearly the top dog in the franchise now, and it shows. The first thing you do after turning on the game, after all, is start building your Ultimate Team by opening packs and playing a few tutorial challenges with the players you receive. After that, you’re bombarded with ads for the current MUT season, and MUT deals, and MUT-themed bundles, and these ads are designed to keep you going back into MUT even after you try to exit out of it. </p><p>I am not joking when I say that a full hour passed between my first boot of the game and my ability to play a standard exhibition game of football. In that time, I exited Madden Ultimate Team <em>three times</em>; once after the initial tutorial, and twice more after in-game ads pulled me back in. Then, when I finally got to the main menu, the order of selections started with Madden News, then Ultimate Team, and <em>then</em> Quick Play. MUT sits above the standard gameplay mode now, as if EA’s reverence to its card-based cash cow couldn’t be any more obvious.<br></p><p>Is MUT fun? Sure! Building a team with <strike>loot boxes</strike> randomized packs of players, and then using that team to play football is a good time, and the endorphin hit that comes with opening a top-rated player is cool. However, the way <em>Madden 25</em> is programmed to push players towards MUT, after they’ve already dropped the entry fee called “retail price” to begin with, has an air of “used-car salesman” tactics that I could do without.<br></p><p>I’m not naive enough to think that <em>Madden</em> will ever stop its yearly visits to store shelves. However, it is absolutely time for this franchise to receive a deep, substantial glow-up, especially this year with its new neighbor <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ea-college-football-25-helldivers-2-best-selling-games-1851627890#:~:text=EA%20Sports%20College%20Football%2025,best%2Dselling%20game%20of%202024."><em>College Football 25 </em>completely eating its lunch</a></span>.<br></p><hr><p>The core gameplay of <em>Madden 25</em> is great, but there are some severe problems with everything surrounding what happens on the field. Franchise and Superstar are starving while MUT is treated like a king. Commentary has glimmers of brilliance, but mostly comes off stilted or even incorrect. For every time I pumped my fist to the sky for something I liked, I held my head in my hands for something I hated.</p><p>The aging gunslinger known as the <em>Madden </em>franchise is showing some wear and tear, with <em>Madden NFL 25 </em>being the latest example. While I don’t ever expect it to be put out to pasture, it might be time for the old coach to take a year off to revamp its approach. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s full of relationship-building with complex characters, has stakes that are just high enough to draw me into the weight of each dialogue choice I make, and its supernatural elements don’t feel so overbearing that they detract from the humanity at its center. I’m hooked. I want to learn more about protagonist Pax and her group of nomadic, superpowered roadtrippers. But, my god, I haven’t hit a momentum killer like <em>Dustborn</em>’s action combat in a game I’m otherwise enthralled by in a hot minute.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,197209,196923" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Dustborn </em>follows a group of four smugglers, three of whom are “Anomals,” which are essentially <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><em>X-Men</em> mutants</a></span> dealing with similar types of persecution. Pax can use her words to impose emotions, feelings, or actions on others. Her ex Noam can cancel out emotions entirely, which is good for diffusing a hostile situation or calming someone down from an anxiety attack. Using these powers in secret is one of the core tensions of <em>Dustborn</em>, as it both can expose the group to authorities who would gun them down if they knew they were Anomals, and because using Pax’s abilities can establish toxic, controlling dynamics between the cast. It makes every dialogue option feel weighty as you try to finish your country-wide smuggling job inconspicuously.</p><p>From the outset, <em>Dustborn </em>makes it clear that your relationships with your posse will take you down different ending paths, and I’m already finding myself wincing when I feel like my relationships with characters like Pax’s best friend Sai are on the rocks. Was I too hasty in using my powers to try and immediately fix a tense situation? Did I offer a gift at an insensitive time as I was figuring out how the dialogue mechanics work? We’re criminals with law enforcement at our front door. I thought I was being efficient, but now I see I was also being shortsighted. Hopefully, I’ll have time to make up for those mistakes as the game goes on, but <em>Dustborn </em>is effective at creating intense moments that test your patience and understanding of who you’re working with. There’s lingering baggage with each character from the outset, such as the unresolved relationship between Pax and Naom, or the lack of established trust between the group and their boss, the enigmatic absolute daddy Theo. <em>Dustborn</em> is already laying down multiple paths these relationships might follow, and I’m already drawn in by the possibilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-recommend-id="image://c7ffe3571782966815386aaa4382ea3c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Theo plays guitar with Dustborn's rhythm game UI at the forefront.

The music hasn’t made a huge impression on me yet, but there are more performances to come. The rhythm minigames themselves have been hit or miss, as rules about what the buttons I’m pressing correlate to in the music have sometimes made it difficult to actually get in the groove. Sometimes it feels like the required inputs are in time with the strums of a guitar, other times they correspond to vocals. The rules seem to change between songs, so I wonder what I’m supposed to actually be listening for as I anticipate every button press in-time with the prompts on screen. But while I expect I’ll get the rhythm down soon enough, I’m already dreading the next time I put down the guitar and pick up a bat to play <em>Dustborn</em>’s combat again.<br></p><p>Maybe I was spoiled growing up on character action games like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/devil-may-cry-5-the-kotaku-review-1833077591"><em>Devil May Cry </em>series</a></span>, but I have always felt like my standards for that genre have been pretty high. Even fairly competent action games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier</em></a></span> don’t scratch the itch for me because they lack interesting enemy design that tests my skills and reflexes. <em>Dustborn</em>, meanwhile, makes such a flimsy attempt to emulate those games that its action is becoming an active roadblock to my enjoyment of the game. Pax gets a bat that she swings with imprecision, and it sometimes feels more like a half-hearted, shallow attempt at a beat-em-up than something with any depth. There are a few gimmicks that shake things up, like Pax using her powers to push enemies away or performing a quick rhythm interlude to deal greater damage to a single target. But overall, <em>Dustborn</em>’s attempt to add an action-oriented pillar to its gameplay loop feels ill-advised and overambitious. It’s always better to do fewer things well than it is to try and do too much.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-recommend-id="image://a852c04ebcd4acf69771f87707d1ed08" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pax hits an enemy with a bat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, after the second combat encounter I was given an option to deemphasize combat for the rest of the game’s run. This is ostensibly to make the game easier for those who are just invested in the story, but <em>Dustborn</em>’s bat-swinging beatdowns weren’t even a challenge. They were just a trivial roadblock in the way of the things Red Thread Games does exceptionally well. President Theodore Roosevelt once said that one should “speak softly and carry a big stick,” but <em>Dustborn </em>doesn’t need a big stick to make an impact when the power of its words far outweighs the alternative. I’m hopeful I won’t have to pick up Pax’s bat that often as I continue her road trip, because all it’s done so far is make me want to turn this tour bus around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 180:single/related:817d6bc08344baa42c49b89891b10cd4 --><!-- empty -->
<p>It's been five years now since the PC version of <em>Borderlands 3</em> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/borderlands-3-is-the-next-big-epic-game-store-exclusive/">launched as a high-profile timed exclusive on the Epic Games Store</a>. At the time, Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/gearboxs-pitchford-steam-may-be-a-dying-store-in-5-to-10-years/">memorably mused</a> that Steam "may look like a dying store" in "five or ten years" thanks to increased competition from Epic and others.
</p><p>Fast-forward to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this week's announcement of&nbsp;</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q8WImF649E" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Borderlands 4,</em></a> and despite Pitchford's old comments, the sequel will not follow its predecessor's example of EGS exclusivity.&nbsp;The new game plans to launch on Steam and EGS simultaneously sometime in 2025 (alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions).</p>
<p>When one social media user <a href="https://x.com/ShitpostRock/status/1826109975594414283">noticed that change</a> this week, Pitchford responded with <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458">another lengthy message</a> explaining why his early hopes for the Epic Games Store's rise to dominance were "misplaced or overly optimistic."</p>
<p>In the short team, Pitchford said his high hopes for Epic's effort were initially "validated" by the launches of <em>Borderlands 3</em> and 2022 spin-off <em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em> (which was available on EGS for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-spin-off-tiny-tinas-wonderlands-heading-to-steam-this-week">three months before its Steam release</a>). "<em>Borderlands 3</em> and <em>Wonderlands</em> demonstrated clearly that the customers show up for the games, not the storefront," he said.
</p><figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Q8WImF649E?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure>
<p>But Pitchford now says Epic didn't "successfully press its advantage" to take a significant chunk of Steam's dominant market power. "Famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot," Pitchford said.</p>
<p>"The industry gives Steam their monopoly because publishers are afraid to take the risk to support more developer and publisher friendly stores," he continued. "It’s all very interesting and there is a huge amount of opportunity in the PC gaming space for retail disruption, but no one seems to be able to make it happen."</p>
<h2>A limited success or an Epic failure?</h2>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">Internal documents revealed in the Epic vs. Apple case</a>&nbsp;in 2021 show that both Gearbox and Epic seemed to benefit from the <em>Borderlands 3</em> exclusivity deal. Epic set a guaranteed sales floor of $80 million to help attract <em>Borderlands 3</em> to the platform—if the game sold less on EGS, Epic would pay Gearbox the difference to reach that amount. But Gearbox's game managed to hit that sales floor in just two weeks, bringing in more revenue on its own than the entirety of EGS had for the previous nine months while also attracting plenty of new EGS users.

<p>Not all of Epic's attempts to secure exclusives were so successful, though. In 2019, Epic paid roughly $542 million in minimum guarantees for exclusive titles projected to earn just $336 million over their lifetimes. That $206 million difference that amounts to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/how-long-can-epic-afford-to-throw-money-at-the-epic-games-store/">throwing money at publishers</a> in hopes that their exclusive games would help attract new users to EGS.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>And that continuing effort hasn't been a total failure for Epic; by the end of 2023, the company <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/epic-games-store-2023-year-in-review">said</a> there were 75 million active monthly users for its PC store, up from 68 million the year before. But that's still relatively tiny compared to Steam, which had 132 million active monthly users <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3133946090937137590">back in 2021</a>. While Valve hasn't released monthly user numbers since then, Steam's concurrent user peak has increased about 67 percent (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/">per SteamDB tracking</a>) since the end of 2021—from 21.17 million to 35.55 million. That suggests Steam's current monthly user number could be well over 200 million.</p>
<p>Things look worse for Epic when you compare the $950 million spent by EGS players in 2023 to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/video-game-insights-steam-pc-revenue-consolidation/">the estimated $8.8 billion Steam players spent</a> that same year.</p>
<p>To be fair, pushing a new PC storefront from a standing start to about 10 percent of Steam's massive revenue in about five years is impressive. But that result still has to be disappointing for Epic, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/epic-thinks-egs-could-make-up-35-50-of-the-pc-gaming-market-by-2024/">projected in 2019</a> that EGS could represent 35 to 50 percent of the entire PC games market in 2024.</p>
<p>It's an open question whether Epic's limited success is a result of the company's failure to "press its advantage," as Pitchford opines, or just a sign that Steam's massive entrenched network effects have proven more resilient than he expected. Regardless, <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s Steam launch— following the lead of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/11/ubisoft-comes-crawling-back-to-steam-after-years-on-epic-games-store/">other former EGS exclusive publishers</a>—doesn't mean Pitchford has given up hope that a Steam-killer could still come down the pike.</p>
<p>"I sincerely hope Epic keeps up the fight and makes headway," Pitchford said. "Epic is going to have to prioritize the store and try some new initiatives while also doubling down on earning pivotal exclusives if it is going to have a chance. I also hope other viable competitors arrive. I am sure we will all be watching."</p>

            <p>Those lucky enough to secure a ticket to visit Nintendo's museum are in for a bonus treat: all eligible tickets will include a portrait of their Mii character.</p>
<p>As anyone accepting a museum ticket must have a Nintendo account in order to accept and use it, Nintendo is automagically customising tickets with each account holder's Mii.</p>

<p>"If tickets are assigned, upon entry to the museum, each visitor will receive a play ticket with the Mii character set to their Nintendo Account printed on it," Nintendo <a href="https://museum.nintendo.com/en/guide/visit-flow/index.html">explains</a>, although it does stress that you'll need to set up your ticket in advance on the ticketing website first.</p>
<p>Scores and photos from interactive exhibits inside the museum will then be added to your Nintendo account, too.</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-peek-at-nintendo-museums-huge-controllers-super-scope-shooting-gallery-and-more">Miyamoto recently took us on a 13-minute online tour of the Nintendo museum</a>. It contains many of the products Nintendo has released since its founding in 1889, charting the evolution of Nintendo's approach to entertainment from its earlier non-video game products - including copy machines, baby strollers, RC cars, and pitching machines - into more familiar territory, beginning with 1977's early video game forays, the Color TV-Game 6 and Color TV-Game 15.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Museum opens 2nd October in Kyoto, Japan, and tickets - if you're lucky enough to be able to visit - can be <a href="https://museum-tickets.nintendo.com/en">reserved right now</a>. Expect to pay 3,300 yen (around £17) for adults, with various concessions available for teens, children, and pre-schoolers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Those include a possible launch date of November 19. While <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm those specifics, the Switch port of <em>MySims </em>is real and coming soon, according to a source familiar with the plans. EA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>MySims </em>was a 2007 game for Wii and DS where players marshaled dozens of Mii-like custom characters in an effort to re-develop a town. Blueprints for building stuff are unlocked and a resource called essence is earned and exploited to design cool things. If you want to know what was so special about these games for some people, you can check out the sparse but still passionate MySims subreddit where long-time fans will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MySims/comments/12hh6um/what_do_you_like_the_most_about_mysims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">regale you with tales</a></span> of their favorite quirks, characters, and story beats.</p><p>There were also a bunch of sequel spin-offs with different themes ranging from the medieval <em>MySims: Kingdom</em> to the vehicle-based <em>MySims: Racing</em>. The characters in them offered a bit more of a whimsical approach to the Sims formula then the ever expanding suite of options in the hit <em>Sims 4</em>. Most of the <em>MySims </em>games were made by EA Redwood Shores, the studio best known for <em>Dead Space </em>which was later rebranded Visceral and shut down by EA in 2017. </p><p>It’s unclear if the return of <em>MySims</em> means that’s where EA’s ambitions for <em>The Sims</em> on Switch will end, with many fans still holding out hope that <em>The Sims 4</em> or another version of the mainline series would eventually get ported to Nintendo’s handheld hybrid console. Maybe the publisher is waiting until a Switch 2 is out to announce that, or maybe the <em>MySims</em> revival is the best that Sims fans on Nintendo’s platform are getting right now. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was looking a bit touch-and-go for real-time stealth-tactics fans after developer Mimimi Games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-developer-announces-final-ever-release">shut up shop</a> following last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-gambit-the-cursed-crew-review-old-school-stealth-gets-a-rip-roaring-pirate-upgrade">superb Shadow Tactics</a>. But thankfully it seems there's more than a little life left in the genre, what with the imminent arrival of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sumerian-sixs-pulpy-stealth-tactics-almost-manages-to-fill-that-mimimi-shaped-hole">promising Sumerian Six</a> and now this: a new Goya-inspired stealth-tactics adventure from The Game Kitchen, the studio behind the wonderfully moody <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> series.
</p>
<p>
The Stone of Madness, as it's known, transports players back in time to an 18th-century Spanish Monastery - serving as both a prison and an asylum - located somewhere in the Pyrenees mountains. Here, five prisoners plan their escape through its gloomy corridors, which, of course, is where all the real-time stealthy stuff starts to come in.
</p>
<p>
As the adventure unfolds - well <em>adventures</em>, given it promises two fully fledged campaigns, each with unique stories, objectives, and characters - players will alternately control five distinct characters: Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo. Each has their own unique upgradeable skills, enabling them to - among other things - cast spells, distract and kill enemies, stun evil spirits, and access hard-to-reach areas.

<p>
However, The Stone of Madness also takes a page from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>'s playbook, meaning characters also have traumas and phobias players will need to deal with. If these are triggered during their escape, their sanity depletes, eventually causing paranoia, dementia, violent outbursts, and more - "fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played".
</p>
<p>
There are further wrinkles promised, too, with players also needing to take into account the time of day. Perhaps unexpectedly, sneaking, exploration, and gathering materials are said to be safer in the daylight, when guards are more easily distracted. However, as time passes, the monastery's ghostly inhabitants will begin to reveal themselves, affecting characters' sanity. And when night falls, the curfew coming into effect, security is much tighter. The Game Kitchen says players might prefer to plan and manage their escape after dark, but teases the rewards found after nightfall might be worth the risk...
</p>
<p>
It's intriguing stuff, and The Stone of Madness is currently set to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/the-stone-of-madness-7b22f3">Epic</a> early next year. And if you fancy a bit of tactical action before then (albeit not of the real-time or stealthy kind), might I suggest you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-breach-wizards-review">pop over here</a>?

		<p>It’s been a busy old week in video games, and so the fitting way to spend my Friday afternoon is to tap out a quick catch up on What We Played, which travelling on a very delayed, very diverted train to escape Cologne. Wish me luck in my continuing adventures!</p>
<p>But train travails is now what we’re really here to talk about, and Dom and I had a jam-packed week of previewing games at Gamescom 2024. We’ve played and seen around 40 games between us, both big and small, and we’ll be churning out our features and write ups over the coming fortnight. But what have we enjoyed seeing the most?</p>

<p>For me, the three games that I’d pick out as highlights were <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/rebellion-reveal-atomfall-which-looks-a-bit-like-fallout-goes-british/">Atomfall</a> by those folks at Rebellion, a game which is probably a good bit different to what you think, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">Civilization VII</a>, which is exploring some fascinating ideas for the 4X genre, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/22/rogue-waters-sails-the-turn-based-tactical-roguelite-seas-in-september/">Rogue Waters</a>, which has a really fun take on turn-based tactical gameplay that’s a lot about positioning and cascading abilities.</p>
<p>As for <strong>Dom</strong>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/07/metaphor-refantazio-trailer-showcases-why-you-should-get-excited-for-this-rpg/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was one game that really stood out, and he rather enjoyed how very British is felt, Dying Light: The Beast with the return of Kyle Crane, and then the musical RPG of Fretless.</p>

<p>On to everyone else, and<strong> Nic B</strong> has continued to enjoy his time with MTG Arena, exploring the online-only pre-con decks, and a smidgeon of Monster Hunter Now.</p>
<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> continuing adventures in Fallout: New Vegas have taken him into the Lonesome Road DLC, which has been a nice narrative detour (with a big difficulty spike). He’s also tried out Rise of Ronin using his PS Portal, which wasn’t quite conducive to the split-second reflexes needed. And most significantly, he’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a> for our review, “As a lapsed Overwatch addict, it’s definitely hitting that hero shooter sweet spot, with a vibrant catch of heroes who each tout markedly different playstyles.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been on the review train with an eclectic mix of Truck racing with Monster Jam Showdown, old-school Zelda-ing with Crypt Custodian, and a spot of retro 2D shoot ’em up-ing with Shadow of the Ninja Reborn. <strong>Aran</strong> in the same carriage, playing Gori: Cuddly Carnage for review and Beyond Galaxyland for a preview.</p>
<p>The re-release of the TimeSplitters trilogy on PS5 had <strong>Miguel</strong> diving back into these FPS classics, but he’s still spent most of his time with Ace Combat 5. From there, “a really wild racing game kick” bounced him between&nbsp;Ride Ridge 2, Ridge Racer 6, F1 2023, Split/Second and Midnight Club Los Angeles.</p>

<p>And finally, we come to <strong>Gamoc</strong>. He’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>. The review embargo isn’t up until Monday at 2PM, so keep an eye out for something around about then!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/avowed-developers-confirm-30-fps-was-the-target/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In an interview with members of the Iron Lords Podcast, Matt Hansen, Art Director, and Ryan Warden, Production Director, sat down to talk about Avowed and what players can expect from the game. One of the most surprising things from <a href="https://x.com/GPTGamingNews/status/1826920564700631363" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the interview</a> was that their target during development for Avowed was 30 FPS across the board. Considering Avowed is a first-person action RPG, this number surprises quite a few people. While many are defending their statement, saying that you don't necessarily need 60 FPS for a game like this, some wholeheartedly believe that 60 FPS should be the bare minimum.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive Avowed Interview Ft @MrMattyPlays | Gameplay Q&amp;A | Xbox Consoles 30FPS? | Gamescom 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AxBL4jTHs5w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>At the moment, they haven't explicitly said whether the game will be able to run at 60 FPS or not, but they have expressed that Avowed will hit 30 FPS with plenty of flashy effects in place to make the game more desirable.</p>
<p>Much like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-possible-endings-now-reach-into-double-digits/">another post</a> we wrote about Avowed, there are macro and micro endings for players to achieve. Those excited to get into the game now know that the ending slides have reached double digits. However, how many are macro endings remains to be confirmed, with multiple variations. According to the interview, though, there are well over 50 variations for players to encounter.</p>
<p>In Avowed, players will play as the Envoy from the Aedyrian Empire, where they are then sent on a mission to the Living Lands to investigate the Soul Plague. While this game does take place in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, the two stories are not directly connected. However, playing Pillars of Eternity does offer the opportunity to get some additional context for Avowed.</p>
<p>The interview with the developers dove into some other essential details for Avowed, such as the lack of a traditional class system. Instead, players are given full authority to explore abilities as they wish, mixing and matching abilities from classes to create the hybrid class that works for them. This helps contribute to the many different ways players can play the game, allowing them as much freedom as they want to create their playstyle that suits them for the journey through Avowed.</p>
<p>The full interview is over thirty minutes long, and they break down plenty of important factors of Avowed, such as the delays that the game experienced, the world-building, and trying to make it seem as dense and populated as possible.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the developers of Avowed will see the mixed opinions on the 30 FPS choice for the game or not, but there is the possibility that they will later make a statement about it or begin to tailor the game to run at a higher FPS for those who want a smoother experience.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-sales-top-10-million-just-three-days-after-release.962082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a frankly insane milestone just three days after the game's release, developer and publisher GameScience has announced.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1826985302592049599" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has sold 10 million copies since launch. As a reminder, the game was released on August 20th, which was just three days ago.</p>
<p>GameScience thanks players for their "support and love" for the game, wishing everyone a "great gaming weekend" in the post. The developer also includes some artwork of the player character clutching his healing gourd.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=O4uKjVkD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-sales-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=bioaCDcX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has done some serious numbers.</figcaption></figure><p>Not only has the game reached 10 million sales, but it's also managed to achieve a total of three million concurrent players across both platforms on which it's currently available (PC and PlayStation 5, in case you're wondering).</p>
<p>It's fair to say the rise of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>has been meteoric, to say the least. Since being announced back in 2020, hype for the game has built and built, resulting in&nbsp;<em>Wukong&nbsp;</em>being the most-wishlisted game on Steam prior to its release.</p>
<p>After its launch, the game quickly began to climb the Steam charts, topping the 24-hour concurrent player count list <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-24-hour-player-count">within just a handful of hours</a>. Further success seemed inevitable, and, indeed, so it has proven.</p>
<p>The rapidity of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s rise can, it seems, largely be attributed to Chinese players. As <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/black-myth-wukong-behind-the-numbers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this (paywalled) article from GameDiscoverCo</a> points out, around 88% of the game's player base is based in China, and 94% of&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em>'s Steam reviews are in simplified Chinese.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s developer is Chinese, it perhaps stands to reason that the majority of the game's players would be in the studio's native country. Still, it demonstrates the power of China as a demographic when it comes to gaming.</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, with an Xbox Series X|S version planned for later down the line. You can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business">read my review here</a> if you want to know why I think it deserves its immense success.</p>

<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake launches in October, and many fans have wondered about game length and how long it’ll take to beat the game. Now, thanks to the game’s creative director, we have an answer.</p>



<p>In responding to <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1825636867900838162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">questions on Twitter</a>, creative director Mateusz Lenart says that Silent Hill 2 remake should take between 16-18 hours to beat on the first playthrough. He then added that it could taken even longer than that depending on how you play.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMvrMTmuJuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“If you like to spent your time searching for everything that we put into the game and things we’ve hidden for you, it will take you more than 20 [hours] for sure,” he said. “I’m not counting the new game plus and all endings of course. </p>



<p>“I’m curious how fast will you get all of them.”</p>



<p>As far as the time length goes, a 16- to 18-hour playthrough puts the remake ahead of <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/8523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">what the completionist time</a> is for the original Silent Hill 2 from 2001. And, for the most part, fans seem excited about the extended time to play the game.</p>



<p>“That is some very pleasantly surprising news,” <a href="https://x.com/Micahmakefunny/status/1826753846447894726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user said</a>.</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/LukeCastles1/status/1826699655495000315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another</a>, “That’s a lot longer than the original, I’m very excited for this.”</p>



<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake releases October 8 for PlayStation 5 and PC. The game is a PS5 console exclusive for at least a year, according to reports. After which, it will be able to come to Xbox Series X|S.</p>
