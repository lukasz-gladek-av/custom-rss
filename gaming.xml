The action game is an on-rails shooter in which you take on the role of the titular <em>Killer7</em>, seven assassins working for the U.S. government. All seven killers are different personas of the main character, an old man in a wheelchair, that are physically manifested from his mind. If that sounds weird, well, it isn’t even the beginning.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/get-early-access-to-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-open-beta-with-ee<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Pre-orders are available now.</h2></div><section><p>The next instalment in the long-running Call of Duty series has been revealed — Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The June Xbox Showcase and Black Ops 6 Direct gave us a deeper look into the upcoming title, with new details on the story and gameplay features never before seen in the series.</p><p>One of the most talked about features is Omnimovement, Black Ops 6’s new movement system which allows players to sprint, dive, and slide in any direction and chain together combat moves. Omnimovement will be present in multiplayer, campaign, and zombies, fundamentally changing gameplay across all modes.</p><p>The campaign takes place in the early ’90s, around the time of the Gulf War and the fall of the Soviet Union. It will see the return of some familiar faces with several new characters added to the crew. During the Black Ops 6 Direct, developers voiced how they focused on mixing things up with a wide range of mission types, varying from storming a palace to planning a bank heist. So, fans can expect locations and mission requirements to keep them on their toes.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will release on October 25, but you can experience the game early by playing the Open Beta. The early access to the beta will be taking place August 30⁠–September 4, and you can get involved in one of three ways: 1) By pre-ordering the game, 2) With a qualifying Game Pass subscription, or 3) Through a special offer from EE.</p><p>EE recently announced a partnership with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 that will allow 150,000 fans to access the Open Beta without needing to pre-order or have a Game Pass subscription. It’s available to any EE customer, including new customers who sign up. All you need to do is log in to the EE website or create a new EE ID before August 29, then go to <a href="https://ee.co.uk/gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>https://ee.co.uk/gaming</u></a> to register your details.</p><p>EE also has <a href="https://store.ee.co.uk/gaming/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6?ReferrerID=EE01&amp;utm_source=eecouk&amp;utm_medium=online&amp;utm_campaign=codbo6_eecouk&amp;utm_content=EE01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>pre-orders available now</u></a> for physical versions on both Xbox and PlayStation consoles, and offer the ability to pay in three interest-free payments. If you pre-order a physical version, you’ll get an email with a code that will grant you access to the beta once it’s live.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/02/ee-cod-black-ops-6-post-helen-project-2-07-24-final-1722615368373.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Alternatively, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will automatically have access to the beta, as well as the full release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on day one. They can also pre-install the game, and seeing that it is lining up to be a hefty download requiring a lot of hard drive space, this can help you get into the action as soon as possible.</p><p>If you’re looking to get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, you can get it for £12, cheaper than anywhere else, with the EE app. You don’t have to be an existing customer — all you need to do is download the app and sign up for an EE ID, with no other purchase or contract required. </p><p>The Xbox Showcase also revealed new flavours of digital-only consoles — including 1TB Robot White versions of the Series S and Series X. EE will have both available when they launch this holiday season, and pre-orders will open soon.</p><p>To stay up to date on pre-order info and upcoming releases, you can<a href="https://ee.co.uk/new-at-ee#register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> sign-up to receive updates </u></a>from EE. You can curate your notifications to focus on particular consoles or brands, so you only get info related to things you care about. All it takes is a few moments, and you won’t have to worry about missing any big game launches again.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-team-reveal-2024-roadmap/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's shaping up to be a busy year for Dead by Daylight, as they have plenty of updates to share over the coming months. Behavior Interactive has shared its 2024 roadmap for <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1819387887915331625/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight in a new post on X</a>, covering all updates players can expect to see throughout the year. This roadmap takes players up to November 2024</p>
<p>August is looking to be the busiest month of the year for the dev team. Dead by Daylight will receive ten new updates this month, including quality-of-life updates, perk tweaks, and killer tweaks.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent quality-of-life updates for Dead by Daylight coming in August is the change to scratch marks. For those who have color blindness, the scratch marks were quite difficult to see. As a result, they've made them more vibrant and plentiful so killers can track their targets accordingly.</p>
<p>As seen on their roadmap, The Doctor, The Nemesis, and The Dredge will all receive tweaks that may make them more powerful or dull their abilities to make it easier for survivors. In addition to killers getting tweaked in August, five perks will also receive some tweaks to balance them out.</p>
<p>These perks include Dance With Me, Deception, Diversion, Chemical Trap, and Mirrored Illusion.</p>
<p>According to the Dead by Daylight roadmap, September and October are shaping up to be busy months. Finisher Moris will receive a quality-of-life update, and more of the killers will be balanced out.</p>
<p>Between September and October, players can expect to see killers such as The Skull Merchant, The Unknown, The Hillbilly and The Twins. In addition, perks such as Leverage, Hex: Crowd Control, Distortion, and Blood Rush are all expected to be tweaked.</p>
<p>Finally, in November, major quality-of-life updates will be made to the Pharmacy, Scene Partner, Weave Attunement, and Shadowborn. According to the roadmap, there will be no perk tweaks; instead, The Cenobite and The Plague will be tweaked.</p>
<p>This year, Dead by Daylight has received many major content updates, such as the 2v8 game mode and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/">cross-progression</a>. The game also introduced Lara Croft. Outside of Dead by Daylight, Behavior Interactive has been working on a game set in the Dead by Daylight universe alongside Supermassive Games titled The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>As with any updates, the Dead by Daylight team added, "timelines may change, but we'll keep you updated as we progress." This means that there may be more tweaks to come, or some may be removed from the upcoming roadmap.</p>

<p>After more than 33 years of operations, Game Informer has announced today that it’s shutting down, effectively immediately. If you try to access the Game Informer site, you will be met with a holding page explaining that the brand no longer exists. In a post on social media, the team lamented the closure of the platform, which has been one of the most pivotal sources of gaming news and coverage for more than three decades.</p>



<p>While the Game Informer team didn’t delve into the reasons for the closure, Geoff Keighley explained in <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1819408173133910500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a follow-up post</a> that the label has been shut down because the staff have been laid off by GameStop, GI’s parent company.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-so-many-memories">So Many Memories</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter, the Game Informer team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>After 33 thrilling years of bringing you the latest news, reviews, and insights from the ever-evolving world of gaming, it is with a heavy heart that we announce the closure of Game Informer.</p>



<p>From the early days of pixelated adventures to today’s immersive virtual realms, we’ve been honored to share this incredible journey with you, our loyal readers. While our presses may stop, the passion for gaming that we’ve cultivated together will continue to live on.</p>



<p>Thank you for being a part of our epic quest, and may your own gaming adventures never end.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Informer was one of the top paper-based publications on the market, offering an unforgettable print media circulation that ran from August 1991 to June of this year. When the rise of digital journalism came about, Game Informer was front and centre for the gaming industry, and for more than a decade, the team maintained a site that was, in many ways, a spearhead for the wider business.</p>



<p>GameStop has yet to make a statement confirming why it has so suddenly shut down the Game Informer brand, but we’ve reached out for comment.</p>

Here's where Xur is this week and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week, Xur is offering the Exotic weapon catalysts for <strong>Coldheart </strong>and <strong>The Colony</strong>, and for Exotic armor, Hunters can pick up <strong>Orpheus Rig</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Sunbracers</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344649" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4344649"></a><figcaption>Xur's location inside the Tower's Bazaar</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4344649-xur-tfs.jpg"></figure><p>Spawn in at the Tower and hang a right past Banshee-44.

Using an ability will improve your other abilities, so you'll want to cycle through them as you activate them, making this a good Exotic for Prismatic builds. This is a better roll than last week's version of the Exotic, as you're getting chunky resilience, a really good strength stat, and decent numbers for recovery and discipline.

Increased solar grenade duration is always good, and when the armor perk kicks in, you can get up to four of these grenades out and make the battlefield look like a volcanic eruption. The stats are well-balanced across the board, although mobility could have been lower and the essential discipline stat will need to be buffed. Not a bad roll, and one that you can work with when you're doing some buildcrafting.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Mobility: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Resilience: 12</li><li dir="ltr">Recovery: 11</li><li

For his rotating selection of Exotic weapon catalysts, he'll sell two each week. His selection will contain older catalysts that are found through random drops prior to The Witch Queen expansion, and he will not have catalysts associated with quests, Exotic missions, Season Pass Exotics, campaign Exotics, preorder Exotics, raid Exotics, or dungeon Exotics.</p><p>Xur will also have three random Exotic weapons available for sale, in addition to Hawkmoon. Xur will still sell Legendary armor and weapons, as well as engrams that can yield any item in those pools at random. Like other vendors, Xur also has his own reputation track now and the more you spend, the more reputation rewards you'll earn, including an Exotic Cipher after every rank reset.</p><p>Additionally, Xur's loyalty program kicks in after you spend 47 Strange Coins, granting you a Strange Favor buff. This lasts for 11 days and can be stacked up to three times--once per week--giving you a chance to earn a bonus Strange Coin from activities that reward you with the currency. Xur is present every weekend in Destiny 2, starting with the daily reset at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET each Friday.</p>

            <p>
Activision and Microsoft have reportedly approved the creation of a new "smaller" team within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/blizzard-entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a> - mostly comprised of employees from Activision's mobile-focused King division - to develop new "AA" games based on existing Blizzard properties.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-and-activision-have-formed-a-new-team-within-blizzard-to-work-on-smaller-aa-games-based-on-existing-ip">Windows Central's Jez Corden</a>, whose sources say the new initiative reflects an eagerness at Microsoft to "explore and experiment" with smaller teams within the larger organisation, in response to the "monstrously ballooning costs" of AAA game development.
</p>
<p>
Corden notes Microsoft has seen success with the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> and Grounded, both built by comparatively small teams - and, of course, 2023's Hi-Fi Rush, created by a small team within Tango Gameworks, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-insists-hi-fi-rush-a-break-out-hit-for-xbox-amid-claims-it-underperformed">heralded as a "break out hit" by Microsoft</a> after its release.

<p>
And if you're wondering why Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">closed Tango Gameworks in May</a> if the studio had already demonstrated success using a development approach it was looking to adopt further, Corden claims Microsoft <em>did</em> see Tango as fitting into its new strategy - but its geographical location made "inter-studio collaboration logistically difficult".
</p>
<p>
Back to Blizzard's new team, Corden says it's "geared up for agility, eschewing some of the bureaucratic bloat" of larger teams. But as to what it'll be working on <em>specifically</em>, that remains unclear. The goal, though, is reportedly to create smaller-scale, lower budget titles built around Blizzard's existing franchises - which could potentially mean anything from current hits like Overwatch to long-dormant series such as StarCraft.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/age-of-empires-25-anniversary-console-launch-xbox/">told Wired</a> back in 2022, roughly a year before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's acquisition of Activision was approved</a>, that he was "excited to sit down with the teams at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and King to talk about back catalogue and opportunities we might have there."
</p>
<p>
All of which just leaves the question of <em>platforms</em> Blizzard's reported new studio might be targeting, given it's being populated by King developers who've historically created games for mobile. Corden notes a mobile focus would make sense for the new team, given Microsoft is currently looking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-actively-working-with-partners-on-mobile-store-phil-spencer-says">launch an Xbox gaming store for iOS and Android</a> following new EU laws demanding Google and Apple open their platforms up to competitors. But with Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-bosses-reportedly-pushing-for-no-red-line-around-which-xbox-games-launch-on-playstation">exploring a multi-platform strategy for its releases</a>, anything is possible.
</p>
<p>
Today's report follows the news Microsoft's gaming revenue grew 44 percent in its last quarter, despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-console-sales-decline-continues">declining Xbox console sales</a>, in large part thanks to its $69bn Activision Blizzard acquisition. Without Activision Blizzard on its books, that growth would be just three percent.
</p>

			<p>As revealed by Circana, video game hardware, content, and accessories spending in June 2024 was&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1819366670282248225" target="_blank" rel="noopener">down by 5% compared to June 2023</a> in the United States. Despite this, it still brought in a hefty $4.6 billion. The&nbsp;first half of the fiscal year saw a small 1% increase in spending compared to 2023, which saw the overall income reach $27.3 billion.</p>
<p>In June, <a href="https://wccftech.com/video-game-sales-in-the-uk-dropped-by-30-in-first-half-of-the-year/">content spending</a> dropped by 2%, bringing in a profit of $4.1 billion. Surprisingly, mobile gaming content spending grew by 12%, combined with a 4% increase in non-mobile subscription content spending, such as Xbox Game Pass. Despite the increases in these categories, a 26% drop in console content spending offset it.</p>
<p>Some of the top-selling games for June 2024 include Elden Ring, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Hogwarts Legacy, and, most surprisingly, Kingdom Hearts: Integrum Masterpiece. The surprise comes from the huge change in rank positions. Last month, it was at 399, and now it's soared to the top and sits at number three on the ranking. However, this huge change in sales most likely comes from the fact that the games were all recently available on Steam, which fans of the franchise have been waiting for. Previously, it was only available on the Nintendo Switch via Cloud saves.</p>
<p>Looking at the most played games for PlayStation, many of them are free-to-play games. Roblox, Multiversus, and Fortnite are among the top three. However, games like Elden Ring and Grand Theft Auto V also made their way into the top ten games played in June 2024.</p>
<p>In terms of mobile gaming, Roblox remains one of the top games, with a 15% increase in revenue month over month. This increase was predominantly driven by a UA campaign, which increased downloads by 22%.</p>
<p>June's video game hardware spending fell by a further 37%. During the first half of the year, the Nintendo Switch suffered the most, with a decline of 48%, followed by the PlayStation 5, which declined by 28%, and the Xbox series, which fell by 18%.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy decline for the PlayStation 5, the console was the most sold console out of the three, leading the month's hardware market in unit and dollar sales. Followed by the PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch ranked 2nd in terms of unit sales, with the Xbox Series coming 2nd in dollars.</p>
<p>Overall, June 2024's spending was a little bit rockier than June 2023's, but there still remains an element of positivity for the month. Shadow of the Erdtree helped bolster Elden Ring, and Roblox has gained a huge resurgence in audiences of all ages, which may continue to help the mobile market sales increase.</p>
