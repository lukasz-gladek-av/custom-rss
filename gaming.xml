He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is launching a way for developers to directly integrate the platform’s social features into their games.</p><p>The new Social SDK, announced today, will let developers that use it offer “friends lists, cross-platform messaging, voice and more for all players — with or without a Discord account,” <a href="http://www.discord.com/blog/announcing-discord-social-sdk-to-power-game-comms">according to a press release</a>. You’ll also be able to send invites to your friends while you’re in a game.</p><p>As the company says, you don’t have to have a Discord account to use the in-game Discord features, but “account linking is available for those who wish to connect their in-game experience to their Discord account for an even more engaging experience.”</p><p>Currently, the SDK is “compatible with C++, both Unreal Engine and Unity, and supports Windows 11+ and macOS,” according to Discord. Console and mobile support is “coming soon.” Developers including Theorycraft Games, Facepunch Studios, 1047 Games, Scopely, Mainframe Industries, Elodie Games, and Tencent Games are already using it, Discord says.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, this halo device for Qualcomm’s just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 gaming chips — which I’ll tell you about in a sec — is a <em>single</em> transforming device with swing out gamepads and screens. It’s called the OneXPlayer OneXSugar, and it’s one of the most delightfully gadgety gaming gadgets I’ve seen.</p><p>Hold it horizontally like a Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, flip out its secondary screen, then <em>rotate</em> its twin hinged gamepads for a more squared-off Nintendo DS-like experience:</p><div id=":R6bdber6:"><div><p><figcaption>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</figcaption></p></div><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / OneXPlayer</cite></p></div></div><p>If you listen closely, you can almost hear the emulation community jumping for joy at the idea of two different aspect ratio screens joined at the hip. Me, I’m busy imagining the satisfying and/or horrifying sounds it might make as its triple joints swing into action!</p><p>We know little more than what you can glean from the pictures and animations, but here are the key bits:</p><div><ul><li><span>It’s from the same boutique Chinese gadget maker behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161887/onexplayer-x1-mini-handheld-gaming-pc-ssd">the three-in-one X1 and X1 Mini</a> that I told you about last spring.</span></li><li><span>OneXPlayer plans to put it on preorder this May.</span></li><li><span>It’s an Android device with Qualcomm’s just-announced Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor inside, rather than an AMD-toting Windows gaming handheld.</span></li></ul></div><p>Before you get your hopes up, the OneXPlayer OneXSugar is unlikely to become a Windows gaming machine. For one thing, we’re looking at nice but modest gains of 30 percent more CPU performance and 28 percent more GPU performance <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">than the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a> announced in 2023. It doesn’t contain the Oryon CPU core that powers both Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite for phones or its Snapdragon X Elite for laptops, nor the Adreno X1 or Adreno 830 GPUs that respectively feature in those chips.</p><p>And while Qualcomm Snapdragon gaming lead Micah Knapp told journalists that the company might launch support for other operating systems “over time,” it’s “really focused on the Android side” as of today. That’s because China is such a huge market for Android gaming, the company hints. “The perspective that Android gaming isn’t popular is a very region-centric perspective,” Qualcomm spokesperson Sascha Segan says when I ask.</p><p>That China interest is certainly helping produce some incredible looking devices. When Qualcomm first announced its last handheld gaming chips, the best it could show off <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23840895/qualcomm-g3x-snapdragon-gen-2-g2-g1-gaming-handheld-chips">was a dull batarang-shaped reference design</a>. Today, in addition to the OneXSugar, it’s got the sleek metal-bodied Ayaneo Pocket S2, an Ayaneo Gaming Pad, and additionally two new Retroid Pocket devices on its new lower-tier chips, the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 and G1 Gen 2.</p><p>Here’s that Pocket S2:</p><p>Knapp tells me that his company doesn’t need to subsidize the development of Qualcomm handhelds, either. “To be blunt, most of them are coming to us to build platforms on their own,” he says. “People have accepted this is where things are going to happen, and now they’re just aggressively moving into the space,” he says.</p><p>Of the two lower-tier chips, the G2 Gen 2 claims significant gains of 2.3x the CPU performance and 3.8x the GPU performance of a Snapdragon G2 Gen 1, though I’m not aware of any particular handhelds shipping with that earlier chip, and neither Qualcomm nor Retroid have released images of its next horizontal handheld. The G1 Gen 2 boasts 80 percent greater CPU performance than G1 Gen 1, and a 25 percent faster GPU.</p><p>The Ayaneo Pocket S2 should be coming this month, the Retroid Pocket PR Classic should be up for preorder this month, and the Ayaneo Gaming Pad should be coming this May.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/undertale-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Toby Fox's classic RPG&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>has reached a new Steam player count record almost ten years after its initial release, and it's probably all down to a remarkable Steam sale discount.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/undertale-sets-new-concurrent-player-record-almost-10-years-after-its-initial-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>reached a 24-hour player peak of 11,071 yesterday, which is also the game's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/391540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time record</a>&nbsp;on the platform. Prior to the Steam Spring Sale's commencement,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>was averaging around 1000-1500 players per day.</p>

<p>It's almost certainly no accident that&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is currently on sale at a 90% discount, which means you can pick up one of the most celebrated and influential games of the past decade for one single measly dollar. Trust me, if you haven't played this one already, it's worth it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-books.jpg?itok=5IM3UcsF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-books.jpg?itok=jtVRx5Mf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>has hit a brand new Steam player count peak.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't yet picked up&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam sale, you've still got a few more days to do so, as noted by <a href="https://x.com/tobyfox/status/1901049377134907874" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">creator Toby Fox himself</a>. Even if you don't intend to play it for a while, it's probably going to be a long time before you can get&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>this cheap again.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Undertale</em>, it's a turn-based RPG with bullet hell elements created by solo developer Toby Fox (who also handled the excellent soundtrack).</p>

<p>I don't want to give too much away in case you're not already spoiled, and&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>is a game best experienced without knowing much about it when going in. Suffice it to say that there's more going on here than just a simple SNES-style&nbsp;<em>Earthbound</em>-influenced RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-deltarune.jpg?itok=B4adxtPx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undertale-steam-player-count-record-deltarune.jpg?itok=rSLJNJOs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Toby Fox is currently working on an&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor by the name of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Currently,&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox is hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, the first two chapters of which are available to play for free right now.</p>

<p>Fox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">has said</a>&nbsp;that the third and fourth chapters of the game will definitely be arriving sometime this year, and he's also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">promised</a> that development will be "smoother" following a fairly long gestation period for the game.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Undertale&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/391540/Undertale/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/undertale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/undertale/9pjggx9xjxpb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/undertale-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and, of course, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S through backwards compatibility).</p>

The soundtrack has also received an orchestral upgrade, with legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu overseeing the new arrangements.

I call upon the fans of the RPG and <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> genre to back the Kickstarter to help us make the game.”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>With the launch of the <em>Hopetown</em> Kickstarter, Longdue delves deep into the game’s mechanics, story and setting, as well as introducing players to the mix of industry veterans and upcoming talent working on the game.

A further quantity-limited pledge will allow backers to get a copy of the game, or two copies, at a discounted price.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is set in a mining town decades after a coronal mass ejection wiped out electronics and global communications. Here, they found the quicksilver, a substance that’s changed everything. Since the incident five days ago, people are dead, others are missing and mining operations have screeched to a halt.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Enter you: middle child of one of the richest men on the planet (voiced by Lenval Brown, narrator of <em>Disco Elysium</em>). You’ve drifted through life knowing only luxury and power, shielded by privilege and surrounded by sycophants. You’ve just stepped off an impossibly long train ride, wheeling an overpriced suitcase across the muddy cobblestone and nursing a four-star hangover. Your mission, or punishment, seems simple enough: figure out what happened, cover it up, and spin a better story. You’re a journalist, after all.</p><p>Different schools and methods of journalism will be your RPG classes: Gonzo. Investigative. Gossip. Conspiracy. Words will be your weapons, and you’ll make your own truth. In <em>Hopetown</em>, the <a title="Genres > Action [2,567 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s you take, the friendships you make and destroy, the change you bring — these things don’t just live in your head, trapped in consciousness and fading into memory. They take shape in the physical world around you, real in every sense of the word. Just like the connection between you and your environment, which is enabled by a unique gameplay mechanic dubbed ‘psychogeography’.</p><p>The environment all around you — the town above and the mine below — will change during the game, based on the choices you make. Wasn’t that postbox at the other end of the street? Wasn’t this road uphill two days ago? Wasn’t that gambling hall a pub when you woke up this morning? Things will change under your nose and under your heel. Make surprising new connections between characters, break longstanding friendships, and see what happens.</p><p><em>Hopetown</em> is being created by a team that includes a mix of industry veterans and fresh talent, drawing expertise from the RPG-space, as well as writers with experience in games, theater and screen. Team members include ex-ZA/UM founder Martin Luiga, narrative director Grant Roberts, technical lead Piotr Sobolewski, <em>Disco Elysium</em> narrator Lenval Brown, <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em> developer Ben Babbitt, <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> composer Pawel Blaszczak and art director Astri Lohne.</p><p><strong>Key Points</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kickstarter Live Now</strong> – The first video and key details on the project are available now on the <em>Hopetown</em> Kickstarter page, along with a number of time and quantity-limited pledge types.</li><li><strong>Continuing the Legacy of Legendary <a title="Genres > RPG [17,059 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a></strong> – <em>Hopetown</em> carries forward the thoughtful, narrative-first approach of titles like <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Kentucky Route Zero</em>.</li><li><strong>Psychographic Mechanics</strong> – The game explores the intricate relationship between mind and environment, offering players a story-driven experience where their choices shape both the world and its characters.</li><li><strong>Gonzo, Investigative, Gossip, or Conspiracy?</strong> – Play as a journalist with different schools of journalism being your RPG classes.</li><li><strong>A World That Burns Bright</strong> – You arrive as a spoilt nepo-baby journalist five days after an incident in a Northern English mining town.

said when he directed his first game, 2013's Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, he received feedback that the game was "super bad" in early tests.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wyrdsong">Wyrdsong</a>, the next game from a team of former Bethesda and Obsidian RPG veterans, is struggling on with a "skeleton crew" after further departures from its team and a rescoping of the game. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/talking-to-the-former-fallout-76-lead-about-their-new-studio-and-occult-rpg-wyrdsong">Wyrdsong was announced back in 2022 as the first project from Something Wicked Games</a>, a new studio helmed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> lead Jeff Gardiner and Obsidian veteran Charles Staples. However, progress on Wyrdsong has been hampered by the team struggling to find further financial backing. 
</p>
<p>
After an initial investment from NetEase, funding ran dry 12 months ago <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wyrdsong-developer-something-wicked-reportedly-impacted-by-layoffs">leading to the departure of "most of" the game's team</a>. Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wyrdsong-the-rpg-from-ex-bethesda-talent-isnt-dead-but-its-no-longer-an-open-world-were-down-to-a-skeleton-crew/">PC Gamer</a>, Gardiner has revealed further departures - including that of his co-founder Staples and of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-lead-quest-designer-joins-other-ex-bethesda-developers-at-wyrdsong-studio">former Starfield lead quest designer Will Shen</a>, who quit Bethesda to join the project.
</p>
<p>Wyrdsong has been reshaped as a consequence of these departures, to try and make the game more managable to fund and be finished.</p>
<p>
"We were making a big open-world RPG," Gardiner said. "The way I have learned to do them requires a lot of people to do that, which means a lot of money that was not forthcoming in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Wyrdsong was announced as a historical fantasy game with supernatural elements set in Portugal around the forming of the Knights Templar. It was originally envisioned as being an open-world game, but this has been dropped in favour of a map with zones that are more managable to develop and explore. A roguelite system has also been added, Gardiner revealed, which fitted with the game's story of exploring what happened after death. 
</p>
<p>
For now, Gardiner is pushing on with the project, but admits that its future looks "very tough".
</p>
<p>
"We're down to a skeleton crew, and I am continuing to work hard to try to find further investment or publishing offers for the game. I'm hoping to sometime this year, but we're just trying to hang on to ride out the storm, which a lot of people thought was going to be over in 2025 and I do not see that reality at all currently."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-graphics-options/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds mods, which are now available online, introduce new graphics options and quality-of-life enhancements that can improve performance and the overall experience.</p>
<p>The new graphics options are introduced by the aptly named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/816?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">More Graphics Options mod</a> created by Aiyke. These include mesh level of detail bias, foliage LOD offset/bias, the ability to disable texture streaming and dynamic shadows and to change small object culling ratio. While adjusting any of these options will impact the game's visuals considerably, it can also improve the game's performance, so the mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game with an acceptable level of performance.</p>
<p>While not every Monster Hunter Wilds player will see some benefit from the new graphics options, the vast majority will definitely appreciate the new quality-of-life gameplay improvements introduced by the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/839?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All in One Menu</a> by Reena, which introduced new options in the main menu, such as the ability to access the Smithy, change equipment and transfer items directly from the menu, without having to return to camp. Especially during the endgame, Monster Hunter Wilds wants hunters to be out on the field constantly, so these options are extremely welcome.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launched last month on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. While the experience is marred by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">bad performance</a> on pretty much anything that isn't a top-end machine, the game is still one of the best entries in the series, as I highlighted in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/"> review.</a></p>

As <em>VGC</em> observes, this means it’s the first time the English-language version of the TCG is being treated this way.</p><p>It’s important to note that permanent&nbsp;Pokémon Centers are unique to Japan and Singapore, which itself remains deeply peculiar given the astonishing popularity of all U.S. and UK pop-up venues—to the degree where people have to buy timed tickets, sometimes via lottery, to attend the stores. All U.S. retailers are therefore third-party, and in a more complicated position when it comes to removing packaging. However, it’s certainly doable, given it only happens at the point of purchase.</p><figure id="" data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-recommend-id="image://8420cfdfce5ce2aa2ebfa39b207afb9b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Journey Together logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, there are those who would consider themselves legitimate collectors, wanting to buy sealed products to keep for their personal collections. And yes, for them, it sucks. Hell, I’d been buying one of every Pokémon Center ETB from the online store to keep sealed for a collection, with an eye on how much sealed products sell for once they’re over a decade old. Unsealed, they’d be worthless. But, you know what, even in my position the scalpers have made this pursuit impossible—the last three sets I’ve not been able to buy an ETB at all, as bots have demolished the stock in the opening seconds it goes online.

            <p>Sony Pictures is working on a new Starship Troopers movie with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gran-turismo-film-review-a-marketing-exercise-filled-with-contrived-drama">Gran Turismo filmmaker Neill Blomkamp</a> - and to be clear, this is completely separate from Sony Pictures' <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> film, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-and-helldivers-2-are-getting-film-adaptations">which was announced earlier this year</a>.</p>
<p>The upcoming Starship Troopers film from Sony won't be based on the 1997 film that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> draws a lot of inspiration from. Rather, as reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/">Deadline</a>, this Sony Starship Troopers film will instead go back to the 1959 sci-fi novel as its source material, which was written by Robert A. Heinlein.</p>
<p>"Plot details for the new incarnation [are] under wraps, but I betcha the movie is about astronauts versus bugs," reads Deadline's report. So, that sounds a lot like what I assume the Helldivers 2 film - which, again, is also in the works with Sony Pictures - will be about...</p>

</figure>
<p>Back in January, Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt confirmed the Helldivers 2 developer will be involved with the upcoming film, but in a somewhat limited capacity. The exec said the game's development team "are not Hollywood people", and therefore "don't know what it takes to make a movie".</p>
<p>The studio's CEO Shams Jorjani still has some ideas for the Helldivers 2 film, though. Writing on Discord following the announcement, Jorjani quipped he wants as "many A-list actors as possible" to be part of the film, but there is a condition - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-will-be-involved-in-film-adaptation-but-not-as-much-as-you-may-have-hoped">he wants those actors to "get killed violently immediately"</a>.</p>

		<p>All-consuming audiovisual VR odyssey <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thrasher">Thrasher</a> is getting a flatscreen release later this year, alongside the PC VR port of the game. There’s no release date just yet, but this port will let you play this successor to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/thumper">Thumper</a> across PC headsets, gaming PCs and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRASHER 2D Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Kc-UKVdHG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally releasing last year for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro, the game skipped out on PC or consoles to start with. We can only hope that there are plans for a PS5 and PSVR 2 release in this game’s future as well.</p>
<p>Coming from Brian Gibon, the artist and composer of Thumper, and Mike Mandel or Rock Band VR at their new studio Puddle, Thrasher looks to explore the rhythm action genre in a similarly dark and moody style. In this game you guide a space eel that is swooping through alien worlds in a race for survival, with players digging into a combo system that ties in with a chase to the top of leaderboards.</p>
<p>This was designed with VR in mind, fully immersing you into the game’s world, but it’s now being reworked to keep as much of that atmosphere when playing on a traditional flat screen platform. The visuals are being enhanced to take advantage of the power of modern gaming PCs when compared to standalone VR headsets. You’ll probably want to have a great pair of headphones plugged in, though.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/18/thumper-psvr2-review/">Returning to the 2016 classic Thumper in 2023</a>, Dom said, “Thumper remains a true VR classic, and its upgrade for PSVR2 makes it the best place to experience its violent audio charms.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 patent that was updated a few days ago provides additional details on AI-powered upscaling, strongly indicating that the system will indeed support the technology in some capacity.</p>
<p>As spotted by Mike Odyssey, the patent was updated last week on March 13th with some additional details on how AI-upscaling works, taking a 520p resolution image and upscaling it to a 1080p resolution output using a neural network. The 520p and 1080p resolutions mentioned in the patent may also indicate how the tech will be used in handheld mode, confirming the console's screen resolution, but there's nothing in the updated patent that suggests a specific use case.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Nintendo just released an update for Nintendo Switch 2 on AI resolution Upscaling. It's happening, folks! <a href="https://t.co/6GZUEXeBli">pic.twitter.com/6GZUEXeBli</a></p>
<p>— Mike Odyssey - Nintendo Switch 2 Experience Dallas (@MikeOdysseyYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1901107300581937596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Considering how the Nintendo Switch 2 is powered by NVIDIA technology, how DLSS itself was mentioned in a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaked-soc-5nm/"> previous patent,</a> and how Nintendo has already used AMD FSR in some of its original Switch games, there's little doubt that the console will support AI-upscaling in some form, although we will probably only get confirmation during the April 2nd Nintendo Direct. According to Kiwi Talks host Reece Reilly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-720p-resolution/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will be the star of the show, as its true, proper unveiling will blow everything else in the Direct out of the water.</p>

<p lang="en">In less than a month in the Switch 2 direct you'll see that Nintendo &amp; Retro were keeping their cards close to their chest with Metroid Prime 4 for this exact moment. The true unveiling will blow everything else in the direct out of the water.</p>

<p>The April 2nd Direct will likely confirm the Nintendo Switch 2 release date, which, according to analysts and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">former Nintendo employees</a>, will be in early summer. The fact that<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/"> around 400,000 units were reportedly shipped to North America in January</a> suggests that the console's release is indeed not too far off.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, and in this article,&nbsp;<span>we'll have a detailed look at what's inside it and see what&nbsp;<em>Warmachine</em> is all about</span>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=VCR0jFXm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-2.jpg?itok=v1xFUkmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, so I won't go into too much detail here, but there are 2 standout mechanics for me. The first is the focus mechanic, a currency that Warcasters generate each turn. Warjacks also generate a small amount of focus, but the onus is on the Warcaster to transfer over some of their focus to the Warjack, or keep it to power their own magic and special abilities, or to boost or gain additional attacks. This adds a lot of flexibility in your turn and opens up options for how you use your Warcaster and Warjacks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=Iw_fOlOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-8.jpg?itok=_R0xt6eS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In <em>Warmachine</em>, when a Warjack is damaged, a dice is rolled to see which column takes the damage.</figcaption></figure><p>The second standout mechanic for me is the Warjack damage system. Rather than a simple damage stat that you subtract from as Warjacks take damage, instead there's a damage table that is rolled against. The number rolled indicates the column that takes damage, and once that column fills up, further damage is allocated to the next column. Letters are also spread across the bottom of each damage column, and once all of one type of letter has been damaged, it affects the efficiency of the Warjack. For example, once all the M letters (for Movement) have taken damage, the Warjack is automatically hit by melee attacks and has its defense reduced. This damage system on the Warjacks works very well as they can soak a lot of initial damage, but then systems will start to shut down as you damage them further. It gives a really thematic feel to the system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warmachine</em> rules are scenario-focused, which means that you're going to be focusing a lot of getting things done and stopping your opponent from doing them, but always looming over you is that if your Warcaster is taken out, you lose immediately. And no matter what you're doing during the game, you need to be aware of how exposed your Warcaster is, whilst slyly checking if your opponent has left theirs vulnerable. In the games I've played so far, this usually led to some insane assassination attempts that were epic if they paid off and almost always cost you the game if they didn't,&nbsp; but they were always fun and cinematic.</p>

<p>Part of Steamforged Games' plan with taking over <em>Warmachine</em>, was the release of a new 2-player starter set. This new set sees the Cygnar Storm Legion clashing against the Khador Winter Korps, and we'll go into more detail of each force below. The main thing to note with this set is that it only contains the miniatures for the 2 forces and some terrain pieces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The lack of rules, accessories and stat cards in the box does make it feel less like a new player starter set, but an intro sheet in the pack points players towards the build instructions, a <em>Warmachine</em> Quick-Start guide (which is very good and takes you through everything, including the first few turns of the game) and the app itself. The app is well designed, clear, and works well, and this process does mean that new players are starting the game with the tools that they will continue to use in <em>Warmachine</em>, rather than having to make the jump to the app after their first few games.</p>

<p>The forces that are included are well-designed for a new starter set, giving both players one of each unit type (Warcaster, Warjack, Solo, and Unit). They are also both exactly 30-point forces, the smallest game of <em>Warmachine</em> you can play, and there's no variation in armaments in the builds, which means that new players can safely construct without having to worry about optimal builds before they learn the rules.</p>

<p>The included units are also Cadre units, which means that they can be used across all forces in the faction. We'll talk in detail about this when we cover the Gravediggers in an upcoming article, but all you need to know here are that the Gravediggers are a sub-faction of the Cygnar force and can also use all the&nbsp;Cygnar units in this box. This is great, as it means that as long as players choose one of the factions in the box to continue with, they'll always be able to use those units.</p>

<p>I really like the fact that the starter set is just miniatures, and isn't locking starter set components into a specific box. If players don't like the look of either of these factions, they can just pick up a different Command Starter Set and access the rules the same way. I think the inclusion of some dice, tokens, and a measuring tool would have made it a truly new player starter set, and even the other starter sets could include some thematic accessories that veteran players would love too. The digital rules mean that players are going straight into the current version, with printed rules being out of date after a rules update and the balance and player experience can be controlled by SFG, who can tweak the starter set units live.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=Whw-9Biv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-4_2.jpg?itok=uy4JPl-i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Into The Storm</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;Cygnar Storm Legion troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are a group known as the&nbsp;Hellslinger Cadre. The Hellsligners are led by the Warcaster,&nbsp;Major Allister Caine. Caine dual-wields Spellstorm pistols, which have 3 attack types to choose from when shooting. He boosts nearby gun mages, giving them headshot, and has access to teleport to get him out of trouble once he's laid down some fire. Caine is backed up by his Warjack, Deuce, who's armed with a powerful Spellstorm Cannon and has truesight, which lets them fire through cloud effects (which is handy for targeting the opponents of this starter set).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=fWXPKq_G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-5_0.jpg?itok=Tbd9vAqh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Hellslingers' solo is&nbsp;Captain Bastian Falk, a ranged expert who can deploy further ahead than the rest of the force. Falk can also immediately return fire with his&nbsp;Magelock Scattergun if he is missed by an enemy ranged attack. He also passes that ability on to nearby gun mages, so keeping all of your units together lets them overlap buffs. The Black 13th is a 3-model unit of just those gun mages. Each is armed with a magic ranged weapon, each with 3 unique fire options to deal with most situations. They can also forward deploy with Falk and gain the benefits of both Falk and Caine's buffs to gun mages.</p>

<p>As you might have guessed, the Hellslinger Cadre likes to stand and shoot and I love the Wild West feel to the miniatures. I'm definitely going to make a hat for Deuce to match the rest of the Hellslingers.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=SY5GNKK8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-6.jpg?itok=bfZrCJdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Winter Is Coming</h2>

<p>The Khador Winter Korps troops in the <em>Warmachine</em> 2-Player Starter Set are known as the&nbsp;SKS-6 Cadre. And they are led by&nbsp;Kapitan Zahara Vilkul. Vilkul has a once-per-game feat that puts between 4 and 6 cloud templates on the battlefield to obscure the advance of her force (the Hellslingers Warjack, Deuce can unhelpfully still target through these clouds). More importantly, Vilkul has an incredible threat range using her Cyclone spell that lets her make a full move and attack, which can be used after a charge to let her attack an enemy up to 18 inches away. Vilkul is accompanied by her Warjack Razor, who comes armed with short-ranged weapons and excels in close combat where its ripper shield adds to Razor's durability and also gives it a powerful melee attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=q9JkQiwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-7_0.jpg?itok=wXaP_JZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sergeant Goran Lazarenko, the Jackal, is the SKS-6 solo, and his miniature features a rocket leaving the launcher tube in an epicly animated sculpt. He gets to pick the column the damage goes into when a Warjack takes damage, so he can target specific columns with letters that will disrupt his target the most. The Hounds are the SKS-6 unit, and each of its 3 members comes armed with different ranged weapons to meet any situation. Where they have commonality is that they each carry a blast shield, which they can use in combat. They're already pretty durable, but their Sheild Wall ability means that whenever the models from this unit are in base-to-base contact with each other, they get an additional +2 armor on top of their already substantial armor.</p>

<p>The SKS-6 Cadre likes to get in much closer than the Hellslingers, which means running the gauntlet of ranged attacks to close the distance. Vilkul's smoke enables this, but Deuce being able to see through it is unhelpful. If Vilkul can activate within 18 inches of Caine, the Hellslingers Warcaster, then it's usually game over, but it can be tricky getting there if the Hellslingers want to play at range.</p>

<h2>Warmachine 2-Player Starter Set Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I love both factions in this set, and while it can feel a little one-sided for the Hellslingers (who can shoot from the start and force the SKS-6 to close with them), if the SKS-6 can get close enough, they can really hammer the Hellslingers. I would have liked to have seen some themed accessories in the box, or even just the option of a Starter Set accessories pack add-on, which will still keep the cost down of the box, avoid duplication to those who have dice and tape measures, but still make it super accessible for new players. The quick-start guide (which is very good) that's linked to from the box could even be printed and thrown in with that accessory set. The digital rules work and make sure anyone picking up the box is getting the most up-to-date rules and stats, allowing SFG to tailor the starter experience if they do find that one side (the Hellsligners) has a much easier time.</p>

<p>The forces are well-designed and give a good experience for what those 2 factions are all about, along with being 30-point armies with one of each unit type, and available to all forces within that faction. There can be a lot of rules for new players to grasp for the 2 included forces, especially with the area of effect and overlapping buffs, but the quick-start going through the first few turns does help. Overall, I'm pleased to get back into <em>Warmachine</em> with this box, which I haven't played since 2019. This starter set feels fresh, and the miniatures look fantastic.</p>

            <p>People Can Fly - the developer of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/outriders">Outriders</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bulletstorm">Bulletstorm</a> - has signed a deal with PlayStation to work on a new project based on an existing Sony series.</p>
<p>Further details remain slim for now, though it has been confirmed the upcoming release is codenamed Project Delta, and that it is based on a franchise to which Sony holds the intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>Word of this upcoming Sony collaboration comes from <a href="https://peoplecanfly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250313-current-report-no-4-2025-conclusion-of-pda-with-sony-delta.pdf">a report published by People Can Fly</a> itself. Here, the studio stated it had entered into a work-for-hire agreement with the PlayStation maker.</p>
<p>So, what could it be? Well, call me optimistic, but I am thinking of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killzone">Killzone</a>. Sure, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/killzone-developer-done-with-series-guerrilla-says-of-switch-to-horizon">developer Guerrilla made it sound like it was done with Killzone</a>, instead now favouring its Horizon series, but that doesn't mean Sony is… right?</p> <div>

			<p>Resident Evil 9 is taking a long time to release because it will be a reinvention of the series, according to a well-known insider.</p>
<p>Speaking on <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a>, well-known Resident Evil series insider Dusk Golem talked about the ninth main entry in the survival horror series by CAPCOM, saying that fans will realize why the new game is taking this long to release when it is revealed, as it is a big reinvention of the series as much as the fourth and seventh entries in the series were back in the day that will be very ambitious and will try new things that will make it play anything like its direct predecessors or the remakes. Dusk Golem also seems certain it will be revealed this year, so hopefully, it will be part of the usual slew of summer reveals in a few months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">(2/2) is taking so long is because it's like a big reinvention of the series, to the same level as RE4 &amp; RE7. It's not going to play just like RE7/RE8 or the Remakes, it's trying new things &amp; very ambitious. It will almost definitely be revealed this year, so just hold tight.</p>
<p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1901499831455186984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very little is currently known about Resident Evil 9 other than the fact that it has been in development for a while. <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-stalker-enemies/">Early rumors</a> suggested that Leon and Jill would play a big role in the game, but according to Dusk Golem, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-wont-feature-jill/">these rumors are not correct</a>. In development together with the next main entry in the series is also a Resident Evil Zero remake, which will be the next series remake to release.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 9 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
The latest <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> game did not perform well for publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, it's been claimed.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which launched last autumn to a mixed response from fans, resulted in "large losses" for the company, <a href="https://kabutan.jp/news/marketnews/?b=n202503130535">Kabutan analyst Hideki Yasuda stated</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ffxvi-has-apparently-sold-3-5-million-copies-could-be-old-numbers-read-op.1133091/">ResetEra</a>/<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-sales-financial-report-large-loss-square-enix-sequel-unlikely/">TheGamer</a>).
</p>
<p>
Officially, Square Enix is yet to comment on Double Exposure's performance - and there's been no word on Double Exposure's sales figures pubicly at all. Deck Nine, the game's developer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">previously announced layoffs at the studio in the wake of the game's launch</a>, and it's unclear what's next for the franchise - despite Double Exposure ending with a message stating that protagonist Max Caulfield would "return".

<p>
Last week, Square Enix issued its most <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3earnings.pdf">recent financial results</a> - which largely focus on the sales of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake and the successful launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> expansion Dawntrail. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps tellingly, there's no notice of how Life is Strange: Double Exposure sold. Instead, Square Enix simply says that its HD gaming division's revenues had fallen due to the fact that unnamed "new titles generated lower sales"  than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>, Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster and Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince did over the same period during the previous year.
</p>
<p>
Square Enix doesn't state what the new titles that underperformed were, but does say that the launch of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D helped offset these losses, as it had performed better than initially expected.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Yasuda and Square Enix for more detail. The company is yet to release a transcript of the financial briefing that includes shareholder questions.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">Life is Strange: Double Exposure launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a> upset at how the game handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max Caulfield, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of Life is Strange 1. 
</p>
<p>
The situation turned uglier when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-fans-upset-after-square-enix-removes-reddit-posts-featuring-leaked-content-anonymous-developer-comments">Square Enix removed leaked development material from a popular Life is Strange fan reddit</a>, including posts by several anonymous commenters who provided proof they worked at Deck Nine, and who made a number of claims regarding how Double Exposure's story had changed through development, shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself. In response, Square Enix said it had acted to remove the content based on "appropriate legal requirements" for "intellectual property violations".
</p>
<p>
"Like its own hero's dabbling with time travel, Life is Strange: Double Exposure highlights the troubles of trying to revisit old memories, while raising unanswered questions about the future," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> is a six player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> extraction spooper that currently sits atop Steam's best seller charts, having amassed around 70k players the week following early access launch on Feb 26, and another 160k since then. That's around 230 thousand players avoiding knifey chef frogs and persistent ducklings while extracting valuables to fill a cash quota. It's a bit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> but even heavier on the absurdity.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this popularity comes down to two things. Firstly, the game is a verdant flub factory, stuffed with the sort of chaotic physics mishaps that translate very well to short video clips. Even the loot extraction point can kill you if lingered in too long. Secondly, the 'Jim Henson does <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> Automata' robots you play as flap their mouths in time to your mic chatter, making even the most bowel-curdling fear shrieks from your teammates look like a hammy comedy routine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I'd usually emit a croaking complaint about being too old for anything viral - the acrid dust cloud from my throat lingering in the air momentarily before cascading downwards and coating me in a grimy sheen of irrelevancy - but R.E.P.O. actually looks great. As it stands, though, you need five willing friends to play: a truly biblical quantity of mates, in the sense that it'd be faster to carve co-op partners from my own ribs than hash out that sort of byzantine scheduling.</p>
<p>Good news re: my organs staying shielded - developer Semiwork are planning on introducing public or private matchmaking. This'll come with a kick button to keep players honest, although they do say it's not quite that simple, since server coding is new ground for them. Here's the update video.</p>

<p>Joining ironmates mode is a new museum level, which they show off by demonstrating some award-winning box parkour. There's also some quality of life bits, like a border at extraction points to show when loot is out of bounds so you don't accidentally let it get crushed. Semiwork also show off a squinty, angry facial expression. Finally, there's a bucket you can pop over the duckling monster that likes to imprint motherhood on one of your crew then follow you around getting in your way and biting anyone that tries to touch it.</p>
<p>My current idea o' the day is Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin's concept of the 'chronotope' - time and space configurations as a kind of contextual bubble -  as mentioned by valued RPS community member #9976 in the comments to Sunday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-80-days-heavens-vault-and-a-highland-songs-jon-ingold?view=comme">Booked For The Week</a>. A fifteen minute internet rabbit hole with coffee this morning led me to <a href="https://youtu.be/r4yluKPhTKE">this video</a> by the eminently listenable Belgian sociolinguist Jan Blommaert, who gives the example of a lecture: the space is the hall, the time is the lecture slot, and this particular chronotope encourages or necessities certain identities, roles, or modes of behaviour within in. An insightful framing of the twin navigations of interpersonal relationships and horror-harried spaces in social extraction games? You, uh, you might be starting to see why I'm enthusiastic about R.E.P.O.'s no-mates mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Heinlein. <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/starship-troopers-neill-blomkamp-1236327071/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/starship-troopers-remake-set-neill-blomkamp-1236338005/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> backed up the report.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new Starship Troopers movie is not a continuation of or related to Paul Verhoeven’s cult classic 1997 sci-fi satire <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/starship-troopers">Starship Troopers</a>. Rather it is a new adaptation of Heinlein’s novel, and comes from Sony’s Columbia Pictures.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/16/starship-troopers-1742154834885.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers satirized the novel upon which it is based.

Arrowhead's Helldivers is heavily inspired by Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and sees cannon fodder soldiers tasked with defending a satirized fascist Super Earth regime from alien bugs, among other enemy factions, while preaching Liberty and Managed Democracy to the masses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony now faces the prospect of having new Starship Troopers and Helldivers movies going up against each other, although The Hollywood Reporter said Blomkamp’s take is not a remake of the Verhoeven movie, rather a return to the source material. Heinlein’s book that Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers is based on differs strongly in tone from the film, with many believing it promotes the ideals the film satirizes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither this new Starship Troopers nor the Helldivers movie has a release window, so it may be some time before we see or hear from either project. Blomkamp’s last film was Sony’s own Gran Turismo, an adaptation of the long-running PlayStation-exclusive driving simulation series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by TriStar Pictures/Sunset Boulevard/Corbis via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-actor-ashly-burch-says-sonys-ai-aloy-video-left-her-feeling-worried-about-game-performance-as-an-art-form<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon actor Ashly Burch has addressed the AI Aloy video that leaked online last week, using it to call attention to the demands of striking voice actors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626695/sony-playstation-ai-characters-aloy-horizon-forbidden-west-prototype" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Verge</u></a> reported on the emergence of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-internal-sony-video-uses-horizons-aloy-to-show-ai-powered-playstation-character-prototype">an internal Sony video showing off tech that uses Aloy from the Horizon series to demonstrate AI-powered characters</a>. Sony has yet to respond to IGN’s request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the now deleted video, Sony Interactive Entertainment director of software engineering, Sharwin Raghoebardajal, has a conversation with an AI-powered Aloy via voice prompts and AI-generated speech and facial animations. Raghoebardajal asks Aloy how she's doing, to which she responds: "Hello, I'm managing alright. Just dealing with a sore throat. How have you been?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The voice heard coming from Aloy's mouth is clearly not that of Burch, rather a robotic voice similar to those heard from text-to-speech voice generators. AI Aloy's facial movements are stiff and her eyes appear lifeless as she converses with Raghoebardajal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch, who has voiced Aloy in all four Horizon video games released so far (Zero Dawn, Forbidden West, Call of the Mountain, and Lego Horizon Adventures) took to social media platform TikTok to confirm that she had seen the video, and that Horizon developer Guerrilla had got in touch to let her know that the tech demo did not reflect anything that was in active development, nor did it use any of Burch’s performance (facial or voice data). That presumably rules out AI Aloy for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">the upcoming Horizon multiplayer game, assuming the character is in the game, and the inevitable Horizon 3</a>. However, as Burch pointed out, Guerrilla (and parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment) owns Aloy as a character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With all this in mind, Burch said the AI Aloy video left her feeling “worried about game performance as an art form,” and used it as a jumping off point to discuss the ongoing video game voice actors strike that has claimed a number of high-profile casualties in recent weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) issued an update to its members on the status of negotiations over video game actor AI protections, saying that while progress had been made, it was still "frustratingly far apart" with the industry bargaining group on key issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Currently what we’re fighting for is, you have to get our consent before you make an AI version of us in any form, you have to compensate us fairly, and you have to tell us how you’re using this AI double,” Burch said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I feel worried not because the technology exists. Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections, any way to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m genuinely not trying to put any game company specifically on blast,” Burch continued. “Certainly not Guerrilla. The technology isn’t the problem. Game companies wanting to use the technology isn’t the problem. The problem is we’re currently on strike and the bargaining group will not agree to give us common sense protections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I support the strike. I’ve always supported the strike. I believe fighting is what we have to do to protect the future and the longevity of this career that we all love so much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Burch then pointed to the temporary union contracts that currently give all the protections the striking voice actors are asking for, that any video game company can sign right now. “There’s the interim, the tiered, and low budget agreement contracts available right now for any game company to sign,” Burch said. “I believe we deserve to be protected.”</p><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734" data-video-id="7481742753991314734"> <section> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="@ashly.burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ashly.burch</a> <p data-cy="paragraph">let us speak on AI aloy</p> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7481742843657194286?refer=embed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Ashly Burch" rel="noopener noreferrer">♬ original sound - Ashly Burch</a> </section> </blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. It has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that hasn’t put off a number of video game companies from using generative AI in the development of their products. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen"><u>Activision recently disclosed the use of generative AI for some Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 assets</u></a> as part of new requirements on Steam, amid a backlash to an "AI slop" zombie Santa loading screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the voice actor strike has begun to impact a number of video games. Players have reported that games such as Destiny 2 and World of Warcraft appear to have certain NPCs left unvoiced in otherwise voiced scenes, likely due to the strike. Late last year, SAG-AFTRA struck League of Legends after Riot <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sag-aftra-strikes-league-of-legends-over-alleged-flagrant-violation-of-labor-law"><u>allegedly tried to subvert the strike by canceling a game in response</u></a>. And Activision confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 characters were recast</u></a> after players expressed concern about new voices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-voice-actors-say-they-found-out-they-were-replaced-when-the-patch-notes-went-live"><u>two Zenless Zone Zero voice actors revealed</u></a> they learned they'd been replaced when they saw the game's latest patch notes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios Asad Qizilbash recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-exec-says-ai-is-important-to-gen-z-and-gen-alpha-gamers-who-want-personalization-across-everything"><u>weighed in on AI to say its use in video games is important to Gen Z and Gen Alpha gamers</u></a> who seek "personalization across everything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For instance, non-player characters in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal,” Qizilbash said. “This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalization across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom.1136436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-reportedly-compared-to-elden-ring-for-its-player-freedom/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet may be very different from what we're used to in Naughty Dog games. The studio's trademark has usually been cinematic, narrative-driven games, at least since Uncharted and, of course, The Last of Us.</p>
<p>However, MinnMax's Ben Hanson teased that he had heard from his sources that the studio's next project was being compared to something else. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhdtygZnYqI&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">October 2024 podcast</a>, he said:</p>
<p><em>I heard from somebody very in the know who worked on the game that they're like Jesus Christ... the tone was like you are all not ready for how amazing this is going to be... and the tone was (I'm not going to say the game that they referenced to compare it)... but they compared to a game with a lot of player freedom.</em></p>
<p>Back then, the game hadn't been unveiled yet. That happened a couple of months later at The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a gorgeous debut trailer</a>. Now that the dust has settled, in the latest episode of The MinnMax Show, Ben Hanson has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rcMrvLXPNY&amp;t=7232s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> exactly which game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet was being likened to:</p>
<p><em>I think it's fine to say it now: that game was Elden Ring that it was compared to back then. If I would have said 'Naughty Dog's next game is like Elden Ring' and then that reveal trailer came out, I feel like we would have been lit on fire. But now that idea of, okay, it's taking place on one planet, kind of uncovering the history of this world, you can kind of see a little more where they might be going with that.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Neil Druckmann has since provided a bit more context. Before the reveal, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-druckmann-new-project-is-the-most-thrilling-yet-may-redefine-mainstreams-perception-of-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> that the new game was fresh to the studio, and he was curious about the players' reactions. This certainly fits such a big change in the degree of player freedom compared to Naughty Dog's most recent games.</p>
<p>Druckmann <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> as recently as last week that Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would be a lonely game for players, unlike Uncharted and The Last of Us, where the main characters were almost always accompanied by allies. This is another hint that MinnMax's report is correct.</p>
<p>Of course, many questions remain. Is this a full-fledged action RPG, then? Can players explore the world of Sempiria in whichever order they see fit? Naughty Dog will undoubtedly respond in due time, although the game creator himself has also warned the project is still some ways off, so we might have to wait a while before learning all those details.</p>
