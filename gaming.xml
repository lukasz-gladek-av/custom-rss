		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/Koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/team-ninja">Team Ninja</a> have released <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rise-of-the-ronin">Rise of the Ronin</a> update 1.06. Ready to download on PS5, this latest patch includes a small number of changes and improvements for the 2024 open-world samurai simulator.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin - The Aftermath Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/34FMSgdzzvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Released back in March, Rise of the Ronin follows a string of celebrated action RPGs developed by Team Ninja, the studio that brought us both the modern <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> series as well as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-or-alive">Dead or Alive</a>. More recently, they’ve given genre fans a more fast-paced and frenetic alternative to Fromsoftware’s Soulsborne saga with hits such as the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh">Nioh</a> series and 2023’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/21/rise-of-the-ronin-review/">Rise of the Ronin review,</a> Aran adored the diverse combat and interweaving character plots, calling the game “a massive gamble for Team Ninja, known for its more linear action games, but it’s one that has paid off. Rise of the Ronin has a lot of depth to it from the satisfying combat, to all the side activities across three broad regions, and the plethora of excellent characters. This game should mark the start of a grand new era for Team Ninja.”</p>
<p>Building on that success, the game has received a number of post-launch updates. For the newest wave of changes you can review the Rise of the Ronin update 1.06 patch notes below.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-revealed-alongside-warbond-shakeup.891141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead Game Studios have announced the newest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, as well as a shakeup to the way Warbonds will work in the future.</p>

<p>The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th, and just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-polar-patriots-warbond">previous</a><i>&nbsp;Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-premium-warbond-democratic-detonation">Warbonds</a>, it's bringing new gear for you to unlock, with new weapons, armor, and utility items for your Helldiver to utilize in the field.</p>

<p>First up, the Warbond offers two new weapons for you to try out. The AR-23A Liberator Carbine is a variant of the Liberator rifle with higher recoil and faster handling, while the SG-22 Bushwhacker is a triple-barrel secondary shotgun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=Pj2_5_8n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-bushwhacker.jpg?itok=-LF2XPd- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond comes with a secondary shotgun.</figcaption></figure><p>Two new sets of armor are also included in the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Viper Commandos Warbond, both of which have the melee damage-improving Peak Physique passive ability.</p>

<p>The PH-9 Predator set is inspired by a legendary Viper Commando who, according to Arrowhead's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>lore, "was said to have held off an entire Terminid brood with nothing but a machine gun, pocket knife, and Orbital Laser". It even comes with a beret!</p>

<p>If that's not your style, the PH-202 Twigsnapper is a heavy armor set that pairs well with the Executioner's Canopy cape, so make sure to factor that into your&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>fashion-crafting.</p>

<p>A new booster, Experimental Infusion, will give you increased movement speed and reduced damage when you take stims, and you'll even find some new skins for your Hellpods and Exosuits, as well as a throwing knife for the perfect jungle commando feel.</p>




<p>Arrowhead says that it's "changing [its] approach to Warbonds" in the future and basing those changes on player feedback.</p>

<p>Firstly, Warbonds won't be released as regularly in order to give the team "more time to polish these designs" and avoid releasing anything "before it's fully baked".</p>

<p>Warbond item arrangements will also be changed so as to "make room for new item types", including higher-quality weapons and armor. Viper Commandos is the first Warbond that espouses these new priorities; it emphasizes "quality over quantity", according to Arrowhead.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on PC and PlayStation 5. The Viper Commandos Warbond launches on June 13th.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/geforce-now-library-gets-street-fighter-6-and-xdefiant.891138/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-library-gets-street-fighter-6-and-xdefiant/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has announced that CAPCOM's Street Fighter 6 has joined the GeForce NOW library (as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-elder-scrolls-online-street-fighter-6-resident-evil-village-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a>), allowing cloud users to enter the fray. The other major weekly additions to GeForce NOW are Ubisoft's free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game XDefiant, which registered strong numbers at launch, and the asymmetric multiplayer horror game Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game.</p>
<p>The latter title was just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> by Nathan Birch, getting a 6 out of 10 score. Nathan wrote:</p>
<p><em>At this point in the review, Killer Klowns from Outer Space may sound like a pretty solid asymmetric multiplayer game, and in terms of base mechanics and balance, it is. That said, this is a very crowded sub-genre at this point, so the question has to be, is Killer Klowns as good or better than other top games of this type? I’d be hard-pressed to say yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Compared to most of its competitors, playing as a killer in this game just doesn’t feel that exciting, although due to the 3v7 split, you get to do it fairly often. So, would you rather playing as a killer be a rare and exciting thing? Or a more common, yet less unique, experience? That will largely come down to individual taste, but speaking personally, I prefer the former.</em></p>
<p><em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space: The Game is a solidly-conceived asymmetric multiplayer horror game, but a lack of polish and content means it’s unlikely to become a long term go-to for most fans of the genre. There’s some quick and easy fun to be had with Killer Klowns, but a $40 entry fee and an uncertain future make these cheap laughs feel a bit overpriced.</em></p>
<p>The rest of the new GeForce NOW games for this week are:</p>
<p>● Autopsy Simulator (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Chornobyl Liquidators (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Sneak Out (New release on Steam, June 6)<br>
● Farm Together 2 (Steam)</p>

  <p id="wAAJI7">In Hollywood, the question “Does this movie franchise need another chapter?” seems to have a pretty easy answer: “Sure, if we think it’ll still make money!”</p>
<p id="REIezV">For fans of a given franchise, though, the calculations are more complicated. Will that new installment in a movie series actually add anything worthwhile to the story, or just <a href="https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/803-horror-sequels-are-the-exact-opposite-of-horror">undermine the franchise’s original successes</a>? Do we actually want to know more about our favorite characters, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDCjIjsZp_Y">will prequels and spinoffs ruin them</a>? Do we have any reason to believe the latest movie using a familiar IP has a reason to exist that isn’t entirely mercenary? Will it at least be some big dumb fun?</p>
<p id="9pugMO">So far, 2024 hasn’t given us many thumbs-up answers to those questions — but a few of the year’s franchise movies have done more to earn their box-office take than the rest. So we decided to run the numbers, ranking the year’s latest-in-a-series movies by how well they justify their existence — both as movies and as installments in ongoing stories. </p>

<p id="Szmiv5">A remake of 2008’s home-invasion horror movie <em>The Strangers</em> wasn’t necessary, but it could have been good: With a premise as solid gold as “masked strangers break into a remote home and kill the couple vacationing there,” there are a million different takes that could have been great horror fodder that doesn’t follow the original movie beat for beat. Unfortunately, that’s exactly the uninspired approach director Renny Harlin (<em>Die Hard 2</em>) takes with this movie, the first in a planned trilogy that was originally <a href="https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/502660/the-strangers-chapter-1-was-originally-a-four-hour-movie/">written as one massive four-hour-plus movie</a>, until Legendary Entertainment broke it down into chunks.</p>
<p id="sMS54q">This new batch of Strangers movies is meant to follow the characters in the aftermath of this initial home invasion. But it kicks off with Harlin essentially remaking the first <em>Strangers</em> with less style and dread. Gone is the slow creepiness of the original movie, replaced by rushed horror sequences and a few moments of lackluster action. While it’s possible that parts 2 and 3 somehow redeem the kickoff, <em>Chapter 1</em> is nothing more than a significantly worse retread of an effective shocker. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="ltQkle"><em>Madame Web</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071940/madame-web-post-credits-sony-marvel-mcu-comics">only loosely connected to Sony’s already loosely connected universe</a> of Marvel characters. Ironic, given that the tagline “Her web connects them all” was the central focus of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_76M4c4LTo">all the teasers</a>. The one thing this offers to longtime fans of the current live-action Spider-Man narrative is a tease about Peter Parker’s existence — something that’s always been a big question mark in the Sony Marvel movies. Paramedic Cassie Webb (Dakota Johnson) is friends with Peter’s (hot, young, not yet dead in a morally instructive way) Uncle Ben, after all! Except the film never actually acknowledges that<em> </em>Ben’s newborn nephew is Peter Parker, to the point where holding back on that detail becomes something like a bit. It’s almost pandering, but not indulgent enough to feel fulfilling at all. </p>
<p id="yYdn9U">With its stilted dialogue and nonsensical plot, <em>Madame Web</em> is not a good movie at all. At least it’s the sort of terrible movie that’s fun to watch in a group setting, while making jokes and tuning out the slower bits? It’s more or less <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/18/21028823/cats-review-musical-taylor-swift-idris-elba-jason-derulo-francesca-hayward"><em>Cats</em></a> for superhero fans. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="cS3siH">This sequel to a sequelish reboot brings the new generation of Ghostbusters (Paul Rudd, Carrie Coon, Finn Wolfhard, Mckenna Grace, etc.) back to New York, and brings back the original characters (Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Ernie Hudson, Annie Potts, etc.) for more than a glorified cameo. That might be enough to make it essential for superfans, but for everyone else, it’s a nostalgic callback to the original movie with not much new or engaging to make it stand out, apart from Grace’s character’s maybe-queer storyline with a cute ghost girl. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="NqFBf6">The fourth entry in the series Michael Bay inadvertently kicked off with his directorial debut <em>Bad Boys</em> back in 1995 brings back a lot of cast members — chiefly the Bad Boys themselves, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. But the filmmakers clearly think Bad Boys fans want a lot more continuity than that. Screenwriters Chris Bremner and Will Beall do their best to build a Fast &amp; Furious-style Bad Boys universe out of every bit of character work and villain lore they can scrap together from the previous three movies.</p>
<p id="nP9oXG">That isn’t a compliment. Where so many blockbuster movies suffer because the studio is trying to launch a profitable franchise instead of telling a decent story, <em>Ride or Die</em> assumes viewers are coming to the theater armed with nostalgia and a detail-oriented fascination with lore, rather than just wanting to see a couple of gifted comedic actors mouth off at each other between frenetic action sequences. Fans who care deeply about the posthumous legacy of Joe Pantoliano’s character, this is your movie. But mostly, the franchise-building gets in the way of the fun. —<em>TR</em> </p>

<p id="bWzLsJ">The fourth in the new-era Planet of the Apes movies (and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150403/watch-planet-of-the-apes-movies-streaming-hulu-starz">10th Apes movie</a> if you batch them all together) <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review">doesn’t add much to the franchise’s ongoing narrative</a> — it jumps the story forward in time about 300 years for a story that’s frustratingly half-baked and surprisingly familiar from the previous entry, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/26/15872420/war-for-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>War for the Planet of the Apes</em></a>, but with a gorilla dictator running a forced work camp instead of a human one. There are some powerful ideas at work — that history repeats itself, that communities are stronger than individuals, and that those communities need to band together to resist tyrants — but they aren’t communicated particularly clearly, especially since they’re mixed in with other threads, about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153868/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-poster-trailers-end-spoilers">a personal journey undercut by every <em>Kingdom</em> ad</a>, and about the unreliability and unknowability of humanity.</p>
<p id="hu5yRh"><em>Kingdom</em> is enjoyable enough in the moment, an action blockbuster with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152375/kingdom-planet-apes-visual-effects-weta-fx-mocap">impressive visual effects</a> and some appealing characters. It isn’t a bad or boring entry in the series. It just never feels essential, or like it’s doing much besides echoing more propulsive, dynamic earlier entries in this run at the Apes story. —<em>TR</em></p>

<p id="5wy0Z4"><em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em> feels like the movie where <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24101190/godzilla-kong-monsterverse-best-watch-order">the new MonsterVerse franchise</a> hit its stride. While 2014’s <em>Godzilla</em> lightly parodies disaster movies and 2017’s <em>Kong: Skull Island</em> does the same for dark war movies, <em>Godzilla x Kong</em> is a buddy movie about a giant ape and a nuclear lizard who don’t like each other much, but are often forced to team up to fight bigger monsters. It’s inescapably dumb and uncomplicatedly entertaining. </p>
<p id="bYFmaa">But what makes this franchise especially fun right now is that it has a secret weapon: television. While the big screen is reserved for silly monster brawls, the MonsterVerse’s TV show, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23966023/monarch-legacy-of-monsters-watchmen-lore"><em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters</em></a>, is a much more reserved, character-focused family drama that feels like an old-school adventure movie with giant monsters thrown in. It’s an excellent counterbalance to the silly fun of movies like <em>A New Empire</em>, with the added bonus that the movie’s story likely means Kong will be in the show’s next season. The MonsterVerse is a strange franchise, but as long as every entry keeps proving itself entertaining, it’s awfully hard to complain. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="nu67x5">The adventures of panda kung fu master Po (Jack Black) could’ve been wrapped up in the series’ third installment back in 2016, but <em>Kung Fu Panda 4</em> adds a bit of a postscript. The door is now open for another unlikely hero to take over the franchise, should DreamWorks decide to go that route: Basically, Po will eventually retire from his title as the Dragon Warrior, and a protégé will take up the mantle. (That definitely isn’t how it worked in the first movie, but I digress.) His heir apparent, the sneaky, thieving fox Zhen (Awkwafina), is actually a pretty cool character. I wouldn’t be too mad seeing more of her!</p>
<p id="fCq2MD">For the fourth movie in an animated series, <em>Kung Fu Panda 4 </em>is decently enjoyable, mostly suffering from wasted potential. But the fight scenes are still cool, and the humor is funny enough, even if it never reaches the highs of the originals. —<em>PR</em></p>

<p id="w0kCvt"><em>The First Omen</em> is a complicated addition to this list. On the one hand, it isn’t <em>necessary</em>, really. And its worst moments come at the close of the movie, when the implied connections to the original film series are made even more explicit than they already were. <em>The First Omen</em> does, however, earn its place on this list via an entirely different version of this metric: It might just be the best movie in the Omen series, which makes it a necessity by default.</p>
<p id="mpqDif">Even better, by making a movie this scary, director and co-writer Arkasha Stevenson (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) actually retroactively improves the rest of Damien’s story, just by making his origins this disturbing. <em>The First Omen</em> is simply an excellent horror movie, and that’s more than we can say for most franchise entries on this list, which is exactly why it clawed its way near the top. —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="3tBfwZ">The second half (or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23712612/dune-how-many-parts-movies-sequels-messiah">with luck, middle third</a>) of Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune</em> adaptation has an advantage no other movie on this list has: It isn’t just an adjunct to other movies, it’s the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24078649/dune-2-review-release-date-cast-zendaya-denis-villeneuve-part-two">vital continuation</a> of an opening-act movie that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22733349/dune-review-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet">mostly setup, building to this payoff</a>.</p>

It doesn’t just contribute new things to a franchise, it’s a cornerstone of the story Villeneuve is still hoping he’ll get to tell more of someday. —<em>TR </em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-boxes-no-longer-mention-8k-support.891132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sony-ps5-8k/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Sony has removed all mentions of 8K support in the new PS5 packaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by on the r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingnews/comments/1d812nx/sony_removed_the_claims_of_ps5_being_able_to_do/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gamingnews</a> subreddit, (via <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2024/06/05/ps5-box-8k-claim-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Lifestyle</a>), it seems Sony has gotten rid of the 8K claim on the PlayStation 5 boxes. The new boxes for the PlayStation 5 Slim models do not have the 8K logo on the packaging, instead, they only mention 4K at 120 FPS and HDR support. Players feel that Sony might have made the move to remove the claim, to use it for their upcoming mid-gen refresh, the PlayStation 5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Through the FAQ section for the PS5, Sony had mentioned that the console will be compatible with 8K displays at launch. Also, it will eventually be able to output resolutions of up to 8K when the content becomes available and software supports it through future updates. This statement has remained true, however, as we saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNGA_XnWVMg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Touryst</a> rendering at 7680×4320 at 60 FPS on the PlayStation 5, back in 2021. It is also worth noting that the Xbox Series X also claims to support 8K resolution. Moreover, the console also supports HDMI 2.1, which is capable of providing an 8K output.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This brings us to the question, why would Sony get rid of the 8K claim if the PS5 can support it? The answer to that is simple, 8K games are something we haven’t seen in the market and it could be a value-adding factor for the PS5 Pro. Hence, Sony might have removed this claim to reserve for the time when the mid-gen refresh console arrives. Another reason could be that there just isn’t enough 8K content in the market yet for the claim to make sense.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation Plus Essential games for the month of June include SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever and Streets of Rage 4 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of them can claimed now</a>. Furthermore, the PSVR 2 will be receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PC adapter this August</a>, enabling players to enjoy games from their PC libraries on the next-gen virtual reality console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What is the reason for Sony to remove the 8K logo from the recent PS5 boxes according to you? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Arrowhead Game Studios confirmed that Helldivers 2’s new Viper Commandos Warbond will drop on June 13.</p>



<p>According to a corresponding <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, the Viper Commandos warbond will add new weapons, armor, and more. </p>



<p>That includes a new triple-barrel sawed-off shotgun that players can use as a secondary weapon, and a brand-new throwing knife. There’s also a modified AR-23A Liberator Carbine.</p>



<p>The fresh armor will feature the PH-9 Predator and PH-202 Twigsnapper. Viper Commandos will also include various new cosmetics and an Experimental Infusion booster. Notably, Helldivers 2 is also introducing customization with vehicle patterns.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Welcome to the jungle, Helldivers. You won't have time to bleed when the new Viper Commandos Warbond deploys on June 13.</p><p>Additionally, High Command have approved the rollout of our first vehicle customization. Full briefing: <a href="https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN">https://t.co/21Dnmzl4AN</a></p><p>[1/6] <a href="https://t.co/dw37j22kzO">pic.twitter.com/dw37j22kzO</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798686308258431215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>In a series of follow-up tweets from today’s thread, Arrowhead Game Studios also issued a statement about its overall approach to Warbonds. </p>



<p>The devs explained they are “slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds,” to ensure they’re more polished at launch. The team will confirm a new timeframe for Helldivers 2 Warbonds “in the future,” likely following Viper Commandos.</p>



<p>The developer also said they will adjust “the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types, and also higher quality armor and weapons.” </p>



<p>Just weeks ago, Arrowhead Game Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-game-studios-appoints-new-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointed a new CEO</a>, with Shams Jorjani taking the role. Johan Pilestedt will still be Chief Creative Officer, stating they wanted to place “100% of my focus on the games and community.”</p>

Plus, Square Enix has released the first Octopath Traveler on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4, meaning both mainline Octopath Traveler games are now playable on all console platforms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you're on Xbox, Octopath Traveler II is also available on Xbox and PC Game Pass alongside the first game. If you've been waiting to jump into this series – whether on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, or PC – now is the best time. And both games are great; read why in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler/an-arduous-but-rewarding-journey"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Octopath Traveler review</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/octopath-traveler-ii/two-is-better-than-one"><em>Game Informer's&nbsp;</em>Octopath Traveler II review</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yskJnYqaqwM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>To celebrate the series being available on all current platforms and PC (via Steam and Windows), developer Team Asano has released a free update to Octopath Traveler II that includes an "Extra Battle" mode that becomes available after defeating the game's final boss. In this mode, players can test their skills against newly added extra-tough opponents – including the main characters from the first game. This mode has been available on Xbox consoles since launch but is now available on PlayStation, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Since its launch in 2018 with Octopath Traveler, the Octopath Traveler series has sold over four million copies worldwide, popularizing the unique HD-2D art style: a striking blend of 2D character designs in beautiful 3D worlds," a press release reads. "Both games are a standalone experience set in different worlds with eight distinct protagonists, each with their own stories to explore and Path Actions to use. Players will embark on a grand adventure and steer their own journey, depending on whom they choose to play as."&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="238" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Arrowhead Game Studios has announced the next Warbond coming to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, Viper Commandos. This one is jungle warfare-themed and will arrive early next week, bringing brand new elements to the game that we’ve never seen before. </p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The Viper Commandos Warbond launches in <em>Helldivers 2</em> on <strong>June 13, 2024</strong>, adding a slew of interesting new weapons and vehicle cosmetics for the first time. Any players who purchase it can unlock new skins for their Pelican, Hellpod, and Exosuits, all of which will look fantastic when you’re battling through thick foliage on Terminid worlds in search of objectives to complete. </p> <h2 id="h-the-viper-commandos-warbond-in-helldivers-2-brings-galactic-jungle-warfare-to-life" data-injectable="false">The Viper Commandos Warbond in <em>Helldivers 2</em> brings galactic jungle warfare to life</h2> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Viper Commandos Warbond Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbb5ngK36x4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">The moment I saw this Warbond’s trailer I was transported into the original <em>Predator</em> movie in the best way possible. The gear you can unlock here screams Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to sneak up on an intergalactic hunter with little more than a bow and arrow and his massive muscles. The fact that one of the armor sets is called PH-9 Predator seals the deal on what it was inspired by. </p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="785" data-injectable="true">Looking the part isn’t enough, though, which is why the Warbond also offers the first throwing knife in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Interestingly, this will be a Utility and not a primary or secondary weapon, so I’m curious to see how it’ll work in action. Based on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Blog post</a> accompanying the announcement, it sounds like it will replace your melee attack when equipped. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sony</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">At this point, I thought we knew what we were going to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-everything-in-the-polar-patriots-warbond-and-their-cost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get with every Warbond</a>. Usually, there are new armor sets, weapons, and cosmetics like emotes, capes, and banners. Arrowhead Game Studios has pushed the boat out here, though, with patterns for the Pelican, your Hellpod, and any Exosuits you call into battle. </p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">Obviously, these will have no impact on gameplay, but they look brilliant. Seeing the Pelican drop in to save you and your team on a jungle world with camo paint or an Exosuit emerge from the trees where it was hidden while it stood still has been a fantasy in <em>Helldivers 2</em> until now. </p> <figure data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Finally, we wanted to share that that, based on your feedback, we’re changing our approach to Warbonds.</p><p>Firstly, we’re slowing the pace that we release Warbonds to allow a little more time to polish them. (We'll confirm what that new timeframe will be in the future)</p><p>[5/6]</p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1798689852671893540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 6, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1798689852671893540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrowhead Game Studios added</a> that with the release of this Waerbond, it’s going to spread them out a little so that each one can be launched when it’s ready and polished instead of trying to meet a deadline. This should help avoid any broken items making it into the game. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">The Viper Commandos Warbond is the first step in the developer’s experimentation with the arrangement of this battle pass system’s offerings. The developer wants to give players more of what they want with each Warbond, so it’s going to lean toward stronger theming as time goes on. </p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">I think this Warbond probably has the best theme we’ve seen in <em>Helldivers 2</em> to date. Until now, themes have felt like they matched the armor styles, while the weapons and other items were more general. I’d like to see more Warbonds that stick to a theme like this in the future, especially if there’s one that leans into something like an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-xiv-adds-the-mountain-zu-a-mountain-dew-themed-bird-mount/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-universe energy drink</a>. </p>

            <p>
Rocksteady's Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League game was a flop for Warner Bros. due to multiple issues resulting in a tumultuous development.
</p>
<p>
That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which details a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision as key reasons for the live-service game's failure.
</p>
<p>
During an earnings call last month, Warner Bros. revealed it had taken a $200m loss on Suicide Squad, while earlier in the year the company's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">the release had "fallen short of our expectations"</a>.

<p>
After Rocksteady's third Batman: Arkham game, the studio initially began work on an original multiplayer puzzle-solving game codenamed Stones. But at the end of 2016, staff were told by studio co-founders Jamie Walker and Sefton Hill that the team would shift to making Suicide Squad. Hill explained this as a better opportunity than making something from scratch, with the intention of it releasing in 2019 or 2020. As we now know, however, it subsequently received multiple delays.
</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. persuaded the studio to shift Suicide Squad to an online multiplayer game with live-service content, following the success of games like Destiny and League of Legends. As a result, Rocksteady grew from around 160 employees to over 250 across seven years, although many departed the company upon realising it was working on a multiplayer game rather than the single-player games Rocksteady was known for.
</p>
<p>
The leaders' vision of the game kept changing, with staff members bewildered by the shift to gunplay from melee combat. Another suggestion was customisable vehicles, with staff wondering why this made sense for the superpowered villain characters - the idea was scrapped after months of work.
</p>
<p>
Hill, Rocksteady's "perfectionist" co-founder and director of the game, created a bottleneck, with staff waiting weeks or months for their work to be reviewed. He scrapped ideas, struggled to put across his thoughts, and confessed to not playing similarly competing games like Destiny. Staff noted gameplay needed to be designed for repeated play as a live-service, but the team struggled to avoid repetition.
</p>
<p>
Several sources described the company culture to Bloomberg as "toxic positivity", with management promising the game would come together eventually despite staff raising concerns. Despite similar failures in the industry (Anthem, Redfall), management was convinced Suicide Squad would still be a success.
</p>
<p>
Hill and Walker departed Rocksteady before the release of the game and instead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-co-founders-have-formed-new-london-aaa-studio-hundred-star-games">founded a new studio called Hundred Star Games</a>. Reportedly, they courted potential recruits from Rocksteady offering the chance to develop a game without pressure from a large corporation like Warner Bros.

</p>
<p>
Warner Bros. declined to comment to Bloomberg.
</p>
<p>
Rocksteady is still releasing regular updates to Suicide Squad, most recently a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-gets-new-enemies-gear-and-more-in-first-mid-season-update">mid-season update in May</a>. However, player numbers have dropped - on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/315210/charts/">Steam</a>, the game is averaging just a few hundred players at peak times.


</p>
<p>
"Rocksteady's talent is so evident in Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it almost overcomes the terrible decision to try and make it," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">Eurogamer Suicide Squad review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-confusion-over-whats-happening-with-dragon-age-dreadwolf-this-week<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> fans should be looking forward to seeing more of BioWare's long-awaited next chapter in its fantasy role-playing series, but there's now confusion over exactly what might be shown at this year's Summer Game Fest.
</p>
<p>
Chatty games journalist Jeff Grubb has discussed Dragon Age's appearance during the upcoming Geoff Keighley-fronted livestream a couple of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2PBbxN9HT0">times</a> this week, hinting that while "Dragon Age" was there, "Dragon Age Dreadwolf" would not be. 
</p>
<p>
On reddit and <a href="https://x.com/JackdawYT/status/1798438437126918288">social media</a>, this prompted fans to begin wondering whether BioWare was set to unveil a new Dragon Age 1 remaster, or that Dreadwolf had been delayed (again). Neither of these things are the case, Eurogamer understands. 
</p>
<figure>

</p>
<figcaption>Thedas Calls: BioWare's latest Dragon Age teaser.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCokMTQ6qKk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
As some eventually suspected, and Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has also now stated on gaming forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jeff-grubb-dragon-age-dreadwolf-probably-wont-be-at-the-xbox-conference-but-dragon-age-will-be-there-up-not-a-remake-see-marks.890637/post-123960270">ResetEra</a>, Dragon Age Dreadwolf has simply gotten a name change. So the project that was Dreadwolf will indeed be shown over the coming week - but no longer with that subtitle. 
</p>
<p>
Reacting to the confusion, former Dragon Age boss David Gaider <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1798503204818448491">posted</a> on social media platform X to speculate whether the project was now simply titled "Dragon Age 4", to make clear the story is another chapter in the same saga, and a continuation of the popular Dragon Age Inquisition.
</p>
<p>
But this seems unlikely. If the title "Dreadwolf" - a reference to a key returning character from Inquisition - has now been dropped, it seems sensible to assume this is to add distance from that game, and make it feel more standalone. 
</p>
<p>
Whatever the next Dragon Age game is called, we're expecting the veil to be lifted in just a few days.
</p>
<p>
Dragon Age fans have been waiting almost a decade for a new installment in the beloved fantasy series. During that time, the project formerly known as Dreadwolf has gone through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/single-player-games-really-really-important-says-ea-boss-despite-live-service-games-dominating">multiple reboots</a> to add and then remove online elements, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-bioware-exec-returns-to-dragon-age-dreadwolf-along-with-mass-effect-team">various changes of staff</a> behind the scenes. Finally, however, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">now sounds like it's close to launch</a>.

<p>The remake is currently being developed by Etan Solrac, who recently shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rExBxJ5lLcQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video</a> showcasing the differences between Lumen and Screen Space Global Illumination using sequences set in a recreation of the Forsaken Fortress, highlighting how SSGI can get really close to Lumen.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grP7o5KW5_E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another video</a> shared a few weeks back, the developer showed more footage from their Zelda: Wind Waker Unreal Engine 5 remake, focusing on the implementation of auto-leap mechanics, sound, and the remaking of Link's facial animations, which looks as impressive as the character model does.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was originally released on Nintendo Gamecube before getting ported to the Wii U console with enhanced visuals and more. The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/">long rumored</a> to be coming to Nintendo Switch as well, but it has yet to materialize, years after these rumors started circulating online. With the second half of 2024 looking barren for the console, however, it wouldn't be surprising for Nintendo to finally release this port to beef up its release schedule as the company gears up for the launch of the yet-to-be-revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">Nintendo Switch 2.</a></p>

A dungeon with a different structure each time you enter, a variety of magic bullets—and a formidable barrage of bullets—await you.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>In this world, Pentagaia, there were five countries that had been transferred from five different worlds.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Magi Province, the land of wizards, where magical technology flourished. A land of priestesses and samurai, a land of warriors and the four seasons. A land of elves, with the blessings of the World Tree. A land of mechanical ingenuity, where super-science rules the world. A land of wilderness and dust, ruled by demons.</p><p>The rulers of each nation sent explorers to the Castle of Heaven, where the secrets of Pentagaia were said to lie. They did so with the longing to return to the original world. These explorers were called “Heaven Seekers.”</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Explore a Dungeon That Changes Each Time You Enter</strong> – In this title, you move with the left stick and aim with the right stick. This is a bullet hell shooting game where you freely control your character and explore random dungeons. When your HP reaches 0, you will lose all the items you have gained during this exploration. The player gains experience by exploring many times and learning the patterns of the rooms and the nature of the enemies.</li><li><strong>Create Your Own “Magic Shot!”</strong> – The shot fired by the player character can be modified by freely combining over 20 customizable items to change its properties. Since items are randomly acquired during each quest, players will fight with a different “personalized shot” each time they dive into a dungeon.</li><li><strong>Dot Art Style Game Visuals</strong> – All in-game elements in this title, including player characters, enemies, and dungeons, are rendered in high-quality dot art.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a gameplay trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="【公式】ローグライトSTG『HEAVEN SEEKER コノ残酷ナ世界ノ救イ方』製品版プレイ動画" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x2czPZaL6n0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Digital Cybercherries' Joe Henson reflects on the variety of experiences crammed into Free Radical's beloved shooter</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><em>Why I Love is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/why-i-love">a series of guest editorials on GamesIndustry.biz</a> intended to showcase the ways in which game developers appreciate each other's work. This entry was contributed by Joe Henson, game designer and marketing director at Digital Cybercherries, which has just released Hypercharge: Unboxed onXbox Series X|S and Xbox One.</em></p>
<p>When I reflect on my childhood filled with gaming, many cherished memories come to mind, featuring a host of remarkable games. Yet, as the sands of time have shifted, one game consistently stands out, always managing to bring a smile to my face and ignite a comforting warmth deep within. This game makes me yearn to turn back time, if only for a day, to relive the thrill of playing it for the first time (it’s probably not a surprise I get this nostalgic given that we made an action-figure, Small Soldiers-inspired shooter in Hypercharge: Unboxed).</p>
<p>That game is none other than TimeSplitters 2.</p>
<p>A first-person shooter developed by Free Radical Design, TimeSplitters 2 might not have boasted the most profound or compelling narrative during its era, but it excelled spectacularly in areas where many others fell short. Its rich assortment of game modes – including a co-operative story campaign, a variety of player-versus-player modes, and notably, the innovative MapMaker feature offered an unmatched breadth of gameplay.</p>
<p>It’s easy to overlook just how spoiled we were by the rewarding gameplay experience, with its plethora of unlockables that seemed almost endless. Looking back, we didn’t realize just how fortunate we were (and shout out to the unlockable Gingerbread Man character!).</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2-MapMaker-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>TimeSplitters 2's MapMaker allowed players to create their own mutliplayer arenas and even single-player missions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another aspect I absolutely adored was the diverse arsenal of weapons in TimeSplitters 2. Each weapon, some of which could be dual-wielded, ranged from tommy guns to alien energy balls, not to mention traditional arms like grenade launchers and shotguns. They were not only visually impressive but also satisfying to use, thanks to their impactful sound effects. The wide range ensured we were never at a loss for options, with each one fitting different play styles and scenarios.</p>
<p>However, the game mode that holds a special place in my heart is Virus. It was straightforward yet extremely fun – a tag-based mode where one player starts as the 'infected,' and the objective is to evade infection as long as possible. The thrill of dodging fiery, green-tinged characters intent on your capture, sprinting into dead ends with adrenaline pumping, was simply electrifying.</p>
<p>Whether playing alone with AI bots or in split-screen with friends, Virus was always a highlight. I fondly recall betting small change on each round during lively sessions with friends, where our makeshift tournaments became legendary among our group.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2-Virus-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Virus was among Henson's favourite multiplayer modes in TimeSplitters 2</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Co-op mode also brings back fond memories, especially of missions filled with hilarious mishaps. One mission required us to tail a character without being too conspicuous – a task at which I frequently failed, thanks to my penchant for mischief, like firing bullets near the target’s feet or attempting reckless speedruns past her. Our failures often turned into impromptu one-on-one battles when frustration peaked, transforming cooperative play into chaotic yet hilarious duels.</p>
<p>It remains a testament to the timelessness of well-made games. Its legacy of innovation, particularly through its MapMaker and varied gameplay modes, continues to influence the design of modern shooters. As I look back, I am filled with gratitude for the unique, fun experiences it offered, reminding me of the joys of gaming during a simpler time!</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Timesplitters-2Melon-(1).png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A monkey wielding a melon. No, we can't remember why either</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>TimeSplitters 2 wasn't just another game; it was a comprehensive, engaging experience that combined action, customization, and a wide selection of modes to cater to all tastes. It challenged players when necessary and provided endless fun, making it a true classic in the realm of first-person shooters.</p>
<p>This rich variety in gameplay and the seamless integration of multiple game modes served as a blueprint for our own title, Hypercharge: Unboxed. We aimed to recreate that sense of versatility and fun, incorporating diverse game modes that could appeal to both nostalgic players and newcomers alike.</p>
<p>I am immensely grateful for the countless hours of joy TimeSplitters 2 provided, and it holds a treasured spot in my gaming history, influencing not just how I view games but also how we designed our own.</p>

            <p>Fallout's showrunners say they want to get the second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible.</p>
<p>The first season of Fallout made its debut back in April, with all episodes releasing on Amazon Prime in one go. Soon after it was released, the show received scores of praise across the industry. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">Our own Fallout review</a> called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain had nothing but praise for the adaptation</a>.</p>
<p>It ultimately came as no surprise when the series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>, but just when could we see the likes of Walton Goggins' Ghoul on the screen again? Well, according to showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner, the Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>

<p>When asked about a release window for the show's second season by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/fallout-showrunners-interview-1235914667/">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Robertson-Dworet and Wagner noted the "internet has an interesting habit of making non-binding statements binding", so they refrained from giving any specific dates. However, Wagner stated the team was "going as fast as we possibly can".</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of heavy lifting from season one already done. We have sets, assets, visual effects, that are already done," Wagner said. "We are hitting the ground running this season."</p>
<p>Robertson-Dworet added: "There are so many things we wanted to do in season one where we were like, 'That would be amazing, let's do that in season two'. So it feels like we're so much farther along and it's honestly really exciting and we're just really grateful to have the opportunity to bring to the screen all the things that didn't quite fit in season one.</p>
<p>"We're excited to get to now do those now."</p>

<p>The first season of Fallout saw<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks"> 65 million viewers</a> tuning in over its first 16 days of release. This in turn led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">Bethesda's Todd Howard</a> recently stating: "Depending on the Fallout game, you're looking at a 4-6x increase in daily players."</p>
<p>This uptick in popularity saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-currently-europes-best-selling-game-almost-a-decade-after-release">Fallout 4 become the best selling game in Europe</a> at one point in April, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76-has-now-welcomed-1m-players-in-a-single-day-six-years-after-broken-launch">Fallout 76 recently welcomed over one million players in a single day</a>, several years after its initial release.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-hogwarts-legacy-%E2%80%9Cdirector%E2%80%99s-cut%E2%80%9D-version-is-being-developed-with-members-of-the-batman-arkham-series-development-team.891051/</guid>

			<p>A new version of Hogwarts Legacy is apparently in development, and members of Rocksteady Studios, the studio behind the Batman: Arkham series and the controversial Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, are working on it.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNzY3MzY3MywiZXhwIjoxNzE4Mjc4NDczLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRU5QQUlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.yB-HVmx3nZL3rpzfiy_eMucOVRoO4LbwqaSoNNzKNzM">report</a> from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier focused on the development woes of the aforementioned live service game released earlier this year by Rocksteady Studios and Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, it's revealed how a "director's cut" version of the open-world game based on the Wizarding World is in the works. No additional information was provided on this new version, so it's not clear how it will differ from the massively successful base version of the game.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph"><em>Many of the studio’s employees are now helping to develop a new “director’s cut” version of&nbsp;Hogwarts Legacy.&nbsp;At the same time, according to people familiar, the studio leaders are looking to pitch a new single-player game, which would return Rocksteady to its roots.</em></p>
<p>The reveal of a new version of Hogwarts Legacy is definitely interesting, as the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-final-update-adds-playstation-exclusive-content-photo-mode-talent-points-reset-and-more/">final update</a> has just gone live, introducing new features and content, including former PlayStation-exclusive content. Even without these late additions, the game would have been a worthy purchase for all Harry Potter and Wizarding World fans, as highlighted by Chris in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hogwarts-legacy-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything to know about The Sims 5, aka Project Rene]]></title>
            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24171609/the-sims-5-project-rene-overview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-to-know-about-the-sims-5-aka-project-rene.891048/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171609/the-sims-5-project-rene-overview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="hr1Az2">Though <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166495/the-sims-4-rivieria-retreat-cozy-bistro-gallery"><em>The Sims 4</em> is still thriving</a><strong> </strong>10 years after it was originally released, developer Maxis and publisher Electronic Arts are in active development on Project Rene, the codename for what will become <em>The Sims 5</em>. Maxis is “very early on in development” of <em>The Sims 5 </em><a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">as of 2023</a>, according to a blog post on the Electronic Arts website. </p>
<p id="DTsG0g">But the game is far enough along that Maxis was able to host small playtests focusing on interior design and furniture as early as 2022 — the same year the company announced it was developing the game. Maxis and Electronic Arts intend to keep that up, hosting small playtests throughout the course of development.</p>
<p id="iQHL05">“This is how the best games are made, working hand-in-hand with players,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">game director Gane Rodiek wrote in 2023</a>. “It’s such a valuable tool that will help us make Project Rene truly special. <em>But!</em>—it is a long, involved process.”</p>
<p id="EuPqTs">So far, the developer has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5iU38RIuU&amp;list=PLSnHrMX7SCvO8UYhQ-_KHa-r1rNmoRlv-">published four separate videos</a> that go over the latest in Project Rene. The broadcasts are an unexpected and transparent way for Maxis to keep players invested in the next generation of The Sims. There’s still a lot to learn about <em>The Sims 5</em>, including the ever-important release date, but we do know a lot. </p>
<p id="w1OwQU">Let’s get caught up.</p>
<h2 id="6neb5i"><strong>Why is it called Project Rene?</strong></h2>
<p id="plHRMW">Project Rene is the codename for the next Sims game. We don’t technically even have confirmation that this game will be called <em>The Sims 5 — </em>just that it’s the next generation of The Sims. Whatever the name, it won’t stay Project Rene<em>; </em>codenames are standard in the industry. But the team chose this codename specifically because it’s a reflection of words like “renewal, renaissance, rebirth,” said Lyndsay Pearson, who leads The Sims franchise, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmm6h6bHD3o&amp;">in a Behind the Sims broadcast</a>. “It represents our renewed commitment to The Sims,” she added.</p>
<div id="kFgjjC"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mu5iU38RIuU?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h2 id="F8ADG1">
<strong>When will </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5 </strong></em><strong>be released?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="Q2qBbs">Maxis and Electronic Arts haven’t given a release window for <em>The Sims 5</em> — they’ve only said that it’s very early in development. You shouldn’t expect <em>The Sims 5</em> to be released for a couple years still, but there may be opportunities for early access periods.</p>
<p id="W6ejec">“There is so much work remaining for Project Rene, though,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/project-rene-playtesting-the-next-generation-of-the-sims">Grant said in a blog post from 2023</a>. “We still haven’t shared our Simulation experiences or character and clothing customization — not to mention new versions of apartment customization and additional social play experiences. All of this will be slowly stood up, shared, tested, tweaked, enhanced, reduced. And we intend to develop it hand-in-hand alongside our players.”</p>
<h2 id="qpmoab">
<strong>Is </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5</strong></em><strong> free to play?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="dcC2JP">Maxis made <em>The Sims 4</em> free to play in 2022, well into the game’s lifespan; <em>The Sims 4 </em>was released in 2014. <em>The Sims 5</em> will be free to download from the start, Pearson said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mu5iU38RIuU&amp;t=624s">an episode of Behind The Sims</a> from September 2023.</p>

<p id="gaNTtJ">“That means that when it’s ready and fully open to our players, you’ll be able to join, and play, and explore Project Rene without a subscription, without a core game purchase or energy mechanics,” Pearson said. <em>The Sims 5</em>, like <em>The Sims 4</em>, will have paid content, but Pearson said the new game’s content distribution will be slightly different. Her example was weather — in <em>The Sims 4</em>, you needed the $40 <em>Seasons</em> expansion pass to have any weather at all. But <em>The Sims 5</em> would come with basic weather, and the paid content would expand on that — so if snow was in the base game, the expansion would let you ice skate or build a snowman, she said.</p>
<p id="4sJS2V">Pearson said Maxis wants to “lower those barriers to play” to give players access to the broadest shared systems. You shouldn’t expect to start with everything that’s currently in <em>The Sims 4</em>, however.</p>
<h2 id="ALlsto">
<strong>Does </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5 </strong></em><strong>have multiplayer?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="dvfKsW"><em>The Sims 5</em> will have multiplayer, but Rodiek tempered expectations <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spC-n7rWp_k">in a Behind The Sims episode</a> from January 2023. “Now, one thing to keep in mind is that Project Rene is not an MMO,” Rodiek said. “It is not this public, shared space where everything you do is always with other people. You could play on your own, on your terms, and then again, when you want on your terms, you can invite others to come and play with you.”</p>
<h2 id="imoInu">
<strong>Where can I play </strong><em><strong>The Sims 5</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="MBqHh9">Maxis and Electronic Arts haven’t confirmed exactly where you’ll be able to play <em>The Sims 5</em>, just that it’s coming to Windows PC and mobile. Not only that, but there’ll be cross-save between the two options: “With Project Rene, you’ll be able to play on a PC, put it down, and pick up right where you left off on a mobile device,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-1">according to a blog post on the Electronic Arts website</a>. The developer is still working on how to “tailor the experiences per platform,” meaning how the game changes between PC and mobile, if at all, due to performance on the platforms.</p>
<div id="YSotUj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tmm6h6bHD3o?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h2 id="WiMtHy">
<strong>How will the gameplay change compared to </strong><em><strong>The Sims 4</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="ji7N2J">Maxis and Electronic Arts said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-3"><strong>in its third Behind The Sims video</strong></a> from September 2022 that <em>The Sims 5</em> will feel “Simsy,” with players managing what their Sims do, “while also presenting gameplay choices differently.” There hasn’t been a ton of information on what that actually means, but some areas that you can expect to see changes are animation, visuals, socialization, and Sim routines.</p>
<p id="kULSwf">“The vision for animation is driven by the phrase, ‘read the room,’ which means we want players to know how our Sims feel, along with what they’re thinking, just by how they behave,” <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-2">Maxis wrote on its blog</a>. “This means we support a variety of attitudes, emotions and postures that need to work across various objects and socialization features.” The developer expects this to extend to routines, improving on how Sims “live at home and in a broader neighborhood.”</p>
<p id="VjDib4">When it comes to customization options, you can expect more detail everywhere. The first playtest was focused on furniture customization and design, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tmm6h6bHD3o">and the first Behind The Sims shows a little about how this works</a>. There’s a ton of flexibility when it comes to color and design, and also in how objects are placed in the world. The clip shows a Sim tinkering with a couch, for example: They were able to change the colors and patterns on the couch, but also adjust different details, like the shape or number of cushions. They could also place and move around pillows that sit on the couch, too.</p>
<h2 id="j2dhD4">
<strong>What about </strong><em><strong>The Sims 4</strong></em><strong>?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="P94A02"><em>The Sims 4</em> isn’t going to die when <em>The Sims 5</em> is released. Maxis said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/behind-the-sims-episode-3">Project Rene and <em>The Sims 4</em> will coexist</a>: “We will continue to support both at the same time and will plan to bring more exciting content to <em>The Sims 4 </em>community for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p id="6KLQ5j">We can’t say how long Maxis will continue to support <em>The Sims 4</em> when <em>The Sims 5</em> comes out, but it’s safe to say it won’t be dropped immediately. </p>

<p>A new report from Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier on the development of Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has revealed that Warner Bros. is working on a new Hogwarts Legacy Director’s Cut.</p>



<p>In the Bloomberg report, Schreier details a lot of Suicide Squad’s shortcomings (<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-05/why-is-apple-aapl-teaming-up-with-openai-both-companies-need-each-other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which we encourage you to read here</a>), but towards the end of the report, it’s said that Warner Bros. is now working on Director’s Cut of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>



<p>The game, which was developed by Avalanche Software was the most successful game in 2023, selling over 23 million copies. Within two weeks on launch, the game sold an impressive 12 million copies and generated over $850 million in global revenue.  Given that Warner Bros. also lost over $200 million in the development of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, it makes sense to continue to capitalize on a successful release. It’s said that the majority of Rocksteady is working on the Directors Cut.</p>



<p>Today, Hogwarts Legacy will also be getting a huge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hogwarts-legacy-update-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new update across all platforms</a>. The update is being promoted by WB Games encouraging users to share their screenshots taken in photomode with the hashtag #CaptureTheUnwritten.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear on what will be included in the Directors Cut, or when it will be released. But given that Bloomberg’s sources have revealed its existence, it could be announced sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>What do you think about a Harry Potter: Hogwarts Legacy Directors Cut? Let us know down int he comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-present-and-future-of-online-toxicity-management<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>At Reboot Develop Blue 2024, Unity's Micaela Hayes appeared on stage to tackle the subject of online toxicity, how to fight it and how important it is to confront it not only from an ethical point of view but, frankly, as a business decision.</p>
<p>Between 2021 and 2023, she explained, the number of people experiencing some form of toxicity has gone from 68% to 76%, and roughly 49% of players have stated that they avoid specific games for this reason. When, later in the day, we had a chance to interview her on these topics, we asked her why she thinks the numbers have been rising.</p>
<p>"I think it's gotten worse because during COVID and 2020, a lot of people were inside playing games," she said, "The gaming community grew and we've kind of plateaued since then, because a lot of people have gone back to school, back to work. They're not at home as much."</p>
<p>The lockdown obviously had a huge impact on mental health and Hayes thinks that "people's empathy changed", suggesting that players became more self-focused and didn't have the same experiences as face-to-face interactions. That is particularly relevant for young people, students who missed two or three years of human interactions during a very delicate phase of their emotional development.</p>
<p>"It very much siloed people's environments and took away the humanity of it," Hayes explained. "And I think that translates in all aspects of the world, especially gaming. Particularly because you're hidden behind a computer screen. You don't have a camera. There's no identifiable information coming from your profile or whatever. So people feel safety in that."</p>
<blockquote><p>"Moderation sees one of the highest turnovers in the industry because they face  obscene language and terrible threats on a daily basis. The human psyche can only take so much before asking if it's worth it"</p></blockquote>
<p>Data also shows how toxic behaviour doesn't necessarily come from a small group of angry people. "There's a generalized increase in toxicity," Hayes said.</p>
<p>But the current situation could be traced much further back than 2020; Hayes suggests the anti-toxicity culture during the early Noughties could be part of the issue.</p>
<p>"When I started playing games, there wasn't the anti-toxicity movement at all," she said. "That kind of behaviour was just part of the culture, part of the experience, deal with it or leave.</p>
<p>"Your foundational understanding of video games comes from when you first start. And I think that when you start your gaming adventures in a toxic environment like that, and you think that's normalized, then you'll expect it to continue on that way, because that's just part of the experience, unfortunately."</p>
<p>She added that changing online behavioural patterns isn't easy: "It's been normalized for so long, people just think it's part of how games work. Thankfully, there's been a super high increase of companies that understand that not only is it important, but the onus is on them to do something about the environments that they create for their players."</p>
<p>During her talk, Hayes pointed out a silver lining to the terrible stats we mentioned earlier: studies show that roughly 96% of people want to do something about the issue. Also, a lot of people states that they are willing to pay even double the monthly price for a game if it means the game environment won't be toxic.</p>
<p>But what can be done and how have companies actually tried to tackle the situation? Hayes briefly summarized it during her talk, explaining how there's almost always a compromise involved. Moderation based on reporting, for example, is complex because it's often not based on evidence, it depends on people's will to act and report and rarely produces any direct feedback for the user. Using forums or Discord means the player has to leave the game to report. Speech to text transcriptions ignore nuances, tone, community culture, which can also be a problem with outsourced moderation.</p>
<blockquote><p>"More companies understand the onus is on them to do something about the environments they create for players"</p></blockquote>
<p>And one of the biggest issues is how hard it is to evaluate contextual behaviour: a certain kind of banter could be insulting between complete strangers and perfectly fine between friends, or generally accepted in a first-person shooter and wildly unacceptable in a game meant for little kids.</p>
<p>So, how does the industry address this complex web of issues? Hayes approach could be traced back to her teaching background; she previously worked as a high school math teacher, before</p>
<p>she had a chance to turn her love of gaming into a job by becoming a community manager at Hi-Rez Studios.</p>
<p>"I worked there for about five or six years, but during that time I transitioned from community management to the business development side of things."</p>
<p>After specializing in community safety and anti-toxicity, she started working on the Vivox voice and chat service in Unity, focusing on in-game communication systems. And in her work, she's been able to apply what she has learned as a teacher.</p>
<p>"As a teacher you... get up and you public speak every day. So having the ability to kind of just off-the-cuff chat with people comes very naturally for me."</p>
<p>Dealing with online communities to fight back against toxic behaviour could be in many ways seen as teaching, she said, because it is not just about punishing, it's also about educating, which can be done in many ways. During her talk, for example, Hayes mentioned how certain games gate rewards and limit them to people who don't receive bans.</p>
<p>Part of the issue with toxicity management also lies in manpower. "Moderation and customer support see one of the highest turnovers in the industry because they are faced with obscene language and terrible threats on a daily basis," Hayes told us. "And the human psyche can only take that so much before asking if it's worth it."</p>
<p>Also, she added, a lot of support teams are "at the bottom of the totem pole." Many people try to get into the industry this way but "then they get a bad taste for the gaming industry at large."</p>
<p>"And their pay is not great. It really isn't, especially compared to other jobs in the same company. And so people start thinking, 'Okay, how many times do I need to read 'kill yourself' before I need to quit this job?'"</p>
<p>This specific issue ties in strongly with the fact that the second half of Hayes talk, which focused on presenting Safe Voice, the cross-platform tool developed by Unity that uses machine learning to manage online toxicity by combining transcription with tonal analysis and monitoring the whole environment. The tool tracks things like player behaviour and responses, such as if a particular player gets muted by all other participants or how people react to specific behaviours.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The moderation needs of a child-centric title like Roblox will differ from those of a game with a more mature audience, such as Call of Duty</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Safe Voice <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unity-announces-safe-voice">launched in closed beta last July</a> and recently entered its open beta phase.It has been designed to give exactly what's usually missing: context, reported in detail and easy to parse.</p>
<p>"It's machine learning at its best," Hayes told us. "It's a way of protecting people, but it's not just protecting the players, it's also protecting the moderators."</p>
<p>But through automating this kind of task, isn't there the risk of perpetuating misinterpretation of context, nuances, jokes? That's the field in which Safe Voice is particularly strong and effective, Hayes explained to us. But it also is fully customizable, so that the studio utilizing it can adapt it to behaviours that could be considered acceptable in specific communities.</p>
<p>"For instance, games come with ratings," Hayes said. "So if the game is Mature or 17+, obscenities are more understandable and more part of just generalized language that doesn't necessarily even mean toxic." In those cases, she added, "maybe using the word 'damn' or 'shit' in a kind of neutral tone is just part of the cadence of talking."</p>
<blockquote><p>"[Fully automated moderation] could happen in future, but some studios want to some sort of human check and I'm all for that as well"</p></blockquote>
<p>Hayes also doesn't think that allowing certain kind of language in specific communities presents a risk of alienating potential new players, because those players "should be adults and should understand the context of how these obscenities are being used, especially in contrast to a game like Roblox, where the majority of the player base is 7 to 14."</p>
<p>But focusing on language and tone is not enough and the system needs to discern more subtle nuances and take into account how the same word can have different meaning in different places. We asked Hayes about this and the fact that languages like Portuguese, Spanish or of course English can be spoken in quite different ways depending on the territories. There's a couple of English words that are completely unacceptable in the US but tolerated elsewhere. She agreed and once again pointed to tonal analysis.</p>
<p>"It's not just about what you say and how you say it, although those are important factors, but also the reception of the listener or the other players. So, understanding if you're offended by what I said, based on your tone, and taking that into account."</p>
<p>That's the big plus compared to simple automatic transcription, where people could say things that would seem fine, but in context could be quite offensive. And of course it could work in the opposite direction, too.</p>
<p>But even with all the grunt work done by AI, the system still needs a human intervention to parse all the selected data, evaluate it and then take action. Will we ever get to a point where the full process will be automated?</p>
<p>"It could happen in the future," Hayes said. "We would love to get to a place like that. But I think studios want to have some sort of human check and I'm all for that as well."</p>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> footage was shared online, providing a new look at the unofficial remake of the popular entry in the series by Rockstar Games.</p>
<p>The new footage, which can be watched below, showcases the Dildo Sparrow mission, complete with full cutscenes. Needless to say, this fan made remake is looking better and better with each showing, putting the official Definitive Edition to shame.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vice City Nextgen Edition | Walkthrough Mission - Dildo Sparrow" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oh9uv3N8XwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>On a related note, the team behind the development of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition, Revolution Team, shared a video last month providing additional information on the fan made remake, such as the reasons behind the choice of remaking the game using the GTA IV engine, instead of GTA V's, and the minimum system requirements, which will be the same as GTA IV's. Additionally, the team revealed in the F.A.Q. video that the mod will be released before the end of the year and that it will be available publicly for free.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vice City Nextgen Edition | Answers on F.A.Q." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Q463nyP9CU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Before Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen, the only enhanced version of the classic open-world game by Rockstar Games that is available right now on PC and consoles is the aforementioned Definitive Edition. While all the games included in the collection received some improvements after release, the Definitive Edition is still a disappointing release, as highlighted by Nathan in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition collects some truly groundbreaking games that still provide their share of nostalgic fun, but little has been done to make them shine here in 2021. Ultimately, a shoddy visual upgrade, choppy performance, and a lack of meaningful updates or extras may leave you questioning why you loved them in the first place. Perhaps this collection can be brought up to snuff with updates from Rockstar (or modders), but for now, its Wanted Level remains low.</em></p>
<p>More information on Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition can be found on the developer's official <a href="https://t.me/revteam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Telegram channel.</a></p>

        <p>Megan Ralph and Joel Herber join forces as co-founders</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A new UK studio from Mediatonic alumni just came out of stealth, called Kindred Spirit Games.</p>
<p>Co-founders Megan Ralph and Joel Herber made the announcement on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7204122339381231616/">Linkedin</a>, saying the studio was created six months ago. Ralph is the firm's design director and Herber its technical director.</p>
<p>Ralph and Herber previously worked together at Fall Guys developer Mediatonic, respectively as lead level designer and lead client engineer. They then both worked together again at Land &amp; Sea, an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/land-and-sea-spins-the-folklore-of-fictional-worlds">indie studio formed by Team Alto veterans in 2020</a>.</p>
<p>At Land &amp; Sea, Ralph was senior game designer, with her previous experiences also including stints at Interior Night and the late Sony London Studio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Herber was lead programmer at Land &amp; Sea, having previously worked at the likes of Dream Reality interactive and Plug-In Media.</p>
<p>"We're channelling our passion and expertise into our debut title, and we can't wait to share updates on our progress and show you what we’ve been working on," the duo said in a statement.</p>

			<p>Hogwarts Legacy was by far <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the best-selling game of 2023</a>. Despite this achievement, Avalanche Software and Warner Bros. Games did not release any post-launch DLC to capitalize on the sales.</p>
<p>That said, around a year after the last major update, Avalanche Software has now <a href="https://hogwartslegacy.bugs.wbgames.com/patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> another update, likely to be the final big one. The Summer Update adds some content that was previously exclusive to PlayStation consoles, such as the Haunted Shop quest (which is considered to be among the best in Hogwarts Legacy), the Onyx Hyppogriff mount, the Felix Felicis Potion, and the Shopkeeper Cosmetic set. There are also a few brand new cosmetic items: the Lavender Borealis, the Azkaban Themed gear, and the Circular Taped Spectacles, not to mention a new broom.</p>
<p>Avalanche Software also introduces a built-in Photo Mode, which players can unlock after the mission that provides access to the field guide, and allows them to reset Talent Points for a cost. This can be done individually for a talent or for the full slate of talents.</p>
<p>The new Hogwarts Legacy patch also fixes many bugs and updates specific PC libraries, including DLSS, FSR, XeSS, and the DualSense controller.</p>

<p>With the lack of any DLC for Hogwarts Legacy, Avalanche Software is most certainly already working on a sequel. We've already <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> that it will use Unreal Engine 5 for the project. Moreover, Warner Bros. has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> not-so-subtly that it will be made into a live service game to generate that sweet recurring revenue.</p>

			<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake is a faithful recreation of the original game mostly thanks to Bloober Team, as the Japanese staff wanted to make more drastic changes.</p>
<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202406/6918#">Famitsu</a>, series producer Motoi Okamoto commented on the remake and its faithfulness to the original game, revealing that the Japanese staff involved in the production of the game, including designer Nobutada Oda and sound producer Akira Yamaoka, wanted to make some drastic changes over the original. It was Bloober Team that pushed for the remake to be as faithful as possible, and in the end, it was decided to go with a faith remake, modernizing elements where needed.</p>
<p>While some of the elements of the original Silent Hill 2 will be modernized in the remake, one thing the team was keen on keeping intact was the atmosphere and immersion, and UI items will be kept to the minimum, such as an element that displays when near an item. Thankfully, the UI can be turned off entirely, so players can rely on James looking towards items like in the original to find them. One element that Motoi Okamoto stresses won't be in the remake is the infamous "yellow paint" to guide players to the next objective. The notes James takes on the map, the blood stains on the ground, and other roadblock elements will be there to guide players.</p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on October 8th worldwide. You can check out the game's latest footage by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/">here.</a></p>

		<p>Wild Bastards, the much awaited spiritual successor to Void Bastards, is set to release on September 12th, Maximum Entertainment has confirmed. The game will be available on all major platforms, including PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and the Nintendo Switch. A demo has also been released on Steam for players to check out some of Wild Bastards.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wild Bastards - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MH7TH0cxcak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Wild Bastards features 13 characters for players to manage and use as they journey across the galaxy. Unlike Void Bastards, which was set in space and aboard spaceships, Wild Bastards has a more grounded setting with a Western theme, although travel remains a core aspect of gameplay, along with first person shooter action. Each of the 13 characters possesses unique skills, as well as having different relationships with each other that can be managed by players. Also, 11 of these characters are ghosts.The plot synopsis for the game says, <em>“Wild Bastards finds its lawbreakers hunted and nearly eradicated by the menacing Jebediah Chaste. After killing all but two of the Bastards, his final targets are miraculously saved by a mysterious, sentient spaceship known as The Drifter. The Bastards are fleeing an unwinnable standoff, exploring an ever-changing and lawless galaxy rife with precious weapons and spoils, as well as grisly fates, in a grand attempt to resurrect their compatriots while living to steal another day.”</em></p>

<p>In our Void Bastards review, Nick said, <em>“On the surface, Void Bastards may just seem like another FPS, but there’s an element of strategy layered in which sets it aside from the rest. It takes a bit of the old, mixes it with the new, splashes it with a comic style aesthetic to make a truly wonderful experience that will challenge you to make good decisions, enable you to play how you want and you get to be called a Void bastard, which is brilliant. It feels like a breath of fresh air in a sea of FPS games that all do the same thing.”</em></p>

            <p>The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin has revealed the show's second season will be shorter in terms of episode count than the first, but there is a reason for that.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-count-season-4-roadmap-1235945923/">Deadline</a>, Mazin confirmed the second season of The Last of Us will comprise seven episodes, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>"We just want to put people's minds at ease that the idea that this season coming up is a little bit shorter than the first one is not because we're taking less time to tell the stories, it's because we want to take more time," Mazin said. "The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster to be honest with you."</p>

</figure>
<p>Mazin stated the material the show is working with from the The Last of Us Part 2 is "way more than the story material that was in the first game", and therefore the showrunners had to find a way to tell that story across multiple seasons.</p>
<p>"When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the [natural] breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes," he said.</p>
<p>The Last of Us' showrunners have already alluded to how many seasons they hope the series could run for, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">Mazin previously stating "four seems like a good number"</a>. And, while the show has, for now, only been renewed for a second season, Mazin reiterated this point again.</p>
<p>"We don't think that we're going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons [two and three] because we're taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too," Mazin explained. "We feel like it's almost assuredly going to be the case that - as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television - season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four."</p>
<p>Mazin remained confident on this point, later adding: "One thing is absolutely for sure, I don't see how we could tell the story that remains after season two is complete in one more season."</p>

            <p>Fucksweeper is a difficult game to play in shared accommodation, a very difficult game to play in the crowded airport lounge I'm currently sitting in, and an incredibly difficult game to play on the airplane I will shortly be boarding. What is Fucksweeper? Discerning videogame cognoscente that you are, I feel like you should be able to read the title and form some broad conclusions. But for those who never owned a Windows PC in the 90s, Fucksweeper is a free, titillating, revolting, beautiful, apocalyptic new version of classic avoid-the-bombs grid puzzler Minesweeper that incorporates elements of dating sims and a vast quantity of generative AI filth. Maybe turn down the volume before watching this video.</p><!--more-->

<p>Much like Minesweeper, Fucksweeper ships as part of its very own desktop OS, a shivering purple curtain with a fat, glossy 3D brain rotating in the centre. The brain, I think, is <em>your</em> brain, and your job, I think, is to play Minesweeper while trying to stave off a cranial invasion of "toxic hyperpuffs" or putrescent, AI-regurgitated erotic pop-ups, some of which are capable of conversation. The result is sort of Thanatos and Eros travelling towards each other at the speed of data and never quite meeting, or perhaps, Thanatos and Eros exploding away from each other like individual pustules on the mutant Tetsuo blob at the end of Akira.</p>
<p>Author and <a href="https://www.nadyalev.com/">wide-ranging digital artist</a> Nadya Lev calls it a "Minesweeper-fetish marketing horror dating sim". Immortality developer Sam Barlow <a href="https://x.com/mrsambarlow/status/1798093542163632433">suggests</a> that you "show this to your senator when explaining why AI is going to destroy us all but be prepared to dive out of the way if they horny explode". Fellow indie Anton Preader comments on <a href="https://fbetspizza.itch.io/fucksweeper">the Itch page</a> that "I was a single jobless nobody before I played this game, now I am cognitively married to 87 concentrically diminished recursive clones of myself and transcended the need for flesh". Here are the marketing bullpoints, to give you a savour of the writing you'll find in-game.</p>
<blockquote><p>ARE YOUR NIPPLES STIFF AS BLOOD-SEASONED STARCRETE AS YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT YOUR OWN INEVITABLE MURDER??? </p>
<p>*Compatible as a hard-sinus hallucination with all properly-calibrated astral gore computers.</p>
<p>TIMELESS TORMENT: The clock mocks you, reminding you of the cowardice in your indecision. Only the swift and confident will survive.</p>
<p>PRIMAL GAMEPLAY: No excuses, no respite. This is Minesweeper in its purest, most savage form. No mercy for the weak: only the grim aesthetic joys that come from the relentless pursuit of sterile perfection.</p>
<p>THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE: String inferences together to create a perfect modus tollens. Test this antecedent by gambling the totality of your wicked life on one reason-tested moment of crisp and dizzying risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>This deserves a longer write-up, but one other takeaway I have is that of <em>course</em> Minesweeper is titillating - why didn't I realise this before? Minesweeper is essentially a striptease you have to draw out for as long as possible. It's the distant ancestor of all those shonky hentai games on Steam where you delete squares to reveal a waifu. Ah, this feels like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sex-games-pc">the kind of thing Cara Ellison would have written up</a> if she were still here.</p>

			<p>An early God of War Ragnarok PC, PlayStation 5 comparison video was shared online, highlighting the improvements the PC version of the game will feature over the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p>The video, which was put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cycu1</a>, is based on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-launches-on-pc-in-september-with-dlss-3-7-and-fsr-3-1/">reveal trailer</a> shared during last week's State of Play, so the comparison may not be one hundred percent accurate. Even so, it's very easy to tell how ambient occlusion is definitely better on PC, and lighting in some scenarios. For the rest, the two versions of the game don't seem to be that much different, although there's no doubt that God of War Ragnarok will be a better experience on PC, as those with powerful enough hardware won't have to choose between Quality and Performance modes.</p>
<p><iframe title="God of War Ragnarok PS5 vs PC Early Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rJz6GLXU32o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok will launch on PC on September 13th. The PC version, which is being developed by Jetpack Interactive, will come with unlocked framerates, NVIDIA DLSS 3.7, AMD FSR 3.1, and Intel XeSS 1.3 support, super ultra-widescreen support, and the Valhalla expansion, a roguelite take on the main campaign formula that I found to be extremely enjoyable, as I highlighted in my review.</p>
<p><em>With its roguelite take on the base game's formula, engaging story, decent amount of new content and excellent accessibility, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla is a great expansion that is worthy of any God of War's fans time. The focus on combat may turn some players off, but it's only a minor issue in an expansion that could have been easily sold as paid DLC.</em></p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4. It will launch on PC on September 13th.</p>

Dawntrail sets its sails for completely separate regions filled with cultures and histories never seen in the game's long history--you can gather as much from the intro cinematic or the several Live Letters from director and producer Naoki Yoshida where he's talked extensively about this new journey. I had the chance to play an early preview build of Dawntrail, and while there wasn't any major story content, experiencing the land of Tural itself already told so many stories.</p><p dir="ltr">The development team at Creative Business Unit III is digging deep into Mesoamerican inspirations, drawing from cultures of pre-colonial Central and South America. It's easily seen in the architecture of the buildings, the topography of Tural's various zones, and the names for all the locations. In the same way Endwalker drew from Indian and South Asian culture to create the Thavnair region, Dawntrail's rich, real-world influences are being reflected in nearly every aspect, and on a much larger scale.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FFXIV Dawntrail Takes New Jobs And Stories Where FFXIV Has Never Been | GameSpot Preview</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I spent a lot of time walking the streets of Tuliyollal, the new main hub for Dawntrail. Going through the marketplace full of vendors, seeing the textiles and structures that make up the town, and watching the NPCs go through their animation sets, establishes a sense of place that has deep roots. It's not so much pulling <em>directly</em> from those real-world inspirations, rather a blending of them with the development team's own imagination to make something wholly unique for FFXIV, yet so familiar to those who know a bit about the indigenous peoples of Mesoamerica and Latin America. But this wouldn't have happened without the help of several groups who had the insight to help craft Tural in all its detail.</p><p dir="ltr">I spoke to Yoshida about how the team approached creating Dawntrail, and he said, "We wanted to deliver to our players this area where there's a diverse variety of values, people have different views of their politics, and are trying to come to a mutual understanding. We started researching more about the history behind the different cultures that exist in that [real-world] region, down to even the food and the history behind some of that food." He further explained how it was a multi-team effort with their localization teams abroad and other branches of Square Enix to make sure that the ideas the Japan team had wouldn't misrepresent the cultures it pulled from.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313739-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h04m19s317.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313739" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313739-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h04m19s317.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313739"></a><figcaption>The architecture throughout Tural draws heavily from Mesoamerica.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313739-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h04m19s317.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yoshida continued, saying, "We went to an external company, making sure that we're getting advice from them and input on what is appropriate and what could potentially be a risk. We made sure we were discussing and hashing things out to have an appropriate depiction of what we wanted to show in certain areas. So while it is all fantasy and fiction, we wanted to also make it seem very real at the same time, a very grounded world."</p><p dir="ltr">He went on to explain how outside consultants advised on preliminary material which led to discussions of how certain things can be misinterpreted or potentially offensive. Yoshida said the team pushed to understand why it'd be the case in those particular instances, and instead of abandoning the initial idea entirely, they worked to develop a deeper understanding and deliver those ideas with better intent. "We do want to emphasize that we did our due diligence, not just internally, but then we also made sure to get proper feedback and advice," Yoshida concluded.</p><p dir="ltr">While all of the groundwork is crucial for doing right by its direct influences and creating something that's still authentic, it seems to be the crux of the main scenario questline. Yoshida mentioned here that having diversity in its region is necessary to tell its story about how different cultures and societies resolve their differences. And while that's unfortunately about as much as he was willing to share, it's also possible to pluck out a bit more about what's going on in Dawntrail from the first dungeon available through MSQ, called Ihuykatumu.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313736-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h00m35s385.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313736" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313736-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h00m35s385.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313736"></a><figcaption>Time to show off them brush strokes indeed, Krile.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313736-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-23h00m35s385.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you run it through Duty Support, you'll be able to take Alphinaud and Krile, and the newcomer Wuk Lamat who's the female Hrothgar you see in the Dawntrail intro cinematic. The dungeon starts with them chasing someone down a river on a boat, then battling through jungles, caves, and ruins. However, the twist here is Urianger and Thancred are in this dungeon as well, as NPCs who obstruct your path through the dungeon, as if to antagonize you. We know there is some sort of bigger competition going on in the story based on previous Live Letters, alluding to what we'd call a "tournament arc" in the anime world.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the dungeon from a gameplay perspective, it's fairly standard stuff for FFXIV--you fight a couple mobs of enemies, fight a boss, and do that two more times. But main dungeons in FFXIV were never really about breaking from that formula; it's instead about the spectacle and their function as a storytelling device. That's not to say there aren't some fun boss fights, however, firing off waves of area-of-effect attacks you need to dodge while keeping uptime with your attack rotation. Ihuykatumu provided a decent challenge, but it was also a great opportunity to try out the new Jobs--Pictomancer and Viper--in a full gameplay scenario.</p><blockquote data-size="large" data-align="center"><p>Pictomancer has got to be the most unserious Job in FFXIV, and I'm absolutely digging it.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">I must say Pictomancer is my favorite of the two, and that's due to its imaginative design and mobility as a magic DPS. To distill it down to the basics, Pictomancers queue up their big attacks by drawing one of the three painting types, which are shown on the Canvas gauge. There's the Weapon Motif, Creature Motif, and Landscape Motif, each of which is summoned separately, and then used to execute attacks. Using these paintings' attacks feed into Depiction, which lets you then access bigger attacks based on the combination of paintings you've used. Pictomancer also has a series of standard casts called Aetherhue that fill the gaps during painting cooldowns, but they also feed into the Palette Gauge and swapping painting colors gives you access to different spells--not too dissimilar to how Red Mage swaps magic types. It reminds me a bit of the old Summoner of pre-Endwalker FFXIV as well, but it has such a natural flow that makes its attack rotation so much fun to churn through.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313730-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-00h40m30s125.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313730" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313730-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-00h40m30s125.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313730"></a><figcaption>Bringing down the hammer as Pictomancer is one of most satisfying things about the new Jobs in Dawntrail.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313730-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-00h40m30s125.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Pictomancer has got to be the most unserious Job in FFXIV, and I'm absolutely digging it. There's something satisfying about the thwack of the three-part hammer attacks via the Weapon Motif and the big damage numbers flying out while frantically running across the combat arena. But I also enjoy the balance between juggling its various mechanics while keeping a sharp eye on your cooldowns. It can be a lot to wrap your head around because of how different Pictomancer presents itself, but so long as you take the time to understand its intricacies, it'll all make perfect sense in battle.</p><blockquote data-size="large"><p>From everything I've gathered, Dawntrail will be hitting another theme that's close to home: venturing into new beginnings, but never forgetting where you came from.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In my conversation with Yoshida, he also waxed philosophical about the development team's journey creating new Jobs and reworking old ones throughout the years. The prevailing idea was about the individuality of each Job, and wanting to avoid a homogeneous gameplay flow between them. Viper is designed in a way that has multiple single-button actions that change throughout its rotation, but features branching paths within that attack rotation that you'll want to prioritize based on the combat situation or what kind of buff or meter you're working toward. So, I asked if this particular design is indicative of where FFXIV is going with future Jobs and reworks of existing ones. And Yoshida replied, "[With regards to] about how the Viper and Pictomancer are set up, that's the individuality of those jobs."</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to keeping combat interesting and challenging in the future, it's not so much about making Jobs more complicated or easier to use; rather, it'll come from the fight design. Yoshida told me, "For Dawntrail 7.0 and the 7.x patch series, our goal in terms of a fulfilling player experience, we want to focus in on the mechanics and the uniqueness of some of these encounters." As someone who regularly sinks time into endgame content and progressing the toughest raid bosses in FFXIV, I have high expectations based on what Yoshida has said and what we've seen in pre-release presentations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313740-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-22h57m08s230.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313740" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313740-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-22h57m08s230.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4313740"></a><figcaption>The Urqopacha region shares similarities to the Andes mountain ranges, and there are sights to behold.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1574/15747411/4313740-vlcscreenshot2024-06-05-22h57m08s230.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, I came away from playing Dawntrail with my passion for FFXIV reinvigorated. I've been so wrapped up in Savage raiding and it almost feels like a lifetime ago when I was in a puddle of tears finishing Endwalker back in 2021. At times, it's been as if I forgot why I fell in love with FFXIV in the first place. So, stepping out into Tural for the first time, I was reminded that FFXIV has still <em>got it </em>and that there's so much more left in the tank for the critically acclaimed MMORPG. And that's just what's on the surface, because as Yoshida has said, they just can't say anything about the deeper story, and from what we've seen about the futuristic city of Solution Nine and secret technology buried underneath Tural, I'm also reminded that FFXIV is all about the wild twists and turns along the way.</p><p dir="ltr">FFXIV has resonated with me so much over the years for how it always made me reflect on my own life, whether that be about friendships, fighting for something greater, or confronting mortality with a brave face. One of my favorite pieces I wrote for GameSpot was on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ffxiv-53-inspires-hope-closing-one-of-final-fantas/1100-6481156/">Shadowbringers and patch 5.3's story</a>, and just how much I love G'raha Tia and the characters who embody such powerful narrative themes--now here he is eating tacos in the streets of Tuliyollal. And so, from everything I've gathered, Dawntrail will be hitting another theme that's close to home: venturing into new beginnings, but never forgetting where you came from.</p><p dir="ltr">FFXIV: Dawntrail starts with its early-access period on June 28 for those who preorder the expansion, and goes live for everyone else on July 2, and it will be available on PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p><em>This article is based on play of an in-development build of FFXIV: Dawntrail, and content in the final version is subject to change.</em></p>

            <p>
Naoki Yoshida, Final Fantasy 14's producer and director, has addressed fan fears of recurrent problems impacting the launch of the next expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a>, stating there's "almost no chance" of server congestion.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at a preview event for Dawntrail, Yoshida discussed improvements to servers since the launch of previous expansion Endwalker, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-suffers-ddos-attack-ahead-of-dawntrail-release">impact of the recent DDoS attack</a>.
</p>
<p>
"It was a source of great inconvenience for our players last time," said Yoshida of Endwalker server woes. "Since we are looking towards the future of Final Fantasy 14 and its expansion as well, we have been excessive with planning and preparing servers.

<p>
"Now if we feel it is necessary, we can open up the new servers with a press of a button. So I think there's almost no chance that we would face a situation where we cannot accommodate the number of players required."
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also explained how players can now travel to different data servers during non-peak times. "So with that in mind, I think we should be good in terms of preparation," said Yoshida.
</p>
<p>
He added, however, that should access be smoother for Dawntrail, it's not due to a drop in players but because the development team has prepared so many new servers.
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also discussed the recent DDoS attack from May that caused technical difficulties in data centres across the globe.
</p>
<p>
"They are very simple in nature," said Yoshida, "but it's precisely because of that, that it's difficult for us to defend ourselves."
</p>
<p>
Of course, Yoshida wouldn't go into too much detail on countermeasures, but explained the team runs simulations to identify possible patterns of attack. 
</p>
<p>
"There is not a zero chance of [an attack] happening," said Yoshida. "But we would basically work on preparing more defence patterns, so that we aren't impacted by that kind of situation.
</p>
<p>
"It is, by nature, just defensive, but this is the way that we are fighting and I just hope that everyone can remember that we are putting in the effort to defend ourselves."
</p>
<p>
Square Enix added a <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/f65d0cde87a0620f16abde630e008841fb8d70f4">new European data centre</a> and three worlds at the start of May, though they are not yet accessible. Plus <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/93750e4b0d6d5a4faf6a00dee199082392f1a754">more are coming to North America too</a>.
</p>
<p>
Queues for Endwalker were so long, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-promises-extra-free-game-time-for-those-long-final-fantasy-14-endwalker-queues">free game time was offered to players to apologise for the long login times</a>. It proved so popular, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-is-so-popular-its-been-pulled-from-sale">game was even pulled from sale</a>.


</p>
<p>
Dawntrail will release on 2nd July (or 28th June for those with early access) and promises to offer "the very best summer vacation". It will be released across PC, PlayStation and Xbox Series X/S.

  <p id="DZzuSk">Announced in July 2023, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24167088/dawntrail-prepare-how-to-get-ready"><em>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail</em></a> was a step in a new direction for Square Enix’s behemoth of an MMORPG. With a near decade-long story coming to a close through the <em>Endwalker</em> expansion, Creative Studio III teased a new start to the never-ending journey of the Warrior of Light, this time promising players a “summer vacation” of sorts set on a continent in the midst of political turmoil as it chooses its new leader. And with the new expansion would come further adjustments to the game, alongside the inclusion of two new job classes and a complete graphics overhaul. Square Enix provided Polygon with the opportunity to dive into a slice of <em>Dawntrail</em>, which included a look at both the Viper and Pictomancer job classes and the chance to run through one of the new dungeons.</p>
<p id="5Jq8z3">When I was present at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23811679/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-expansion-2024-release-date-ff14">Fan Fest 2023</a>, I was enticed by the idea of a new job class, mostly because I had grown tired of the continuously gutted Summoner, the lack of engagement while playing Gunbreaker (or any tank), and the homogenization of most of the healing job classes. So I jumped at the chance to give Viper a whirl at this recent preview event. Having now played them, the Viper and Pictomancer remind me of the more experimental age of <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> that arrived with the release of the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion — when the job classes were more interesting, and when Creative Studio III was still ironing out the wrinkles of <em>A Realm Rebor</em>n. </p>
<p id="Ay33wR">These two new job classes are both refreshingly complex. On the surface, Viper seems akin to the Ninja with its dual blades and dexterous animations, but in practice, it’s a more involved version of the Reaper, which was introduced through <em>Endwalker</em>. The Viper is fast and fluid, with your attacks built on devastating sweeps of your dual blades or combining the blades into a polearm through special attacks and stances to rip and tear through enemies. You are constantly swapping between stances, applying debilitating debuffs to enemies, and ramping up your attack speed to cancel animations to deal as much damage as possible in short bursts of time. Like the Reaper, the Viper has a healthy selection of single-target and AoE attacks, which means you will be able to reliably build up your Vipersight and Serpent’s Ire gauge. <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> has remained a game of building up your gauges to burst down enemies within very specific time windows, and <em>Dawntrail</em> doesn’t seem to stray from this path.</p>

<p id="uLKJXJ">However, the Pictomancer does provide an additional bit of support in combat, outside of being a damage-focused job class, through buffs, which is honestly quite refreshing. Through the use of spells brought to life by the strokes of a multicolored paintbrush, the Pictomancer paints swatches of color hastily on a canvas to manifest a hammer or the wingbeats of a Moogle to damage enemies. As you continue to color the world with vibrant flecks of paint and pain, you will accumulate color on your palette in the forms of highly saturated colors or pastels. Filling your palette will grant you access to more powerful spells, such as Holy in White or Comet in Black, which you need to balance between channeling the abilities of more powerful creatures and objects through your illustrations. Overall, Pictomancer is a very complicated job class that provides that aforementioned team support in the form of the Starry Sky Motif skill, which augments a party’s offensive capabilities. Where it will stand when it comes to Savage Raids and other endgame content like Ultimates will be interesting.</p>
<p id="LxjDBd">Alongside the addition of the Pictomancer and Viper, Creative Studio III will implement changes and updates to various job classes as part of <em>Dawntrail</em>. This has included a shift in how Monk is played, alongside adjustments to Black Mage. What I noticed with jobs like White Mage and Gunbreaker was that skills such as Presence of Mind or Bloodfest now transform into an additional skill once used. Presence of Mind turned into Glare IV, and Bloodfest became the full Renzokuken combo from <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, Lionheart finisher included. Job classes will certainly be getting more skills, as I noticed the White Mage does have a dash similar to Dancer, but this adjustment has at least prevented further button bloat for those playing with controllers. The user interface also indicates what skills will change upon being used more clearly, which means you won’t accidentally be putting two of the same skill on your hotbars anymore.</p>

<p id="hK81FL">But above all else,<em> Final Fantasy 14</em> is a pretty game and perhaps one of the best-looking MMORPGs on the market. <em>Dawntrail</em> expands upon this not only through the texture update, which received a new benchmark after the initial one had seemingly gone <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/4603966abf780d1e177e0513dbecd574ad0d397a">awry</a>, and through the lush environments of Tural. Creative Studio III was not shy in hiding its inspirations for this expansion, billing it as a “<a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/contents/">vacation</a>” to the warmer climates of Eorzea’s version of Latin America. The dungeon of Ihuykatumu is full of vibrantly colored plants and other such creatures, even if it is just a trip down the Amazon River (in Final Fantasy form, of course), and the mountainous region where the Pelupelu are found is just as visually saturated. Tuliyollal, a large port city, is decorated with swaths of brightly colored cloth with intricate patterns, and houses are made out of a healthy mix of wood and stone. </p>
<p id="ZuSpbO">When asked about obvious nods to Latin America in <em>Dawntrail</em>, producer Naoki Yoshida (also known as Yoshi-P) mentioned that the team had some consultation on what would appear in the expansion. This included input from the global team at Square Enix and members of the translation team. However, Creative Studio III did choose to reach out for further input regarding the representation of the cultures they would go on to depict in<em> Dawntrail</em>. Yoshida also mentioned that even with consultation, there is always a potential risk.</p>

<p id="RXWKfk">“Of course our team is very cautious about taking risks, and they would advise, like, <em>So this might be a little too risky</em>, or <em>You might want to avoid this thing</em>, but we didn’t stop there. We tried to understand why they would consider it a risk, and figure out how to avoid any situation that could arise,” Yoshida said. “How do we understand, and how do we deepen our understanding so that people won’t take offense as to how we depict them and what they would interpret as offensive? We dug really deep into what is considered appropriate or inappropriate, even down to the textures that we used in wall patterns or even curvature for specific symbols. If that symbol was representative of something that a particular culture might find sacred, we don’t want to offend that. Sometimes we might do research and understand that meaning for ourselves.</p>
<p id="K7QL4l">“So we might make the decision that, <em>OK, this is what that represents, this is what it symbolizes, and this is how we want to use it.</em> Or if it’s too much of a risk and we don’t want it misinterpreted by our audience, we would instead try to figure out how to modify this to steer away from offensive content and make sure that we are symbolizing something similar, but be mindful of the culture that we are trying to depict. We don’t want to make this one-sided. It was a learning experience for sure. But at the same time, we didn’t want to let go of certain elements just because someone would seek a potential risk in it. I feel like the fruits of our labor are very clear, and that people will see what we have tried to do and appreciate it. We’re hoping that the different cultures represented are respected, and that it will be appreciated by the players as well.”</p>
<p id="y3GRHS">When asked about possible official support for Latin American countries such as Brazil and Mexico, given <em>Dawntrail</em>’s heavy dose of inspiration, Yoshida said he is aware of issues concerning latency for players in that region. He mentioned that having a physical data center for Latin America is “technically possible, and not that difficult of a task to do, so to speak,” but the lack of dedicated language support makes it more complicated. “We don’t have a dedicated Latin American language specialist,” Yoshida explained. “So we always have to rely on outsourcing for any translations of the Spanish and Portuguese language. And considering <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> is a live service game, it needs constant support. Not having that dedicated person does create a bottleneck.” But he went on to mention that Square Enix president Takashi Kiryu is a strong supporter of more language support for other regions. “I myself traveled to Brazil last year,” Yoshida concluded. “I met many passionate players there, and there is a desire, for sure.” </p>

Two of my friends came across a Queen Bee, which was an exceptionally powerful target that could be hunted in <em>Dawntrail</em>’s open environments. They couldn’t take on it themselves, eventually asking for assistance from me and some other nearby friends.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>A handful of us tried our hand at the fight and still failed. The aides at the event went around buzzing at other players, letting them know what we were up to, and indicating that we might need further help. Before long, our numbers grew until there were about a dozen of us fighting this one monster. Even with our greater ranks, we seemed to be wiping pretty quickly.</p><p>Then, one player took the initiative and started calling out the buffs, debuffs, and abilities that the Queen Bee was using. They also issued commands, such as telling us when to rush in or stay back to avoid some of her attacks. Before long, our party of players, who for the most part <em>didn’t </em>know each other, whittled her down and vanquished her, with everyone involved letting out a triumphant roar across the preview hall. We had done it, we’d achieved a pointless goal we’d set for ourselves for no particular reason, but we had done it together.</p><p>I’ve largely treated <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a></span><em> </em>as a lengthy narrative game. I’ve played stretches of it with friends and others by my lonesome, but the story has always been front and center. I’ve mostly been playing catch up since picking up the game right around the launch of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxiv-s-biggest-expansion-yet-endwalker-will-take-you-1847854594"><em>Endwalker</em></a></span><em> </em>at the end of 2021, and so whenever I log on, I’m heads down in the ever-evolving saga of the Scions of the Seventh Dawn, rarely touching any of <em>FF14</em>’s side content, let alone its endgame activities. I don’t enjoy the game <em>with </em>others so much as I enjoy it while I happen to be <em>around</em> them.</p><p><em>Dawntrail </em>will mark my first expansion that I’m playing alongside <em>FF14</em>’s renowned community. I finally get to experience firsthand the excitement of the fandom as we get to unravel the mysteries of Tural together. I get to run the same dungeons, trials, and raids as everyone else, and I’ll likely be colliding with more players than ever before as we take on creatures in the wilds. Jumping into <em>Dawntrail </em>holds the promise of more experiences like my preview encounter against the Queen Bee.</p><p>That segment of the preview is what I keep turning over in my head. I really enjoyed sampling <em>Dawntrail</em>’s new jobs and one of its new dungeons, and getting to talk to the game’s director, Naoki Yoshida, but the unplanned Queen Bee fight is the thing to beat. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-dawntrail-ps5-controller-1851385139">I became a PC player</a></span> at this preview, and yet the biggest thing to happen was this singular moment where I felt like part of a larger community. The possibility of enjoying the world of <em>FF14</em> alongside others suddenly unfurled as if for the first time, despite the fact that I’ve been playing this MMO for more than two years now. And it felt joyous in a way that <em>FF14 </em>has never quite felt for me.</p><p>It feels as though I’ve been closing myself off to this whole other way to experience <em>FF14</em>, and it took this completely innocuous fight to shake me from my bad habit. Now, I want to be inundated in the game’s community at launch, help pick <em>Dawntrail </em>apart, and feel like I’m embarking on a whole new journey with a village at my back, one who’s ready to raise me when I’ve fallen and have my back in the trials to come. It feels like I’m finally prepared to enjoy <em>FF14</em> the way it ought to be enjoyed. And I owe it all to that Queen Bee that thankfully knocked sense into me.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span><br></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This article is based on play of an in-development build of FINAL FANTASY XIV: Dawntrail, and content in the final version is subject to change.</p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="348" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new era of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is just on the horizon as our beloved Warrior of Light and their companions set sail for the New World, Tural, in <em>Dawntrail.</em> The MMO’s next expansion teases a refreshing, summer vacation-styled adventure; it’s a moment of reprieve for the heroes who traveled to the edges of the universe and saved their star.</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">Though, as is the case with any beach episode, it’s all fun and games until God shows up to ruin the fun. While we don’t know the exact <em>Dawntrail</em> scenario, <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>director and producer Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida has dropped a few sly teases indicating Version 7.0 won’t be a strictly fun-in-the-sun affair. Tural is full of adventure, and after spending a day in some of the expansion’s earliest zones, I’m more than ready to set sail.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">During a recent press event hosted by Square Enix, I played an early build of <em>Dawntrail </em>— one that didn’t include some of the more recent benchmark graphic updates, mind you — and realized even a full day of playtime isn’t long enough to sample the entire slice. In a game like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, I’m eager to chase the story behind every environmental detail, all while remembering there’s a wealth of new combat and system changes to try out, too.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-fabled-golden-cities-of-the-new-world" data-injectable="false">The fabled golden cities of the New World</h2> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true">Since the<em> Endwalker </em>patches, <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> team has promised a sizeable graphics overhaul that includes everything from improved textures across models to more dramatic lighting and shadow effects. Seeing those changes in person, even after several livestreams and an updated benchmark, make the upgrades clearer than ever. <em>Dawntrail</em> is gorgeous, no doubt. It’s perhaps the most visually stunning expansion yet, and there’s a lot riding on 7.0’s drastic makeover. </p>

For a<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em> city, there’s a noticeable jump in the number of items peppered across the landscape here. The expansion’s home point feels like a sizeable step up, and that’s with most of the bustling NPCs and flavor text removed from the build. According to Yoshida, those were cut to spare us from spoilers. Though in hindsight, I realize it was probably for the best, as my enchanted oh-what’s-that reactions while perusing the lush greenery and elaborate architecture had me itching to stop and Gpose everywhere. </p>
 <p data-characters="669" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Tuliyollal reminds me a lot of another favorite destination, Radz-at-Han, mostly for its interesting uses of verticality and a skyline to die for. There’s a neighboring forest that slopes into the coastline through a gradient of vegetation and colorful architecture. Then at night, the docks glow with posts and strings of warm lantern light, leading the way from Tuliyollal’s beaches into the Aetheryte Plaza. Among my favorite stops were Brightploom Post and the Arch of the Dawn. The former, I’m assuming, serves as some sort of government stronghold within the city; it hosted a few tough military types. The latter was where I found the Alpacas. </p>

Again and again, I doubled back to investigate the nearby market, brimming with vibrant tapestries and tightly packed stalls managed by vendors all dressed in striking textiles. So striking, in fact, that I couldn’t just pass any of them up once, and combed the details of their wares for new items on my<em> Dawntrail</em> furniture wishlist. Here’s to hoping that Square Enix gives us at least a sliver of the new furnishings I spotted across Tuliyollal, I’ve got a place to bulldoze and redecorate. </p>
 <h2 id="h-even-of-your-little-eorzea-you-know-precious-little" data-injectable="false">Even of your little Eorzea, you know precious little</h2> <p data-characters="752" data-current-count="752" data-injectable="true">If I could’ve, inspecting the ins and outs of Tuliyollal’s delightful first impressions would’ve taken up a whole day, but moving along paved the way for exploring its neighboring zones, Urqopacha and Kozama’uka. Neither of which I’d ruminated for long after their respective reveals prior, but it’s these areas that have left me reeling in the days after. It’s where I had that old familiar feeling; you know the one. It’s the moment the expansion is real. It’s when a bewildering decade’s worth of storytelling kicks into high gear, leaving me to frantically scan my surroundings for anything and everything to indicate what happened, what’s happening, and what’s gonna happen. </p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">And well, maybe it’s a shocker, but I did not manage to find any of those grand details in the terrain that would lead me to a moment of mystery-solving genius. So no, I still don’t know what on earth<em> Dawntrail </em>is about other than the big Festival of the Hunt inspirations it seems to invoke from <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, but the wheels are turning. I mean, really turning, too. Every cog up there that sickly read and reread the Eorzean Encyclopedias and side stories is desperately trying to find meaning in every suspicious hillside and ominous blade of grass. </p>

I realize there’s a thoughtful use of unreachable objects in the distance and mountainous terrain splitting the zones, but both areas feel gigantic. Come launch, <em>Dawntrail’s </em>Main Scenario, and a series of Aether Currents, will undoubtedly guide the way, but seeing it laid out in totality for the first time certainly gave me a bit of decision anxiety. With so many options ahead, I chose a few places to stop and sightsee in more detail than others.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-s-the-story-behind-urqopacha-s-landscape" data-injectable="false">What’s the story behind Urqopacha’s landscape? </h3> <p data-characters="631" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">My exploration left me with more questions than answers about anything waiting beyond the Indigo Deep. Some of my curiosity was rooted in previous Live Letter broadcasts, but Yok Tural no doubt has plenty of history to tell. In the Eorzea we’re familiar with, the acceptance of the New World’s actual existence seems more recent than anything, just within the last 80 years or so. It was Urqopacha’s southern landscape, in particular, that spurred my desire to dig and learn more. The land is covered in crumbling ruins, some stretched along the mountains or tucked into valleys, all in different states of decay.</p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">The map also revealed locale names, with places in the south like Proof, Shades of Grief, Sunken Stars, and the Indelible Passage. It’s a sharp contrast from the land up north that leads back to Tuliyollal, where the terrain seemed more hospitable, and stops like Ciblu’s Coffee Grounds, Miplu’s Mate Garden, and The Family Ranch sure sound like places where Yok Tural’s history was a little kinder. </p>

While that civilization is long gone, I’m assuming the modern-day’s <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/dawntrail/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yok Huy</a> must, somehow, tie into those Gigant ancestors. There are traces of the giant civilization everywhere. Also, someone, or something, definitely smashed in the mountainsides all along the southern area, and it was certainly bigger than the neighboring Pelupelu.</p>

The regional climate seems forgiving in contrast to Urqopacha’s rugged terrain, and the abundance of life is testament to that. Just in passing, I spotted several of the local Tribes already revealed as Yok Tural residents, like the newer PeluPelu, along with the distant relatives of the Vanu Vanu, the Hanuhanu, and finally the Goblin-like creatures, Moblins. </p>
 <p data-characters="538" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">It’s another sprawling zone, only made more impressive by the rocky crags erupting into the skyline. They’re visible in some form from nearly all vantage points in Kozama’uka, and after several trips from one side to the other, I developed an appreciation for the varied biomes at every level. Sure, at a glance, it’s mostly lush greens, but there’s a thoughtful approach to life along the vast, stoney outcroppings at their highest peaks versus how the flora and fauna adapt to the rivers and runoff below. </p>

Following the twisting and turning rivers landed me somewhere a little more central, with one area aptly labeled the Breath Between. The Hanuhanu seem to favor the region, and they’ve built shops and boardwalks just above the raging rivers below. There’s no Aetheryte here or striking fixtures denoting importance, but I loved running the stretch of bridges offering such a perfect view of the lowest and highest grounds in Kozama’uka. </p>
 <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">There’s a lot to see here, and if said Aetheryte placements are any reasonable indicator, Kozama’uka is the larger of the two preview zones, with three total. Ok’hanu and its familiar naming convention is the closest to Tuliyollal, in the north. I mostly point that out because, from the looks of it, the Level 91 dungeon — Ihuykatumu — easily serves as a journey to the other side, all the way south. The Duty begins along raging rapids, slowly guiding the party up, through the vast jungle and ending somewhere along the mountainside.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">I’d hoped to spot an obvious purpose for Ihuykatumu’s location and clear path there, but I’m still not sure if its position means we’re taking a shortcut to see all, or most, of Kozama’uka’s sprawling forests early on. Perhaps that’s not it, and we’ll go the long way through Urqopacha. Alternatively, the answer is both, and this is where<em> Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> formulaic split between beginning zones happens in<em> Dawntrail.</em> </p>
 <h2 id="h-expand-your-horizons" data-injectable="false">Expand your horizons</h2> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">As for the dungeon itself, Ihuykatumu blends right into the beginnings of <em>Dawntrail’s</em> earliest moments in Tural. There’s no strange, otherworldly technology looming in the background and no fiery trails of Magitek-fueled wars, either. It was just me, the Warrior of Light, Erenville, and a leisurely boat cruise down the river. </p> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="842" data-injectable="true">Or at least, that was partially it — Alisaie, Wuk Lamat, Alphinaud, and Krile were along for the ride as well, and this must be where some of that fight for Tuliyollal’s throne really comes into play. Just as we began, Alisaie warned of another boat ahead, with either Zoraal Ja or Bakool Ja Ja on board. Yoshida explained that most of this build’s dialogue was cut to avoid major spoilers, but there was enough information there to contextualize which Mamool Ja was the bastard that busted my boat.</p>

For even moderately experienced players, lowly dungeon mobs are everything you expect them to be, and that’s fine. I ran Ihuykatumu twice as a Scholar: once with other players, then again with Duty Support. Neither struggled, and I used the breezy combat to test out new abilities.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Dawntrail’s earliest dungeon encounter, Ihuykatumu</h3> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="482" data-injectable="true">The real meat, of course, is in the boss fights. The first encounter was with Prime Punutiy, a darling manatee sporting an uncharacteristically bad temper, and then there was Drowsie, a sleepy troll with a green thumb. The former most certainly has a minion; it’s at the end of the <em>Dawntrail</em> benchmark. As for the latter, I’ve yet to spot the darling, dopey boy anywhere else. Fingers crossed, but I’m hoping similar existing models mean Drowsie gets the mount treatment.</p>

Each with cautionary text, some white and red, smack-dab in the center of it all. Underneath, a bar signaled how much time I had left before the sequence began. I can’t help but think the idea’s new implementation leans into the controversial ways some players use third-party tools in the MMO’s battle content. In this case, we aren’t talking about world first races or extra early raid warnings, so it’s less contentious. The design is a net positive in story-driven combat and a little relief in a game with chaotic screens and narrow text. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">I get it, too. I nearly leapt over the moon when <em>Endwalker</em> offered a way to center recast timers and increase their size. Tweaks like this are the small, meaningful I appreciate in <em>Final Fantasy XIV’s</em> steady evolutions. For all of the hemming and hawing I do over the minutiae, these elements are what I hope make entry-level content less intimidating to friends and other prospective players. </p>
 <h2 id="h-go-forth-and-seek-discovery" data-injectable="false">Go forth and seek discovery</h2> <p data-characters="525" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">For those eager to get further in the weeds,<em> Dawntrail’s</em> preview build at least gave me a better idea of how some of my favorite Jobs should feel come launch. As context, I’ve spent most of my time in Eorzea playing Scholar, though my resume does include chaotic stents as an Astrologian, White Mage, Machinist, and impressively dead or dying Dragoon. I’m never matching the brilliance of the scene’s most talented players, but I’ve limped my way through (almost) every Savage tier and other battle content.</p>
 <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">This is all to say I’m at least familiar with how every expansion’s combat felt, quite fond of how Scholar plays now, and happy with the <em>Dawntrail</em> makeover. If you’re a Job veteran longing for the days of Bane or Miasma II, an AoE DoT removed in<em> Shadowbringers</em>, then perhaps you’ll dig the changes to Chain Strategem.</p> <figure data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false"> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FFXIV_Dawntrail_Preview_Embargo_Scholar_Job_Tool_Tip-1.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive=""> </figure> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FFXIV_Dawntrail_Preview_Embargo_Scholar_Job_Tool_Tip-2.png&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive=""> </figure> </figure> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">Now, the Scholar Ability lasts a little longer, but it’s not done after one use. Chain Strategem gives the Healer a 30-second window, Impact Imminent, where you hit the target and surrounding enemies with an AoE DoT, Baneful Impaction. It doesn’t spread Chain Strategem, so we can let go of that dream, but I’m eager to see how this works into <em>Dawntrail’s </em>harder content.</p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Taking a Job’s most notable abilities one step further seems to be a recurring thing with <em>Dawntrail</em>. When I swapped to Astrologian, I noticed Divination became Oracle, a massive arena-wide hit only available under another limited window, and White Mage’s Temperance became Divine Caress. For now, I dig that change, but until I’ve had more fights to sample, I’m staying firmly optimistic about how our new kits shape encounters. </p>
 <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">Try as I might, there was no way I was fulfilling so much of my curiosity around the patch in just one day’s time, and that optimism is a theme through so much of my early<em> Dawntrail </em>experience. It’s a bright-eyed shift in my outlook from here, one that’s had no lack of ups and downs since 2013, but after saying goodbyes in <em>Endwalker </em>and brute forcing my way through the Pandaemonium Raid series, it’s nice to be back here. </p>

After a full day of <em>Dawntrail</em>, I’ve got that expansion spirit again and all in for whatever waits in Tural. If this adventure is anything like the other four before it, then I figure it’s enough to keep me around and waiting for whatever patch number takes us to Meracydia.</p>
