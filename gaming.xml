And given what studio co-founder Gabe Newell has to say on the subject in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">2-hour documentary</a> that the company released in tandem with the update, it seems less likely than ever that we’ll be seeing either follow-up anytime soon.</p><p>Newell explains what he calls his “personal failure” <a href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=7078">near the end</a> of the video:</p><div><blockquote><p>You can’t get lazy and say, “oh, we’re moving the story forward.” That’s copping out of your obligatiion to gamers, right? Yes, of course they love the story. They love many, many aspects of it. But sort of saying that your reason to do it is because people want to know what happens next... you know, we could’ve shipped it, like, it wouldn’t have been that hard. You know, the failure was — my personal failure was being stumped. Like, I couldn’t figure out why doing Episode 3 was pushing anything forward.</p></blockquote></div><p>That’s not to say the company didn’t try<em>. </em>One idea for <em>Episode 3</em> included an “Ice Gun” that Engineer David Speyrer says in the documentary would’ve let players spray “amorphous shapes” that could serve as barriers, platforms, or even “Silver Surfer mode” paths that they would shoot in front of themselves to cross gaps. Speyrer also talks about “blob” enemies that could move through grates or split into smaller “head-crabby things.” </p><p>But Speyrer and other Valve employees featured in the video echo Newell’s sentiment that they just couldn’t come up with ideas that seemed worth a new <em>Half-Life</em> game. One of its level designers said something similar in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">2020 <em>IGN</em> interview</a>. He also blamed “scope creep” — the tendency of a project to slowly grow beyond its original plan — and the company wanting to get going on developing the Source 2 engine that drives VR prequel <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. </p><p>“Newell sees <em>Half-Life 2 </em>as an engine, a platform, or at best a whole industry unto itself,” gaming journalist Geoff Keighley, who Newell <a href="https://www.theringer.com/video-games/2022/12/8/23498936/geoff-keighley-the-game-awards-video-games-oscars">once gave a key card</a> for Valve’s studios and told to “do whatever you want,” <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/">wrote for <em>Gamespot</em></a><em> </em>in 2016.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsoft%E2%80%99s-portable-console.1037628/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsofts-portable-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">Xbox boss Phil Spencer once again mentioned that an Xbox handheld</a> is potentially in the works, but that it is still a few years out. While that timeline sucks, it does mean Microsoft has time to really make it into something awesome that can compete with top-end <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-handheld-gaming-pc">handheld gaming PCs</a> like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-ally-x-review">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we do know is that Phil Spencer has gone on record saying he “think(s) being able to play games locally is really important”, which suggests that any Xbox handheld that comes out won’t follow the same playbook as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">PlayStation Portal</a>, which could only play games streamed from your PS5. Unfortunately, that’s about all we really know about what the handheld console would actually be, but that doesn’t mean I can’t sit here and dream about what I’d like to see out of a potential Xbox handheld, even if I do have to wait a couple years to get my hands on it. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Run Windows, But Make it Controller-Friendly</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s face it, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-xbox-console-release-dates-in-order">Xbox consoles</a> become more like Windows 11 every single day – hell, there’s even ads on the home screen now – so why not go all the way and make the presumptive Xbox handheld run Windows 11. This would open up the platform to hundreds of games that the Xbox Series X simply can’t run, plus, it would allow (or force) Microsoft to create a version of Windows 11 that’s navigable with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-controller">controller</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has certainly created weird one-off UIs for Windows before. After all, this is the same company that created Windows RT, plus versions of Windows 7 and 8 that ran on Windows phones – remember those? It could be argued that all of those disparate versions of Windows were complete disasters, but as long as it’s optional, it could be a great way for Microsoft to get more Windows users, while also letting people that don’t like navigating a traditional desktop ignore the more arcane elements of Windows 11. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/gs1ioj2wcaax-he-1721386723939.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Make the Gamepad-Friendly Windows UI Downloadable on Any System</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If Microsoft makes its Xbox handheld a Windows device with a gamepad-friendly UI – and that’s a big if – it would be super cool if it would also make it available for anyone to implement on their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">gaming PCs</a>. I personally have a gaming PC set up in my living room, and I have to have a keyboard and mouse nearby to use it, especially when I’m trying to play a game that’s not on Steam. A controller-friendly Windows UI would do wonders there. It would also make using handheld gaming PCs much easier, now that more of them come running Windows 11. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Manufacturers like Asus and Lenovo have created ways to navigate the operating system with the controllers, but they’re not <em>awesome.</em> Essentially, both of them have ways to emulate mouse input when you’re interacting with the desktop. This works most of the time, but there have definitely been times where it’s stopped working for one reason or another and I’ve had to fumble around with a touchscreen, and Windows 11 is notoriously awful for touch displays. I’m no engineer, so I don’t know how hard it’d be to implement, but I’d love to have a toggle somewhere in Windows 11 settings to enable a ‘controller mode.’ </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/24/gettyimages-1233352115-1700844269665.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Don’t Lock It Down to the Windows Store or Xbox Store</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The main reason an Xbox handheld running on Windows 11 instead of a standalone operating system would be appealing is because it’d let you run whatever you wanted, rather than just what’s on the Xbox Store. Letting people play any game they own on Steam, Epic, or one of the countless PC gaming platforms would be incredible. I don’t know about you, but these days, I just want to play my game on whatever device I’m using at any given moment, and the more open the Xbox handheld’s OS is, the more it’ll let me do that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has already indulged my need to play games on a billion little devices with its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/xbox-play-anywhere" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Play Anywhere</a> program that essentially lets you buy a game on PC and then play it on Xbox Series X, with your saves carrying over. The problem is that it only supports certain first-party games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if Microsoft has it locked to the Xbox store by default, at least give us access to the BIOS so we can install an unlocked version of Windows ourselves. It took Microsoft a few years to learn that lesson with Windows 10S and RT, let’s hope that it applies those lessons to the Xbox handheld, too. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/11/16/xbox-series-1605567051768.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Quick Resume</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing that keeps me playing games on the Xbox Series X instead of my gaming PC is Quick Resume. There’s something to be said about having multiple games that are essentially suspended, that you can swap between at will. This is awesome when you’re stuck on a boss and you want to take a break with a different game, then come back with a clear head without losing any progress. I want that on Windows, especially for a handheld system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, when you put a gaming PC in sleep mode while it’s running a game, that game will still be running when you wake it up. This is essentially what happens when you tap the power button on your ROG Ally. However, it’s not perfect, and there are times where things will break in your game when you wake your system from sleep. So, the capability is technically there for something like Quick Resume, it would just need to be implemented. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/19/rog-ally-x-6-1721422488016.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Wait for More Powerful Hardware</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the AMD Z1 Extreme is awesome for handheld gaming PCs, we’re still waiting for AMD to create a next-generation version of it. What makes the Z1 special is that it’s specially engineered for the needs of a handheld gaming system. It has awesome graphics performance, but doesn’t draw too much power, allowing you to play games on battery for a few hours. The trade-off, though, is that it’s not great at moving above 1080p on medium settings in most games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The AMD Z1 Extreme is using a Zen 4 CPU core, along with an RDNA 3 GPU core. We already have Zen 5 processors on the market, like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-review">Ryzen 7 9800X3D</a>, but we’re still waiting for RDNA 4 to show up. With how late in the year we are, my bet is that AMD will show off its next-generation graphics tech at CES 2025. If that happens, we should see the Z2, or its equivalent, some time in mid-to-late 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft being Microsoft, though, it’s entirely possible that it could work with a chipmaker like AMD to create custom silicon to bring the Xbox handheld to the next level, which would make it stand out in a market that’s becoming increasingly saturated with new handhelds all the time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jackie Thomas is the Hardware and Buying Guides Editor at IGN and the PC components queen.

<p>It’s not every day that we receive a competent “Battlefield-killer,” though Delta Force, from developer Team Jade, is shaping up to take on the crown with its free-to-play first-person shooter. From what we played during past beta periods, it’s an exceptionally good time, with fast-paced, satisfying ground combat, high-speed vehicle encounters, and customization options that keep us grinding for more weapon XP round after round.

<p>Yes! Delta Force is coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-console-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no official release date</a> for either system yet. Developer Team Jade revealed it’s targeting a Q1 2025 console release for the free-to-play first-person shooter. </p>



<p>Alongside the console release, PC players will receive full controller support.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-delta-force-feature-cross-progression">Does Delta Force Feature Cross-Progression?</h2>



<p>When Delta Force is finally available on all systems—PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S—it will feature cross-progression between each platform, allowing you to download and play anywhere you want. If you have multiple systems, download the FPS on PC and Xbox Series X|S, for example, and you’ll find that your stats, weapon XP, and rank all transfer over.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-game-modes-does-delta-force-offer">What Game Modes Does Delta Force Offer?</h2>



<p>On launch, Delta Force will include three game modes:</p>

As Steam was on the rise and digital distribution was clearly to become the future of gaming, a Polish company that had just released its first game—a relatively obscure RPG called <em>The Witcher</em>—wanted to get in on the act.

Over the years, GOG seemed to drift away from this origin, and shift its focus to trying to compete as a distribution platform for AAA gaming, going head-to-head with Valve’s behemoth.

December is typically filled with a few significant releases to prepare for the holiday season and countless sales to capitalize on Christmas. For now, let’s focus on the games. Here are the biggest video game releases of December 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-major-video-game-release-in-december">Every Major Video Game Release in December</h2>



<p>Honestly speaking, this December is a little more lackluster than usual. We don’t have as many high-profile releases to discuss, besides Delta Force, Marvel Rivals, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. While I’m excited to play all three, Caves of Qud steals the month for me, and I’ll probably lose myself to another few playthroughs of that one.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete (iOS / Android) – December 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Delta Force (PC) – December 4</strong></li>



<li><strong>Caves of Qud (PC) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fantasian Neo Dimension (PS4 / PS5) – December 5</strong></li>



<li><strong>Marvel Rivals (PC / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 6</strong></li>



<li><strong>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle (PC / Xbox Series X|S) – December 9</strong></li>



<li><strong>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 Remastered (PC / Switch / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – December 10</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fairy Tail 2 (PC) – December 11</strong></li>



<li><strong>Alien: Rogue Incursion (PSVR2 / PC VR / Quest 3) – December 19</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-a-taste-of-what-s-to-come-in-january">A Taste of What’s to Come in January</h2>



<p>Of course, as you start to get older, you’ll find that the months begin to blend as one moves into the next rapidly. Before you know it, the holidays end, and January and the new year begin, so there will be plenty of new video game releases!</p>



<p>Here’s a taste of the upcoming game releases in January 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana (PS4 / PS5 / Switch) – January 7</li>



<li>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD (Switch) – January 16</li>



<li>Tales of Graces f Remastered (PC / PS4 / PS5 / Xbox One / Xbox Series X|S) – January 17</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/how-rockstar-chases-bigger-better-more-immersive-worlds<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been 23 years since Rockstar Games pioneered the 3D open world with Grand Theft Auto 3 and ever since that industry-shifting release the studio has remained at the very forefront of the genre. Despite there being more contenders to the throne than ever these days, Rockstar’s worlds have consistently proven themselves to be generational leaders largely thanks to the pursuit of immersive realism. The network of overlapping systems and handcrafted elements that make up places like Los Santos and Saint Denis are designed to offer such a sense of authenticity that these simulated cities truly feel alive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The craft behind such digital realities is something that Ben Hinchliffe knows well. A former Rockstar designer now working in the immersive field of virtual reality, he helped put together the worlds of L.A. Noire, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 – games that each pushed the bar higher and higher. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/la-noire-1731677045841.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">L.A. Noire's facial capture tech made conversations feel very realistic (if quite uncanny) Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For 2011’s L.A. Noire, much of that immersion came via its groundbreaking facial capture technology that was able to recreate an actor’s every sneering lip and twitching eye. It’s the feature that liquidated developer Team Bondi will be best remembered for. But Rockstar, who acted as both publisher and co-developer on the project, offered contributions that were informed by its proven strengths in open world design. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s something that will no doubt raise a few eyebrows, as L.A. Noire is widely considered a poor open world game due to its lack of side activities and map-populating content. “Because the focus was on Phelps and the police, you were kind of boxed in a little bit,” says Hinchliffe. “How far would Phelps go and what could he do? He couldn't do anything too outrageous. He's law enforcement. It did shape a lot of the content as to where we could take it. Let's say you were a criminal or an outlaw, you probably could have gotten away with a lot more in terms of content and what you could have done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, L.A. Noire’s approach to a sprawling city was closer to Grand Theft Auto’s guiding philosophy than you may expect. It was all about <em>authenticity</em>, something that has only become increasingly important to the studio over the last decade.  “[The aim was] trying to get that vibe of the 1940s era and the setting and making sure that all felt very authentic in terms of how it was portrayed throughout the game,” explains Hinchliffe. L.A. Noire’s achievements in this area are largely uncontested thanks to a recreation of the city of angels that is so period-accurate even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/night-and-the-city" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who lived in LA during the 1940s praised its depiction</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of Rockstar's tools</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reflection of that authentic, painstaking-recreated LA would later be found in Grand Theft Auto 5’s Los Santos, which features large sections of city streets that are map-accurate to the metropolis that inspired it. But realism isn’t achieved by architectural accuracy alone – people are as important as pavements. Hinchliffe worked on several of L.A. Noire’s random crimes, a human element that helped bring the digital city to life. There were mobsters lurking in the backalleys that didn’t care about the main story, and you’d never know when they’d strike next. They lent some authentic everyday frustration to the job of a detective – would you focus on the case, or do your public duty and clean up another one of the city’s messes?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those random crimes would indirectly evolve into Grand Theft Auto 5’s world events, in which pedestrians would call out for help after being mugged or carjacked. They appeared as part of Rockstar’s mandate to “go bigger and better in every aspect.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was making the cars feel like they handled better, having better damage on the vehicles, having the tyres deflate and stuff, having everything react more realistically,” recalls Hinchliffe. “It was a grand vision of just pushing everything forward.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The key to enhancing GTA 5’s immersive qualities were the dozens and dozens of automated systems that made its simulation of city life feel truly organic. A tyre bursting was a natural reaction to a player’s driving habits rather than a scripted sequence. But Rockstar learned that sometimes it took a lie to create something that feels like the truth.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/gta-5-1731677294732.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 5's traffic behaviour could be hand-crafted to create immersive, cinematic situations. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on The Meltdown, a mission in which you must help paparazzi photographer Beverly Felton score a picture of a drunken celebrity caught in a police chase. To create an authentic race through the streets of Los Santos, Hinchliffe controlled <em>everything</em>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of the traffic in that chase is fully hand-scripted,” he says. “It's not ambient traffic. We've made the cars follow a set route and cross over at the set time, and have a garbage truck just pull around the corner at the right time. We've hand scripted all of it to give the player the best experience and the best cinematic feel for that chase.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar’s systems are very clever,” he adds. “The tools are very powerful for design. You can switch between hand scripted and generic behaviors very easily, and even the hand scripted stuff looks like it's organic because of the tools.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That approach really comes into its own in Red Dead Redemption 2. While the 2018 western is Rockstar’s most simulation-heavy open world to date, much of its authenticity only exists because the world is so authored. The frontier may feel alive and reactive, but behind the scenes are thousands of hand-crafted responses to the many actions players can perform. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/15/rdr-2-1731677309650.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Red Dead Redemption 2's conversation system gave impressive, authentic life to every NPC. Image credit: Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“A big aspect of Red Dead 2 was that the higher ups wanted to push forward that feeling of the NPCs feeling more real and make that world around you feel like a living, breathing world,” Hinchliffe recalls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You've got these smaller towns and less of a population density, so you need the NPCs to feel a bit more real,” he explains. “It was a big drive to [allow players] to talk to people and be more involved in the world, to make you feel bad if you just shoot a random person. [Because of that conversation system] maybe you'd feel a bit worse about that than just mowing down 20 people in GTA 5.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pretty much every NPC in Red Dead Redemption 2 has some kind of interior life. Even if that life is just riding a cargo wagon along the same route over and over, it’s a job with a destination that players can turn into a highway robbery opportunity. This level of detail is vital for Red Dead Redemption because of the limited population density Hinchliffe mentioned. At the modern metropolitan scale of Grand Theft Auto, though, with its streets home to thousands of pedestrians, such a sense of authentic life is much more difficult to achieve. It feels like a pipe dream to expect the upcoming Grand Theft Auto 6 to replicate RDR 2’s immersive achievements… but that’s not to say it’s impossible. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that Red Dead Redemption 2 level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hinchliffe worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 until he left Rockstar in 2022, which means he both knows the scope of its ambition and is bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement to keep that scope a secret. But as a veteran designer of open world games, he has his own informed opinions about what is possible.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“From a theoretical standpoint, and what you might be able to do if you had the budget and the team size, I don't see any reason why you couldn't have that [Red Dead Redemption 2] level of NPC interaction in a much larger scale game,” he says.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such interactions are not where his current priorities lie, though. Hinchliffe now works at British indie developer Just Add Water, acting as lead designer on virtual reality construction simulator Dig VR. In many ways it’s a galaxy away from his experiences at Rockstar, but there is an element that unites his past and present: immersion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“VR just adds another level of immersion by default because you're in the space,” Hinchliffe says. “But it's harder to then make the player feel like they're immersed and that place is real because they're <em>in </em>it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously VR is super tactile,” he continues. “You are using your hands in most stuff, and the challenge is making sure that the things you are doing with your hands or anything you interact with feels real. If it doesn't, you can instantly break the immersion.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those challenges really highlight two very different approaches to immersion. Where in GTA it’s all about the detailed city-wide simulation, in VR it’s about physically turning the key in the ignition. It’s smaller, more intimate. That requires a complete reset of your expectations and ambitions when compared to traditional gaming. That goes for much more than just immersion, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A huge achievement for us [in Dig VR] was getting the dynamic terrain working so you can fully dig the ground and then dump it out,” he explains. “That's a first for any Meta Quest game. Now, people in the traditional flat screen world are going ‘Whoop-de-do, you've done dynamic terrain. There's like a million games with dynamic terrain. What's the big deal?’ But for us in VR, that's a huge deal because there was no reference point, no one to learn from. We just had to figure that out and make it work.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The current state of virtual reality feels like a repeat of traditional gaming’s infancy. Because the medium is so different, everything demands starting from scratch. And so Dig VR’s achievements are literally groundbreaking. Furthermore, it may inspire other VR developers to incorporate dynamic terrain in their projects. “It's those baby steps of helping each other and helping the medium go forwards,” says Hinchliffe. “As each game comes out with a new feature that hasn't been done in VR, the whole space starts iterating and moving forwards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">23 years ago, Rockstar transformed its Scalextric-esque 2D roads into a fully three-dimensional city. It pushed the industry forwards, paving the way not just for its own games but laying the groundwork for the likes of Assassin’s Creed, Forza Horizon, and Cyberpunk 2077. The open world genre is now a patchwork of different developer contributions, each one having iterated and moved the concept forward. And next year, with the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, we’ll finally see what Rockstar’s next contribution to immersive worlds will be.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. <br>Views expressed in this interview are the personal opinions of Ben Hinchliffe and do not represent the thoughts or opinions of Rockstar Games. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><em>It's&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>&nbsp;week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of&nbsp;</em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>“Well, I just hate the idea that our games might waste people’s time. Why spend four years of your life building something that isn't innovative and is basically pointless?”</p>
<p>Valve software founder Gabe Newell is quoted by Geoff Keighley—yes, the Game Awards guy, back then a GameSpot writer—as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-final-hours-of-half-life-2/1100-6112889/"><span>saying this in June 1999</span></a>, six months after the original <i>Half-Life</i> launched. Newell gave his team no real budget or deadline, only the assignment to “follow up the best PC game of all time” and redefine the genre.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2004/12/hl2/"><i>Half-Life 2</i> arrived in November 2004</a>, the Collector’s Edition contained about 2.6GB of files. The game, however, contained so many things that would seem brand new in gaming, or just brave, that it’s hard to even list them.</p>
<p><span>Except I’m going to try that right here. Some will be hard to pin definitively in time to <i>Half-Life 2</i> (<i>HL2</i>). But like many great games, <i>HL2</i> refined existing ideas, borrowed others, and had a few of its own to show off.</span></p>
<p>Note that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-valve-made-half-life-2-and-set-a-new-standard-for-future-games/">some aspects of the game itself</a>, its status as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">Steam’s big push title</a>, and what it’s like to play it today, are covered by other writers during Ars’ multi-day celebration of the game’s 20th anniversary. That includes the Gravity Gun.</p>

<h2>The Source Engine</h2>
<p>It’s hard to imagine another game developer building an engine with such a forward-thinking mission as Source. Rather than just build the thing that runs their next game, Valve crafted Source to be modular, such that its core could be continually improved (and shipped out over Steam), and newer technologies could be optionally ported into games both new and old, while not breaking any older titles working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>Source started development during the late stages of the original <i>Half-Life</i>, but its impact goes far beyond the series. <i>Team Fortress 2</i>, <i>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</i>, <i>Portal 1/2,</i> and <i>Left 4 Dead</i>, from Valve alone, take up multiple slots on lists of the all-time best games. <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, <i>Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines</i>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_%28game_engine%29#Notable_games_using_Source"><span>a whole lot of other games</span></a> used Source, too. Countless future game developers, level designers, and mod makers cut their teeth on the very open and freely available Source code tools.</p>

<h2>A shooter with family dynamics</h2>
<p>Novelist Marc Laidlaw has made it clear, multiple times, that he did not truly create the <i>Half-Life</i> story when he joined Valve; it was “<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-narrative-had-to-be-baked-into-the-corridors-marc-laidlaw-on-writing-half-life"><span>all there when I got there, in embryo</span></a>,” he told Rock Paper Shotgun. Laidlaw helped the developers tell their story through level design and wrote short, funny, unnerving dialogue.</p>
<p>For <em>Half-Life 2</em>, Laidlaw and the devs were tasked with creating some honest-to-goodness characters, something you didn’t get very often in first-person shooters (they were all dead in 1994’s <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"><span><i>System Shock</i></span></a>). So in walked that father/daughter team of Eli and Alyx Vance, and the extended Black Mesa family, including folks like Dr. Kleiner.</p>
<p>These real and makeshift family members gave the mute protagonist Gordon Freeman stakes in wanting to fix the future. And Laidlaw’s “basic dramatic unit” set a precedent for lots of shooty-yet-soft-hearted games down the road: <i>Mass Effect, The Last of Us, Gears of War, Red Dead Redemption,</i> and far more.</p>

      </figure>

<h2>Intense speculation about what Valve is actually doing</h2>
<p>Another unique thing Laidlaw helped develop in PC gaming: intense grief and longing for a sequel that both does and does not exist, channeled through endless speculation about Valve's processes and general radio silence.</p>
<p><i>Half-Life 2</i> got “Episodes” but never a true numbered <i>Half-Life 3</i> sequel. The likelihood of <i>3</i> took a hit when Laidlaw <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/half-life-1-2-writer-answers-fans-hl3-question-by-announcing-retirement/"><span>unexpectedly announced his retirement in January 2016</span></a>. Then it got even less likely, or maybe just sad, when Laidlaw posted a barely disguised “snapshot of a dream” of “<i>Epistle 3</i>” to his blog (since deleted and later <a href="https://pastebin.com/q9DMFa7c"><span>transposed on Pastebin</span></a>).</p>
<p>Laidlaw has expressed regret about this move. Fans have expressed regret that <i>Half-Life 3</i> somehow seems even less likely, having seen Valve’s premiere writer post such a seemingly despondent bit of primary source fan fiction.</p>
<p>“Fans of popular game eager for sequel” isn't itself a unique thing, but it is for <i>Half-Life 3</i>’s quantum existence. Valve published <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/publications"><span>its new employee handbook</span></a> from around 2012 on the web, and in it, you can read about the company’s boldly flat structure. To summarize greatly: Projects only get started if someone can get enough fellow employees to wheel their desks over and work on it with them. The company doesn’t take canceled or stalled games to heart; in its handbook, it’s almost celebrated that it killed <i>Prospero</i> as one of its first major decisions.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>So the fact that <i>Half-Life 3</i> exists only as something that hasn’t been formally canceled is uniquely frustrating. <i>HL2</i>’s last (chronological) chapter left off on a global-scale cliffhanger, and the only reason a sequel doesn’t exist is because too many other things are more appealing than developing a new first-person shooter. If <i>you</i> worked at Valve, you tell yourself, maybe you could change this! Maybe.</p>

<h2>Source code leak drama</h2>
<p>The Wikipedia pages “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_video_games_with_available_source_code"><span>List of commercial video games with available source code</span></a>” and its cousin “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_commercial_video_games_with_later_released_source_code"><span>Later released source code</span></a>” show that, up until 2003, most of the notable games whose source code became publicly available were either altruistic efforts at preservation or, for some reason, accidental inclusions of source code on demos or in dummy files on the game disc.</p>
<p>And then, in late 2003, Valve and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/"><span><em>Half-Life</em> superfan Axel Gembe hacked into Valve’s servers</span></a>, grabbed the <i>Half-Life 2</i> source code that existed at the time and posted it to the web. It not only showed off parts of the game Valve wanted to keep under wraps, but it showed just how far behind the game’s development was relative to the release date that had blown by weeks earlier. Valve’s response was typically atypical: they acknowledged the source code as real, <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/news/posts/1065132052.html"><span>asked their biggest fans for help</span></a>, and then released the game a year later, to critical and commercial success.</p>
<p>The leak further ensconced Valve as a different kind of company, one with a particularly dedicated fanbase. It also seems to have taught companies a lesson about hardening their servers and development environments. Early builds of games still leak—witness <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/full-dev-build-of-space-marine-2-leaks-and-players-are-already-leveling-up/"><span><i>Space Marine 2</i> this past July</span></a>—but full source code leaks, coming from network intrusions, are something you don’t see quite so often.</p>
<h2>Pre-loading a game before release</h2>
<p>It would be hard to go back in time and tell our pre-broadband selves about pre-loading. You download entire games, over the Internet, and then they’re ready to play one second after the release time—no store lines, no drive back home, no stuffed servers or crashed discs. It seems like a remarkable bit of trust, though it’s really just a way to lessen server load on release day.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>It’s hard to pin down which game first offered pre-loading in the modern sense, but <i>HL2</i>, being <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/how-half-life-2-helped-sell-steam-to-a-skeptical-pc-gaming-market/">a major launch title for Valve’s Steam service</a> and a title with heavy demand, definitely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/news-270804"><span>popularized the concept</span></a>.</p>
<h2>Always-online for single-player games</h2>
<p>Here’s one way that <i>Half-Life 2</i> moved the industry forward that some folks might want to move back.</p>
<p>Technically, you can play <i>HL2</i> without an Internet connection, and maybe for long periods of time. But for most people, playing <i>HL2</i> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/half-life-2-single-player-no-internet.446819/">without a persistent net connection</a> involves activating the game on Steam, letting it fully update, and then turning on Steam’s “Offline Mode” to play it. There’s no time limit, but you need to keep Steam active while playing.</p>
<p>It’s not so much the particular connection demands of <i>HL2</i> that make it notable, but the pathway that it, and Steam, created on which other companies moved ahead, treating gaming as something that, by default, happens with at least a connection, and preferably a persistent one.</p>

<h2>A place on “All-time” video game rankings forever</h2>
<p><em>Half-Life 2</em> introduced many ground-breaking things at once—deep facial animations and expressions, an accessible physics engine, a compelling global-scale but family-minded story—while also being tremendously enjoyable game to play through. This has made it hard for anyone to suggest another game to go above it on any "All-time greatest games" list, especially those with a PC focus.</p>
<p><span>Not that they don’t try. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-top-100-pc-games-2024/#section-10-1"><span>PC Gamer has <i>HL2</i> at 7 out of 100</span></a>, mostly because it has lost an understandable amount of “Hotness” in 20 years. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-100-video-games-of-all-time"><span>IGN has it at No. 9</span></a> (while its descendant <i>Portal 2</i> takes third place). Metacritic, however fallible, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/pc/"><span>slots it in universal second place</span></a> for PC games.</span></p>
<p>So give <i>Half-Life 2</i> even more credit for fostering innovation in the “arbitrary ranked list of games” genre. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">Rock Paper Shotgun’s top 100</a> is cited as the best “to play on PC today,” as they have “paid no mind to what was important or influential.” And yet, <i>Half-Life 2</i>, as a game you can play in 2024, is still on that list. It’s really something, that game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc">a rewarding series of point-and-click murder mysteries</a> that became one of my favorite games of 2022. And while I felt there was more story to explore about the titular golden idol, I wasn’t sure if a potential sequel could live up to its clever puzzles and fascinating, slowly unfolding story. Turns out, I had nothing to fear: <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267159/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-release-date-trailer">the newly launched sequel</a>, easily surpasses the original by improving on just about everything.</p><p>At its core, <em>Rise</em> is a very similar game to <em>Case</em>. The new game takes place in the 1970s, around 200 years after the events of the original, and each of <em>Rise</em>’s cases drops you into a specific moment in time, typically during or shortly after a murder. You’re tasked with solving what’s going on. To figure that out, you first have to click around the scene to discover relevant words and names that get saved in a menu. Then you use those words to solve puzzles within the case, like the names of the individuals in a scene, a description of how the murder happened, or even things like how to interpret parts of a dance or who won a game show.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s an example of how you use the words you find to solve elements of a case.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>It’s a clever system. Clicking around to collect all of the words forces you to scrutinize everything that’s going on, and having to fill in the blanks means you really have to think about how elements of the scene might be connected. I’ve come to think of it like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review">elaborate jigsaw puzzle</a>: while the scattered elements may seem like a lot to tie together, as you slowly solve the disparate elements of the puzzles within cases, it’s easier to figure out how they connect.</p><p>There are more layers, too, as you have to solve puzzles encompassing the events of entire chapters, which typically have three or four cases within them, to be able to move on to the next one. A few recurring characters will pop up across chapters, meaning the game is able to tell a holistic story by forcing you to understand their actions across a bunch of different scenes. (You don’t need to have played <em>Case</em> to understand the events of <em>Rise</em>, though there are a few tidbits that will be familiar to fans of the first game.)</p><p>The system isn’t perfect. Like with <em>Case</em>, if you’re off the mark after you’ve slotted in words for a specific puzzle, <em>Rise</em> will tell you if your guess is incorrect or if you have two or fewer words in the wrong place. Usually, knowing that I was close meant I could reexamine my assumptions and tweak a few words to get things right. But as I also did with <em>Case</em>, if I couldn’t figure out the two or fewer incorrect words on my own, I would just brute-force a bunch of guesses until I got things right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rise</em> has some tough puzzles, but so far, I’ve been able to solve all of them without turning to an online guide like I had to do with the final few cases of <em>Case</em>. <em>Rise</em> also has an improved hint system that offers up to three hints for a specific part of a case, and often, checking those pointed me in the right direction when I was stuck. I’d also recommend having pen and paper handy to write things down, especially because some cases scatter details across multiple areas. And if you can play with someone else, that helps, too — my wife saw a bunch of things that I completely missed.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>I will warn you that the game can be grotesque. <em>Case</em> generally erred on the side of creepy with its old-school pixel art style, but <em>Rise</em> looks more like a painting, and that means you’ll be seeing slightly more realistic dead bodies. Scenes and characters move in short loops, which makes them feel alive but also means you’ll see certain uncomfortable movements over and over again. The first case opens with a man actively strangling somebody else; another shows a person getting electrocuted. If you have a fear of birds, there’s one case you’re really not going to like. But like a good scary movie, those twisted scenes are part of what makes the game compelling. Every time I started a new case, I was always eager to see what terrible things I’d come across.</p><p>I’m not quite done with <em>Rise.</em> After more than 15 hours, I’m on one of the last of the game’s 20 cases, and this one is taking me a couple of days to muddle through. I think the eventual thrill of figuring it all out will be worth the pain, though, as there’s nothing better than that lightbulb moment of slotting the final word into the right place of the puzzle. And even when I’m done with all 20 cases, there will be <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2716400%2Fview%2F4478360632965464065">four DLC packs</a> to look forward to next year — perhaps there’s even more that we don’t know about the mysterious golden idol.</p><p><small>The Rise of the Golden Idol<em> is now available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and on mobile with a Netflix subscription.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>By analysing the hacker's digital footprint, the Japanese megacorp was able to hunt them down.</p>

            <p>Nintendo reportedly hunted down an alleged Switch pirate by tracking their reddit posts.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo resumed its fight against the modded console business with new lawsuits, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">including one against James "Archbox" Williams</a>, who was the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-nintendo-found-archbox-switch">Game File</a>, it seems Williams was located after Nintendo commissioned a law firm to investigate "freeshops" or online repositories for pirated Switch games.</p>

<p>By analysing Williams' past posts online - including one from reddit user "archbox" in 2015 that was very complementary about Midwestern University's optometry clinic - the firm helped the Japanese company "succeed in linking Archbox with at least two Nintendo accounts for an individual named James Williams".</p>
<p>And because Williams seemingly used the same email address to get repairs for their Nintendo Switch, staff at Nintendo's Product Lifecycle Management group was able to find his shipping address.</p>
<p>Once it had acquired Williams' address, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, after which Williams initially agreed to "comply and cooperate" with Nintendo's demands. However, Williams then went dark and failed to show up at court, defaulting judgement in favour of Nintendo.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown streamer Jesse Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to yesterday's leak that showcased a selection of free battle pass rewards purportedly set to be available via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' upcoming Animus Hub.</p>
<p>As Eurogamer reported yesterday, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">leaked Assassin's Creed Shadows images</a> showed a similar selection of items to those previously offered through daily and weekly missions via Ubisoft Connect. That said, Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and the publisher is still to announce how any new battle pass system for the franchise will work.</p>

<p>In a message posted today on social media that seemed targeted at those taking a less nuanced response to the idea of Assassin's Creed adding a battle pass, Ubisoft said it wanted to "clarify" the matter.</p>
<p>"All the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost," Ubisoft confirmed.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said it would unveil more details "closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows" in February 2025.</p>

		<p>Valve has released the Half-Life 2 Anniversary update to celebrate the game’s 20th anniversary, adding developer commentary, improved the graphics and lighting in the game, Steam Workshop support, and bundled in Episode One, Episode Two, and Lost Coast all into Half Life 2. You can also grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/220/">Half-Life 2 and all of this content for free from Steam</a>.

<li>With the Episodes and Lost Coast now contained within Half-Life 2 itself, we’ll be reducing the visibility of the standalone versions on the Steam Store. The old standalone applications will remain available to ensure community projects that rely on them still function properly but they will now appear within the Tools menu on your Steam Library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Valve has also announced that it will be reprinting Raising The Bar, an expanded edition of the original book that was first printed in 2004. This second edition of Raising The Bar adds new concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, plus a look at the never released third episode. It will be released in 2025.</p>

		<p>The tail end of every year is full of single days that are blown way out of proportion. Halloween has houses covered in cobwebs and guarded by pumpkins for weeks before and after, Christmas has a two month run up (if not longer), and even Thanksgiving in the US has morphed into a scattershot ‘Friendsgiving’ gathering ahead or instead of the actual holiday.</p>
<p>But we all know what comes directly after Thanksgiving, and that’s Black Friday, and the need to ring up sales has Black Friday sales kicking off all over the place already – it’s the Friday with by far the biggest presence on the calendar. I’ll admit, I’ve got my eye out for a few choice purchases as gifts, biding my time until the best deals arrive…</p>

Players defeat enemies by sending commands through dynamic and passionate music to the Cobuns, making for an enjoyable <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,869 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> with thrilling battles intertwined with rhythm and action.</p><p><em>Ratatan</em> is a rhythmic <a title="Genres > Roguelike [275 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike</a> action game, developed in collaboration between Hiroyuki Kotani, the game designer of the renowned series <em>PATAPON</em>, released on <a title="Platforms > PSP [649 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/psp">PSP</a> in 2007, and <a title="Companies > TVT [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tvt">Tokyo Virtual Theory</a> (TVT). Players act as the Ratatan, using magical instruments to deliver different commands to the armies of Cobun to attack the enemies.</p><p>In addition to attack and defence rhythmic sequences, there are also actions that allow the Ratatan to move freely, with unique skills for each character, further deepening the musicality of the game. Players will enter “fever mode” when they accurately follow the rhythm sequences.

<p>In December, the grand final of the PUBG Mobile Global Championship will unravel in London, England. With a $3 million prize pool up for grabs, this has snatched the record for the most valuable esports event to ever be held in the United Kingdom. It’s the first time the tournament has taken place in the UK, and fans are <strong>excited</strong> to say the least.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>The PUBG Mobile Global Championship is one of the most valuable tournaments in the modern esports calendar. A single event will rarely reach such epic proportions in terms of a prize pool, and few tournaments come close to the $3 million pot that this game boasts.</p>



<p>During the event, 49 teams will compete for a chance at snatching the coveted PMGC trophy. In 2023, it was IHC Esports that walked away with the prize. The tournament was a roaring success in 2023, with a whopping peak viewership of 980,123 users being recorded, which decimates most competing events.</p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of mobile-based esports tournaments has skyrocketed in popularity. It’s estimated there at 2 billion mobile gamers worldwide, and many of them invest time and effort in games like Free Fire and PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>While the United Kingdom’s gaming expo scene is crumbling, the esports ecosystem across the region remains relatively solid. In the last few years, we’ve seen the likes of the League of Legends World Championship, the Halo Championship Series, a BLAST R6 Major, and the Rocket League Championship Series all make their way into the region.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the PMGC unfold in London? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve heard the term ‘adpocalypse’ in the streaming world and haven’t got a clue what it means, you’re not alone. Recently, it was revealed that some Twitch streamers are suffering immeasurably from plummeting ad revenue rates, and nobody knows why. On the streaming platform, some users have reported a drop in ad revenue of as much as 95%.</p>



<p>This adpocalypse came on suddenly and has impacted some of Twitch’s biggest streamers, some of whom were picking up thousands of dollars a month through ad revenue. They’re now looking at just a few hundred dollars, and on their end, nothing has changed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-taken-for-granted">Taken for Granted</h2>



<p>Admittedly, this is the bread and butter earnings for some Twitch streamers. On social media, clips have surfaced showing users complaining about their ad revenue drops, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1857455706376450514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">such as Lacy</a>, who stressed that his $10,000-a-day ad revenue stream has dropped to around $2,000 a day.</p>



<p>That’s still <strong>far, far </strong>more than the average worker earns, but for someone who has built a way of living out of those earnings, it could be devastating. Twitch allowed them to secure the bag in this way, and then without warning or forethought, the rate of earnings has been slashed immeasurably.</p>



<p>Imagine if your place of work suddenly cut your salary by 80% without telling you – that’s effectively what’s happening here. Sure, the creators still have subscriptions, bits, and other donations, but it’s not <strong>good</strong>.</p>



<p>One streamer, TheStockGuy, revealed that he’s disabling ads on his streams because the returns aren’t worth the disruption. He was reporting a 95% drop in earnings – one of the most significant examples of the adpocalypse we’ve seen.</p>



<p>Twitch has yet to comment on why ad revenue is plummeting – I’ve reached out for a statement in the meantime.</p>



<p>Do you think streamers needed their earnings adjusted, or is this an unfair change from Twitch? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Dying Light 2 is available on PS Plus this month as a free game, but Techland has gone one step beyond that provision and added a series of PS5 Pro-focused enhancements to the game. One of the best open-world zombie games ever made has just gotten better with these recent changes – read on to find out what they are.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-gorgeous">The End of the World Looks Gorgeous</h2>



<p>With a PlayStation 5 Pro, users can soak up several key advantages, from boosted resolutions to enhanced frame rates. There’s a sizeable processing boost under the hood of the PS5 Pro, and many developers have leant on that to strengthen their games. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be added to PS Plus this month as a free game. It was then announced by Techland, the game’s developer, that PS5 Pro enhancements are also inbound.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphics settings (Balanced, Resolution, Performance, Quality)</li>



<li>Increased base resolution</li>



<li>Improved shadows, screen-space reflections, and sub-surface scattering</li>



<li>Better weather (including fog)</li>
</ul>



<p>Dying Light 2 already looked phenomenal, boasting one of the best apocalyptic environments in recent years, but this latest round of changes takes things to an entirely new level. If you’re a PlayStation 5 Pro owner and you want to pick up a copy of Dying Light 2 when it goes live on PS Plus, I’d recommend doing so.</p>



<p>In recent news, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> had surpassed one million wishlists.

Originally set to follow on from Episode 1 and 2, its cancellation instead left the series dangling on a cliffhanger it never directly resolved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, on the occasion of Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, Valve has opened up about its development in a brand-new documentary that shows never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had complete a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new gameplay footage, writer Marc Laidlaw, founder Gabe Newell, and others also talk frankly about why it was never released, ultimately chalking it up to a lack of compelling new ideas and other reasons. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for Episode 3's cancellation has been the subject of much discussion over the years, not the least because Episode 2 ended on a grim cliffhanger. In an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">interview with IGN</a> shortly before Alyx's release, Valve level designer Dario Casali described it partly as an issue of scope screep. Laidlaw would later reveal the plot in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/half-life-2-episode-3-potential-plot-revealed-by-series-writer">story called "Epistle 3,"</a> featuring "Gertie Freemont" and "Alex Vaunt" — plays on Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/16/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary-1-53-41-screenshot-1731720807178.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Half-Life 2: Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and featured an Ice Gun. Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's possible to detect a lot of regret over the decision not to go through Episode 3. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?" Others talk about how Episode 3 probably could have been released in hindsight. Newell says, "We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve finally released Half-Life Alyx in 2020, sending <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-ending-explained">the story spinning off in a new direction</a>, but many fans remain wistful about Half-Life: Episode 3 (not to mention the long lost Half-Life 3). Now, 20 years after its release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-update-includes-developer-commentary-improved-graphics-and-a-2-hour-documentary">Valve is celebrating Half-Life 2</a> amid unconfirmed rumors that a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/leaks-deadlock-details" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new game is in the works</a>.

Now, 20 years later, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve has updated the landmark first-person shooter</a></span> and added new features, fixed old bugs, improved some visuals, added more options, and integrated the Steam Workshop into the classic game. And if you somehow don’t own <em>Half-Life 2</em>, well, it’s free to grab over the weekend. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest new addition to the 2004 shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as part of this update</a></span> is that <em>Lost Coast </em>(a small free side-game), <em>Episode 1, </em>and <em>Episode</em> <em>2</em> are now included as part of the full <em>Half-Life 2</em> package, so you can play all of these games within <em>Half-Life 2. </em></p><p>Speaking of <em>Lost Coast</em>, ever since Valve launched that small experience it has included developer commentary in its games. However, <em>Half-Life 2</em> lacked this feature, and that’s now been rectified with this update. Valve got the ol’ gang back together and recorded nearly 4 hours of commentary for the FPS. They also did a big documentary about <em>Half-Life 2</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253">spilled the beans on<em> Episode 3</em>'s development and cancellation, too</a></span>. </p><p>Another big feature included in this update, alongside improved gamepad controls and auto-aim, is the inclusion of Steam Workshop support. This will make it easier than ever to add new levels, guns, and mods to the extremely moddable PC game. There’s basically 20 years’ worth of mods out there that can now be migrated to the Workshop and made easier than ever to access. </p><p>Valve also updated a ton of smaller parts of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, including fixing old bugs, adding new graphical options for blood splatter, tweaking HDR settings, and more. Thankfully, if you don’t like these changes or have a mod that relies on the old version, Valve isn’t removing the OG <em>HL2 </em>from Steam. You can still download it and enjoy all your mods and old memories. </p><p>And best of all, Valve has made <em>Half-Life 2 </em>(which now includes all the <em>Episodes</em>) totally free for the next three days. You have until November 18 to grab <em>Half-Life 2</em> on Steam for $0 and you should. It’s one of the best games ever made, and the mods alone will keep you busy for the next 20 years.</p><p>If this seems familiar, that’s because back in November 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..">Valve did a similar big Anniversary update for the original<em> Half-Life</em></a></span> to celebrate 25 years of the franchise.

I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether or not the Indiana Jones license might eventually expire, Spencer said, "I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney, all up, on that.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is officially 20 years old this weekend, and to mark the occasion Valve has released a special anniversary update, bundling in a brand-new documentary, commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.
</p>
<p>
Valve's seminal shooter sequel, which charts the continuing adventures of bespectacled scientist Gordon Freeman and his deeply erotic love affair with a prising tool, released into the world on 16th November, 2004. It was immediately heralded as a classic of the genre, and Valve has done everything in its power not to release a numbered sequel since.
</p>
<p>
But now, 20 years on, Valve is in a celebratory mood, and - much as it did when the original Half-Life <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-gets-25th-anniversary-update-with-restored-content-new-maps-and-more">reached the big two-five last year</a> - it's released a special anniversary update introducing bonus material, previously separate bits of DLC, and a whole range of tweaks.

<figcaption>Or you can watch the Half-Life 2 documentary right here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
There is, for starters, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">new documentary</a> created by Secret Tape. "It's about a lot more than just the making of a game," explains Valve in its announcement. "Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there!" It's also unearthed a number of old presentations from across Half-Life 2's development, which it's <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th">shoved on its anniversary website</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, Valve has recorded a brand-new Half-Life 2 commentary for its latest update, and it's also permanently bundled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-one">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>, Episode Two, and Lost Coast - all previously available separately - together with the base game. That's alongside the addition of integrated Steam Workshop support, meaning everyone can browse and download player-created content from directly within the game.
</p>
<p>
But that's still not the end of it. Valve says every map has been looked over by its level designers to "fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog". It's also added new graphics settings meaning players can now choose between the original launch day blood and fire effects or those introduced in Half-Life 2's later episodes; it's updated gamepad controls and aim assistance, and it's also possible to play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode. Full patch notes, if you're curious, can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/5914976662778213744?l=english">found in Valve's announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>
All the above is now available as part of Half-Life 2's free 20th anniversary update on Steam. And if you don't already own a copy of Half-Life 2, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">free to download and keep on Valve's platform</a>, provided you pick it up before Monday, 18th November at 6pm in the UK.

The update includes new commentary, quality-of-life features, Steam Workshop support, and more. However, perhaps the most exciting thing to come out of this big <em>Half-Life 2</em> celebration is a new two-hour documentary from Valve detailing the development of the famous first-person shooter and its follow-up episodes. And yes, they talk about<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929"><em>Half-Life 2 Episode 3</em></a></span>, the game that never came to be despite millions of players begging Valve to make it. </p><p>Here’s the documentary if you haven’t watched it yet: </p><p>At the end of the doc, after talking about <em>Episode</em>s<em> 1 </em>and <em>2</em>, numerous people who worked on <em>Half-Life 2</em> and its episodes then began talking about  <em>Episode 3</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve was apparently working on an ice gun</a></span> that would let players create icy structures, pathways, and barricades during combat. Valve was also working on a blob-like monster that could split into multiple parts and go through vents and chain-link fences. However, this was all very early stuff, with <em>HL2 </em>engineer David Speyrer suggesting they were only about six months into development before plans changed. </p><p>“Even into <em>Episode 3</em>, I still don’t know what that would have been if we’d built it because it hadn’t been built,” said series writer Marc Laidlaw. </p><p>“That was the the feeling of excitement. Of something I can’t even imagine is going to happen with this team. I was not imposing a top-down, ‘This is what we must do to tell our very important tale,’ you know? It’s like, ‘Oh, we have new features, how do we use [them]? What kind of story can we do with these now?’” </p><p>According to Speyrer,<em> Episode 3 </em>was set in the Arctic—something that previously released concept art had confirmed—and he explained that the episode would focus on the missing Borealis ship referenced in both the <em>Portal</em> and <em>Half-Life</em> franchises.</p><h2 id="h164158"><a id=""></a><em>Episode 3 </em>was stopped after six months of development</h2><p>After six months of development, Speyrer says that <em>Episode 3</em> was still a “collection of playable levels in no particular order” and some story beats. He theorized that after another six months, they would have reached a “critical mass of mechanics” and at that point they could start really putting the game together for release in about a year or two, depending on “how ambitious” the team got.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t happen.<em>&nbsp;</em>In the documentary, <em>Half-Life</em> 2 devs explain that they had started to run out of things to do with the tools and features they had developed. At one point, they reference Arkane’s canceled Ravenholm episode, and how the team was struggling to do new and fun stuff with the<em> Half-Life 2</em> toolbox and engine. </p><p>“Arkane was building the Ravenholm game and even they were having trouble doing cool new stuff with this toolset, and if those guys can’t figure out a bunch of cool stuff to do with this, I think we’re running out of fuel,” said Laidlaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So everyone at Valve focused on finishing up <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and put <em>Half-Life Episode 3</em> on the back burner. And then, they felt like they had waited too long to come back and finish it.</p><p>“<em>Left 4 Dead</em> came out great,” said Speyrer. “But it took long enough—and this is  the tragic and almost comical thing about it—was it took long enough that then, by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, ‘Well, we missed it. It’s too late now, you know,’ and ‘We really need to make a new engine to continue the <em>Half-Life</em> series’ and all that.”</p><p>Now, Valve feels like that was a mistake, with Speyrer adding: “In hindsight [it was] wrong. You know, we could have definitely gone back and spent 2 years to make<em> Episode 3</em>.” </p><p>Toward the end of the documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell says that <em>Half-Life</em> <em>Alyx</em>’s ending was a somewhat “self-critical realization” that they needed to move forward with the story. </p><p>“I think that<em> Half-Life</em> represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven’t been [seen] previously, and I think that there are no shortage of those opportunities facing us as an industry right now,” is the final message in the doc from Newell.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
