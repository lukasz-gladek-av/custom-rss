            <p>Katsuhiro Harada, has announced his departure from Bandai Namco having worked on the Tekken series for 30 years.</p>
<p>"I'd like to share that I’ll be leaving Bandai Namco at the end of 2025," he wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>"With the Tekken series reaching its 30th anniversary - an important milestone for a project I've devoted much of my life to - I felt this was the most fitting moment to bring one chapter to a close. My roots lie in the days when I supported small local tournaments in Japanese arcades and in small halls and community centres overseas. I still remember carrying arcade cabinets by myself, encouraging people to 'Please try Tekken,' and directly facing the players right in front of me.</p>
<p>"The conversations and atmosphere we shared in those places became the core of who I am as a developer and game creator. Even as the times changed, those experiences have remained at the centre of my identity. And even after the tournament scene grew much larger, many of you continued to treat me like an old friend—challenging me at venues, inviting me out for drinks at bars. Those memories are also deeply precious to me.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"In recent years, I experienced the loss of several close friends in my personal life, and in my professional life I witnessed the retirement or passing of many senior colleagues whom I deeply respect. Those accumulated events made me reflect on the 'time I have left as a creator.' During that period, I sought advice from Ken Kutaragi - whom I respect as though he were another father - and received invaluable encouragement and guidance. His words quietly supported me in making this decision.</p><p>"Over the past four to five years, I've gradually handed over all of my responsibilities, as well as the stories and worldbuilding I oversaw, to the team, bringing me to the present day. Looking back, I was fortunate to work on an extraordinary variety of projects - VR titles (such as Summer Lesson), Pokkén Tournament, the SoulCalibur series, and many others, both inside and outside the company. Each project was full of new discoveries and learning, and every one of them became an irreplaceable experience for me.</p>
<p>"To everyone who has supported me, to communities around the world, and to all the colleagues who have walked alongside me for so many years, I offer my deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>"I'll share more about my next steps at a later date. Thank you very much for everything."</p>
<p>If you've been following Harada's outspoken comments over the past few years, this may not come as much of a surprise: the Tekken boss has made a few suggestions that his future may not rest within the walls of the Japanese publisher. First up, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-boss-says-he-just-wants-to-meet-more-people-as-fans-spot-linkedin-post-looking-for-work">he had a 'looking for work' tag on his LinkedIn page</a>, leading people to speculate that he was looking for the door in his current place of work.</p><p>Then, earlier this year, Harada spoke to Eurogamer about what a future without him would look like at Bandai Namco. "[I] feel over the past 30 years the gameplay has been polished and everything is in place, so it's much easier to continue with someone else," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">he told Connor Makar at Evo 2025</a>. "[Producer Michael Murray and I are] public figures for Tekken, sure. Compared to other people outside of the company - and this is [my] personal opinion not the official stance of Bandai Namco - it really depends [on the game]. There are other games out there - even fighting games - where there is no public figure to attach to it."</p>
<p>In the same interview, Murray also mentioned that he may have 'only one Tekken game left in him', so it feels like there could be a potential shift in the franchise as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> continues to grow and people start to think about what Tekken 9 (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-tag-tournament">Tekken Tag Tournament</a> 3) could look like.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been the source of a lot of controversy ever since launch. Alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of emergency patches</a> that had to be issued by the developer to appease irritated fans, there was also <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-reneges-on-its-controversial-dlc-rollout-but-is-it-too-little-too-late">a glut of controversy</a> surrounding the game and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-street-fighter-6-monetization-hurdle">its DLC methods</a>, which Harada - in typical fashion - was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/tekken-8-community-up-in-arms-over-plans-to-add-premium-currency-to-game-post-launch">very outspoken about</a>.</p>
<p>If you're concerned about the game losing its identity without the dynamic, public-facing duo, fret not: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> was the first game in the series for years that didn't include much input from Yoshinori Ono, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-figurehead-yoshinori-ono-leaves-capcom-after-nearly-30-years">who also left Capcom after 30 years with the company</a>. Street Fighter 6 has been a massive success, however, proving that there is life in these storied fighting games - even without the notable figureheads leading the charge with the crowd-facing side of development.</p>

<h2 id="h-budapest-major-playoff-predictions-are-set">Budapest Major Playoff Predictions Are Set</h2>



<p>The StarLadder Budapest Major will run from December 11 – 14 and will feature a single-elimination bracket featuring eight of the best Counter-Strike teams in the business. Leading up to the grand final, every match will be a typical best-of-three run, while the grand final itself is more meaty with a best-of-five requirement.</p>



<p>The confirmed matches to start the Budapest Major playoffs have been locked in:</p>



<p><strong>December 11</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Vitality vs. The MongolZ</li>

<p><strong>December 12</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>MOUZ vs. FaZe</li>



<li>FURIA vs. Natus Vincere</li>

<p>In terms of predictions, both Team Spirit and FURIA found a spot in the playoffs from flawless runs through the tournament’s third stage. They’re the favorites to scoop the trophy and the half-million-dollar prize. </p>



<p>In terms of the next stage, it’s easy to see the teams that are <strong>most likely </strong>going to make it through. It’</p>



<p>It’s a solid bet to assume that the semifinals will consist of Vitality, Team Spirit, FaZe, and FURIA. Looking even further, it’s easy to see a Team Spirit vs. FaZe Clan final, but only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Season 3 of Prime Video’s Fallout may be filming as soon as Summer 2026, should one executive’s hopes come true. Its second season is only weeks away and, with a third season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-already-announced-before-season-2-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already in production</a>, fans seemingly won’t have to wait long to return to the wasteland.</p>



<p>In the world of great adaptations, none came more of a surprise than Prime Video’s Fallout. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the series goes its own route yet keeps the action, heart, and comedy of the games. Released in 2024, the series was a smash hit with fans and critics. In fact, it was nominated for several Emmys, including Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. A second season <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was quickly greenlit</a>, now set in the vibrant New Vegas. With its release on December 17th, fans already can’t wait to see more. Fortunately, it seems filming is happening sooner than expected.</p>

<iframe title="Fallout Season 2 Exec Producers on New Vegas Factions, Deathclaws &amp; Mr. House" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Xes4q43OcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In an interview for IGN, series creator Jonathan Nolan and showrunner Geneva Robertson-Dworet chatted about Season 2. At the tail-end of the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/7Xes4q43OcI?si=PdsmZGkkQfDQUtRM&amp;t=1073">at around 17:50</a>, a question about Season 3 and possible locales was asked. In response, Jonathan Nolan stated,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“<strong>Well, I say with regards to production, we’re hoping to be shooting again next summer</strong>,” says Nolan in the interview. “<strong>We’ll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all</strong>. I’m excited that, though the scope of the show feels undiminished season on season, Geneva and Graham and our incredibly talented cast and crew were able to work quickly enough to get back on the air in a reasonable amount of time. I think what’s happened with television, in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season, is kind of an unfortunate trend. You don’t want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that <strong>we like to be back on the air as soon as we can</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite Nolan’s comment, it seems a Summer 2026 filming date is not yet set in stone, so nothing is confirmed just yet. A third season was greenlit back in March 2025 after filming wrapped on the second season and seemingly started production then. If it does film in Summer 2026, fans could see the third season release as soon as Spring 2027, if all goes well. It’s too soon to say where the story will go with it, but given how well the first season did, it seems it’ll be in good hands. Either way, the December 17th release for Prime Video’s Fallout can’t come soon enough.</p>







<p>What do you think of Fallout Season 3 possibly shooting in Summer 2026? Is it too soon? Where do you hope the show goes next?

GoChess Wizard comes with 32 sculpted game pieces made of high density ABS and vinyl. Each magnetic piece matches the medieval-inspired designs from the films and has intricate details. The white and black pieces are packaged in triangle slabs with custom slots to ensure they arrive in pristine condition. The pieces can also be stored in two Harry Potter-branded drawstring pouches.</p><p>The premium magnetic game board is only 0.34 inches thick and has built-in smart features. Each square has light LED lighting rings to display valid moves, make suggestions, and signal where to move the CPU pieces when playing solo. The chess bot has 32 difficulty levels and can be used as a personal trainer via the free companion app. Additionally, you can play online with friends and via matchmaking by connecting the companion app to Lichess or Chess.com.</p><p>The GoChess Wizard also comes with a smartphone/tablet stand and a USB-C charging cable. The board runs for 5-10 hours on a full charge and takes two hours to recharge.</p><p>There are two versions of the GoChess Wizard. The Mini comes with a 13.1 x 13.1-inch board and 1.37-inch squares. The GoChess Wizard Lite is a full tournament-size board--19 x 19 inches and 1.88-inch squares--but otherwise these sets are the same.</p><p>As of December 7, only the GoChess Wizard Mini is in stock with a $300 (was $380) holiday launch deal from Particula and Amazon.

This Bluetooth-enabled 3 x 3 cube has LED lights and positional tracking that registers each rotation and turn in the app. The app has an academy that walks you through the process of solving the cube for the first time. From there, you compete against players around the world, play minigames and puzzles, and track your progress with your solves to see where you can improve.</p><p>The GoCube's app integration is superb and the cube itself is solid. This is a magnetic cube, though it doesn't turn anywhere close to as fast as high-end speed cubes. The pillowed design also makes it feel different from traditional cubes.</p><p>For beginners and anyone who wants as change of pace by playing minigames and solving puzzles, the GoCube Edge is fantastic. I learned how to solve a 3 x 3 cube using the GoCube Edge in 2024. Today, I can solve every square cube up to 13 x 13. I still return to the GoCube Edge to practice and play minigames, because the smart cube features are so good.</p><p>There's also a 2 x 2 version of the GoCube for $35 (was $60). You can bundle the two models together for $73 (was $133). The GoCube comes with a carrying pouch, charging stand, and USB charging cable.</p><ul><li><strong>GoCube Edge 3 x 3 Smart Cube -- $40 (<del>$73</del>)</strong><ul><li><a

A seven-step tutorial teaches newcomers how to solve a Rubik's Cube for the first time.</p><ul><li><strong>Rubik's Connected 3 x 3 Smart Cube -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Particula+Tech%27s+Smart+Chessboard%2C+Including+New+Harry+Potter+Wizard%27s+Chess&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6536743&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fparticula-tech.com%2Fproducts%2Frubik-s-connected%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fparticula-tech-holiday-sale-gochess-wizard-smart-chess-harry-potter-edition%2F1100-6536743%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Particula</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Original-Connected-Beginner-Intelligent-Rechargeable/dp/B08JYVKJTG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Amazon</a></li></ul></li><li><strong>Rubik's Connected 2-Pack -- $70 (<del>$120</del>)</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Particula+Tech%27s+Smart+Chessboard%2C+Including+New+Harry+Potter+Wizard%27s+Chess&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-07+17%3A38%3A54&amp;fnarticle_id=6536743&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fredirect.viglink.com%3Fkey%3Dfbff19622bfc4d759c94ca50d964e98d%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fparticula-tech.com%2Fproducts%2Frubiks-connected-bogo-deal%26cuid%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fparticula-tech-holiday-sale-gochess-wizard-smart-chess-harry-potter-edition%2F1100-6536743%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Buy at Particula</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>                      </div>   </div><div title="6536743 - Particula GoDice" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="5205" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536743 - Particula GoDice" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">GoDice Smart Dice Sets</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0B9Y48CPT,B0D79F3DJV,B09TL9SCTZ,B09TWP1HLQ,B0BDRHCMP5,B0BKQ5197J&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">2-Pack - $30 (was $50) / 6-Pack - $60 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Particula's smart dice have Bluetooth connectivity and 3D sensors that register rolls in a free companion app for iPad and Android. tablets.

<p>Spear Fishing, as the name hints, is a fishing-based <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forge-codes-december-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> simulation. Your only job is to hunt down the rarest sea creatures in the water areas using Harpoons, Baits, Fish Basket, and Spear Guns. To kill Mythic, Legendary, and even Epic creatures, in some cases, you’ll need the finest tools. However, one must spend a large number of Coins and Gems to purchase them. This is when the active Spear Fishing codes come into action, as they can be redeemed for free Gems and Coins. This guide features all active codes, the code redemption process, tips for investing the free resources, and more.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-reward-code-pay2win/</link>
            <guid>1375732</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, has trolled the Escape from Tarkov community with a code appropriately named ‘PAY2WIN’. On social media, the prolific developer posted an image featuring some of the most valuable items in Escape from Tarkov, announcing that a code would drop soon, suggesting that those very items would be obtainable.</p>



<p>When the code dropped, it was with a tongue-in-cheek reference: ‘PAY2WIN’. However, upon redeeming the code, players quickly learned that they’d been hilariously duped.</p>







<h2 id="h-pay2win-was-a-joke-all-along">PAY2WIN Was a Joke All Along</h2>



<p>The code that Nikita Buyanov was teasing led users to believe they’d be getting <strong>stacks</strong> of stuff in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>This image included an FLIR optic, an Altyn helmet, stacks of Bitcoins, and a THICC case, amongst other things. However, shortly after, Nikita revealed the code, PAY2WIN, and users quickly set about redeeming it in the game’s launcher.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The bundle was ultimately unveiled as one of the worst stacks of items you’d ever hope to get in Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This includes some of the most useless weapons, such as the TOZ and the Blicky, one of the smallest backpacks, a pack of croutons, a fuze (but no grenade), and a replica helmet. You literally couldn’t have asked for a worse bundle.</p>



<p>It’s not often that the Escape from Tarkov developers crack a joke like this, but they’ve admittedly given away quite a lot of stuff recently with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-escape-from-tarkov-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more reward codes</a>.</p>



<p>It’s often pointed out that ‘free is free’, but perhaps this bundle isn’t even worth anything!</p>







<p>Did you redeem the code in Escape from Tarkov? Let us know if you’re happy with your little Blicky on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

        <p>Nintendo Switch 2 took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, too.</p>

            <p>The European Top 20 didn't welcome any new entries last week, but Black Friday week saw a boost in sales nonetheless thanks in no small part to Sony, which was seemingly the MVP of Black Friday, hoovering up 62 percent of all console sales in the UK over the week.</p>
<p>The data – supplied by NielsenIQ and GSD, and published by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> – showed that console sales were much stronger this holiday period, with revenue up 14 per cent, and unit sales up 7 percent.</p>

<p>And while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> took a sizeable 23 percent chunk of all hardware sales, it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> that had its best week outside of launch. Xbox Series S and X accounted for just 10 percent of all console sales, possibly because Xbox consoles were discounted by around 8 percent on the typical price, but PS5 Slim consoles were down 21-34 percent depending upon the model.</p>
<p>Accessory sales, however, were down 17 percent when compared to the same period last year, as did joypad  and headset sales, which tumbled by 27 and 28 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>And while both the Meta Quest 3 and the PS5 VR headsets enjoyed their best weeks of the year, overall, VR headset sales dropped by around 7 percent, too.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we reported that former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida suggested that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-admits-it-would-be-difficult-for-japanese-developers-to-make-games-in-the-same-way-mihoyo-does">Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China</a>, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p>

            <p>UK developer Three Fields Entertainment - the studio behind the likes of Dangerous Golf and Dangerous Driving - says it has been "forced" into placing its "entire team on notice of redundancy" because publisher THQ Nordic has shown no "enthusiasm or financial support to continue development" of its latest title, Wreckreation.</p>
<p>Three Fields Entertainment <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dangerous-driving-devs-wreckreation-is-an-open-world-racer-with-a-diy-focus">unveiled Wreckreation back in 2022</a>. A custom-content-focused open-world racer, it released on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in October this year. Now, however, in a heartfelt message posted to X/Twitter, CEO Fiona Sperry said that it was "a heartbreaking moment for all of us", but hoped that by going public, "someone out there might also see the potential" in Wreckreation.</p>

<p>"Since the launch of Wreckreation, our small studio has worked incredibly hard – with heart and dedication – to update the game, listen to our community, and deliver the fixes and features players asked for. I could not be prouder of the people I’ve worked alongside or the passion they’ve poured into this project," Sperry wrote.</p>
<p>"But the reality we now face is stark. As an independent studio, we will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future.</p> <div>

<p>"We have had to self-fund most of this year and all of the post-launch content. Without the enthusiasm or financial support from our publisher to continue development, we simply cannot sustain the studio in its current form. Making this decision has been unbelievably painful."</p>
<p>Because of claims it has had to self-fund, Sperry added that the studio cannot be sustained and it "will not see revenue from game sales for the foreseeable future," (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/wreckreation-developer-puts-its-entire-staff-on-notice-as-publisher-thq-nordic-abandons-it-we-simply-cannot-sustain-the-studio-in-its-current-form/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>

            <p>Iam8bit is suing Skybound Games for £2.9 million ($4 million), alleging breach of contract, fraudulent expenses, theft of designs, and claiming that Skybound used iam8bit's trade secrets to cut it out of a Stray deal.</p>
<p>Iam8bit – which entered into a partnership with Robert Kirkman's game studio, Skybound, in 2021 – alleges Skybound failed to provide its contractually obligated monthly reports, and "padded its expenses with millions of dollars in fake line items".</p>

<p>After Skybound was reportedly unable to provide evidence of the line items to a third-party auditor, 8bit has now filed a breach-of-contract complaint with the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p>
<p>In the complaint seen by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/iam8bit-is-suing-skybound-game-studios-alleging-fraud-and-theft-of-designs-000822886.html">Engadget</a>, iam8bit similarly claims that after designing promotional materials for the launch of Stray, Skybound used iam8bit's materials to secure its own deal for the Nintendo Switch port, intentionally cutting the latter out while using "almost exact copies" of 8bit's marketing materials.</p>
<p>Iam8bit also claims Skybound used confidential information about 8bit's royalty split with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> to cut it out of the deal.</p>
<p>In all, iam8bit is suing for breach of contract, fraud, conversion, unjust enrichment, and misappropriation. It's seeking real and punitive damages totalling $4 million. Neither company has publicly commented on the lawsuit.</p>

Snow might be settling in where you are, temperature's dropping — or perhaps you're lucky to be reading from somewherein the southern hemisphere. But there's one thing that remains the same wherever you're reading from; it's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/eshop-selects">eShop Selects</a> time once again!</p>
<p>Here we are once again, looking back at the last month of excellent releases. And it was a busy one in Switch 2 land, with two major Nintendo releases in Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment and Kirby Air Riders both launching. Did we get time to play much else?</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wgrkxv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>Of <em>course</em> we did — and we've got a handful of the best hidden gems here from November 2025. Same rules as always apply: Our writers and contributors vote for their top three eShop games from November 2025 from titles we've reviewed of reviews. The three games with the highest scores will make the podium.</p>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194301 @ 1765187250 -->
<h3>Honourable mentions</h3>
<p>Admittedly, the eShop was a bit quieter than previous months this year, so we have a limited selection. Looking at just 8/10s, so the best of the best, 5 games were in contention for the three spots. But that just means all five of these are absolutely worth your time.</p>
<p>Here's what just missed out, with the top three to follow...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/morsels">8/10</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/videoverse">Videoverse</a> (NS1) | Review: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/videoverse">8/10</a></li>
</ul>
<div><div><h2 data-toc="3 to 1" id="top-3">3. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">3rd Place - Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Well wasn't this a nice surprise? The first of Lara's reboot series came to Switch and Switch 2 on the eShop in November, and it's a pretty impressive port, if we do say so ourselves!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> is a refreshing reminder of the talent at Crystal Dynamics, a studio that has been hit by layoffs over the years. While Mouse Mode and graphical fidelity hold this back from being the definitive way to play, it's still a great way to experience Lara's origins. The gameplay is as rock-solid as ever, and the visual design and world is incredible.</p>
<p>We recommend the Switch 2 version wholeheartedly, and scored it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">an 8/10 in our review</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194042 @ 1765187250 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">2. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">2nd Place - Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road (Switch 1 &amp; 2)</a></h2>
<p>Goodness, it's like Level-5 never let off the gas. After wowing us with Fantasy Life i earlier this year (an eShop Selects winner, too!), the long-awaited <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> <em>finally</em> launched in November after years of delays and name changes. And, guess what? It's excellent.</p>
<p>Packed from goal-to-goal, Victory Road is a game that feels like you could play it forever. Heck, you don't even have to engage with everything, because the central soccer RPG loop is so darn good that you might not want to do anything else. It's a fabulous return for the series, and has us ever hopeful for that remake.</p>
<p>It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">another 8/10 in our books</a>, meaning that Inazuma Eleven is worth the wait; the Switch 2 version is excellent, too.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/switch-eshop/related-articles:194063 @ 1765184723 -->
</div><div><h2 data-toc="skip">1. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">1st Place - Demonschool (Switch 1)</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/demonschool">Demonschool</a> might have been late to class — it was delayed multiple times prior to its release last month — but here's another game that was absolutely worth the wait. So worth it, in fact, that it <em>just</em> sneaked into the top spot to become month's eShop Selects winner.</p>
<p>Twisting tactical RPG gameplay into a new form, and blending it with daily school life and demon hunting, Demonschool is almost too cool for school. It's bloody, messy, and street smart, full of quips and humour and dashes of Italian horror-inspired imagery. We can't get enough of that unique grid-based action, either.</p>
<p>Rounding out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/demonschool">our set of 8/10s</a>, Demonschool earns top marks from us, and we hope you consider enrolling.</p>

<p><em>Do you agree with our ranking? Tell us about your favourite eShop releases of last month by voting in our poll and sharing your thoughts in the comments.</em></p>

<p><strong>How we decide our eShop Selects top three:</strong> As we reach the end of every month, the Nintendo Life staff vote on their favourite titles from a list of games selected by the editorial team. To qualify for this list, these games must have been released as a digital-only Nintendo Switch eShop title in that particular month, and must have been reviewed on Nintendo Life; we select the qualifying games based on their review scores.</p>
<p>Staff are then asked to vote for three games that they think deserve to sit right at the very top of that list; first choice gets three points, second choice gets two points, and third choice gets one point. These votes are then tallied to create a top-three list, with the overall winner taking that month's top prize.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendo-life-eshop-selects-november-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[A love letter to glory days of iPhone gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/839050/simogo-legacy-collection-review-switch-steam</link>
            <guid>1375570</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It may be hard to believe now, but the App Store was once a thriving place for inventive indie games. The ubiquity of the iPhone coupled with the relative ease of development for the platform meant that smaller studios were able to get their games in front of huge audiences, leading to a great time of experimentation that unfortunately didn’t last. But if you want to relive those better days, Simogo’s new collection is just the thing.</p><p>You might recognize the name Simogo from more recent titles, like the noir mystery <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24157530/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-switch-steam"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a> or the vibrant interactive pop album <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/621706/sayonara-wild-hearts-ps5-review"><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em></a>. Before that, though, the studio was a creative force in mobile. The <em>Simogo Legacy Collection</em>, as it’s called, collects seven games from this period, plus a companion app, which were all developed over a five-year span between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>The most striking thing about the collection is the sheer range of games. It’s hard to believe they were all made by the same team. Some of the early titles, like the arcade game <em>Kosmo Spin</em> and the charming automatic platformer <em>Bumpy Road</em>, feel like slightly more stylish takes on popular mobile genres. But from there, you can see the studio getting bolder and more confident. <em>Beat Sneak Bandit</em> is a rhythm action game, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/21/4013456/year-walk-iphone-ipad-vision-quest-game"><em>Year Walk</em></a> is an adventure about going on a folklore-inspired vision quest. (Also in the collection is the <em>Year Walk</em> companion app, which details the strange creatures you’ll encounter in the game).</p><p>Things get weirder from there: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4844472/device-6-iphone-ipad-report"><em>Device 6</em></a> is a combination of game and mystery novel; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7162959/the-sailors-dream"><em>The Sailor’s Dream</em></a> is a mixed-media storytelling experiment; and rounding out the bunch is the most traditional title, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9386121/spl-t-iphone-puzzle-game"><em>SPL-T</em></a>, a puzzle game that burrows into your brain like <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>If there’s any connective tissue between these disparate releases, it’s an incredible sense of style and clear sense of purpose. The games may all be very different, but each has a specific focus and vision. You can tell each was made with care in every element, from the visuals to the game design to the music.</p><p>The same goes for the collection itself. I played the game on the Switch 2 (it’s also on Steam and the original Switch) and it re-creates the mobile experience by essentially turning your device into a giant smartphone, complete with a basic menu where the games all appear as app icons. There are a whole bunch of extras to dig into, including playable prototypes of some of the games and other bonus materials, like a podcast series that was released as a companion to <em>The Sailor’s Dream</em>. Don’t sleep on the music player; there are some amazing tracks here.</p><p>The <em>Simogo Legacy Collection</em> isn’t just a well-crafted collection of some great games; it’s an important act of preservation. You can still find them in the App Store right now, but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/23/23038870/apple-app-store-widely-remove-outdated-apps-developers">Apple’s digital store can be hostile to older games</a>, so this release ensures the likes of <em>Year Walk</em> and <em>Device 6</em> can continue on through other platforms. It’s also a great reminder of how vibrant those early days were and how the best stuff stands the test of time.</p><p><sub><em>The </em>Simogo Legacy Collection<em> is available now on Steam and the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/839050/simogo-legacy-collection-review-switch-steam]]></content:encoded>

While Ubisoft's new feudal Japan outing has been mostly well-received by critics on Nintendo's new hybrid platform, it seems the experience hasn't been quite as enjoyable for some players.</p>
<p>Multiple message board posts and social media threads online are filled with player reports about the game randomly crashing. Some players have even experienced repeated crashes, forcing them to completely halt their play sessions until Ubisoft deploys a patch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ZZTIyng2dUk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZZTIyng2dUk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZZTIyng2dUk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed746e4brzostm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>The following comments in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pcp97o/assassins_creed_shadows_has_a_bad_crashing/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-supposedly-unplayable-for-some-players-after-repeated-crashes">thread on the Switch 2 subreddit</a> highlights just how much of a problem this has become for some players:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>DrLukeyy</strong> - "I also had 4 crashes back to back when trying to complete that add a building mission. Probably gonna wait for a patch"</p>
<p><strong>dennishylau</strong> - "I’m around Senri Hills now, and the crash is so frequent it is unplayable. Playing on dock and using internal storage."</p>
<p><strong>ApprehensiveLie8032</strong> - "My game crashed 10 times in 20 minutes, I couldn't play. And the worst part is we paid for it and there's nothing we can do; Ubisoft doesn't care."</p>
<p><strong>Safe-Reputation-2737</strong> - "My game crashes no joke every 5 minutes it’s unplayable"</p>
<p><strong>EmotionAwkward411</strong><strong>3</strong> - "Yes I confirm it is difficult to play it correctly the game keeps cutting 5 crashes in 30 minutes. I'm waiting for an update, it's impossible to play it correctly"</p>
<p><strong>stevenandthecg</strong> - "For me it is unplayable, it crashes every 2 minutes. Support is gaslighting me saying that it is an issue with my console. Never had any issue with any other game. I tried everything, I am kind of desperate..."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is seemingly no clear solution or fix to stop these game crashes, but it hasn't stopped players sharing their own ideas.</p>
<p>Some suggest playing the title exclusively in docked mode, making sure the game is installed on Switch 2's internal storage, changing the system resolution, turning off HDR, disabling various other options, and even reinstalling the game...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Central</strong> - "Im playing Assassin's Creed Shadows on handheld &amp; I haven't had a crash yet &amp; the game is still on the internal hard drive of the Switch 2."</p>
<p><strong>andrsperdomo</strong> - "I installed it directly on the console and the problem does not go away."</p>

<p>Some users here on Nintendo Life have also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">reported encountering crashes</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Critics have noted <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-impresses-in-handheld-play">issues with frame-pacing</a>, and recommend handheld mode for the best experience, but there seems to be fewer reports about game crashes during the review phase. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/03/assassins-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2-review/">TheSixthAxis</a> was one site that directly acknowledged this "underlying issue" – referencing "a series of crashes" not long into the adventure, but "no clear trigger". <a href="https://www.nintendoworldreport.com/review/73520/assassins-creed-shadows-first-impressions-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo World Report</a> also mentioned the "occasional" software crash.</p>
<p>In our own review here on Nintendo Life, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">we admitted Assassin's Creed Shadows wasn't the perfect port</a>, but still felt it was a colossal achievement on Nintendo's new system.</p>
<p>So, when might we see a patch for this problem? As highlighted in the Reddit thread above, the <a href="https://youtu.be/KYaby1Yb1Ck">YouTube channel 'What's It Like?'</a> (which also "experienced several crashes" during its review of the game) says it reached out to Ubisoft's support and there's supposedly a patch planned for mid-December, which will apparently address "some" technical issues with the Switch 2 version. And with so many player reports now, Ubisoft has hopefully got the message.</p>
