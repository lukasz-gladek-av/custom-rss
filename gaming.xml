<p>After announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-makes-surprise-premier-season-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the end of Counter-Strike 2 Premier Season 1 last week</a>, Valve has officially started Season 2. Season 2 will not last nearly as long as Season 1, but CS2 players will have to contend with the highly anticipated map pool changes and the tweaks to rifles.</p>



<p>Get your buddies and get into the Premier queue, the newest season of Counter-Strike 2 is now live.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-premier-season-2-patch-notes">CS2 Premier Season 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>Now that CS2 Premier Season 2 has begun, the active duty map pool will introduce Train and sub out Vertigo. Train made its CS2 debut and its anticipated return to Counter-Strike back in November, with a number of layout changes, a fresh coat of paint, and even some satisfying rain effects. Vertigo had become increasingly unpopular amongst pro players, though because it’s so new there have been no selections of Train at top tier tournaments yet.</p>



<p>Two major changes to rifles are now live as well. The M4A4 has received a price reduction, dropping down to the $2900 price point that its counterpart the M4A1-S has. Both M4s have been popular amongst players, with some preferring the controlled spray of the silenced M4A1-S, while other prefer the damage and larger magazine of the M4A4. For now, cost will no longer weigh be a decider. The FAMAS now only costs $1,950, and it received an accuracy improvement.</p>



<p>Additionally, the AUG and the SG received an adjusted scope dot to “be more useable at range,” while the MP9, the MP5-SF, and the MP7 all received reduced crouching accuracy, making them less effective for long-range duels. The <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/news/updates#:~:text=UPDATES-,JANUARY%2028%2C%202025,-Counter%2DStrike%202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full patch notes</a> also include some minor changes to the UI and Train.</p>



<p>As for the Premier season itself, players that earned a CS Rating while playing in Season 1 will receive a commemorative with detailed season stats. To be eligible for a medal in Season 2, players will need to refresh their CS Rating by winning 10 Premier matches. Season 2 will end at the conclusion of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-blast-tv-austin-cs2-major-dates-times-and-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST.tv Austin CS2 Major</a>.</p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-arc-abilities-revealed-for-episode-heresy/1100-6528871/" data-ref-id="1100-6528871">Destiny 2: Heresy</a> arrives early next month, players will find themselves back on the Dreadnaught, the Hive ship that's been left adrift since The Taken King expansion. And while players have fought inside the ship before, the Dreadnaught has undergone some changes since its last appearance. </p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," said Nikko Stevens--Destiny 2's Narrative Architect--during a feature <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on PlayStation's official site</a>. "The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>There are plenty of Taken enemies waiting for players on the Dreadnaught, and the goal of the mission is to push back against the corruption that has largely overtaken the ship. That's why this mission will introduce a new activity called The Nether. In this task, Players will be dispatched to disable the ship's internal weapons and prevent the Taken corruption from spreading. Both the players and their enemies can also be positively or negatively affected by boons which will shake up the balance of power between them.</p><p>Destiny 2: Heresy will launch on February 4 alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-is-getting-star-wars-gear-in-latest-crossover-collaboration/1100-6529080/" data-ref-id="1100-6529080">a collaboration with Star Wars</a> that introduce gear, armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are inspired by some of the Empire's fiercest warriors including the Death Troopers and the Imperial Guards.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/narrative-designer-job-description-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to '<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What I Do</a>', Aftermath's regular feature showcasing just what it is, exactly, that individuals in the video game business do every day.</p><p>We've recently spoken with<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-executive-producer-job-description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Executive Producers</a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/operations-manager-hades-supergiant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Operations Managers</a> and even<a href="https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> someone responsible for putting a big fancy showcase demo together</a>. Today, we're chatting with Fran Warner, who is a narrative designer, a job that involves writing but also so much more.</p><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Hey Fran! Tell us a little about yourself</em></strong><em>!</em></p><p><strong>Fran Warner</strong>: My name is Fran Warner. I grew up in New Jersey, moved to Los Angeles to work in the film industry for a bunch of years, then met a girl from Adelaide and moved to Australia. I'm a big fan of movies, sports, very loud rock music, cooking, short narrative-driven games with interesting mechanics, and the Oxford comma.</p><p><strong><em>LP: What's your journey through the video game business looked like?</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>Where did you get your start?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: My first brush with video games was when I was very small and had an Atari 2600. I decided for a while that I wanted to make games and used to design them on paper before I knew that was a job. Then I got older and fell in love with movies, got a couple of degrees in film and television, and headed to Los Angeles to become a screenwriter. I did lots of work in various aspects of film production, and a lot of that served me well in my games career.&nbsp;</p><p>I left LA for Adelaide, Australia to be with my future wife, and discovered that the film industry here (while currently thriving!) didn't have a lot of opportunity for me. I found work as a games producer for a tiny startup who had their offices in a vacant storefront in a shopping mall. This company was called Mighty Kingdom. We didn't have a narrative department when I joined, but we still had the need for narrative content in our games. As producer, I started doing the narrative on the games I worked on. When we finally did start a narrative department, the company was kind enough to let me switch disciplines. Ten years and three office moves later, I'm still with MK.</p><p>Currently, I oversee the narrative design for two mobile games we make with our partner East Side Games, <em>Star Trek Lower Decks: The Badgey Directive</em> and <em>Power Rangers Mighty Force</em>. For these games, our narrative designers outline and write cutscene scripts, build the cinematics in our proprietary Unity-based engine, select prizes for players to earn in the games, and contribute to marketing.</p><p><strong><em>LP: OK, so you're a narrative designer, not a writer. Slightly confusing. What does the job involve, exactly?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: I think there are a lot of misconceptions about what narrative design is, and I think that's because different kinds of games require different skillsets from a narrative designer. Generally, I see narrative design as a subset of game design. We provide a story arc, characters, and an emotional hook that work in lockstep with fun, challenging gameplay to keep players coming back for more. Narrative is often brought in later in the process, but ideally the narrative for a game is built hand-in-hand with the overall game design from concept all the way through to shipment. This is so mechanics and gameplay are thematically aligned with the worldbuilding and the stories being told. Or, to be all academic about it, so that we avoid ludonarrative dissonance.</p><p>As for my role as the narrative lead, it's a combination of administrative and creative duties. I find my experience as a producer invaluable in the role. I contribute creatively to our games, but I also manage the other narrative designers, set standards and best practices for our department, maintain a style guide, handle the content approval process with our IP licensors, participate in scoping for pitches, and assist in resource allocation.</p><p><strong><em>LP: You said there are some misconceptions surrounding the job. What are some of the worst you've seen?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: I think there are misconceptions about narrative design mostly because we're a very small discipline. Many studios don't employ anyone in the role, and it's hard to understand the breadth of what a talented narrative designer can do for you until you have one. I think the largest misconception is that we're just writers - of dialogue, of flavor text, of UI. On big AAA games with a large narrative design team, there can be devs who are mostly just writers. But we're also designers, and we often contribute to creating the central conceit of a game, worldbuilding, environmental storytelling, character creation, marketing, level design, and monitoring player sentiment so that we can lean in to what players love about our games.</p><p><strong><em>LP: What is it you love most about coming to work every day and doing what you do?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: There are two things I love most about the job. One is making players laugh. The other is hearing from players who love what we do. <em>Star Trek</em> fans are notoriously fickle, and I love sharing positive comments with the team and being reminded that we don't operate in a vacuum - we're responsible for creating stories that players can find worthy of their time, money, and fandom.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Given writing is one of the jobs already within the crosshairs of AI proponents, what are your feelings about generative AI and its potential to threaten the careers of anyone whose job includes the words "art" or "writing"?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: I tend to think that the AI debate is a more nuanced discussion than the one being played out at the moment, but that's probably true of most things. I am absolutely opposed to any use of generative AI to create visual art, writing, or any other creative product that would otherwise be made by a human artist. For one thing, art is made by artists with thoughts, emotions, memories, and senses that can't be replicated by AI, as is clear to anyone who has consumed AI content. For another, to any extent AI is able to produce a usable piece of content, it can do so only by training itself on the work of real artists, who have not given permission and are not compensated.</p><p>I think there is a use case for AI to assist in non-creative tasks, especially as it concerns engineering, game economies, and the like. But any such case still has to reckon with both the environmental impact of AI and the temptation to expand its use beyond these parameters.</p><p>TL;DR, AI is bad for games.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Have you got any advice for anyone considering a similar career path?</em></strong></p><p><strong>FW</strong>: My general advice is the same as it would be for any discipline. Make your own game, or if you don't have the skills to be a solo dev, collaborate with others to make your own game. It's the best way to showcase your talent exactly how you want to, and it's a proof of concept to potential employers. It shows that you are a game dev, not an aspiring game dev.&nbsp;</p><p>For narrative designers specifically, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to make sure you have a strong command of written English (or whatever language you speak). There are so many games that ship basic spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and grammar errors and it just takes you right out of the game. I've done it too! You will rarely if ever have the benefit of an editor when working on a game, so you need to be on point.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-phoenix-labs-layoffs-studio-closure-far-cry-dauntless"><h3>Another Big Day For Layoffs In Another Big Year For Layoffs</h3></a><p>Ubisoft is closing its third studio in two months, and Phoenix Labs is bidding farewell to "the majority" of its workforce</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/escape-room-first-time"><h3>My First Escape Room Was Pretty Cool</h3></a><p>Please tell me everything about how you design them</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Off's memorable characters and retro-inspired visual style were a major influence on game designer Toby Fox, the creator of Undertale and Deltarune, and this new edition brings the inspiration full circle with Fox contributing new tracks to Off's soundtrack.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-world-lego-set-is-discounted-at-amazon-but-probably-not-for-long/1100-6525283/">Super Mario World Lego Set Is Discounted At Amazon, But Probably Not For Long</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-festival-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-gets-rare-discount/1100-6528970/">Fortnite Festival Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller Gets Rare Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-discounted-on-launch-day/1100-6524388/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Is Discounted On Launch Day</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-chance-to-grab-3-movies-on-4k-blu-ray-for-only-33-at-amazon/1100-6528683/">Last Chance To Grab 3 Movies On 4K Blu-Ray For Only $33 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-ps5-reprint-restocked-at-amazon/1100-6528630/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Physical Edition Gets PS5 Reprint - Snag It While You Can</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-2500-piece-legend-of-zelda-lego-set-is-now-available-at-amazon/1100-6523747/">The 2,500-Piece Legend Of Zelda Lego Set Is Now Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup/1100-6528603/">Mario Kart Lego Sets Are Available Now - Check Out All Six In The Launch Lineup</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-lego-sets-launch-at-major-retailers-including-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6528629/">Fortnite Lego Sets Launch At Major Retailers, Including Amazon And Walmart</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">From dry deserts, bustling forests, blazing volcanos to even frozen tundra, a variety of environments appear throughout the Monster Hunter series, each with its own unique ecosystem created by a diverse cast of monsters. The experience of adventuring through an unknown world, walking across its lands as you hunt, is one of the great joys when playing Monster Hunter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This holds true for Monster Hunter Wilds, the newest game in the franchise. After the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest, hunters will take their next step into the harsh lands of the Oilwell Basin, a place covered in flames and oilsilt. Once there, they'll find their path blocked by dripping, viscous oil and all-blazing magma. While it may seem to be a sterile, lifeless place, one can see the sluggish movements of small creatures wriggling around in the mire. And here and there in the Oilwell Basin sits what looks like the remains of some ancient civilization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yuya Tokuda, director of both Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter Wilds, describes the Oilwell Basin to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"During the Fallow, the Oilwell Basin is a place filled with mud and oil. When the Inclemency known as the Firespring comes, it burns away that oilsilt, and at times during the Plenty the burned-away oil and soot vanishes, revealing the minerals, microorganisms and the original color of the manmade artifacts hidden underneath," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Down in the Muck</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What kind of concept did the development team have in mind when constructing the Oilwell Basin? We ask Kaname Fujioka, director of the first Monster Hunter as well as executive director and art director for Wilds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had two horizontally broad locales in the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest, so we decided to make the Oilwell Basin a vertically connected place,” he says. “The environment there changes slightly when you travel between the top, middle and bottom strata. Sunlight reaches the top strata, where oil gathers like mud, and the lower you go, the hotter the place becomes, with lava and other substances."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda continues: "From the middle to bottom strata, you'll find creatures not unlike aquatic life that may remind you of the deep seas or underwater volcanoes. In World, we created the ecosystem of the Coral Highlands using the idea of what it would look like if aquatic creatures lived on the surface, and we've used the knowledge we gained in the process to create the Oilwell Basin's creatures and ecosystem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a blazing and barren wasteland that becomes filled with vitality once the Plenty comes. Fujioka says he wants players to enjoy this contrast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"During the Fallow and Inclemency, smoke comes out of everywhere in the Oilwell Basin like it's some sort of volcano or hot spring,” he explains. “But during the Plenty, it takes on a clear, marine-like tone as we just mentioned. Look closely at the environmental biology and you'll find that it's even a region inhabited by the kinds of creatures you'd expect to find on the ocean bed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Oilwell Basin's environment is made in a way that differentiates it from other locales. While it may look lifeless when covered in oilsilt, not only do shellfish like shrimp and crabs live under it, so do small monsters that provide raw meat. Large monsters eat small monsters, small monsters filter out and consume microorganisms from the environment and oilsilt, and microorganisms derive energy from the heat of the earth. If the Windward Plains and Scarlet Forest are ecosystems built upon sunlight and vegetation, the Oilwell Basin is an environment belonging to creatures that live by way of geothermal energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The large monsters that live in the Oilwell Basin are distinct from those found in other locales as well. One such monster is Rompopolo, a globular and noxious creature with a mouth resembling thin needles. What ideas could have led the developers to Rompopolo's bizarre design? Fujioka explains</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We designed it as a tricky monster that lives in swamps and creates chaos for players by using its stored up toxic gas,” he says. “The idea of a mad scientist came up often when we were trying to depict this trickiness. We were inspired by this concept when giving it a slightly chemical purple color and glowing red eyes. The equipment you can craft from it is surprisingly cute, though. So is its Palico equipment." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Tokuda categorizes the Rompopolo Palico equipment as "amusing,” I could see exactly what they both meant when I got to play with it myself. I hope you'll craft the equipment and check it out, too.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Flames of Ajarakan</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new monster appearing in the Oilwell Basin is Ajarakan, a monster that feels like a massive gorilla enveloped in flames. That said, unlike the Scarlet Forest's Congalala, it seems to have a slimmer sort of silhouette.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new monster appearing in the Oilwell Basin is Ajarakan, a monster that feels like a massive gorilla enveloped in flames. That said, unlike the Scarlet Forest's Congalala, it seems to have a slimmer sort of silhouette.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we saw many scenes of Rompopolo and Ajarakan fighting for turf in <a href="https://youtu.be/yp-28fhhOs4?feature=shared&amp;t=193" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this video</u></a>, we actually see it grab Rompopolo's body with both arms to give it a bear hug. Its martial arts-inspired movements make frequent use of its fists, giving it a charm unlike that of fanged beasts we've seen before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Normally when we design fanged beasts, their hips are low to the ground, putting their heads at about eye level with the hunter,” says Tokuda. “We thought that this can make it harder to sense the threat that the monster poses. That's why we were conscious of giving this monster a more top-heavy and towering silhouette. We then added flame elements that are at home in the Oilwell Basin, as well as grabbing attacks reminiscent of a wrestler that highlight its physical strength. It's a monster that combines strength, physical attacks and flames, like its attack where it melts something and tosses it at you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka also comments on Ajarakan's design: "With one unique monster after the next making an appearance, we thought that this might be a good time to add a monster whose strengths are easy to understand. That's how we got Ajarakan. It just punches or slams its fists on the ground to make flames shoot up, making it the kind of monster that's strong by way of all its super-straightforward attacks."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ajarakan occupies a fairly high position in Oilwell Basins's ecosystem. Compared to Rompopolo, which makes full use of poison gas and oilsilt, Ajarakan really does stand out with its flashy appearance, with flames and magma accompanying each one of its attacks, making you very conscious of the area's pecking order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At first it was just kind of a physically powerful monster,” says Fujioka. “That's why I talked quite a bit with our artists and designers about giving it more personality in some way. It's a monster in a fiery location, so I wanted to make use of flames and heat. That said, I didn't want it to simply breathe fire or create flames. That's how we ended up with a design where the monster seems to be wearing flames on its back, similar to the Buddhist deity Acala. From there we got the idea of Ajarakan's rising internal temperature giving it enough heat and power to melt anything in front of it, which seemed to give it so much more personality. Ajarakan will grab the hunter or hug Rompopolo, and we wanted to make players think about how much they'd want to avoid getting hugged by an absurdly hot creature. We decided to make it seem scary by making it so hot that it'll melt anything and everything around."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike the tricky Rompopolo, Ajarakan's design focuses on straightforward power. As there's the risk of its concept of depicting simple strength leading to no-frills movements, Fujioka says the team kept giving it flashier and flashier moves as they reached the end of development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We kept adding lots of different interesting techniques, like it jumping into the air, balling itself up and falling to the ground," he says.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A monster generations in the making</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Ruling over the Oilwell Basin's ecosystem as its apex predator with octopus-like tentacles is the “Black Flame,” which we can finally name for the first time: <strong>Nu Udra.  </strong>With its slimy body covered with the flammable oil it secretes, it stretches and wriggles around the Oilwell Basin in every direction. Just as the Windward Plains' Rey Dau controls lightning and the Scarlet Forest's Uth Duna envelops itself in water, Nu Udra coats itself in flames. The two developers say that apex predators in Wilds are designed with the element of their region strongly in mind. Of course, finding an octopus in a scorching hot area is odd. Was this really the animal that inspired the monster?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes, it was octopuses,” says Fujioka. “We also wanted its silhouette to be striking when it rises up and gave it what look like demonic horns, but we also tried designing it in a way where you can't tell where its face is."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokuda explains that even the music that plays when fighting Nu Udra is based on demonic imagery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had the composers include phrases and musical instruments reminiscent of black magic,” he says. “I think it ended up being a unique and good piece of music."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The squirming movements of Nu Udra's tentacles apparently follow in the footsteps of monsters like Lagiacrus, which appeared in Monster Hunter Tri. A tentacled monster like this is a concept that both Tokuda and Fujioka have long wanted to make a reality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the concepts in Tri was underwater combat, so I did write a proposal for an octopus-shaped monster at the time, emphasizing its distinctive underwater movements,” says Tokuda. “I had fun coming up with all kinds of ideas, like 'It has lots of legs, which means lots of parts you can sever!' There were challenges keeping us from making that a reality, though, including technical ones. But even so, I've been holding onto that proposal for all this time." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen monsters in the past such as Yama Tsukami and Nakarkos that wriggle around as they use appendages like their tentacles. I ask Fujioka if they took the movements of these past monsters into consideration when developing Nu Udra.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're always interested in using monsters who move like that in moments where they'd stand out, as their silhouette and the impression they give are nothing like standard monsters with limbs and wings,” he says. “While including too many unique monsters will cause players to get tired of seeing them, dropping one in at just the right moment leaves such a strong impression. That's why we had Yama Tsukami appear in the game the way it did,” he says, referring to the scene in Monster Hunter 2 (Dos) where you encounter Yama Tsukami floating over the mountains in a deep forest. “You glance up, see it flying above you, and think, 'What the heck is that?' I think there's a kind of adventurous feeling you get from seeing something a bit odd, similar to cryptids."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hearing this, Tokuda adds with a nostalgic tone, "You know, I'm the one who put that (Yama Tsukami) there." While they weren't able to create the same kind of actions for Yama Tsukami as they have for Nu Udra due to the technology at the time, they say they wanted to find some way for it to leave an impression.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A constant feeling I get throughout this interview is one of just how sincere Monster Hunter's team is throughout the development process about creating monsters, and that they make use of so many techniques in the process. Even if it can't be done with current technology, these creators have countless ideas in their heads about how they want to use a monster. Then when they develop a new title, they draw on this stockpile when creating new monsters. In that sense, you could call the realization of a monster that makes full use of its tentacles like Nu Udra a major accomplishment for both Tokuda and Fujioka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While Yama Tsukami and Nakarkos were monsters that attacked you with their tentacles while fixed there in a stage, Nu Udra makes use of its physical traits as a cephalopod to freely move around the area. In that way, the gameplay it enables could be seen as something we're trying for the very first time here."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka continues: "Monsters with tentacles like that pose a lot of technical challenges, like controlling it with respect to the terrain and its target. When we began development on Wilds, the technical department's tests went incredibly well, and so we felt like we could really make it happen this time."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we saw the tests, we also thought to make it the apex predator of the Oilwell Basin,” adds Tokuda. “That's just how much of an impact this monster has.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While there are countless proposals that I've had rejected due to technical reasons, it feels like I'm finally getting to attempt one of those this time around." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even outside of hunting, I get the sense that fine attention was placed on Nu Udra's animations. After you deal it enough damage, it wraps itself around what looks like an ancient ruined pipe in order to wriggle its way around the area. It even enters into small holes in the terrain without any trouble at all. Every one of Nu Udra's movements posed a challenge to the art team led by Fujioka.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We did quite a lot of work on depicting flexible bodies this time with Nu Udra,” he says. “At the start of development, we try coming up with pretty unreasonable ideas, whether or not we can actually achieve them. It's a challenge to ourselves in a way, and while it does cause a lot of challenges for our artists, the final product looks so amazing if we're able to actually make it take shape."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team uses new technologies to make possible the ideal expressions they've accumulated as the series progresses. They give it a try even if they aren't sure they can make it happen. I even get a sense of what it feels like to be on the Monster Hunter development floor when I hear these two talk. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we first implemented the movement of it going inside a hole, an animator told me, 'When you weaken it and it starts heading back to its nest, please wait here for a moment!',” says Tokuda. “Apparently they wanted me to see it going into its little hole, and I still remember replying, 'Oh, that really is amazing!' The animator looked so satisfied as well."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It might not be easy to get the chance to see it, but the way it squirms around while wrapped around a pipe is so well made too,” says Fujioka. “I do hope you check it out. Only games are able to depict things like that in real-time instead of as some premade scene. I'm incredibly proud of it as a crystallization of the staff's efforts." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka's tone of voice gives me a strong sense of just how satisfied he is with the level of detail of Wilds' monsters and how proud he is of the team who created this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I actually try taking on Nu Udra, I have significant trouble finding an opening on its flexible and ever-changing body. If I let my guard down and stick too close to it, it uses its head to launch a powerful counterattack. While I struggle, I somehow manage to focus enough of my attacks to successfully break a tentacle part, only for its severed tip to thrash around on the ground. Is it possible to destroy all of its many legs?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"You can cut off so many tentacles,” Tokuda explains. “While I suppose it depends on how you count them, all of the parts that resemble legs that touch the ground can be severed. While the tentacles do move right after they've been cut off, they begin to rot after some time passes. If you try to carve a part that's rotten and no longer moving, you won't get good materials from it. The same also applies for breakable parts of other monsters, like tails.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nu Udra uses its tentacles to launch attack after attack on its target. We were conscious to give its attacks a unique tempo through a combination of focused attacks, and area-of-effect attacks using its head and flames. We wanted to make it a massive monster that still seemed to launch a barrage of attacks. With all of its tentacles, though, it's possible that it becomes difficult to tell who it's targeting in situations like multiplayer hunts. That's why we've made it so that it has sensory organs at the tips of its tentacles that use light to indicate when and who it's going to attack."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At times, Nu Udra will hold its tentacles in the air and slam them into the ground as an attack. Like Tokuda says, its area that would correspond to the palm of a human hand gives off light when it does this. This light-emitting section of its body is Nu Udra's sensory organ. But as it doesn't use vision to understand the world around it, Flash Bombs don't affect it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nu Udra poses a significant challenge. I ask Tokuda what players can do to start working toward defeating it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Its body itself is fairly soft, and it has lots of breakable parts,” he replies. “I think hunters should think about how to determine where to attack. Cutting off a tentacle will also shorten its area of effect attacks, making it much easier to move around. You could also call it a monster made for multiplayer, as that means its targets will be split up. You may be able to enjoy it even more by using SOS flares, Support Hunters included."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fujioka expands further. "As we designed this monster, I thought it's one that can be tackled in a way that's very much like an action game in the sense that destroying its parts can help you get closer to defeating it. Gravios is another monster where you discover a way to defeat it as you destroy its tough armor, right? The ability to carefully watch a monster's movements and use that to make a decision fits perfectly with Monster Hunter's overall approach."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A welcome reunion </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">In his answer, Fujioka brings up the name Gravios. That's right, players can reunite with Gravios, who hasn't been seen since Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, in the Oilwell Basin. As a monster covered in what looks like a rocky carapace and which emits hot gas, Gravios really is a perfect monster for the area.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask Tokuda what led them to decide to have Gravios make another appearance (for more details, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gravios-returns-in-this-exclusive-gameplay-ign-first"><u>this Gravios interview</u></a> as well).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were thinking of monsters that match the Oilwell Basin's environment, make sense in the game's overall progression and don't play too similarly to any other monsters, we thought that we could make Gravios seem like a fresh challenge and decided that it would reappear," he says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Tokuda says, the reappearing Gravios had become a monster with an even harder body than I remembered. Its massive presence is overwhelming when compared to the other monsters in the Oilwell Basin. When I somehow figure out a way to attack its rocky carapace, I'm able to form red wounds on its body like any other monster and unleash a Focus Strike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When bringing Gravios over to this game from previous titles, above all else, we wanted to make sure it still had its distinguishing features like its hardness,” says Tokuda. “From a game design perspective, we also wanted it to be a monster that appeared after you've progressed a good bit and had gone through everything the game's design has to offer. That's why I came up with the idea of it being a monster where it's difficult to figure out a way to defeat its hard body at first, only for hunters to find more and more clues as they make good use of the wound system and part breaking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If Gravios is making an appearance, does that mean we'll also be seeing its juvenile form, Basarios? I ask the question, only for Fujioka to simply reply, "Sorry, but Basarios will be taking this one off." It seems like the time isn't quite right yet, and we'll have to wait longer before we see Basarios again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the two explained during our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-monster-hunter-wilds-team-select-their-beastly-lineup-ign-first"><u>interview about monster selection</u></a>, the Monster Hunter team is careful to not make offhanded decisions about having monsters reappear, only doing so if they can be used to their fullest in a game. That means that the team must have decided to not include Basarios in this game after multiple discussions. Though a bit unfortunate, many other monsters not touched on in this article will also make an appearance in the Oilwell Basin. I can't wait for the day when I get to go hunting there, Cool Drink in hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is scheduled for release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on February 28.

			<p>Last year, fans of adventure games <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were treated to a great release schedule</a>. Can 2025 match or even surpass it? Possibly, thanks to several experienced studios like Don't Nod and Hazelight, which have proved to be masters of the genre time and again. We still don't have a release date for The Wolf Among Us 2; Telltale <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a few months ago that the long-anticipated sequel isn't canceled, but it doesn't sound like it's coming in 2025. Thankfully, in the meantime, there'll be plenty of fun to be had between triple-A and independent productions.</p>

<h2>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage (February 18, April 15)</h2>
<p>The creators of Life is Strange return with a sort of spiritual successor titled <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>. The story will be split into two episodes, scheduled to be released around two months apart.</p>
<p>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage is set in the fictional town of Velvet Cove, Michigan, and features four former friends (Nora, Autumn, Kat, and Swann) who are reunited after 27 years. As Swann, players will actually navigate two different timelines: the Summer of 1995, when their friendship blossomed, and 2022, when the group gets together again despite having sworn not to speak again after they had buried a secret together. Don't Nod promises players will be able to shape both timelines somehow, while dialogue will feel more realistic thanks to the ability to ignore or interrupt what the others have just said. Given the studio's pedigree in the adventure games genre, this is likely one of the most widely anticipated titles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB_1920x1080.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Split Fiction (March 6)</h2>
<p>After the enormous success of 2021's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">It Takes Two</a>, which won many awards and sold over 20 million copies, Josef Fares and his Hazelight Studio are about to try again with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-split-fiction-trailer-showcases-co-op-gameplay-and-side-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Split Fiction</a>. Once more, this adventure game has been designed specifically to be played in split-screen cooperative multiplayer, so you'll need a friend to experience it.</p>
<p>This time around, the main characters are Mio and Zoe, two writers who work on sci-fi and fantasy, respectively. The beginning of the narrative sees them being trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas. They don't really feel much for one another at first, but they must work together if they are to escape this prison, mastering a variety of skills and overcoming various challenges as they jump between the sci-fi and fantasy worlds they had envisioned in their works.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/southofmidnight-1-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>South of Midnight (April 8, PC and Xbox Series S|X)</h2>
<p>The first project developed by Compulsion Games since they were acquired by Microsoft is undoubtedly an action/adventure game with a fair amount of action and puzzles. However, the developers have stressed that the story, rather than the gameplay, is the main focus of <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. In a fantasy world inspired by Deep Southern Gothic tales, protagonist Hazel suddenly becomes a Weaver, a magic user who repairs broken spirits and bonds.</p>
<p>The stop-motion-inspired visuals are certainly catchy, but Hazel's journey—both across the land and within herself—should take center stage when the game launches in early April.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Karma-The-Dark-World-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>KARMA: The Dark World (TBA)</h2>
<p>Shanghai-based developer Pollard Studio managed to stand out among the sea of upcoming new game releases with its debut project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-in-a-trilogy-of-trailers-released-for-karma-the-dark-world-paying-homage-to-david-lynch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KARMA: The Dark World</a>. The developers described it as a first-person cinematic psychological thriller set in a dystopian 1984 East Germany.</p>
<p>In this alternate timeline, the Leviathan Corporation rules society with an iron fist, controlling its citizens through mass surveillance, strict social class rules, mind-altering drugs, and the promise that the gates to utopia will open for those who obey. As Daniel McGovern, a Roam Agent for Leviathan's Thought Bureau, players will get to use advanced tech to enter the minds of the accused, investigate crime scenes, interview suspects, and report their findings to Leviathan.</p>
<p>Through a combination of investigative tools and interviews, players will solve puzzles and uncover the truth of a dark tale of love, loss, and deception where nothing is what it seems, and every twist and turn brings a new twist to unravel.</p>

<h2>Spirit of the North 2 (TBA)</h2>
<p>The cute fox from 2020's Spirit of the North returns in the sequel to this peculiar adventure game franchise. In Spirit of the North 2, players will be transported to an ancient world in ruins. As a lonely fox, with the help of a wise raven companion, they must find the lost legendary guardians and free them from the grasp of a dark shaman called Grimnir.</p>
<p>These corrupted guardians will have to be defeated and subsequently cleansed in puzzle-based encounters. Developer Infuse Studio also promised a large and ancient open world to explore, filled with history to discover, not to mention challenges to overcome and secrets to unlock.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-festival-is-bringing-sabrina-carpenter-next-season-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1094313/</guid>

<p>According to reliable insiders, Fortnite Festival’s next Season will have Sabrina Carpenter at the centre stage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a> (via <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1884279980621979689" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>), Fortnite Festival’s next Season will seemingly focus on the artist behind some of the most popular tunes of 2024, Sabrina Carpenter. If the ‘Espresso’ singer turns out to be the icon of the Fortnite Festival Season 8, then players can expect a bunch of new cosmetics and jam tracks inspired by the American artist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Like previous Icons, the Fortnite Festival could receive a music pass with a Sabrina Carpenter skin, new emotes, and cosmetics. The popular singer might also be featured in the Fortnite Item shop as a bundle with exclusive items. However, it is hard to confirm anything without an official announcement. </p>



<p>Sabrina Carpenter has already collaborated with Fortnite in August 2024, where players received a couple of emotes and jam tracks featuring popular songs from the artist but no skins. So it isn’t very farfetched to expect Sabrina Carpenter to be the main attraction of Fortnite Festival’s next Season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the same duo responsible for this leak claimed Fortnite will receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-will-receive-red-hulk-falcon-and-superman-skins-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Red Hulk, Falcon and Superman Skins</a>. Also, here’s everything you need to know about Fortnite’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-godzilla-event-release-date-godzilla-skin-king-kong-crossover-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Godzilla event</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-valorant-champions-winners/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Every year, the best VALORANT team at the world is crowned at VALORANT Champions, which serves as the world championship for Riot Games’ agent-filled tactical shooter. Over time, the event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-was-the-most-watched-esports-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has drawn larger audiences as the game expands its global reach</a>, and that reach is exemplified in all the different regions that have claimed the trophy at VALORANT Champions.</p>



<p>VALORANT may have a shorter history than several other esports titles, but that just makes the hall of Champions winners that much more exclusive.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-champions-winners-in-order">All VALORANT Champions Winners, In Order</h2>



<p>There have been four VALORANT Champions winners so far, beginning with the inaugural tournament in 2021.</p>



<h3 id="h-acend-2021">Acend – 2021</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Jianhua Chen for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Acend’s story has somewhat of a sad ending, as the organization didn’t acquire partnership in the VCT international leagues, and was <a href="https://x.com/AcendClub/status/1835685812031365594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced to close its doors</a> in 2024 due to unsustainability. But the organization and its players still hold the distinction of being the first ever VALORANT Champions winners, defeating a Gambit team that had dominated the scene for virtually the entire year in a thrilling five-map series in the grand finals.</p>



<ul>
<li>Santeri “BONECOLD” Sassi</li>



<li>Mehmet “cNed” İpek</li>



<li>Vladyslav “Kiles” Shvets</li>



<li>Patryk “starxo” Kopczyński</li>



<li>Aleksander “zeek” Zygmunt</li>



<li>Laurynas “Nbs” Kisielius (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-loud-2022">LOUD – 2022</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Brazilian organization LOUD entered VALORANT at the start of 2022, and finished the year with a world championship. LOUD pulled the best talent from Brazil together under one electric green banner, and found a rival wearing green themselves in OpTic Gaming. The two teams faced each other six times during the 2022 season, but LOUD got the last laugh in the upper bracket final and the grand final of Champions 2023.</p>



<ul>
<li>Bryan “pANcada” Luna</li>



<li>Gustavo “Sacy” Rossi</li>



<li>Matias “Saadhak” Delipetro</li>



<li>Erick “aspas” Santos</li>



<li>Felipe “Less” Basso</li>



<li>Matheus “bzkA” Tarasconi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-evil-geniuses-2023">Evil Geniuses – 2023</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evil Geniuses’ championship run in 2023 is considered one of the miraculous runs in the history of esports. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coach Christine “potter” Chi</a> started with a roster of lowly regarded players and added a completely unknown player from an open tryout mid-season. The North American team stunned the international audience with a grand finals run at Masters Tokyo, then knocked off Champions contenders like DRX, LOUD, and finally Paper Rex to win the world championship in front of a Los Angeles home crowd.</p>



<ul>
<li>Kelden “Boostio” Pupello</li>



<li>Ethan “Ethan” Arnold</li>



<li>Alexander “jawgemo” Mor</li>



<li>Corbin “C0M” Lee</li>



<li>Max “Demon1” Mazanov</li>



<li>Christine “potter” Chi (coach)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-edward-gaming-2024">EDward Gaming – 2024</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Colin Young-Wolff for Riot Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Riot Games’ expansion of the international VALORANT esports ecosystem into China couldn’t have gone any better for the region. EDward Gaming, after dominating the Chinese scene again but falling short on the international stage, finally had their moment at Champions 2024. In Seoul, EDG went undefeated in playoffs, defeating Team Heretics in an amazing grand final, cementing Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang as the top star of Chinese VALORANT.</p>



<ul>
<li>Wan “CHICHOO” Shunzhi</li>



<li>Wang “nobody” Senxu</li>



<li>Zheng “ZmjjKK” Yongkang</li>



<li>Zhang “Smoggy” Zhao</li>



<li>Hsieh “S1Mon” Meng-hsun</li>



<li>Tang “Muggle” Shijun (coach)</li>
</ul>



<p>Across these four years of VALORANT, no team has accomplished the feat of winning both a Masters event and Champions. Only one player has accomplished this: Sacy, who won Champions 2022 with LOUD and Masters Madrid 2024 with Sentinels.</p>

<p>Bungie announced today that Destiny 2 will receive Star Wars skins and cosmetics on February 4, 2025, along with the game’s third and final Episode, Heresy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have only <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1884318035000938780" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">teased</a> the upcoming Destiny 2 Star Wars skins and cosmetics, and we have yet to learn what exactly will be released. Players should expect new armour ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers inspired by Star Wars. Additionally, at the launch of Heresy, three new armour ornaments (one per Guardian class) will become available. And the inspiration for these ornaments will be “the soldiers of the Galactic Empire”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-destiny-2-s-heresy-act-1">Destiny 2’s Heresy Act 1</h2>



<p>Apart from the Destiny 2 x Star Wars collaboration, the developers have released <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">details</a> about their third episode and final epilogue, Heresy. Guardians should expect the return of a familiar foe: the Dreadnaught. However, this time, the players will take the fight to the Dreadnaught through a new exploration and combat-based activity: The Nether.&nbsp;The Heresy Episode will consist of three Acts. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers will experiment with player modifiers in the upcoming Destiny 2 update. Once the Heresy update arrives, players will observe new modifiers “with increased health pools, no regenerating of health, low ammo drops and revive tokens, and a modification on healing in the sandbox over the course of play.” Bungie wants players to strategically build their loadouts for survivability as health pools increase and regen is stopped in the upcoming update.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, according to claims, Bungie’s upcoming MOBA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is inspired by Smash Bros</a>. The development studio allegedly hired fans because they would “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-hired-fans-as-they-would-work-for-less-former-exec-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work for less.</a>” What are your thoughts on Destiny 2’s Star Wars collaboration? Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

A full gameplay reveal is set for February when the latest entry’s first trailer will go live. </p><p>But <em>MLB The Show 25</em> is marking some other notable firsts as well. After having been a day-and-date Game Pass release in recent years, the latest entry is going back to the standard boxed sales approach. It also won’t be coming to PlayStation 4 or Xbox One, a relief to many fans tired of PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions feeling held back by older hardware. <em>MLB The Show 25</em> will still be on Switch however, seemingly with an upgraded version on Switch 2 whenever Nintendo’s new console releases later this year. </p><p>Both <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> also skipped PS4, despite the latter also being on the less-powerful Switch.

It also sounds like <em>MLB The Show 25</em> won’t be hitting PS Plus in 2025 either. Last year’s entry hit the service in September, six months after it launched. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In the aftermath of the bombs dropping in and around Appalachia, much of the wasteland is barren and rife with danger. But some settlements and tows prove relatively sane and peaceful. Helvetia is neither. It’s a strange haven. But it’s where you’ll find the annual <strong>Fasnacht Event</strong>! Here is where to find Helvetia in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-helvetia-in-fallout-76"><strong>How to Find Helvetia in Fallout 76</strong></h2>



<p>You can find Helvetia in Fallout 76 by venturing into <strong>The Forest region</strong>, an early-game portion of the world map, and then head south of <strong>Morgantown</strong>, along the river, and just east of <strong>Sutton</strong>. It’s a small town with a main road, a three-way intersection, and a handful of buildings, including a church and several residential abodes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Overall, the area is relatively quiet for the post-apocalypse. It’s home to a handful of Scorched on any given day, except during Fasnacht when all hell breaks loose, and people flock to the town in droves to celebrate in strange masks and with music aplenty!</p>



<h2 id="h-quests-in-helvetia"><strong>Quests in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<p>You won’t find typical quests in Helvetia, though you will partake in various events, such as <strong>Fasnacht Day</strong>. It’s an annual event that brings players together to help the Protectrons of Helvetia celebrate the iconic albeit strange holiday commonly found in West Virginia. It’s characterized by strange masks, cheerful music, and plenty of brews to wash down the radiation.</p>







<h2 id="h-creatures-in-helvetia"><strong>Creatures in Helvetia</strong></h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>On an average day, Helvetia is quiet. It’s home to a handful of <strong>Scorched</strong>, none of which pose much of a threat to a terrifying Vault Dweller such as yourself, right? But during Fasnacht, the town starts to experience the hustle and bustle of the wasteland. During the annual event, you’ll stumble upon:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bee Swarms</strong></li>



<li><strong>Honey Beast</strong></li>



<li><strong>Megasloth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rabbit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Radtoad</strong></li>



<li><strong>Squirrel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Super Mutant Suicider</strong></li>



<li><strong>Wolf</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, there’s always the occasional Protectron to assist!</p>



<p>What’s your favorite part of Fasnacht Day in Fallout 76? Let us know in the comments, or visit the Insider Gaming community forum to share screenshots of the event!</p>

Scoring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/soar-in-style-with-a-jet-pack-in-fallout-76/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jet pack in Fallout 76</a> will let you zoom across the map and soar through the skies!</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/" data-ref-id="1900-6418131">Baldur's Gate 3</a> players mistakenly received early access to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-update-with-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-detailed/1100-6528108/" data-ref-id="1100-6528108">Patch 8</a>--the final major update for the game--before its scheduled stress test. Now, Larian Studios has announced that the Patch 8 stress test is live, and it's introducing several new features including cross-play.</p><p>To familiarize players with the way cross-play will function, Larian has also released the following video that walks through the necessary steps to join up with friends who are playing on separate consoles or PC. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qX4ffv7xLsI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Prior to launching Baldur's Gate 3 on Xbox Series X, Larian was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-could-add-split-screen-on-xbox-series-s-after-launch/1100-6517248/" data-ref-id="1100-6517248">forced to drop the split-screen feature from Xbox Series S.</a> After Patch 8, Series S users will finally get the split-screen option that Series X players have enjoyed since 2023. </p><p>Photo Mode is another prominent addition in Patch 8, alongside the 12 new subclasses that players can select. Larian notes that there are some known bugs that are still being worked out, which is why the stress test is being used to identify these issues before the official Patch 8 rollout begins to every player. </p><p>Once Larian wraps up its work on Patch 8, the studio's full attention will go to its next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/" data-ref-id="1100-6528758">codenamed Excalibur</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-new-eberron-2025-supplement-bringing-back-older-dd-setting<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced two new supplements coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. One of those is a new Eberron 2025 supplement, bringing players back to one of the fantasy TTRPG's most beloved settings.</p>

<h2>The Eberron 2025 Supplement Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/d-d-adds-two-new-books-to-2025-slate-including-new-eberron-book.710194/#post-9568885" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, the Eberron 2025 supplement has been added to Wizards of the Coast's upcoming slate of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> books coming this year.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=XUICQ1Tk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eberron-2025-adventurer-artwork.jpg?itok=VktmOXzJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Eberron is the name of an original setting set in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> . It was created by Keith Baker, James Wyatt, and Bill Slavicsek and debuted in 2004 for <em>D&amp;D 3.5 Edition</em>. It is a setting distinct from Dragonlance or The Forgotten Realms for its introduction of fantasy technology like trains, airships, automatons known as Warforged and iconic arcane tinkerers: Artificers.</p>

<p>The Eberron supplement, officially titled <em>Eberron: Forge of the Artificer</em>, will come to store fronts this August. The book will be a companion to the previously released book, <em>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</em>, and will contain new player options, bastion options tied to the Eberron setting, and new airship rules.</p>

<p>Among those new player options is the revised Artificer class. This aligns with Wizards of the Coast recently releasing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-releases-dungeons-dragons-2024-artificer-unearthed-arcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Artificer playtest material</a> for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> after the class was conspicuously absent from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, the Eberron 2025 will contain some changes to the setting's lore. Dragonmarked houses are no longer species-locked , players can join any house. In addition, dragonmarks will be made into more fully fleshed out Feats including pre-requisites Lastly, the Khoravar, originally treated as a form of half-elf, will now be treated as a separate player species.</p>

<p>The design team on this new supplement will include James Wyatt and Keith Baker will act as a consultant.</p>

<p>The announcement of the Eberron 2025 supplement is in keeping with Wizards of the Coast's latest wave of books for the latest iteration of their fantasy TTRPG. Their release slate also includes a <em>Forgotten Realms Player's Guide</em> containing 8 new subclasses and a <em>Forgotten Realms Adventurer's Guide</em> providing GMs with worldbuilding details on the land of Faerun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-vr-developer-fast-travel-games-hit-with-layoffs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Another virtual reality (VR) studio has been bitten by the layoff bug. Fast Travel Games, the developers behind titles such as  Cities: VR and Into The Radius, announced on Tuesday that it is laying off 30 people because of low game sales.</p>



<p>The announcement was made via a statement on social media.</p>



<p>“Due to lower sales than expected from our six game launches in 2024, in combination with a more uncertain year ahead for VR Games as a whole, we’ve taken the difficult decision to make 30 employees redundant at FTG,” Fast Travel Games’ statement reads. “These changes will affect mainly our Publishing, Marketing, and Admin departments, although the Studio will also be impacted as we consolidate down to one development team.”</p>



<p>They continued: “This is an exceptionally difficult decision, but we believe it’s necessary to ensure a stable and sustainable future for the company.</p>



<p>“Our focus now is on supporting all Fast Travellers through this challenging time. We’re grateful for the invaluable contributions of those leaving and remain committed to continue launching incredible games for our players.”</p>



<p>With the layoffs at Fast Travel Games, January has seen 21 studios either hold layoffs or shut down. The <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">total estimated jobs lost</a> as of writing sits around 700. The only bright spot at the moment is that, at this time last year, the games industry had already seen nearly 6,000 lose their jobs.</p>

                <p>Destiny is getting crossover content with one of the biggest sci-fi franchises on the planet, as Bungie has announced a partnership with Lucasfilm to bring Star Wars content to Destiny 2.</p><p>Launching on February 4 with the Destiny 2: Heresy update, the Star Wars content includes new armor ornaments, accessories, emotes, and finishers that are "inspired by Star Wars."

You can get a glimpse at the new armor in the image below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673" data-ratio="0.56791569086651" data-width="854" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4434673"></a><figcaption>Destiny x Star Wars launches in February.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4434673-screenshot2025-01-28at3.07.17pm.png"></figure><p>Destiny 2 has welcomed a number of licensed crossovers before, including franchises like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-adding-the-witcher-skins-with-season-of-the-wish-launch/1100-6519381/" data-ref-id="1100-6519381">The Witcher</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-lets-you-cosplay-as-commander-shepard-with-mass-effect-cosmetics-out-now/1100-6521058/" data-ref-id="1100-6521058">Mass Effect</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-and-destiny-2-crossover-will-introduce-some-trendy-cosmetics-to-both-games/1100-6509625/" data-ref-id="1100-6509625">Assassin's Creed</a>, but Star Wars is the biggest yet in terms of prominence.</p><p>Bungie announced the Star Wars crossover and lots more during a broadcast on January 28. Also as part of this, Bungie confirmed that the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/01/28/inside-destiny-2-heresy-launching-february-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dreadnaught is returning to Destiny in Destiny 2: Heresy</a>, which is the final epilogue of the so-called Light and Darkness saga.</p><p>"What's significant about the Dreadnaught's return for Heresy is that it's going to be changing, and we're going to be fighting through it in ways we've yet to experience," Destiny 2 narrative architect Nikko Stevens said. "The Dreadnaught has reawakened for the first time in almost a decade, spurring the Vanguard and Guardians across the system to take notice. We finally get to see what has become of the Dreadnaught years after Oryx was felled and its halls were left to corrode, without a Navigator."</p><p>In other Bungie news, the company underwent significant changes in 2024 when it announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">mass layoffs and a restructuring that will see some staffers form a new team inside parent company Sony to make a new game.</a> In addition to ongoing support for Destiny 2, Bungie is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">working on Marathon</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-dev-teases-sci-fi-project-inspired-by-frogs-comedy-mobas-and-fighting-games/1100-6517010/" data-ref-id="1100-6517010">a game inspired by frogs and comedy.</a></p>

                <p>Donkey Kong could be headed for an overall redesign. Fans got a quick glimpse of the great ape in the Switch 2 demo reel with (what appears to be) <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/" data-ref-id="2900-6141">Mario Kart 9</a>, but it seems the new look for DK isn't just for the game, but in merchandise as well.</p><p>It's not the first time Donkey Kong has been given a facelift since his original design in 1981, which was more like King Kong, and then completely overhauled with Rare's Donkey Kong Country franchise. His solo series gave him a necktie, a subtle hair wave, smaller nostrils, and a furrowed brow that always made him look slightly perturbed.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1471706756" data-promo-id="0"

Movie, which eagle-eyed fans have noticed on Nintendo's <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/goods/VM_NSJ_8_CMAAT" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Japanese merchandise</a>. The brow was scaled back, giving him a sort of kinder, rounder look. DK's superfans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1iahhoh/history_is_being_rewritten_in_front_of_our_very/?" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> weighed in on the design with some not sure, while others were in favor of the new look. </p><p>"At first I was against the design change, however after looking at it more I agree that it better allows DK to convey facial expressions and emotion. Before DK just kinda always looked angry? The brow reduction allows a greater range of expression and honestly looks pretty good once you get over the initial surprise of the change," one user said.</p><p>For now, it's just Donkey Kong himself getting a new look though it's unclear if Diddy Kong and the rest of the Kong family will be spared.</p>

			<p>2025 is going to be a jam-packed year for new games being released, but who could forget about the many DLCs and expansions that are confirmed to be happening this year? Admittedly, some have yet to be detailed or even announced, but the ones that have been are bound to keep you watching the calendar for their release date. Without further ado, here is Wccftech's most anticipated DLC of 2025.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-horror-games-of-2025-new-scares-inbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-sports-and-racing-games-of-2025-in-the-fast-lane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sports and Racing</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-strategy-and-simulation-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Strategy and Simulation</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-shooter-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-multiplayer-games-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Multiplayer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Atomic-Heart-DLC-3-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Atomic Heart: Enchantment Under the Sea (January 28)</h2>
<p>This expansion actually launches today on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atomic-heart-soviet-bioshock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">February 2023 launch</a>, Atomic Heart has already received two DLCs, both of which have been welcomed with mixed feelings across the board. However, the third time's the charm, right? In this DLC, you will return to Facility 3826 as Major P-3, with Twin at your side as you go diving into the depths and explore uncharted watery depths to try and save humanity.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/age-of-empires-4HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Age of Empires 4 Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>The name of the upcoming DLC hasn't been revealed yet, but World's Edge has confirmed that there will be a new DLC coming at some point in 2025 for Age of Empires 4. So far, the game has received a lot of seasonal content, but it has also received a mixture of <a href="https://wccftech.com/age-of-empires-iv-anniversary-season-3-upate-ottomans-malians/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> and paid DLC. These DLCs have added the Ottomans and Malians to the game, as well as a paid DLC called The Sultans Ascend, which added other civilizations to the game. Hopefully, the DLC is what the fans have been hoping for.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Indiana-Jones-Giants-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle - The Order of Giants (TBA)</h2>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the best games released in 2024</a>. Needless to say, we're eager to get our hands on its announced story-driven DLC, The Order of Giants, which is included with the purchase of the Premium Edition. As implied by the title, this expansion should shine further light on the secretive organization that the main game reveals to be actually named Nephilim Order. There's little doubt that Indiana will once again face many shenanigans in this new adventure, though we don't know who else might appear in it - could we see other familiar faces from the movies? Only time will tell.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Lies-of-P-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Lies of P Untitled DLC (TBA)</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is another DLC that doesn't have a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/">confirmed release date yet</a>. However, we do know that it is slated for release this year, possibly in the first quarter, while Neowiz is also working on a sequel to Lies of P that is coming in the future. It's uncertain as to what this DLC will be about, but it's perfect for those who enjoyed Lies of P or are wanting more of the soulslike experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rain-world-the-watcher-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<h2>Rain World: The Watcher (March 28)</h2>
<p>Rain World has already received a fair bit of new content over the years since its release in 2017, with Downpour being the first major DLC that the game received back in 2023. Luckily, for those who are a fan of the slugcats, Rain World will be getting its second paid DLC, named The Watcher, released on March 28, 2025. While January has been going on for what feels like ten years, it will soon be over, meaning March will be even closer than before.</p>
