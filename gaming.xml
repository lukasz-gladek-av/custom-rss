            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03c6d943f55be/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out the official details for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> USB camera compatibility on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-USB-Cameras-2785632.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq6zK5mTXSBzpSY011GVRE952hwn0jSzgAUKbx6ToaOJmHWyDEh">Nintendo's website</a> and you'll be greeted with a surprisingly straightforward message from the Big N stating that, "You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C camera you'd like." Nice!</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that nothing is ever quite so easy; Nintendo does qualify that some cameras may not work and you'll need to use the handy compatibility test found in the new console's settings. This is great, but not much use when you haven't bought the camera yet.</p>
<p>As it turns out, choosing a camera — besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">the official one</a>, or the not-quite-as-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you">Hori Piranha Plant one</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/horis-new-switch-2-camera-is-built-for-handheld-play">the other Hori one</a> — can actually be a little bit of a complicated task. Some cameras work, some don't. Simple as that.</p>
<p>And so, as ever, enthusiastic gamers have been stepping into the breach, compiling master lists of Switch 2-compatible cameras that you can browse and/or add to with your own findings, and there are quite a few popular brands popping up in "Not Compatible" sections thus far.</p>
<p>As pointed out at the very top of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/?sort=new">this ongoing master list</a> (and this was news to us), some USB-A cameras do appear to work when plugged into the dock or, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, plugged into the Switch 2 console. New information has appeared! Indeed, in TV mode, it appears you can just directly plug into the dock to potentially use USB-A cameras you have lying around.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this writer did attempt to use a Blink Dog Security camera connected to the dock, but alas no dice.</p>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64d2528759954/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Okay, this one didn't work, though the power light did flash on and off, so that was something — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking through the Reddit list as it stands right now (which we can't vouch for, mind), you can also see some patterns developing around particular brands. Logitech has a whole bunch of cameras, ranging from cheap to expensive, that are seemingly compatible - and a shoutout to whoever it is that's been using an endoscopy cam. Good job!</p>
<p>Here are a few of the included cameras in the 'working' section with some prices (check out the thread for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">the full, growing list</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aoni A20 - 1080p - $19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 100 - 1080p - $29</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 105 - 1080p - $45</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 300 - 1080p - $39</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 501 - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft LifeCam Cinema - 720p - $94</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo - 1080p - $47</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo Pro - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>WAYVOSE ‎WVS0015 Endoscope - ?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So there's certainly plenty of non-Nintendo gear out there that's getting the job done at various price points, it would seem.</p>
<p>In terms of cameras that won't work, well, Elgato gear seems to have been totally left out in the cold, as does Sony, Insta360, and Microsoft for the most part. There are some surprises and brand outliers, too, such as the very well-regarded (and expensive) Logitech Brio 4K, which is seemingly having issues</p>
<p>So make sure to give this list — and any others you find popping up online — a good read-through before deciding that a very nice and expensive USB-C camera you've seen should 100% do the job. It may not!</p>

            <p>A controversial third-party plugin used by some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> players has been permanently shut down following a cease and desist notice.</p>
<p>A message on the PlayerScope discord (shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1lfgia4/playerscope_stalker_plugin_ceases_development_due/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>) details the web back-end has been taken offline and all stored data has been "permanently and irreversibly deleted", while the plugin files have been completely removed from GitHub and GitFlic. "There will be no further updates, support, or development from my side," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>While PlayerScope hasn't specified where the cease and desist notice has come from, back in January this year Final Fantasy 14 producer and director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> shared news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-considering-legal-action-against-use-of-a-third-party-tool-in-final-fantasy-14-says-naoki-yoshida">Square Enix was considering taking legal action against the creator of a third-party tool</a>.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> for clarification.</p>
<p>Yoshida has long warned players against using third-party plugins, which are strictly prohibited in Final Fantasy 14. He's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">repeatedly called out players for cheating during Ultimate Raid challenges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the PlayerScope tool in particular has been used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>The plugin would allow anyone to search for a Final Fantasy 14 character name to receive that player's account details, including information of all characters on that account. Player information was also uploaded to a central server combining all data. Essentially, this allowed for in-game harassment and stalking.</p>
<p>In short, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1hvv7k5/comment/m5w6qo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> put it, the plugin was a "stalker's wet dream".</p>
<p>"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools," said Yoshida back in January.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515747-Letter-from-the-Producer-LIVE-Part-LXXXV-%2802-21-2025%29">Square Enix stated</a> it was making changes to how characters were blacklisted, although third-party tools were able to get around this - something the company admitted was "very problematic". While it had countermeasures in place, Square Enix did not disclose what those were.</p>
<p>Now, however, PlayerScope has been completely shut down. "This wasn't an easy decision, but it was necessary," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>Still, while players have mostly praised the decision, some have concerns the database of player information may still exist elsewhere.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>March to the beat</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new overview trailer for the upcoming remaster of a PSP classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>This one was initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">final Switch 1-focused Direct</a> in late March and is set to come our way on <strong>11th July</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who played either <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/patapon">Patapon</a> or its sequel on PSP back in the mid-2000s won't find too many surprises in the new trailer, but if you missed out, it does a decent job of filling in the blanks. This is a rhythm game where you take control of an army of tiny one-eyed warriors, and help them journey across the land. Every command you give to your team comes in the form of drum beats, which you'll have to bash out on the buttons to make them follow your instructions.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The new trailer runs through most of these commands while showcasing the game's controls and tactical slant, before detailing some of the gimmicks, character classes and quality of life improvements we can expect to encounter next month — shout out to the 'Drum Command Always Display' function.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather sweet. Bandai Namco have assumed publishing duties on this one, but the original Patapon team are hard at work on a spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, which is <em>also</em> eyeing-up a Switch release. Man, it's a good time to be a rhythm fan!</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4 development team aims to take full advantage of the generational shift since the release of The Witcher 3, and their ambition to deliver a true next-gen experience had to be shown right from the get-go with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> shown during this year's edition of Unreal Fest.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-devs-are-preparing-for-a-generational-shift-after-the-witcher-3-and-theyre-studying-the-rpgs-biggest-city-to-help/">GamesRadar+</a>, Engineering Production Manager Jan Hermanowicz said that the studio is adapting to the generational shift in hardware, engines, and technology since the release of the third entry in the series. The studio wants to take full advantage of this shift to deliver a true next-generation experience.</p>
<p>This ambition had to be shown right away, which led to the showing of the village of Valdrest in The Witcher 4 tech demo. This village featured over 300 NPCs, a huge character density comparable to The Witcher 3's biggest city, Novigrad, which provided clear proof of how serious CDPR is about stepping up from the previous entry in the series. The city players get to explore as Geralt is searching for Ciri actually served as a basis for the creation of Valdrest's NPC density, according to Hermanowicz, as the team spent a lot of time looking at recordings of Novigrad, looking at what was done in the past, what worked and what couldn't be accomplished at the time. As such, the studio is definitely not stepping into upping the ante blindly, but is actually building on what was already done in the past.</p>
<p>Though just a tech demo that may not be entirely representative of the final game, The Witcher 4's first showing was indeed impressive, and not just for how alive the village of Valdrest looked. The tech demo was running on base PlayStation 4 at 60 FPS with ray tracing, and with the studio making the game with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a>, there's no doubt that we won't see a repeat of what happened with Cyberpunk 2077's console launch, although Xbox Series S owners may not be able to enjoy the game as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners, as getting the game to run at 60 FPS on the system will be extremely challenging.</p>

The advert, now spotted by multiple fans and confirmed in person by IGN staff, really does say the game is "out now".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Nintendo has not announced a Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date other than a vague promise it will launch this year. But even if the game isn't out now, its appearance on an advert in such a prominent location is giving Nintendo fans hope its launch is right around the corner.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Any idea why the MP4 Beyond ad in the London Underground says 'out now'?" Nintendo fan orchestar  wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I’m genuinely confused. Do they mean the Switch 2 is out? I wish the game was truly out though haha."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have speculated that the advert is perhaps outdated — maybe Nintendo did initially plan to launch Metroid Prime 4 now, and the wording wasn't updated? Alternatively, we could be seeing a version of the advert not due until later, alongside the game's actual release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For other Nintendo fans, keen to play the game soon after many years of waiting, the advert has sparked hope of a surprise release. This does seem unlikely, however, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Donkey Kong Bananza firmly positioned as Nintendo's next big Switch 2 title</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN senior commerce editor Rob Anderson told me this morning, reporting from the scene, the whole of this Oxford Circus tube platform is one long Nintendo Switch 2 advert, with individual panels for games such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Donkey Kong Bananza and the Switch 2 console itself. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's placement here, then, looks just to be part of a wider promotional campaign — rather than a specific placement for the individual game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/pxl-20250620-103943003-1750416263852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now", according to this Oxford Circus advert. Image credit: IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now a cross-gen title for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is set to finally arrive at some point in 2025 after a long and eventful development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally announced back in 2017, the follow-up to Retro Studios' beloved GameCube and Wii trilogy was rebooted in 2019, and development restarted by Retro Studios after an earlier version in the works at Bandai Namco failed to meet Nintendo's standards. Years later, with Switch 2 on the horizon, Nintendo finally gave the game a proper unveiling in June 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will run at 120 frames per second and offer optional controls that take advantage of the Joy-Con's mouse feature. It seems most likely to arrive at some point between Donkey Kong Bananza's July launch and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's arrival in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo credit: Rob Anderson</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>NetEase Game has announced a new game called Blood Message, which it describes as its first "AAA" single-player experience that is under development at Naraka: Bladepoint studio 24 Entertainment. Set during the final years of the Tang Dynasty, the game follows a nameless messenger and his young son as they embark on a 1,000 mile journey to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang Empire.</p><p>Fraught with peril, the trek sees the hero encounter difficult terrain and brutal sieges unfolding in the land. A trailer for the game featuring a mix of gameplay and cinematics has also been released, and you can watch it below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6IwsMWTVGI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/n6IwsMWTVGI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>NetEase says players can expect "cinematic storytelling" and realistic combat that blends stealth and survival mechanics, as well as expansive landscapes inspired by East and Central Asia. At its core, the company says Blood Message is about how ordinary people leave their mark on history as unsung heroes. The story focuses on a father and his son as they navigate a collapsing world and find themselves torn between duty and family.</p><p>"We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," NetEase executive VP Zhipeng Hu said in a press statement. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p><h2>Blood Message screens</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/20/ludocene-the-new-app-that-reimagines-game-discovery/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.ludocene.com/">Ludocene</a>, a new, self-styled dating app for video games, is aiming to tackle an age-old (albeit first world) problem. We’ve all been there, flicking through tatty, overstuffed CD wallets or irritably browsing digital storefronts, not really knowing what we want to play next. The unending influx of new releases doesn’t help with 19,000 titles being added to Steam alone in 2024. That sense of choice paralysis is only exacerbated further when you factor in the hoard of complimentary games shotgunned into players’ libraries on a monthly basis thanks to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playtstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, and other services such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ludocene Kickstarter Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRkvfG-1et8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ludocene wants to cut through the noise in a way that’s personalised and playful. Currently in its testing stage, the innovative web app invites users to grab a seat at its virtual table, offering them a series of cards from its ginormous deck. Each card represents a video game, complete with a blurb, trailer, and even a handy store link should you want to make a purchase. Much like a dating app, Ludocene will ask you to keep cards or discard them, each swipe helping to narrow the results of its recommendation engine.</p>


<p>While storefronts such as Steam do a passable job of suggesting similar games to what you’ve been playing, it doesn’t account for changing tastes or the fact that sometimes we want to try something completely different from the game we’ve just finished. For instance, after wrapping up <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, I wanted to play something much shorter and less demanding.</p>

<p>So, I set about swiping and quickly landed on one of TSA’s all-time favourites, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey">Journey</a>. Dropping it into the “Played Favourites” box prompted Ludocene to deal me similar cards such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/abzu">ABZU</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>, as well as games I’d seemingly forgotten about like Season: A Letter to the Future. I was also presented with more obscure indie titles like Two Falls, Webfishing, and Feather, and even upcoming releases, with Sword of the Sea being the top pick.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ludocene - Game Suggestions From People You Trust" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdyh0Mc9TXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once you’re satisfied with the pool of cards you’ve curated you can save it and start a new “run” from scratch. This time around, instead of smaller, zen-like experiences I wanted to play an arcade racer on PS5; filtering out driving sims and Mario Kart clones I finally landed on Split/Second. While Ludocene is great for finding new and lesser known titles, it also encourages the rediscovery of games we might already own or have played in the past. Minutes later, I was drifting through collapsing cityscapes thanks to the game being part of Sony’s streamable PlayStation Plus classics catalogue. It would be great if Ludocene’s cards could indicate whether a game is currently available via subscription services though I imagine that curating an updated database of store links and updated prices is already suitably challenging.</p>
<p>With that said, there are special theme cards you can add to your deck that augment your results if, say, you want to specifically see games being offered as part of a Netflix subscription. There are expert cards too with Ludocene assembling an Avengers-like team of tastemakers from across the gaming industry. Given the current state of games journalism – with publications closing up shop and Google directing eyeballs towards sloppy AI summaries instead of actual articles – it’s great to feel a sense of connection with actual humans giving their honest opinions.</p>
<p>So, how do you get Ludocene? For instant access to a fully-functioning prototype, you can make a late pledge <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene">over on Kickstarter</a> with a wider release planned for September 2025.</p>

                <p>Gamers have been waiting 18 years for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> to arrive, so it was understandable when Nintendo reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-4-is-still-coming-out-in-2025/1100-6529216/" data-ref-id="1100-6529216">the game will be released this year</a> to assuage fears of any further delays. While the game still doesn't have an official release date, there are now ads in the London Underground that state Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now."</p><p>A picture of the ad was posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lfoblm/metroid_prime_4_beyond_out_now_advert_spotted_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, where it's become the topic of speculation. But don't get too excited. It's far more likely that this is a mistake rather than Nintendo shadow dropping one of its most-anticipated titles of the year in the wake of Switch 2's launch without a proper media push.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo didn't reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/" data-ref-id="1100-6530408">the first trailer for Metroid Prime 4</a> until earlier this year, and there have only been a handful of glimpses since. Players will once again assume control of bounty hunter Samus Aran as she finds herself trapped on the jungle planet Viewros while facing foes and hostile terrain. Luckily, Samus has also developed some new psychic powers that may give her the edge she needs to survive her latest ordeal.</p><p>While Metroid Prime 4 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-upgraded-original-switch-games-including-metroid-prime-4-and-pokemon-legends/1100-6530551/" data-ref-id="1100-6530551">coming to both Switch and Switch 2</a>, the latter has a special feature that will let players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between standard controls or the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> on the fly. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">GameSpot's hands-on preview</a>, that ability took some getting used to. But the game looks very promising so far.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't shared any concrete details about when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be released, but the year is half over and the wait shouldn't be too long.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netease-joins-the-aaa-single-player-wave-with-blood-message-developed-by-the-naraka-bladepoint-team.1223760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/blood-message-reveal-trailer-netease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blood Message, a single player narrative action game, has just been revealed by Netease Games.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PC and consoles, though no release date has been announced.</p>
<p>Developed by 24 Entertainment, the studio responsible for melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint, the new trailer introduces the Dunhuang's Uprising as Blood Message's setting, where your character must make a 1,000 mile trek with a crucial message in hand.</p>

<p>The trailer - which you can watch above - is a visually impressive display, showcasing plenty of third-person action across various distinct locations. While 24 Entertainment does have action experience courtesy of Naraka, this looks to be a much slower, cinematic affair.</p>
<p>An accompanying press release states Blood Message will feature: "Visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics", as well as "expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia". In terms of gameplay comparisons, think something along the lines of The Last of Us, albeit with a close-quarters, historical focus.</p>
<p>"We are ushering players a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," said Zhipeng Hu, lead producer and NetEase executive vice president. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p>
<p>We're seeing a lot of these big budget action games come from China as of late, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the success of Black Myth: Wukong changed the game for the country's developers</a>. Prior to Blood Message, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Lost Soul Aside, and Tides of Annihilation are just a handful of examples of interesting titles following the path Wukong first tread.</p>
<p>These examples have yet to release, and as such whether or not the financial and critical success of Wukong can be replicated by its contemporaries remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this wave of interesting looking games coming to the West from a historically under-represented part of the video game industry (at least as far as big budget AAA is concerned) certainly offers another avenue for exciting games to reach the hands of curious players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The release of a new console is then spent burning through as many of the launch titles as humanly possible. That’s even more true if you’re us, and the days and nights at TSA Towers have been spent blearily looking at the differences between docked and undocked performance, and trying out all our old games to see if they run better (they do!). I’m genuinely really happy to have a console that is a Switch but better, and it’s made a big jump towards what we expect from current gen consoles and handhelds. I’ve been playing a heap of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, loads of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, a spot of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and plenty of family Mario Kart World. Me and my wife also embarked on a highly romantic playthrough of The Last of Us Remastered, as we approach our 15 year(!) wedding anniversary. That’s true love.</p>

<p>We’re going to start with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s played a wide range of titles as he hid from the fiery ball in the sky. He tells us, “I cleared the lovely Symphonia on Game Pass (highly recommend for fans of Celeste et al), the clunky but nostalgic Warhammer Space Marine MasterCrafted, finished checking out Next Fest demos and inflated my ridiculous wishlist even more. I also started the excellent Alters (although only played the part I had already done in the demo last year). Finally I got deep into Metroid Zero Mission which is still an astonishingly good game – beginning a full series playthrough to take me up to the launch of Prime 4.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> had a busy one, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/tron-catalyst-review/">TRON Catalyst</a> for our review, Elden Ring: Nightrein, Synduality: Echo of Ada, and Girls Frontline 2: Exilium!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> returned to Atomfall for its Wicked Isle DLC, continued on with Rebellion titles with Zombie Army VR, and then waggled his arms around in Maestro for review. That wasn’t all though, as he tell us, “There was also a bit of Balatro and, miraculously, a few hours of Fallout 4 on my severely under-equipped PC over the weekend. I forgot how awesome mods are and now I don’t want to go back to console.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub&nbsp;</strong> has been wrapping up our upcoming review of Death Stranding 2, but has also been playing Destiny 2, presumably. And do you know what? I’ve downloaded it so I can play it too. I was appalled by the 180Gb install mind you, but the new expansion is free on PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>Keen for a kick-about, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/">Rematch</a> for review, which has some really interesting ideas on how to handle video game football, and paired that with his old standby, The Witcher 3.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has had a heck of a week, reviewing Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Survival Kids. He’s also been playing through Split Fiction on the Switch 2 (review to come) and finished Mario Kart World. I think he’s probably exhausted, as he told us, “I have no intention of ever sleeping — I am going to go make another coffee, however…”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been juggling a few very different games this week. First up was Nobunaga’s Ambition Awakening which he says, “just didn’t hook me in the same way previous instalments have done.” Looking to cross another game off his backlog, he booted up Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey which didn’t start out well, “I initially found it equal parts dull and frustrating, leading me to wipe the game from my PS5. However, the following day I decided to reinstall and give it another shake. With the help of a few guides (the in-game onboarding is lacking) I’m starting to enjoy the game as my primal tribe of apes gradually learn to explore, communicate, and use tools. To cap it off, I’ve been playing Rematch – the new action footie game from Sifu developer, Sloclap.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been on holiday in the Lake District this week with the family, so that’s meant lots of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Rayman Legends on the Switch for evening gaming sessions after an epic walk or two! Sounds perfect!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Reuben</strong> has been dealing with the world being a mess by playing a lot of games set ostensibly in post-apocalyptic worlds. He tells us, “I’ve been playing FUGA 3 (review coming shortly), Shin Megami Tensei IV and Stray. The last of which I have finished and didn’t overly enjoy all that much, but SMTIV is an incredible experience, if a little on the long side.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been continuing his charge through the Switch 2’s library. This week’s seen Yakuza 0’s hefty cutscenes occupying him, plenty of back and forth to do our Hogwarts Legacy comparison (so he could use that punny headline he thought of weeks ago), and he’s pulling together patched game thoughts as well. Is that enough to do? Hell no! That’s why he’s been playing a bit of Remedy’s quirky co-op shooter spin-off, FBC: Firebreak. It’s an…. unusual game…</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 packs significant CPU and GPU performance improvements over version 5.4 of the engine, boding well for future games powered by the Epic engine.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> on YouTube puts the Paris Tech Demo by Scans Factory running on an RTX 5080 in Unreal Engine 5.6 and Unreal Engine 5.4 at default settings and with hardware Lumen in GPU and CPU limited scenarios side-by-side, highlighting how there are significant performance improvements in the new version of the engine in both scenarios. GPU performance is estimated to be improved by up to 25%, with the new version of the engine utilizing GPU resources better, resulting in a higher power draw as well. CPU performance, on the other hand, sees the biggest improvement in the new version of the engine, up to 35%, with more stable frametimes as well. Even in terms of image quality, Unreal Engine 5.6 brings significant improvements with more accurate Lumen lighting and higher quality Lumen reflections.</p>
<p><iframe title="Unreal Engine 5.6 vs Unreal Engine 5.4 Comparison - Significant Performance Improvement | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOb4b1Y-Mw8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 launched earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">this month</a>, right after the annual Unreal Fest opening presentation revealed some of its central features and improvements over the previous version of the engine. Among the improvements are hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, and more. The launch of the new version of the engine accompanied the first public showing of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Wìtcher IV tech demo</a>, which served as a showcase of the features of the new version of the engine.</p>
<p>More information on Unreal Engine 5.6 can be found on its official website.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch was on the back foot in terms of hardware power from day one. The game’s big launch title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, felt like it <em>just barely</em> fit within the confines of the system, running at an inconsistent 30fps and a less-than-optimal pixel count. Six years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> pushed the Switch even closer to its limits (and arguably beyond).</p>
<p>Given the struggles the games had on the OG Switch, it feels appropriate that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more technically-adept Switch 2</a> is launching with updated versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which promise sharper visuals, better performance, and more. So, do these upgrades truly transform these Switch-era epics? Or are they less than legendary? Venture forth for my thoughts...</p>
<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The original Switch versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom certainly delivered in terms of style, mood, and sense of scale, but you usually weren’t rewarded for examining anything too closely, with an unflattering combination of soft details and jagged edges affecting many environments and objects.</p>
<p>The new versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom sharpen things up considerably, bumping the resolution to a native 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld mode. That resolution is likely somewhat dynamic, but to my eye, it looked to occupy the higher end of the scale most of the time. Combined with HDR, the resolution bump results in an overall more vibrant, engaging presentation. Individual blades of grass can now be seen and environmental details are no longer lost in a sea of bleary textures and jagged edges. That said, I’d be lying if I said the difference is completely transformational. Underlying assets haven’t really changed, they’re just rendered at a more appealing resolution. The visual update is nice, but I can’t say it completely bowled me over.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>More significant, is the boost in performance. On the OG Switch, you only got a shaky 30fps which could drop as low as 20fps (particularly in TotK) but on Switch 2, you’re looking at a rock-solid 60fps. Even delving into TotK’s most problematic areas, like the Fire Temple, didn’t result in any particularly noticeable hiccups, and I have to say, it felt damn good to finally wander around Kakariko Village without any chug.</p>
<p>Ultimately though, the thing that impressed me most about the Switch 2 versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom was something I wasn’t expecting – Zelda Notes. If you download the Switch 2 updates you can now pair with a mobile app that provides the player with on-the-fly guidance and other handy-dandy features. Honestly, I’m not really a big phone guy – I own one, but I don’t do much with it, only downloading the apps I absolutely need. The idea of playing Zelda with my phone on my lap didn’t sound particularly appealing and Nintendo’s history when it comes to these kinds of mobile companion apps wasn’t terribly encouraging. Consider my surprise when I actually found the app quite useful!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The core feature of Zelda Notes is an interactive map, which syncs with your Switch 2, tracks your current coordinates, and allows you to mark the location of pretty much anything you want, whether you’ve found that thing previously or not – landmarks, key items, crafting materials, enemies, whatever. The map even provides GPS-like directions to marked destinations. Of course, discovering things for yourself is part of the fun in Zelda games, but for someone like me who’s already sunk many hours into beating BotW and TotK, but still far from 100 percent completion due to a lack of time and patience for searching out every trinket, Zelda Notes is kind of a godsend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For example, I’ve wanted to acquire the “Depths Armor” set in TotK for some time, as it gives you some immunity to the game’s annoying Gloom, but getting it requires the player to locate a series of difficult-to-find “Bargainer Statues” in the game’s murky underworld. I’d pretty much given up the task, but Zelda Notes allowed me to easily locate the Bargainer Statues using the map and in around 90 minutes I finally had my Depths Armor set, something that previously would have required countless, possibly fruitless, hours searching in-game or through poorly-written online guides.</p>
<p>Zelda Notes also offers other features, including the ability to save and share Autobuild creations and items, “Voice Memories” that provide new insights about the world from Zelda and other characters, and yes, even the limited ability to fix broken weapons! Zelda Notes feels like an promising template for the future, and I’d like to see other Nintendo games, particularly those with lots of secrets, get similar guides.</p>

<h2><strong>Come for the Polish, Stay for the Pro-Tips</strong></h2>
<p>The Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom offer a nice visual spit-shine and performance boost, although I’m not sure what you get is more impressive than some of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVmerPY3obzj00atuU_9x4IiHZhiPYF2w257wTmfUao3XQL78E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates Nintendo is offering</a> for other Switch 1 games. In my opinion, what really justifies the BotW and TotK updates being paid products is Zelda Notes, which is a surprisingly useful and technically-savvy tool. Of course, not everyone will be interested in something like Zelda Notes, but if you’re looking for a bit of guidance, this is an upgrade path worth exploring, adventurer.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates are available now for $10 apiece or for “free” with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Some raw footage has leaked of a cinematic moment in Battlefield 6 (or Battlefield Now, or Battlefield Big War, or whatever Electronic Arts are planning to call their next western military interventionism sim). The video sees the player escaping from a collapsing dam at the last minute as bomber jets launch a payload at the big concrete waterstopper. The footage is silent, but you can insert the manly yells of "Go! Go! Go!" easily enough yourself. Perhaps more interestingly, the same leaker also provides evidence of a battle royale mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The footage was <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">posted on social media</a> by data miner "temporyal", who has been going through the files of the Battlefield Labs playtest client, uncovering various details. It's a very early block-out of what may become a more detailed escapade during a campaign mission, or perhaps the early workings of a trailer - who knows. Either way, there's lots of greybox geometry, placeholder props, and unfinished animations. Kind of like watching theatre actors perform a rehearsal wearing their jogger bottoms, script in hand. But it does give you a sense of scale, and it's a reminder that EA remain obsessed with big chunks of world infrastructure falling on top of people.</p>
<p>It's not the only thing the leaker claims to have uncovered in their spelunk down the data mines. They've also posted <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935676264565862641">images and blurbs</a> which suggest there will be a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1kti0m0/bf_labs_datamining_the_battle_royale_mode_new/">battle royale mode</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a> had a battle royale mode called "Firestorm" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> had a not-quite-battle-royale mode called "Hazard Zone". I'm curious to see if they go trad royale with this one or add some sort of battlespice, if this mode does materialise.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1925897904956362807">lore tidbits</a> that could mean maps set in New York and Turkmenistan. As for the campaign, the miner is <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">convinced</a> we'll see missions taking place in various countries "including Egypt, Tajikistan, the USA, and Gibraltar". </p>
<p>But of course, all this comes deep from the guts of the game's current playtesting client. There's no guarantee such things will surface in the finished game. Bits of lore and other narrative text can be easily misinterpreted, and none of it is officially confirmed by EA, who have yet to reveal more details about the game. They are planning to show off a no doubt explodey trailer with more information sometime this summer, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">according to EA comms director Andy McNamara</a>.  

</p><p>This isn't the first leak of footage from the shooter. Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">call for playtesters</a> early this year, some nine minutes of multiplayer footage showing the series' long-running conquest mode were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaked from those playtests</a>. There are tanks and drones and medics, oh my.</p>
<p>It is looking traditionally shooty so far. Battlefield 2042, the last game of the series, was not particularly well-received among fans of bigwar, many of whom complained that it was not fully polished on release, full of bugs and instabilities. In his review, our Ed called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">"an FPS that doesn't feel ready yet".</a> That'll be why EA is going so hard on playtesting this one then.</p>

<figure><a title="dk rap credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebfcd677b20e3/dk-rap-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we reported on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-the-dk-rap-is-in-donkey-kong-bananza">the DK Rap is back</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which as we all know is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p>However, one (perhaps expected, on past evidence) little wrinkle is that Grant Kirkhope, the illustrious composer of the DK Rap, alongside music for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">Goldeneye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/viva_pinata_pocket_paradise">Viva Pinata</a>, and a whole bunch more didn't actually know the rap was going to be used in the game.</p>
<p>As Kirkhope himself explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-wasnt-aware-the-worst-rap-track-in-the-history-of-rap-tracks-would-be-included-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Eurogamer</a>, he hadn't been made aware of this most recent usage, which didn't come as such a big surprise to him.</p>
<p>Describing the rap itself, which he created for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, as "the worst track in the history of rap tracks" (has he not seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Re4aDJL3heA?si=3AdUhICSOqi6iSC1&amp;t=150">the John Barnes rap</a>?) Kirkhope, who also wasn't credited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, pointed out that's just not how Nintendo do things.</p>
<p>Speaking last month about being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/grant-kirkhope-apparently-got-a-bananas-reason-for-his-missing-mario-movie-credit">left out of the movie credits</a>, he explained to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo... Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composer tried appealing to Nintendo on other levels about being left in the movie credits, but the company won't be budged, it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Nintendo are notorious sticklers for the rules they lay down, it's hard to see how we'll get 'Grant Kirkhope' (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/random_childish_gambino_sampled_donkey_kong_country_and_david_wise_definitely_approves">Dave Wise</a>, for that matter) appearing in the credits for Donkey Kong Bananza — and he's gonna have to wait and see like the rest of us, we guess — but at least he's remained humorous about the whole thing. "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Of course, we all know Grant is quite the celebrity in the gaming realm, so we don't think he need worry about being forgotten (this writer will shout his name aloud when the rap starts in Bananza).<em><br></em></p>
<p>Now...should...should we all watch it? You only live once, right?</p>

<hr>
<p><em>Feeling good about having the DK Rap stuck in your head for another 26 years? Let us know!</em></p>

			<p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of an expanded partnership with AMD to make next-generation devices, AMD CEO Lisa Su also posted her own statement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a brief video message</a>:</p>
<p><em>AMD and Microsoft are advancing a bold, shared vision for the future of gaming one that enables seamless gameplay across any screen, placing gamers at the center of the experience anywhere. We're so excited to be deepening our relationship with Microsoft and build on the over two decades of partnership, innovation, and trust. From the earliest days of the Xbox 360, to the most advanced consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and S, and the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> ROG Xbox Ally handhelds.</em></p>
<p><em>Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimized chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility, so gamers can access their favorite titles across platforms, delivering on a promise to both gamers and developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Together, we are building a vibrant, open ecosystem that delivers the next generation of graphics and immersive gameplay, powered by AI that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering. From console to cloud to handheld, AMD and Microsoft are building the future of immersive gaming. We are so excited to be working with Microsoft to bring all of this tech to gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>The first products born from this deeper partnership to hit the market will be the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch in late October, according to a recent rumor. The next-generation Xbox consoles aren't likely to be released before 2027. Interestingly, both Microsoft president Sarah Bond and AMD's Lisa Su have underlined that the new chips will also power the Xbox cloud offering, which is currently much less attractive than competitors like NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, whose servers are equipped with more powerful hardware. This should make streaming Game Pass titles way more interesting for subscribers.</p>

Xbox president Sarah Bond said the deal is all about building a "gaming platform" that's always with players. In short, she explained Microsoft wants to build an Xbox experience that isn't&nbsp; "locked to a single store or tied to one device." Microsoft has already shown willing to bring its major franchises to rival platforms like Nintendo Switch and PlayStation and make Xbox Game Pass accessible beyond the Xbox ecosystem. It seems that slowly breaking down those platform barriers remains the plan moving forward.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Aggro Crab and Landfall 'side hustle' Peak has sold 100,000 copies in 24 hours"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/aggro-crab-side-hustle-peak-has-sold-100-000-copies-in-24-hours">Aggro Crab and Landfall 'side hustle' Peak has sold 100,000 copies in 24 hours</a></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>via Game Developer //</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Earlier this year, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Another Crab's Treasure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer Aggro Crab told us it would be pivoting to smaller projects after struggling to secure funding for a big swing.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> has received an update to make its Overture DLC easier to access and play.</p>
<p>The game's director, Jiwon Choi, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-will-have-difficulty-reduced-in-future-update">stated in a video last week</a> an update including "difficulty reduction" was on the way. Now it's here.</p>
<p>Specifically, the DLC can now be accessed from Chapter 5 instead of Chapter 9, as long as you're on your second playthrough.</p>

<p>Further, repeat playthroughs will have reduced monster difficulty, while on a first playthrough certain field monsters will have adjusted stats. I really hope it's those bastard kangaroos that have been nerfed.</p>
<p>This is great news for everybody, except me. It means that if you're on a second playthrough of the game (on NG+), you can now access the DLC earlier. I, however, have already had to do a NG+ speedrun up to the end of Chapter 9 prior to this update just to access the DLC. Sigh.</p>
<p>Still, alongside the DLC, an update for the full game has brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-receive-difficulty-options-in-free-update-alongside-overture-dlc">new easier difficulty options</a>. So even if the DLC's difficulty has put you off (or, like me, you just want to get through the base game quicker), it's easier to do so on a lower setting.</p>
<p>Alongside the balance adjustments, a number of bugs have been fixed, as per the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1627720/view/519716851054280776">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Lies of P has <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001716.000010988.html">now sold over 3m copies</a>, thanks to the release of the Overture DLC. Previously, publisher Neowiz revealed the game had reached 7 million players, but as it was initially released on Xbox Game Pass, these didn't count towards copies sold.</p>
<p>To celebrate, developer Round8 is (according to <a href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=37284">The Elec</a> - thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/lies-of-p-devs-get-bonus-paid-holiday-and-switch-2-consoles-for-hitting-sales-milestone/">VGC</a>) rewarding its employees with a bonus payout, extra holiday, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> console each.

                <p>Earlier this week, Robin "DarkOne" Scott announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nexus-mods-changing-owners-after-two-decades-but-will-remain-community-first-founder-says/1100-6532457/" data-ref-id="1100-6532457">he sold Nexus Mods</a> to a new owner, ending his nearly 24 years as the leader of the site that he founded in 2001. Scott has indicated that he will remain with Nexus Mods in some capacity while guiding the overall direction of the site. The new owner, Chosen, has also spoken out to assure fans that the valuable resource won't be adding "aggressive monetization" or suddenly place mods behind a paywall.</p><p>Referred to by their Nexus Mods names in a statement from Scott, Foledinho (Victor), Rapsak (Marinus), and Taagen (Nikolai) are the three partners in Nexus Mods' ownership under <a href="https://wearechosen.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chosen</a>. This led to fears among players that they collectively plan to monetize the site and exploit the user base for short-term gains. In <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a post on Nexus Mods</a>, Foledinho told fans that "mods will always be free."</p><p>For the most part, Foledinho's message was that few things would change. He went on to say that Chosen doesn't claim ownership of any mods, nor will it charge users to download them. Foledinho indicated that Lifetime Premium subscriptions and free accounts will stay as they are, and he expressed admiration for the way Scott monetized the site in 2007.</p><p>"Honestly, we think it was done right," noted Foledinho. "It enabled healthy growth while supporting the community. We have no plans to change the core of how Premium works. It gives users choice based on their needs--and that’s a good thing."</p><p>"Monetization is hard and Nexus Mods is a complex platform," added Foledinho. "What matters most is continuing to support mod authors, delight users, and keep the lights on. We're not changing the core model. No aggressive monetization. No paid mods. If anything, we're aiming for fewer ads, not more. We'll take a community-first, listening approach, and we won't compromise on what's made Nexus Mods special."</p><p>In a follow-up message, Chosen affirmed its commitment to maintaining the diversity and inclusion approach that Scott embraced during his ownership stint.</p><p>For now, Chosen seems to have said all the right things to assure fans that nothing will fundamentally change. However, Foledinho didn't specify how the leadership team plans to reduce ads on the site without losing the income they bring in.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 12pm UK:</strong> Nintendo has confirmed to Eurogamer the "out now" message seen on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> advert is incorrect.</p>
<p>Further, the company has confirmed both versions of the game are not yet available, and remain scheduled for "2025".</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 9.30am UK:</strong> An advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond has reportedly been photographed on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now".</p>
<p>Officially, the game is only due for release at some point this year, so the discovery of this advert has sparked hope a release is imminent.</p>
<p>The images, reportedly taken at Oxford Circus, have not been verified. Eurogamer has contacted Nintendo for confirmation of Metroid Prime 4's release date.</p>

<p>Still, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit post</a> does include multiple images from different angles, so it certainly appears real. So what's going on?</p>
<p>At the very least, Metroid Prime 4 is certainly not "out now". It's not available to purchase on the eShop, and it seems unlikely Nintendo would shadow drop it.</p>
<p>Instead, this is likely a mistake: either the advertising company has mistakenly put the advert up too early, or a "coming soon" sign of some sort is meant to cover the "out now" part for removal later. Either way, we're awaiting official clarification from Nintendo.</p>
<p>As the advert is specifically for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> Edition, it includes: support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support.</p>
<p>The game is also set for release on the original Switch, presumably at the same time.</p>
<p>After years of waiting, the hugely anticipated sci-fi adventure received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer in June last year</a>. A deeper look at the game was provided during the March Nintendo Direct, where <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">Samus' psychic powers were revealed</a>.</p>
<p>I was able to play Metroid Prime 4 at the Nintendo Switch 2 preview event in London and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">tested out its variety of control options</a>. Mouse controls certainly work well enough, but I'm not convinced it'll be the most comfortable way to play on your sofa.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nothing is more powerful, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> and its -likes teach us, than a good corner from which to lurk and swing sharp objects at conga lines of investigating idiots, each somehow convinced that although he just watched four mates get blade-battered in that exact spot by some murdercrazed invisible entity, he will personally be the one that overcomes the unassailable instant death corner with all his favourite bits intact.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slaughter-void">Slaughter Void</a> this lethal arcade <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> speaks of, although, hang on: it's got its own creation myth, in which a betrayed deity unleashes her anguish and makes everything at least 60% more violent and shit than it was previously. The claret-spattered cosmic psychedelia was enough to sucker me in alone, but there's some nicely written fiction here too. It's the kind that just pokes its horns through the walls occasionally, giving you enough of a sense of the entire beast to feel like you're entering somewhere with history, without bogging down all that good good corner slaughter.</p>

<p>Where the stated Diablo influences start to creep in is through a few neat combat twists that transform Hotline Miami's crests and lulls of situational disempowerment into a sort of weaving tactical bloodlust. You'll still get squished instantly if you slip up, but you get temporary armour and speed boosts for kill streaks, and you can access both ranged and melee at the same time. There's also a fat area-of-effect super for dealing with groups. Features ahoy:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Fast paced, brutal action:</strong> Combat in SLAUGHTER VOID is quick and merciless. A single hit will kill you, but the same goes for (most of) your enemies- agility and aggression are essential.</p>
<p><strong>Be your own harbinger of destruction:</strong> Through a deluge of hand-crafted levels, carve your own bloody path with unique combinations of weapons and relics to achieve maximum slaughter.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Dismemberment:</strong> Quick death is not enough. The faster you kill, the more havoc you wreak upon your foes, severing and splattering them into multiple pieces. The more you slaughter, the more you reap, harvesting valuable loot from their corpses to spend on upgrades, items, and more.</p>
<p><strong>To the Victor the Spoils:</strong> Compete to be the fastest on the leaderboards as you decimate enemies from this gore-soaked void to the next.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730700/Slaughter_Void_Demo/">demo on Steam here</a>. More importantly, you can switch out your axe for a very large hammer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following on from his previous PlayStation blog contribution (more on that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-director-vows-to-deliver-a-respectful-representation-of-japan-on-par-with-ghost-of-tsushima"><u>here</u></a>), Fox yet again emphasized the team’s commitment to portraying feudal Japan in a respectful way, this time focusing on the efforts they made to represent the culture of the Ainu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ainu are an indigenous people from north Japan, especially Japan’s northernmost main island of Hokkaido, which provides Ghost of Yotei’s setting. Their language, culture, beliefs, and traditions are distinctly different from the Yamato (also known as Wajin), the main ethnic group that makes up the overwhelming majority of Japan’s population today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ghost of Yotei is set at a pivotal point in the history — 1603 was the year the Tokugawa Shogunate was formed by Tokugawa Ieyasu, one of Japan’s great unifiers, putting an end to decades of civil war. Edo (now Tokyo) became Japan’s center of power, ushering in the peaceful Edo period in which Japan’s culture and society blossomed. However, at this time, Hokkaido was still a wild, sparsely populated island home to the Ainu, its formidable winter snow and rugged landscape making it a tough place to live.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When setting a game in Hokkaido we knew a crucial element was doing our best to represent Ainu culture in a respectful way,” Nate Fox explained. “Thankfully we’d connected with an Ainu cultural adviser before setting out on our reference gathering trip.” Not only that, but they were invited by the adviser to meet her family, which led to the Ghost of Yotei team getting to forage for vegetables in the mountains. “It was a lovely way to make new friends and start our journey in learning about Ainu culture. That night we resolved to put foraging into our new game, we wanted players to be able to share (our) experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Fox, the Ghost of Yotei team spent part of their research gathering trip in Oshima Peninsula, the southern part of Hokkaido that is closest to Japan’s main island of Honshu. In the 1600s, this was the domain of Matsumae clan, who would be given exclusive rights by the Tokugawa government to trade with the Ainu living further north. Fox observed that there are signs even today of how the mainland Japanese people of this time rarely lived any further north of Oshima. There is a “proliferation of cherry trees on the peninsula, brought there from Honshu, yet uncommon in the rest of the island. That really told the story of how sparsely settled Hokkaido was in 1603 by the Wajin people,” he noted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve tried to mimic that quality in the game, leaning into areas of wilderness between homesteads.” This rugged wilderness will provide a backdrop for protagonist Atsu’s quest to take revenge on those who killed her family.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox and the team also went to the Nibutani Ainu Museum with their Ainu cultural adviser. Traditional Ainu houses (called <a href="https://daisetsu-kamikawa-ainu.jp/en/story/chise/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>cise</u></a>) differ from traditional Japanese houses. The museum trip “really helped us get a sense for sorts of objects we’d see in the game and how they were used.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We can get a glimpse of the inside of an Ainu house, with its large central hearth, in Ghost of Yotei’s official release date trailer (around the 2-minute mark). The woman protagonist Atsu is talking to in this scene seems to be Ainu, as she has a lip tattoo. This symbol of beauty for the Ainu would later be cracked down on by the Japanese government in the late 1800s, after it had fully annexed Hokkaido (source: <a href="https://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/SeasonCulture/event/2020/202001/16_Daiwa_MeaningofTattoos.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Embassy of Japan in the UK</u></a>). By then, measures to force Ainu to abandon their language and culture and integrate into Japanese society were in full swing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side note, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_33/August_1888/Ainu_Houses_and_their_Furnishing" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>J.K Goodrich’s 1888 account </u></a>of Ainu houses paints a first-hand picture of the contrast, and complicated relations between the Ainu and Japanese at this time.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yōtei Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fox also touched on the time that the Ghost of Yotei team spent learning about Edo period Japan, which took them to Nikko Toshogu, one of the shrines in Japan dedicated to the unifying shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, who kickstarted the Edo period. “While there we obtained a blessing for the game from the enshrined deity, Tokugawa Ieyasu,” Fox explained, adding that they proudly display the ema (wooden plaque) and omamori (protective charm) that they obtained from Nikko Toshogu at the studio as reminders of their trip.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reflecting on the research trip, Fox explained that “while our version of Hokkaido is fictional, the feeling of authenticity we strive to create has roots in those real world experiences.” It will be interesting to see how Ghost of Yotei portrays the contrast between the Wajin/Edo culture, and that of the Ainu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

                <p>The Switch 2 hasn't even been out for a month yet, but Nintendo is already taking strong measures to make sure pirates can't use the company's new console. Switch 2 owners are sharing stories online that their systems have been banned after using a third-party cartridge that some players have reportedly used for illegal ROMs.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688483/nintendo-switch-2-ban-error-code-mig-flash-cartridge-online" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Nintendo has been targeting systems that have used a MIG Switch cartridge, which can store ROMs that were either illicitly obtained or downloaded from players' personal libraries. Nintendo doesn't appear to have drawn a distinction about how the ROMs ended up in players' hands. If Nintendo detects the MIG Switch, the consoles in question are banned from going online forever.</p><p>The YouTube channel Scattered Brain shared its own report about the issue, and notes that even restoring the Switch 2 to factory settings can't undo the ban. Nintendo considers using the MIG Switch cartridge a violation of the Switch 2 End User License Agreement, and the penalty is a pricey lesson for anyone who doesn't heed the warning.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExgYTA18_vo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ExgYTA18_vo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In retrospect, these measures shouldn't be too surprising considering that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went to great lengths to find an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year who the company accused of selling hardware hacks and offering modified Switch consoles with pirated games.

			<p>Today, 24 Entertainment (the studio behind the successful free-to-play Battle Royale game <a href="https://wccftech.com/naraka-bladepoint-runs-at-nearly-600fps-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-dlss-4-ue5-plugin-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NARAKA: BLADEPOINT</a>) and NetEase Games announced Blood Message, a single player story-driven action/adventure game, with a stunning trailer. Zhipeng Hu, Lead Producer and NetEase Executive Vice President, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message. As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world.</em></p>
<p>The game is set during the final years of the Tang dynasty. As a mere messenger who joined the Dunhuang uprising, players must traverse a treacherous 1,000-mile journey back to Chang'an, the heart of the Tang empire. They must cross lethal landscapes, including desolate deserts and the vast wilderness of East and Central Asia, to survive brutal sieges, unforgiving terrain and overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>The game invites players to step into the shoes of unsung heroes — not emperors or generals, but ordinary people driven by extraordinary resolve. As part of a righteous uprising in Shazhou, Dunhuang, a father and son must navigate a crumbling world, torn between their duty to their country and their love for their family. 24 Entertainment reckons that the world has heard enough stories of emperors and generals, which is why Blood Message is different. The studio also described the game as linear and narrative-driven, not to mention anchored in cinematic storytelling.</p>
<p>Players can look forward to visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics. It will be, according to the developers, a deeply emotional journey exploring themes of family, honor, sacrifice, and cultural identity. Throughout Blood Message, players will traverse expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia, such as Dunhuang.</p>

<p>The game is being developed for PC and consoles, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and enhanced with proprietary technologies crafted by 24 Entertainment. There is no release window yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-has-sold-over-3-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>South Korean developer NEOWIZ has <a href="https://x.com/Liesofp/status/1935850080948699629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the Soulslike game Lies of P has surpassed 3 million copies sold globally.</p>
<p>It had been a while since we got a sales update. The only official one was <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> in October 2023, when NEOWIZ revealed that the game had sold over one million units in less than one month.</p>
<p>Of course, when interpreting Lies of P sales figures, we also have to consider that the game was available on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service from day one. As such, many more gamers will have actually played it. Furthermore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a rumor</a>, the game might be in development for the Nintendo Switch 2. If that's the case, sales could get even higher.</p>
<p>Lies of P recently launched its Overture DLC, which received the same score (8/10) as the base game in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-overture-one-more-lie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a>. Here's a quote from the article:</p>
<p><em>At the end of the day, Lies of P: Overture is an expansion in the true sense of the word. Opting to deliver more of the same, Round8 Studio plays to the game’s strengths, offering an experience every bit as enjoyable as the base game, even with some unfair difficulty that will likely get toned down in time. As such, the DLC is a worthy purchase for those who loved the original and still want more. Those who feel they’ve had their fill or struggled with the game’s quirks the first time around won’t find much to change their minds here, however. For better or worse, it’s more Lies of P.</em></p>
<p>Looking ahead, a Lies of P sequel is all but inevitable considering these sales. NEOWIZ isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, though; we know they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-to-launch-in-q1-2025-neowiz-now-working-on-a-sci-fi-survival-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a sci-fi horror game project, and they've also signed publishing deals with several developers, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-studio-will-publish-an-upcoming-noir-western-rpg-from-ex-cdpr-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ZAKAZANE</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-expands-publishing-portfolio-with-wolfeye-studios-partnership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WolfEye Studios</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/neowiz-will-publish-the-detective-adventure-game-kill-the-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowlight</a>.</p>
