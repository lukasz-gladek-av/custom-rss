To give you an idea of how paltry those capacities are, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/teen-becomes-first-tetris-nes-player-to-clear-level-255-and-achieve-the-mythical-rebirth<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Michael "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga clears level 255 and sends it all the way back to the beginning.</h2></div><section><p>The Tetris community has reached another major milestone, with 16-year-old Michael "dogplayingtetris" Artiaga becoming the first player to clear level 255 and achieve the mythical "rebirth" — community parlance for reaching the game's highest possible level and looping all the way back to the beginning.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/nes-tetris-first-ever-rebirth-loops-past-level-255-and-back-to-zero/?utm_source=bluesky&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=aud-dev&amp;utm_social-type=owned" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ars Technica</a>, Artiaga accomplished the feat in front of hundreds of Twitch viewers, clearing some 3,300 lines over the course of 80 minutes. It's an achievement that was thought to be impossible until techniques like rolling and hypertapping came into play, inspiring a new generation of Tetris pioneers.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">35 years after its release, <a href="https://twitter.com/dogplayingtris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@dogplayingtris</a> just became the first person to get the NES Tetris rebirth. He made it all the way to level 255, then the game wrapped around and restarted from level 0. <a href="https://t.co/Igwa2fIrmJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Igwa2fIrmJ</a></p>— SummoningSalt (@summoningsalt) <a href="https://twitter.com/summoningsalt/status/1842762608627331278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 6, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Notably, Artiaga was playing on a special version of the Tetris NES rom that keeps it from crashing after passing level 155. Earlier this year, Tetris expert and fellow teen Willis "Blue Scuti" Gibson managed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/impossible-tetris-nes-beaten-for-the-first-time-in-34-years-by-13-year-old-phenom">beat Tetris for the first time</a> by hitting one of these crashes on level 157, marking the first ever instance of a human player getting one over on Alexey Pajitnov's classic. After level 157, the crash points continue to proliferate, making them virtually impossible to avoid.</p><p>Still, that doesn't make Artiaga's feat any less impressive. As Ars Technica notes, the NES version of Tetris actually has a glitch in level 235 that results in it taking an incredible 810 lines to clear — an eternity when you're playing at the fastest possible rate. Artiaga spent 20 minutes on this level alone, finally proclaiming that he had "seen the light" when it was finished.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Top 100 Games of All Time (2021 Update)</h3></div></output><p>Artiaga went on to clear level 255 and finally pull off the "rebirth," sending the game all the way back to level 0. Then, incredibly, he kept right on playing, continuing all the way to level 91 before finally giving up. His final score was 29,486,164, breaking the previous world record by Alex Thach by more than 12 million points.</p><p>"Oh my god, I'm so glad that game is over, bro," Artiaga said. "I never want to play this game again, bro... I was starting to lose my mind."</p><p>Fans hailed Artiaga's accomplishment online, not just because he pulled off a world first rebirth, but because he proved that endless play was indeed possible. Now speculation has already begun on who might pull off the first "double rebirth." If records keep falling at the pace that they have been, it shouldn't be long. After all, it's been less than a year since <a href="https://x.com/kobunheat/status/1839852964477055100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Scuti beat Tetris, and he's now crashing it for fun</a>. </p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/epic-games-disney-fortnite-mickey-mouse-gun<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic is talking a big game about its ever-shifting vision of the metaverse again, and as usual, it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-epic-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly word salad</a> presumably meant to whet investors’ appetites. But one detail in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Verge interview</a> with Epic Games EVP Saxs Persson about the company’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/disney-fortnite-d23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1.5 billion partnership with Disney</a> stood out to me. Specifically, this one:</p><blockquote><p>But the partnership doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll be able to run around the <em>Fortnite </em>battle royale island as Mickey Mouse with a gun. “Not every outfit will be able to do everything,” Persson says. “A [Lego] minifig doesn’t hold a gun. Brands should be able to enforce the brand guidelines to the degree that they’re comfortable with that brand being associated with particular ratings.”&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>For the moment, this is a presumption on The Verge’s part – not a statement of fact from Epic or Disney. Still, it certainly sounds plausible given the conditions Epic has laid out: Epic and Disney will offer separate “front doors” into the same interconnected, Epic-powered universe where different characters will play by different rules depending on family friendliness. “Some IPs are not teen IPs or mature IPs,” Persson told The Verge. “They are E for everyone IPs.”</p><p>This corporation-controlled, hyper-sanitized vision of the future is pretty par for the course as far as these things go, but I will nonetheless balk at one element of it: Mickey Mouse, specifically, <em>should </em>be allowed to wield a gun. The case for, as far as I’m concerned, is stronger than the case against. To begin, Epic has already put guns in the hands of <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?type=outfit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous characters</a> who’d never otherwise be caught dead – or in this case, killing – with them.&nbsp;</p><p>These include Aang from <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, who spent his series’ entire final arc searching for a way to avoid killing its biggest villain, and Spider-Man, who generally refuses to kill people, as well as Disney mainstays who feel, at best, out of character firing a gun, like Jack Skellington from <em>A Nightmare Before Christmas</em> and, <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3551687/now-officially-official-disney-owns-alien-predator-franchises/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">technically</a>, the Xenomorph from <em>Alien</em>, who simply does not need a gun. It’s also weird to see Naruto and his friends gun down all who oppose them, though I will acknowledge that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/y5oxhk/references_to_guns_in_naruto_despite_guns_not/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns exist in the <em>Naruto </em>universe</a> despite rarely being seen outside early episodes.</p><p>More importantly, Mickey Mouse has held a gun in his iconic gloved hands on multiple occasions. For example, there’s <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Two-Gun_Mickey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Two-Gun Mickey,”</a> a 1934 cartoon in which both Mickey and Minnie use guns for their intended purpose: Wild West rootin’, tootin’, and shootin’. There’s also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrBvxHI5wFc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 1938 cartoon called “Mickey’s Parrot”</a> in which Mickey grabs a shotgun to fend off what he perceives to be a home invader (it’s actually a parrot). Much more recently, there is a level in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1522160/Disney_Epic_Mickey_Rebrushed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently-remastered</a> 2010 video game <em>Epic Mickey</em> – literally a combination of the words “Epic” and “Mickey,” though not developed by Epic Games – called “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNXwsbnzpAc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Great Guns</a>” that’s set during World War I and sees Mickey platform his way through streams of gun- and cannon-fire. Relatedly, Mickey Mouse also <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/BQXhuqy5geSMLA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared on real-life World War II war bonds</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be noted that I am not personally a fan of <a href="https://kotaku.com/real-guns-virtual-guns-and-me-1824159338" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guns</a> or the extent to which they permeate culture in the United States. Nonetheless, when it comes to nauseatingly corporate fictional settings, I believe in two things: fairness and unintentional comedy. If you’re going to force my sweet boy Goku – who refused to kill even Frieza, a confirmed genocider – to wave around cold, unfeeling steel instead of the beautiful and pure life energy of the Spirit Bomb, then Mickey deserves the same treatment. Anything less would be an insult to his legacy of sporadically packing heat. Let Mickey Mouse have a gun. It’s the right thing to do.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/talking-death-roll-show-camp-rend-horror-and-indie-production-with-frankie-and<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Death Roll Show is a new indie TTRPG Actual Play with a focus on taking different horror styles and adapting them into short anthology adventures. On October 11th the first season of Death Roll Show: Camp Rend will be released. To talk about Camp Rend, indie TTRPG creations, and how to get your own start in the space I sat down with the Creator, Executive Producer, and DM for Camp Rend, Frankie Nicks, as well as Producer and performer, KP.</p>
<p>As always I like to start at the beginning so I asked Nicks how the premise for Death Roll Show originated. Nicks explained that a friend of his owns a production company that focuses on creating "B-movie horror type special effects and gore" Nicks explained that he's been attempting to get his friend to do a project with him but "he just has never been interested. He's not big into TTRPG or <em>D&amp;D</em>. I think he played a couple of times in High School when I dragged him along. Every time I pitched it he didn't get it, I ended up finally getting him to watch <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="55a80c6c-ea7c-4151-9523-d332db6f6cd5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/how-brennan-lee-mulligan-created-never-stop-blowing-up-love-letter-to-80s">Dropout </a>enough to where he got interested and he really appreciated how Dropout as a company was structured with lots of employee involvement and profit sharing and so then I was able to show him Dimension 20, show him how successful those things were so to get the company involved I pitched 'we could do something horror related'"</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//_1SkLBNVn5Y"></iframe></p>
<p>Nicks explained that he had always had a love of horror growing up "Obviously <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="15ae2b87-cf24-463c-b903-4dadaf6c28ea" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/friday-13th-horror-at-camp-crystal-lake-review"><em>Friday the 13th</em></a> and all that stuff, but I was more into the weird kinda stuff like catseye that always had little stories. That's where I got the anthology idea because I also wanted to pitch it in a way that would be smart commercially." Nicks rallied off the benefits of keeping it small in the TTRPG space, it would need just a single location, minimal set work, and they could shoot all four episodes in a day.</p>
<p>Camp Rend is a slasher season that will focus on a group of campers and their camp counselors as if something is attacking them. Referencing back to his last answer about creating something easily definable Nicks explained "we chose this genre specifically because not only a love for everything of the 80s and the past, but being on a short budget we could use a VHS filter in editing to hide production"</p>
<p>Nicks took me behind the production curtain a bit explaining that there was a lot of planning that went into making sure they could create as high a production end product knowing that they didn't have the budget to have 6 Production Assistants on hand-checking every single shot.</p>
<p>As I heard from both Nicks and KP it was clear to see not just how much passion they had for the project, but also how much respect they had for all of the work each other and the entire production crew and cast had put into creating Camp Rend. Each was constantly trying to follow up from the other making corrections to ensure each got the credit they were due.</p>

<p>Nicks also spoke about his aspirations for what a second season and beyond would look like. Writing for Camp Rend began only six month ago, knowing that these productions can be small and turned around on a tight schedule.</p>
<p>"What I'm glad about the team is we're all very positive and looking toward the horizon in what we want to do. We have ideas for a Sci-Fi one, a very cult-like/witchy vibe one almost <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e47e5379-5686-451a-9164-1641ecae29eb" href="https://techraptor.net/games/blair-witch"><em>Blair Witch Project</em></a> style." KP explained to me "Not only in terms of storyline wise but also in terms of how can it be manifested on-screen in a unique way."</p>
<p>KP teased that they already have three or four ideas for ways they could introduce interesting mechanics, such as the Jenga Block tower, to other settings to create distinct experiences.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Camp Rend Is A Unique <em>D&amp;D</em>-Hybrid Experience</h2>
<p>Camp Rend uses <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> as its base, each of the characters are built to level 5 using the<em> D&amp;D</em> rules, but there's an added twist that the Jenga Block tower system from <em>Dread </em>is implemented to assist with ever-increasing stakes.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=gFSfZwsD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-campground-scene.jpg?itok=R309uR9g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>"The biggest [mechanic] you can see from our trailer is using the Jenga Tower" KP explained "Using that as a system to elevate the stress and impact of decisions that are being made. D&amp;D and all of these games players are typically very powerful and it's very easy to lose that sense of dread. We wanted to bring that back into the show and ensure that as players and characters we felt the fear that came from being in the situation."</p>
<p>Nicks explained "I was trying to find a way to increase the stakes. I tried a couple of different things first, I tried some test games borrowing adversity tokens from Kids on Bikes, trying an anti-adversity system, I workshopped a system with a skill game with a bar but I kept coming back to the tower."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's perfect because it's a little bit of skill involved but there is a rule that if you touch it you take it, so no tippy tappies"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A look of disbelief and shellshock came over KPs face as this rule was disclosed. He reinforced that the consequences were very real in the game and it's not something that any rules in D&amp;D can save you from.</p>
<p>KP and Nicks started to reference a moment from the trailer as KP pulled a block. KP highlighted how real the feeling of success was for him in that moment. Nicks added laughing that that was the moment he thought "Ok, we might have something here. That was the proof of concept. I wanted to find a way to bring up the tension but as more blocks are pulled you know it's going to be harder."</p>

<p>On top of the Jenga Tower another unique aspect to appeal to the audience is the live battle damage that will occur to the players as they get in danger.</p>
<p>Colin Fleetwood, the director, got the kudos for coming up with the idea of adding blood, but Nicks explained it was something they stumbled into. "When Colin accepted a deal and we got to talking production details it came about because he didn't understand the medium completely."</p>
<p>Nicks described miscommunications on the need for a set, Fleetwood believing it would take all of their budget before Nicks explained it just needed to be a static space with a table "like a play".</p>
<p>"When I was trying to explain that if I beat his armor class I could cut him and he said 'do they get damaged?' and I explained yeah they might have a gash and he said 'so we'll do the makeup for that?'" Through conversation they were able to figure out that blood could be set up in 5-30 minutes</p>
<p>Nicks joked that he hadn't seen anything like that in AP before, a progression of battle damage, and right as they were filming Dimension 20's latest season <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b02fe4e6-1370-402b-a680-949a73bfa736" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/ify-nwadiwe-and-jacob-wysocki-chat-never-stop-blowing-up-being-new-at-table-and"><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> had DM Brennan Lee Mulligan</a> get bloodier with each episode.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-roll-show-bloody-campers.jpg?itok=yjShqtDS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-roll-show-bloody-campers.jpg?itok=w1KWECqQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Meeting Camp Councelor Virin</h2>
<p>KP took some time to introduce me to his character for Camp Rend, Camp Councelor Virin. "He is all about the camp, this is probably his second or third year working at Camp Rend. He comes from a local druid circle in the nearby forest and he does not like it. He hates the idea of being stuck in the past and being all nature-esce:</p>
<p>We shared laughs as both of our thoughts turned to the idea that Virin was a druid on the equivalent of his rumspringa.</p>
<p>KP expressed his love for being part of Death Role Show not only as a player, but that it was a production that made him feel like it was something he helped create. "When I was on the show and I got to experienc ethe story and the production I personally felt in that moment no one else is doing something like this, it's very cool and I'm imagining how we can take this to the next level. As someone who came from a Project Management background I know how I can help, what is a Producer but a Product Manager for the media world."</p>
<p>From there KP was able to get involved in creating pitch decks, crafting a media kit, and took over the reigns of the social media for Death Roll Show. The key of it all is that KP expressed his desire to make sure Death Roll Show could be a complete success.</p>

<p>Knowing that Nicks and KP had taken the first of many difficult steps into the realm of Actual Plays, playing on different tables and now producing their own shows I wondered what tips could be offered to those who might be hesitant to take their first steps.</p>
<p>For Nicks he was able to immediately offer what might be simple advice to hear, but to put in practice is much harder. "Keep trying, don't give up. I know that sounds lame but when I first started auditioning I had a very bad experience. It soured me on it and I almost left. You're going to have bad experiences, we know in this world there are gatekeepers and bad actors but a run in with one of those can sour you. Just work through that at your own pace and if you can get to the other side of it there are amazing people you'll get to meet."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Think big, if you have an idea and you think it's good then think big"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>KPs advice came from a bit of a stranger place, an adult film director, who said "Everyone is fuckable" After pausing to laugh for a moment KP took the time to explain what he meant. "There's someone out there that will look at you and think 'I will smash that' and for any idea that you have there is someone out there that will see it and say 'I want to smash that idea.'"</p>

You have to remember even if you have ten people who watch your show you have to remember what ten people in a room looks like. When you see a number that looks like 100, compared to others that might seem small but you've got to imagine 100 people watching you perform. I feel like we're losing our perspective on how big that is."</p>
<h2>Short And Sweet Story</h2>
<p>Death Roll Show's first season, Camp Rend will start airing on the 10th of October and will air for the next four Thursdays concluding on Halloween night. KP did make a joke about how there is another Actual Play that airs on Thursdays that "a lot of people tend to be Critical about" but reinforced the idea that their episodes aren't just airing earlier but will each be in the 45-60 minute range making it easier to digest.</p>

            <p>
Pathologic, the acclaimed plague-themed horror series from developer Ice-Pick Lodge, is returning for a third instalment, this time slinging time travel into its gruelling, emotionally draining mix of intentionally dispiriting survival and haunting theatrics.
</p>
<p>
The newly announced Pathologic 3 is something of an oddity in that it's technically, sort of, the second chunk of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> - itself a half sequel and half (much-improved) remake of Ice-Pick Lodge's cult-classic 2005 original. Pathological 1 - which, as with all entries in the series, charts the sudden decline of a strange, small town on the edge of the Russian Steppe as it slowly succumbs to a mysterious plague - memorably had three playable characters and three distinct routes through its 12 days of increasing misery: that of Artemy Burakh (the Haruspex), Daniil Dankovsky (the Batchelor), and Clara (the Changeling).
</p>
<p>
Due to financial concerns, however, only the Haruspex path made it into Pathologic 2, and while Dankovsky did appear as the protagonist in a short standalone episode, titled The Marble Nest, his full path will now be the focus of Pathologic 3 - albeit significantly expanded.
</p>

<p>
Dankovsky is a young doctor and expert in thanatology who travels to Pathologic's mysterious town at the start of the outbreak in order to advance his research on death. As with the Haruspex's path, Dankovsky has 12 days to stop the plague, using all the tools of his medical trade. He can, explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">Pathologic 3's Steam page</a>, examine potions and diagnose diseases, cross-check symptoms and prescribe treatments, impose quarantines and curfews, confiscate medicine, vaccinate the population, deploy patrols, and more. 
</p><p>
Crucially, though, Dankovsky now also wields the power of time, and can travel forward to witness the future, or go backward to correct mistakes of the past. "Anything you see can tell a story and become a piece of your mental map of the world," explains Ice-Pick. "Explore the town for new insights, notice details, and connect the dots. Uncover the secrets of the town's inhabitants. Shape their stories, decide their fates, and talk to their shadows."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much everything we know about Pathologic 3 right now, but  the current plans is to release it for PC some time next year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can%E2%80%99t-afford-to-ignore-these-tasks-before-diving-into-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred.1003206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/before-playing-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The first major expansion for Diablo 4 is finally upon us, with a brand-new class—Spiritborne—a new zone to explore, unique gameplay mechanics, and major reworks and overhauls for core gameplay systems that totally revamp how you play Diablo 4. It’s a lot to ingest, and it’s easy for new and returning players to feel overwhelmed. Well, to help you out, we’ve compiled a few of the things you should do before Vessel of Hatred!</p>



<h2 id="h-change-campaigns">Change Campaigns</h2>



<p>After purchasing and downloading Vessel of Hatred, upon release, you’ll want to start a brand-new character to dive into the expansion and subsequent season. However, the game doesn’t jump straight into the new content. You need to tell it where to go.</p>



<p>At the end of character creation, you can ‘Change Campaign State’ to ‘Start with the Vessel of Hatred Campaign,’ and you absolutely should choose this option. Otherwise, you’ll start either in Kyovashad once again, like every other prior season, or you’ll begin the main Diablo 4 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-campaign-diablo-4-before-new-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story mode from the beginning</a>. Well, you’ll still start in Kyovashad, but there’s a quest in the main city to kickoff the new expansion.</p>



<h2 id="h-acquire-renown-and-altars-of-lilith">Acquire Renown and Altars of Lilith</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>You’ll want to run through Sanctuary acquiring every single Altar of Lilith and increasing your Renown within each zone. Every Altar provides a unique buff, usually additional stat bonuses, like Dexterity or Strength, along with the occasional Murmuring Obol capacity increase or an extra Paragon Point. They’re worthwhile, as starting a new character with all of the Altars provides you a significant power buff straight out of the gate.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Renown allows you to claim bonus XP, gold, skill points, additional Potion Capacity, Max Obols, and Paragon Points from the Region Progress hub, which is, once again, a nice power buff for a new character!</p>



<h2 id="h-focus-on-mercenaries">Focus on Mercenaries</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure>



<p>After starting a new character and venturing from Kyovashad to Nahantu, the blacksmith Rahair will introduce you to the new Mercenary mechanics, which allow you to bring an NPC companion along with you. They’re immensely useful when you want to play solo and clear content quickly. Oh, and a second one will occasionally pop up to deal damage before disappearing into the night.</p>



<p>But first and foremost, before you get too excited and leap headfirst into the Vessel of Hatred campaign, complete the Mercenary missions to increase your rapport with each new character. The unique abilities each Mercenary unlocks with Rapport XP really does make a difference in the new content.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-about-vessel-of-hatred">What You Need to Know About Vessel of Hatred</h2>



<p>Before diving into all of the new content available in Diablo 4, there’s a few things you should know beforehand, as a lot of key changes come to the game alongside the new expansion, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>This first expansion includes a level squish, bringing the max player level down from 100 to 60.</li>



<li>The World Tier difficulty system is completely revamped and now includes Torment-like tiers instead of World Tier I-IV.</li>



<li>The max Paragon level is now 300.</li>



<li>Everyone receives two new character slots.</li>



<li>Every class receives additional Skills and Passives</li>



<li>Party Finder is finally in the game for group content.</li>



<li>Seasonal content and rewards</li>
</ul>



<p>Specifically to those who purchase the expansion, you will receive:</p>



<ul>
<li>Nahantu</li>



<li>Spiritborne</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatred campaign</li>



<li>Runewords</li>



<li>Dark Citadel</li>



<li>Mercenaries</li>



<li>Kurast Undercity</li>



<li>Vessel of Hatres-specific resource trading mechanics</li>
</ul>



<hr>



<p>Did you know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/diablo-4-has-made-over-1-billion-in-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 4 made over $1 billion in revenue</a>? It’s a positively staggering amount but not surprising in the least bit considering the cost of cosmetics available in the in-game store!</p>

Even if you’ve never watched the iconic anime, you’ve probably heard Harris’ work on the show because the phrase “find out on the next episode of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>” or some variation has become a long-running joke on the internet.</p><p>Harris narrated the show for over 223 episodes between 1996 and 2003, though that role eventually went to Kyle Hebert, who voices Gohan in the anime. Hebert’s take on the narrator is near-identical to Harris’ booming, guttural delivery, so even if he’s been gone from the franchise for 20 years, his impact can still be felt in more recent dubs of the series. Sadly, Jōji Yanami, the narrator for the Japanese version of the series up until his retirement in 2015, passed away in 2021.</p><p>Harris isn’t the only loss the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise has had to endure in 2024, as series creator Akira Toriyama <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/akira-toriyama-dragon-ball-dies-quest-chrono-trigger-1851318780">passed away in March</a></span>.

          <p>The <em>Alien&nbsp;</em>franchise is about uncaring monsters, unfeeling corporations, and horrific, claustrophobic terror. Given this setting, it almost made sense, what happened to the original <em>Alien: Isolation</em>.</p>
<p>The game was released to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-decade-of-alien-isolation-how-creative-assembly-made-an-all-time-horror-classic">positive reviews</a>, is now considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_considered_the_best#2014">one of the best games ever made</a>, and sold more than 2 million copies within its first few months. Despite this, <em>Isolation</em> only got "close to break-even or just about in the black," then-Creative Assembly studio director Tim Heaton <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/web/20170427202334/http://go.skimresources.com/?id=87431X1540261&amp;site=eurogamer.net&amp;xs=1&amp;isjs=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesindustry.biz%2Farticles%2F2015-09-30-sega-europe-were-definitely-on-the-right-track&amp;xguid=&amp;xuuid=638630bcdcb174d5fd1afe32be6f2553&amp;xsessid=&amp;xcreo=0&amp;xed=0&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20170427202705%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true&amp;xtz=0">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> a year after release. With the rapid evolution of AAA game development, that wasn't enough. And so, like a salvage team diverted to a bio-weapon recovery mission, <em>Isolation</em> and its momentum were seemingly <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170427202705/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-04-26-alien-isolation-2-rumour-isnt-true">abandoned</a>.</p>

      Gameplay and review accolades for <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, released 10 years ago today.

<p>Abandoned, that is, until today, the 10th anniversary of that game's 2014 release. The appropriately named Al Hope, creative director of <em>Isolation&nbsp;</em>studio Creative Assembly, <a href="https://x.com/AlienIsolation/status/1843305291322200488">posted on X</a> (formerly Twitter) that his team had "heard your distress calls loud and clear," and could confirm that "a sequel to <em>Alien: Isolation&nbsp;</em>is in early development."</p>
<p>The original game stands out to this day for its bold yet entirely appropriate take on making an&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> game. You play as Amanda Ripley, daughter of iconic heroine Ellen Ripley, working for Weyland-Yutani in a welding job. You get a chance to find out more about what happened to your mother, but—you'll never believe it—things go terribly wrong, and now you are hunted.</p>

                <p>Arizona Cardinals Quarterback Kyler Murray has announced a partnership with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, despite previously being criticized by fans who believed his love of the shooter was impacting his on-field performance. The partnership comes alongside a new Replacer ad, which features the Replacer taking a press conference for Murray.</p><p dir="ltr">Murray announced the partnership deal on <a href="https://x.com/k1/status/1843351187170673149" rel="nofollow ">Twitter</a>, writing, "To the trolls who memed me into a bag, thank you!" Murray is referring to previous criticism he received about playing Call of Duty too much, which came after he signed a new contract with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nfls-patrick-peterson-roasts-kyler-murray-with-video-game-themed-celebration-after-interception/1100-6508760/">"independent study" clause</a>, which was <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/cardinals-remove-independent-study-clause-from-kyler-murray-s-contract">later removed</a>. The clause stated Murray must spend four hours a week focused on studying football film, without other distractions, something that is <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBrandt/status/1551668817348141058">relatively unheard</a> of for starting quarterbacks in the NFL.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsDzb5CWsTY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OsDzb5CWsTY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">After the contract clause was put in the public spotlight, rumors circulated that it was due to Murray playing too much Call of Duty. This led to fans making fun of Murray, even doing breakdowns of his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/weamew/a_statistical_analysis_of_kyler_murrays/" rel="nofollow ">performances on double XP weekends</a> compared to his usual stats. The new ad even references this, with the YouTube description reading "No need to wait for a double XP weekend when you have The Replacer."</p><p dir="ltr">This partnership is one of many ads featuring The Replacer, who used to appear in old Call of Duty ads. The Replacer takes your place at work so you can game, with him appearing as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-brings-back-popular-character-for-black-ops-6-marketing-and-he-pretends-to-be-the-pope/1100-6526771/">Pope for Black Ops 6</a>.

The trailer's contents reveal that Pathologic 3 will see players experience the same events that took place in Pathologic 2, but this time they'll be seeing things through the eyes of Danil Dankovsky, also known as "The Bachelor."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Pathologic 3 - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Set in a small town located in Russia's remote steppes in the early 1900's, Pathologic follows the story of three main characters: Artemy Burakh ("The Haruspex"), a local healer returning to his hometown to address a recent tragedy; Danil Dankovsky ("The Bachelor"), a certified doctor visiting from the city in the hopes of uncovering a scientific breakthrough; and Clara ("The Changeling"), a mysterious young girl who has the ability to save (or end) lives with a single touch of her hands, but has no idea how or why she arrived in the town. There's no word yet regarding when players might get their hands on Clara's version of events, but after the announcement of Pathologic 3, it stands to reason that Clara's playthrough is also in the works.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pathologic/">original Pathologic</a> launched to critical acclaim in Russia in 2005, and also earned a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cult following of players</a> from around the world. The original game was later followed up by a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/384110/Pathologic_Classic_HD/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remastered version</a> featuring better graphics and an improved English translation. Both versions of the game allow players to complete each protagonist's story in its entirety, with each playthrough revealing more info about the strange disease that's rapidly killing the town's inhabitants. Each protagonist must find a cure for the disease using their unique skills, while also working to uncover the truth behind the source of the outbreak. But the game's main characters face far bigger challenges than the plague itself, and must find a way to work around lying NPCs, the general breakdown of law and order as the town gets progressively sicker, and an impending military invasion which is sure to result in the town's destruction if it isn't stopped.</p><p>The series was rebooted in 2019 with the release of Pathologic 2, which only featured Artemy Burakh's storyline--though Ice-Pick Lodge promised the other two playable protagonists were in development. Unfortunately, complications regarding Russia's war in Ukraine (which the game's developers have <a href="https://x.com/IcePickLodge/status/1498269141404463107" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">publicly denounced</a>) caused complications leading to a delay in the release of Danil Dankovsky's storyline. Fans of the franchise have been waiting years for an update regarding the next chapter in the Pathologic franchise, and now--nearly five years later--they finally have it.</p>

		<p>Over the weekend, we finally said goodbye to our dog Pixel. Funny enough, I did not nerd name that dog. She was a chihuahua found on the streets, and the woman who helped rehabilitate her had run out of names for tiny dogs, so she opened up a thesaurus to the word small, her finger landed on "pixel," and the rest was history. It seemed silly to rename her. She was a good dog, like most dogs, even if our children never got a chance to see that side of her. It was a tough decision, but she's in a better place now, wherever that might be. A weight has been lifted, and I will drown my sorrows in lots of spooky media this week.</p><p>-pk, who keeps closing Pixel's gate for the stairs, even if he doesn't have to anymore</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY: </strong>How many times should a person let a fridge malfunction and spoil an entire batch of groceries before you replace it? Find out on the latest episode of HOA, folks! I think if this happened in our home, my wife would flip out so fast over the wasted food—one of her absolute pet peeves—that I wouldn't be allowed to do <em>anything</em> I'd sorted out getting the fridge replaced. Rob and I have also started writing our next letter series, this time focused on the role the movie theater does (or doesn't) play in our lives these days. Oh, and I got to record a patently ridiculous interview you'll hear later this month lol</li><li><strong>TUESDAY:</strong> Even though it's pushing My Turn out of order, we've all seen Francis Ford Coppola's <em>Megalopolis</em>, so we might as well record an episode about watching <em>Megalopolis</em>. You'll hear that next week. Drop your questions in now for what is sure to be an <em>interesting</em> discussion about an <em>interesting</em> movie. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdThqHvDA1mZZitu9DAb33xsWh-ji76_3AD2uhxmkidIrRgug/viewform?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">You can drop any questions or observations about the movie into this form.</a> Also, in the afternoon, Rob and Janet will be playing a lil' soccer with <em>FC 25</em>.</li><li><strong>WEDNESDAY: </strong>We'll record Remap Radio—yes, I've been playing <em>Silent Hill 2</em>—before Rob and Cado hop on Twitch to run through a bunch of games both of them have wanted to try playing. Why not play them in front of you, too? I'll also be guesting on <em>Nextlander </em>to discuss the anthology movie <em>Trick 'r Treat.</em></li><li><strong>THURSDAY:</strong> In the evening, I'll be returning to the world of spooky games. I ordered a night vision web cam that should show up on Wednesday, too. Still figuring out what we're going to play, but a few options I've been kicking around: <em>Mouthwashing, Amnesia: The Bunker</em>, and<em> Unsorted Horror</em>. I'm also still bitter that I've never beaten the <em>Friday the 13th </em>game for the NES. A new daily game? This stream will kick off after I'm able to help get the kids into bed.</li><li><strong>FRIDAY: </strong>Remap Radio will be in your feed nice 'n early. We may toss a bonus stream on the fire, but we're leaving our options open at the moment.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is almost out in early access, and players not well-versed with the game’s mechanics might find the PvP mode a bit troublesome. As we all know, the best defense is a good offense, and this Dragon Ball Sparking Zero Defence guide will take you through this system’s fundamentals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Defending can be tricking in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, as you are always vulnerable to a barrage of explosions, Ki blasts, punches and kicks. When you find yourself in these dire situations, there are 4 Defense mechanics that you can use in Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Guarding, Recovery, Counters and Evasion.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-defend-in-dragon-ball-sparking-zero">How to Defend in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</h2>



<h3 id="h-guarding">Guarding</h3>



<p>Using Guards is the most basic form of Defense in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero. You must press R1/RB while inputting an Up or Down direction to perform a High or Low Guard. Players should know that guarding for too long can also be detrimental, as a Guard Break will put you in a vulnerable position.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-recovery">Recovery</h3>



<p>Recovery is a quick way to get back into action in the game. There are two ways to recover: Ground/Wall recovery, executed by pressing down before hitting a wall or ground, and Dragon Dash recovery, which lets you take the fight back to your opponent directly. It can be performed by pressing up before hitting the ground or wall.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="h-counters">Counters</h3>



<p>Counters is the new Defense system in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, and it can be divided into four parts: Super Perception, Z-Counters, Revenge Counter, and Super Counters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Perception can be performed by holding O/B before getting hit by an opponent’s attack. However, its cost will vary from Ki to Skill count depending on the counterattack. Super Perception will allow players to perform Sonic Sway, which is almost an MUI Goku way to dodge attacks when faced with a Rush Attack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Z-counters must be performed before an opponent hits the player with a Vanishing Assault; you must press R1/RB to execute the move. The Z-Counter continues until one of the players mistimes the input. Also, the damage inflicted will increase depending on how long the Z-Counters the encounter was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Revenge Counters are the best way to get out of a sticky situation. However, they do cost a Skill Count. The Revenge Counter can counter any attack, whether melee or blast attack and can also be used while you are being attacked. It is one of the strongest defense moves in Dragon Ball Sparking Zero and can be performed by pressing the R3/R stick.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Counter is another move players can use for most attacks, and it can be used when being attacked, too. However, timing is critical. To perform this move, press up along with Square/X and send your opponent flying away.</p>

<h3 id="h-evasion-nbsp">Evasion&nbsp;</h3>



<p>The last defense system for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is Evasion, and players can evade in two ways; High-Speed Evasion and Step-in Sway. High-Speed Evasion is performed by pressing R1/RB right before specific attacks to evade them and create an opening for a counter. Step-in Sway allows you to evade an attack by pressing X/A and R1/RB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a big week last week for Cloud9’s Valorant team, as the competitors walked out of the Red Bull Home Ground North American Qualifier with first place. With Sentinels falling back in second place, Cloud9 will now advance to the Red Bull Home Ground Finals, taking place towards the end of November.</p>



<p>Cloud9’s North American Valorant Team Manager, <a href="https://twitter.com/johnnypulatie">Johnny Pulatie</a>, gave his thoughts in an exclusive interview with Insider Gaming exiting the event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cloud9-valorant-team-manager-discusses-competition-after-team-qualifies-to-berlin">Cloud9 Valorant Team Manager Discusses Competition After Team Qualifies to Berlin</h2>



<p>With the North American qualifier officially over and Cloud9 now preparing for the Finals in Berlin, Johnny Pulatie had quite a bit of insight to share following the event.</p>



<p>“With how important Red Bull Home Ground is to Cloud9 and to continue our storied history with the main event, we knew we had to bring together the best roster possible to compete in and win the NA Qualifier,” said Pulatie in an exclusive interview.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team had been working to prepare for the event while also having to bring in a few stand-ins, who were not able to practice with the team before the tournament began in Seattle. </p>



<p>“Our highest priority was to sit down as a team to walk through our game plan for the event and make everyone on the team as comfortable as possible. We knew that if we were comfortable, we would naturally enter the flow state and be able to dominate any team.”</p>



<p>This comfortability clearly showed through the team’s competitiveness during the qualifier after Cloud9 beat Team Sentinels 2-0 in the Finals.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pulatie-discusses-grand-finals-in-berlin-and-how-the-team-is-preparing">Pulatie Discusses Grand Finals in Berlin and How the Team is Preparing</h2>



<p>Now, the team will have to face the real challenge, as the players prepare to travel to Berlin this November for the Red Bull Home Ground Finals. After competing last year in the Japan Finals, Cloud9 is ready to continue its legacy as one of the best Valorant teams out there.</p>



<p>“The team is currently boot camping at the T1 facility in Seoul, South Korea to make sure the team chemistry, culture, teamwork, and comfortability are high right away so we can hit the ground running,” said Pulatie.</p>



<p>The event will take place from November 20 to 23, 2024, giving fans quite the action to make up for VCT being in its off-season. Cloud9’s North American Valorant team will also be competing in the 20254 Sentinels City Classic, which is set to take place at the beginning of November in Los Angeles, California.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/pathologic-3-revealed-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pathologic 3 has been revealed by Ice-Pick Lodge and HypeTrain Digital, with this being a follow up to Pathologic 2 which was released in 2019. Pathologic 2 was actually a reboot of the original Pathologic that was released in 2005. That had three characters who were the Changeling, the Haruspex, and the Bachelor. The 2019 reboot focused solely on the Haruspex, while Pathologic 3 will focus on the Bachelor.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pathologic 3 Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zb0C2WYUjkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pathologic 3, The Bachelor is a doctor who has come to the small town in an attempt to find an immortal man, and defeat death. The Bachelor only has 12 days to complete this impossible mission, but he has an advantage as he access to a time travel mechanic. While trying to defeat death, players will also be influencing events in the town, and trying to help the townspeople as an epidemic sweeps through the population.</p>
<p><span>Ice Pick Lodge founder Nikolay Dybowski, said, “<em>We are making a game about how a person develops their mind to learn how to work with things they previously couldn’t or didn’t know how to notice. Our goal is to understand what this means for the player. Right now, the most pressing issue for me seems to be rethinking our habitual understanding of how our mind works—how to use it without getting into trouble or losing ourselves. That’s why I want to create gameplay that touches on this theme. The Bachelor sees himself as a man of intellect. We can describe the concept of this mechanic as surrealist time management. Our goal is to give the player a sense that time is more complex than we typically perceive it—as a linear path. We want to show the player the possibility of existing in a world that is disassembled and functions in a way quite different from what we’re used to expecting.”</em></span></p>

<p>Pathologic 3 is due to release in 2025 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

			<p>Silent Hill 2 director Masashi Tsuboyama <a href="https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842185991496614263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took to X</a> to talk about his feelings on the remake that's due to launch tomorrow. Tsuboyama-san, who has since worked in the art department of a few Nintendo games (most recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yoshis-crafted-world-crafty-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yoshi's Crafted World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/princess-peach-showtime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Princess Peach: Showtime!</a>), criticized differences like 4K, 'photorealism', and the bonus headgear, labeling as mediocre. However, he praised the camera change as a major improvement for the remake.</p>
<p><em>I think the value of the Silent Hill 2 remake is that a new generation can play it. As a creator, I'm very happy about it. It's been 23 years! Even if you don't know the original, you can just enjoy the remake as it is. Whether it's good or bad doesn't affect the original.</em></p>
<p><em>The differences between the original and the remake, 4K, Photorealism, the bonus headgear, etc. are all mediocre. Who is this promotion going to appeal to? It seems like they're not doing enough to convey the appeal of the work to the generation that doesn't know Silent Hill.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing to note is the change in camera (perspective). The change in playable camera has a significant impact on many aspects, combat, level design, art creation, etc. While the impact on the story may be relatively small, it brings a big change to the playfeel of the game. To be honest, I'm not satisfied with the playable camera from 23 years ago. Depth and angle were limited by the processing load. It was a continuous process of hard work that was not rewarded. But that was the limit. </em><em>The over-the-shoulder view definitely adds to the sense of realism. In other words, it makes me want to try playing the even more immersive remake of Silent Hill 2.</em></p>
<p>The Silent Hill 2 remake officially launches tomorrow, although pre-orders of the digital deluxe already have access to the game, and user reviews on Steam are already overwhelmingly positive (96%). This lines up with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own review of the game</a>, where Chris Wray wrote:</p>
<p><em>So, shall I succinctly finish this? Silent Hill 2 is scary, atmospheric, polished, and fun (or as fun as a game like this can be). It is great, the best game by the Bloober Team, and proof that, somewhere in the organisation, someone in Konami knows what needs to be done, and they must be nurtured.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragori-games-announces-tanares-expeditions-epic-pirate-adventure-board-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dragori Games has announced a new board game coming to Gamefound. The game is <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em>, a swashbuckling pirate adventure set in the studio's original fantasy setting.</p>
<h2>The Tanares Expeditions Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players. It is a standalone experience where players take on the role of pirate heroes as they attempt to stop something from drowning the world of Tanares in corruption and despair. The game will feature four brand-new heroes, with more to come in the future.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=4zjjvn1R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tanares-expeditions-dragon-miniature.jpg?itok=3De-FjXb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay of <em>Tanares Expeditions</em> is a blend of a classic dungeon-crawler and a roguelite. Through quests, characters will grow stronger, allowing them to develop powerful combos. Combos are a staple of Tanares' series gameplay, allowing you to engage in combat even when it isn't your turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While designing the mechanics and pace of Expeditions, I aimed to capture what fans truly love about Tanares while introducing something fresh and exciting," explains Alexandre Aboud, lead game designer for Expeditions. "Inspired by the fantastic Slay the Spire, players can expect constant adaptation and growth with the new roguelite-inspired mechanics we're bringing.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea</em> is the latest entry in the Tanares adventure series. It began in 2018 with Dragori's first game, <em>Arena: The Contest</em> in 2018. Since then, the studio has expanded the series through several successfully crowdfunded board games.</p>
<p>These projects include <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/dragori-games/tanares-adventures-ultimate-edition"><em>Tanares Adventures</em></a>, a co-op adventure that garnered critical acclaim, and over $2.8 million during its initial campaign, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg"><em>Tanares RPG</em></a>, a TTRPG using the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>D&amp;D</em></a> 5e ruleset set in the world of high fantasy, political intrigue, and eldritch horror.</p>
<p>At time of writing, details are scarce on Tanares Expeditions: Central Sea. Its Gamefound campaign is currently <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dragorigames/tanares-rpg">in preview</a>, but will officially launch November 19.</p>

The original game used <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/hSvs_7JkLUA?si=t6QF5F8GOmTtVQXP&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/hSvs_7JkLUA?si=t6QF5F8GOmTtVQXP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a somewhat static camera</a></span> that roughly followed the player as they moved around. While some hardcore fans believe this camera is superior to the easier-to-use system found in the remake, it turns out that the original director behind<em> Silent Hill 2</em> on PS2 disagrees. </p><p>On October 4, OG <em>Silent Hill 2</em> director Masashi Tsuboyama shared his thoughts on the new remake and its changes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842185991496614263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842185991496614263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Twitter thread</a></span>, explaining that “games and technology are constantly evolving.” This leads to what Tsuboyama called “significant differences” in how creators today are constrained compared to devs back in the past.</p><p>“The thing to note is the change in camera perspective,” said Tsuboyama. “The change in playable camera has a significant impact on many aspects, combat, level design, art creation, etc. While the impact on the story may be relatively small, it brings a big change to the playfeel of the game.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842188417326821413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tsuboyama2024/status/1842188417326821413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He then admited</a></span> that he was “not satisfied” with<em> Silent Hill 2</em>'s camera 23 years ago. “Depth and angle were limited by the processing load,” said the director. “It was a continuous process of hard work that was not rewarded. But that was the limit.”</p><p>“The over-the-shoulder view definitely adds to the sense of realism. In other words, it makes me want to try playing the even more immersive remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” added Tsuboyama. <br></p><p>Of course, not all the changes were received as positively by the original game’s director. He added that the bonus headgear, featuring a dog mask referencing a famous secret ending and one based on villain Pyramid Head, were “mediocre” and asked, “Who is this promotion going to appeal to?” </p><p>Still, it’s clear that unlike some fans, Tsuboyama is feeling good about the remake and is happy that a “new generation can play it.” </p><p>“As a creator, I’m very happy about it,” said Tsuboyama. “It’s been 23 years! Even if you don’t know the original, you can just enjoy the remake as it is. Whether it’s good or bad doesn’t affect the original.”<br></p><p><em>Silent Hill 2</em> (the remake) will launch on PS5 and PC on October 8.<br></p><p><strong>Order <em>Silent Hill 2:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Silent-Hill-2-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CMC3C3Z9/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-changes-camera-director-konami-ps2-1851667016&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CMC3C3Z9" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cndvw4Kodwz&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cndvw4Kodwz" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsilent-hill-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsilent-hill-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, now <em>Halo</em>’s Master Chief is getting that treatment for real, and the initial tease looks impressive. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-the-kotaku-review-1848159022"><em>Halo Infinite</em> was made</a></span> with a brand-new proprietary set of game development tools called Slipstream. The result was seemingly less than ideal. In addition to the game taking forever to come out, it also got lampooned by fans over how it looked in its initial reveal. A particularly flat and dead-looking Jiralhanae Berserker in the first gameplay trailer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-s-craig-once-a-laughingstock-now-looks-1847930693&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-s-craig-once-a-laughingstock-now-looks-1847930693">was named Craig by the internet</a></span> and became a symbol of impending disappointment with the long awaited sequel. </p><p>“<em>Halo Infinite </em>was the last remnants of how we made<em> Halo</em> games in the past,” Pierre Hintze head of 343 Industries, now called Halo Studios, said in a video documentary showing fans their first glimpses of Master Chief’s Unreal Engine 5 makeover. The brief clips and images shared by the team are part of Project Foundry, an exploration of the franchise under this new tool set and a clear attempt to turn the page on a rocky past. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">The snippets shown in the video</a></span> include three biomes: the Pacific Northwest, the Coldlands, and the Blightlands, which gets its name from regions completely taken over by <em>Halo</em>’s cosmic infestation known as The Flood. They also provide samples of what Master Chief and Covenant Elites look like when recreated in the new engine, as well as series staples like energy weapons and the M6D Pistol. “Unreal affords us more opportunity than we’ve ever had in the past,” art director Chris Matthews said.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t confirmed what the next <em>Halo </em>games will be under this new direction, but a reported remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">might be one of them</a></span>. It’s already been 10 years since <em>Master Chief Collection</em>, and that was only a remaster rather than a ground-up overhaul. If <em>The Last Of Us Part </em>1 can get a next-gen remake, surely player’s first steps in the<em> Halo</em> universe can get a long-overdue makeover as well. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
