<p>Nearly 11 years after its release, Hideo Kojima has taken to X to express his feelings over the negative feedback that Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes received when it was released.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-legacy-video-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hideo Kojima</a> is one of the finest auteurs of his generation across all mediums. His calculated approach to cinematic presentation and innovation has accompanied the director across his multi-decade career. Metal Gear Solid is arguably his crowning achievement, and many of the entries are some of the most heralded releases in the annals of gaming history.</p>



<p>One entry has proved divisive. Although it’s looked upon more favorably in hindsight, Ground Zeroes was the subject of much criticism when it first launched.</p>







<figure><figcaption>It’s still an incredible game. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Ground Zeroes was considered a “Prologue to the new gameplay” of Metal Gear Solid Phantom Pain, and it was originally supposed to be part of The Phantom Pain. However, as <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima</a> puts it in his statement on X: “The PS4 was released and there were only a few titles out, so just GZ was released ahead of the others.”</p>



<p>Kojima and Konami opted to release it as a standalone piece of bite-sized action, and Ground Zeroes looked and played incredibly—thanks to the new and improved Fox Engine. But its brief runtime was an inescapable negative at the time. </p>



<p>Reflecting, Kojima has said: “Although the episodes were short, we threw in as many gameplay elements as possible. Although it is recognized now, 11 years later, there was online negativity at the time saying, “Selling a demo version at a low price?” and it received the lowest rating in the MGS series.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>Already 11 years ago😅

This was originally planned to demonstrate the FOX engine and the gameplay of an open world infiltration game. I thought of it as an episode connecting PW and MGSV TPP, to be a bridge for both generations (console and handheld). We were considering </span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s clear that Hideo Kojima is proud of the work, and it’s fair because Ground Zeroes was a great—if not compact—MGS experience. The original plan would happen sometime later as Metal Gear Solid V: Definitive Experience was released. It bundles Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain into one complete MGS package.</p>



<p>Kojima has moved on from MGS with Death Stranding. A successor—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stranding 2</a>—is due to release in 2025. Whereas the MGS series moves on without Kojima in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</a>.</p>

As seen below in the side-by-side comparison from <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1902740220245672017" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a>, classic Call of Duty operators stand atop a crashed helicopter in Verdansk, much like the original artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">Warzone recently celebrated its fifth anniversary with a nostalgic trailer, and this new promo art further confirms that Season 3 is looking to sell players on nostalgia.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's seasonal artwork usually features key characters and operator skins that players will find in the battle pass or shop bundles. Jason Hudson of the Black Ops series is featured front and center, so he'll likely be the main operator featured in Season 3's battle pass. Hudson was killed off in a flashback during Black Ops 2 that takes place prior to Black Ops 6, so this OG throwback season gives the developer a way of adding the popular character as a playable operator in Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Other notable operators shown in the Season 3 artwork include OG skins for Ghost and Mace from Modern Warfare 2019. Frank Woods is likely getting a throwback skin as well. Frank has been wheelchair-bound since the events of Black Ops 2, but he's standing and looking much younger in Season 3's artwork, so this might be a Black Ops 1 variant skin.</p><p>For more on Call of Duty, make sure to check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-3-expected-start-date-og-style-rumors-and-leaks-so-far/1100-6529766/">rumors and announcements for Season 3 of Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.

<p>It's unknown why the game would have this hidden mode, but its speculated that it could unlock when being played on Nintendo Switch 2. There's a chance that the game could receive a patch that lets it take full advantage of the new hardware's capabilities.

            <p>YouTube personality and kinetic artist Joseph Herscher has created a real life Lego Mario Kart race track in his home using everyday items such as books, handheld weights and tupperware.</p>
<p>Herscher - who has over seven million YouTube subscribers and <a href="https://www.josephsmachines.com/">prides himself on being able to build Rube Goldberg machines</a>, chain reactions and "other completely useless contraptions" - used official Super Mario: Mario Kart Lego sets to get the race going, and then created a course around his (I presume) bedroom.</p>

<p>Sticking with what he is best known for, Herscher launched bricky racers such as Mario, Baby Peach and Luigi off on their way, setting off a chain of events that eventually sees one reign supreme on the podium.</p>
<p>In true Mario Kart fashion there are some - ahem - mishaps and shells on the way to victory, as the characters negotiate a chest of drawers and more. Whose victory? Well, you can watch and find out for yourself below.</p>

<p>Needless to say, Herscher's followers have been left impressed with his Mario Kart creation, with comments such as "amazing!", "awesome!" and "so cool!" popping up underneath the video.</p>
<p>In related news, a new 18+ Lego Mario Kart set was recently announced. The upcoming set will release on 15th May, and features a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/18-lego-mario-kart-set-leaks-online">buildable Mario complete with a posable head and arms</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Mario Kart video game series, it seems very likely that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">the next franchise entry will arrive with the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-vrr-screen/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-to-feature-120-hz-lcd-screen-with-vrr-and-hdr-support-%E2%80%93-rumor.1140174/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-120-hz-vrr-screen/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 could feature a 120 Hz screen with VRR and HDR support, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jfrb32/the_switch_2_is_rumored_to_have_a_120hz_lcd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, Famiiboards forum member Secretboy, who correctly revealed the GPU performance of the system before clock speeds were leaked back in January, recently reiterated that the console will feature a 120 Hz screen that will support both variable refresh rate and high-dynamic range. The user also said that it will be an LCD screen, and not a superior OLED screen, most likely to keep costs down.</p>
<p>Expecting Nintendo Switch 2 games to run at 120 FPS is obviously a bit unrealistic, but a 120 Hz screen with VRR support comes with some additional benefits, such as games supporting 40 FPS modes and better responsiveness, that would greatly improve the gaming experience on the system. However, while the user did reveal information on the system correctly in the past, they haven't provided any evidence for their claim, so we have to take what has been revealed today with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it won't take much longer to learn if the Nintendo Switch 2 will indeed sport a high refresh rate screen. The proper unveiling of the system will take place less than two weeks from today during a Nintendo Direct airing on April 2nd. Among the games that will likely be shown during the event, which will supposedly also confirm <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/">when the system will launch</a>, is said to be Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. The next entry in the series will blow everything else shown during the event out of the water, according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-updated-patent-ai-upscaling-metroid-prime-4/">rumors.</a></p>

As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444">previously teased</a></span>, we saw an upcoming mobile card game, but we also got new looks at the future of <em>Digimon </em>video games and anime in between some (incredibly long) merchandise drops. If you want to watch the nearly three-hour presentation, you can do so below. If you want the highlights, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Bandai Namco announced <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>last month during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893">PlayStation State of Play showcase</a></span>, and we didn’t see much new from the RPG in the Digimon Con 2025 presentation. However, the team confirmed a few things about the game’s structure, noting that you’ll be able to move between the real world and the digital world, both of which have their own towns and environments where you can walk around, interact with the locals, and prepare before embarking on quests. The team also introduced some of the characters you’ll meet, revealing that you can choose between a male or female protagonist and that the character you don’t pick will be your “operator,” assisting you throughout the game. The presentation also announced that the starter Digimon this time around are Patamon, Gomamon, and DemiDevimon, and there will be over 450 Digimon you can recruit in total.</p></div><div><p>The presentation then shifted over to the card game. After showing off the new Protector of Light and Hero of Hope starter decks, new booster pack sets, and a new run of the <em>Digimon Liberator </em>online comic, the showcase revealed the new mobile game <em>Digimon Alysion</em>. The card game app seems a bit more elaborate than <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, as it includes a story mode complete with a new cast of characters. It will feature cards that are in the current TCG, as well as exclusive cards only found in the game. New Digimon and characters will make their debut in the game as well. A closed beta test is in the works.</p></div><div><p>There were two major announcements on the anime side. The first was the reveal of <em>Digimon Adventure Beyond</em>, an OVA set between the <em>Digimon Adventure tri. </em>and <em>Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna </em>films. The four-minute video is available to stream on the official <em>Digimon</em> channel. The more notable announcement was <em>Digimon Beatbreak</em>, the next season of the anime set to premiere in October 2025.</p><p>The short teaser is light on details, but references “emotion-devouring digital lifeforms.” We also see a brief glimpse of the new protagonist and their Digimon partner, but that’s about it. <em>Beatbreak </em>is bringing <em>Digimon </em>back to TV after a two-year hiatus. The last anime series, <em>Digimon Ghost Game</em>, concluded in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Inzoi is shaping up to be one of the most fire releases of 2025. Its blend of life-simulation mechanics and lifelike graphics combine to create one of the most unique experiences, but Mac users are wondering if they’re being excluded.</p>



<p>You’d be hard-pressed to find anyone to argue with The Sims being <em>the </em>life-sim series. Its lifetime revenue and sales are head and shoulders into the sky in the hundreds of millions. It’s a tough task for newcomers, but we know there’s a lot of interest in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-inzoi-come-out-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a>—a new life simulator game headed by Inzoi Studio and Krafton.</p>



<p>Inzoi’s more realistic take on graphics is already a huge plus in its favor. However, for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-inzoi-platforms-is-it-coming-to-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi’s platforms</a> and the game’s availability, we need to see if everything is as rosy.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-inzoi-playable-on-mac">Is Inzoi Playable on Mac?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Create a virtual paradise space. Credit to Inzoi Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Inzoi is not playable on Mac when it launches in Early Access as it stands.</strong></p>



<p>The current platforms locked in for <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Inzoi</a> are PCs (not Macs), PlayStation, and Xbox—although the latter two ports are only arriving much later on. Even though PCs and Macs are considered similar formats, there’s still a world of difference between them, and Macs usually get the short end of the stick.</p>



<p>If you want to play Inzoi anytime soon, you need to invest in a PC. Make sure you check out the different levels of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ail-inzoi-pc-system-requirements-minimum-recommended-best-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">system requirements for Inzoi</a> before you do to ensure you meet its PC Specs.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-inzoi-on-mac">Why Isn’t Inzoi on Mac?</h2>



<p><strong>There are two possible reasons for Inzoi not being on Mac: The game starting out in Early Access, or Macs struggling to run Inzoi.</strong></p>



<p>If you check out the system requirements above, you can see even the minimum requirements are tough. I would wager there’s concerns at Inzoi Studio about the game running on Macs. This is one big possibility for the lack of a Mac presence.</p>



<p>The other reason is a Mac version may arrive later down the line. To reiterate, <strong>even the PlayStation and Xbox are missing out initially</strong>. Many Early Access games opt for a PC-only release at launch. Once Inzoi starts finalizing its official debut, we may hear more about a Mac version.</p>



<hr>



<p>As always, we’ll update you if there are any developments regarding an Inzoi Mac port. Leave a comment to let us know your thoughts on Invoi, and head to our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> to discuss it with other users.</p>



<p>We have more Inzoi information including if it’s got <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-inzoi-multiplayer-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-much-will-inzoi-cost-inzoi-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how much it costs</a>.</p>

While no release date has been revealed, there will be a closed beta at a later date. The game will also include microtransactions.</p><p>Not many details about the game were shown off, but Bandai Namco provided information about some of its characters, including who seems to be the protagonist, a black-haired girl named Kanata Honde. The girl with short white hair is named Futre and it seems like she wields some sort of special power, and another girl named Valner Dragnogh. There's also a Digimon named Gemmon, who is a fluffy white creature with gems encrusted into its body, and it looks like it'll be the protagonist's partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaoHerGig5w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JaoHerGig5w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Pokemon Company found big success with Pokemon TCG Pocket, which is an electronic version of its popular trading card game.

Especially since the Analogue 3D is still currently sold out. </p><p>Of course, even if Luckey’s M64 turns out to be as good as the Chromatic, it’ll still require buying retro gaming hardware from a guy who says stuff like, “The United States should not be the world police. We should be the world gun store.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Regular Eurogamer readers may know I am rather fond of The Last of Us, and if anything to do with the series is due to pop up online, I am already eagerly awaiting it. So it was with some surprise this morning that I saw a new trailer for HBO's The Last of Us series had dropped. I immediately Clicker-ed to watch.</p>
<p>It turns out this trailer isn't for the show's upcoming second season, however. Or more specifically, it is a handy recap of season one in advance of that second season, packaged up into a video that lasts a little over five minutes. As you would expect, it covers all the essential plot points to get you up to speed - you know, the start of the outbreak (and the emotional impact behind that fateful night), Ellie's immunity, David (shivers) and the hospital finale.</p>
<p>Oh, and yes, <em>that </em>kiss between Tess and an infected. Oh my word. It still makes me feel all funny even though I knew it was coming the moment the Capitol shots started showing up. Anyway, if you want to refresh yourself on the events of The Last of Us season one for yourself, you can do so below.</p>

But it’s also a big, complicated game with a lot of different mechanics, systems, features, and options. And <em>Shadows </em>doesn’t always do a great job of explaining how all of this stuff works.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,196299,195922" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So let us help you out with 25 tips for<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Don’t worry, there are no spoilers below, and these tips will be useful both for people just hopping in and for folks who have played a dozen or so hours. </p><h2 id="h6448"><a id=""></a><strong>Use Balanced Mode If You Can</strong></h2><p>If you have a 120hz TV I recommend playing the game in “Balanced” mode. In this mode, <em>Shadows</em> runs at 40FPS instead of the slower 30FPS or super-smooth 60FPS. But on a 120hz display, 40FPS feels great and still lets the game look really sharp. If you can’t use that mode, the 60FPS “Performance” option is a good second choice that loses some clarity in pursuit of smoother gameplay. </p><h2 id="h6449"><a id=""></a><strong>Regardless of the mode you pick your HQ runs at 30 FPS</strong></h2><p>Here’s something weird: Your main base of operations that you update and build over time always runs at 30FPS. I guess this is because of some tech issues involving how you can stuff the base with animals and buildings. But yeah, it’s not just you; the game just runs slower in that area. </p><h2 id="h6450"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t worry about catching up on<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> lore</strong></h2><p>While there is some modern-day story stuff in here if you look for it, 90 percent of the game is focused on the characters living in feudal Japan and their own goals. So don’t feel like you need to do homework before hopping in. </p><h2 id="h6451"><a id=""></a>Use the “Pathfinder” feature</h2><figure id="" data-id="2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-recommend-id="image://2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-recommend-id="image://2b3f8639122a6d07c6a3b6edbbef10ac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, I get it. You probably think you don’t need a floating white line that points you near your objective or map marker. I thought that too...at first. But the large map in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is filled with big swaths of mountain forests which are really annoying to cross.</p><p>So instead of doing that, save some time and frustration and just hold Left on the d-pad to activate “Pathfinder” and follow the white line to your next faraway objective or location.</p><h2 id="h6452"><a id=""></a><strong>Swap between the two characters often</strong></h2><p>While you can complete most of <em>Shadows </em>as just Naoe or Yasuke, I highly recommend swapping between them periodically as you play. I think this is a lot more fun, as you essentially get to two different games in one: A sneaky ninja sim and an action-packed samurai adventure. </p><p>It’s also helps the very big game feel less tedious in long stretches. Bored of sneaking? Switch! Want to climb more? Switch! Mission too hard? Switch! Don’t get stuck on one when playing both is so much better. </p><h2 id="h6453"><a id=""></a><strong>Upgrade Naoe’s Shinobi and Assassin tree ASAP</strong></h2><p>At the start of the game, the sneaky Naoe is a solid fighter and ninja, but she becomes a force of nature once you unlock her full Assassin toolbox, including the ability to one-hit-kill large enemies, assassinate anyone during a fight, and even the always cool ability to take out two targets at the same time.</p><h2 id="h6454"><a id=""></a>Oh, and get her smoke bomb, too!</h2><p>This is found and unlocked in the shinobi skill tree and will let you escape in a flash, which can be useful if you are surrounded by a large group of angry samurai. </p><h2 id="h6455"><a id=""></a><strong>Upgrade Yasuke’s Samurai tree ASAP</strong></h2><p>He can become a one-man army if you dump points into this tree early on, granting you some powerful boosts to combat, health, and unlocking abilities that you can use regardless of your weapon. </p><h2 id="h6456"><a id=""></a><strong>Level up your Knowledge Level by doing side activities </strong></h2><p>In <em>Shadows</em>, you level up by earning XP, which grants you skill points that can be used to unlock or upgrade new options in the skill tree. But while XP levels you up, it doesn’t grant you access to the later sections of each skill tree. To do that, you’ll need to improve your Knowledge level. This can be done by completing side activities marked with orange icons. These include meditating, finding hidden pages at temples, archery competitions, and more. </p><h2 id="h6457"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t be dumb like me: Click the Knowledge Level icon to see more upgrades</strong></h2><p>Perhaps the game says this, I don’t know for sure, but it wasn’t until nearly 30 hours into the game that I realized you can CLICK the knowledge level icon in the skill tree menu and see a different universal tree. All the skills here are passive bonuses, and while you shouldn’t dump points into them until later in the game when you’ve maxed out other trees, it’s still good to be aware of it.</p><h2 id="h6458"><a id=""></a><strong>Help people in random encounters to earn free scouts</strong></h2><p>Scouts are useful for gathering resources, finding objectives, and even clearing your wanted status in a region. But you can only use them once and then you have to wait for them to refresh when the season changes (or you can spend 200 gold to refresh them). However, if you are out and about you’ll sometimes see people being abused by guards or robbed by bandits. If you save the day, the person you help can become a free scout for you, or can reveal some valuable loot on the map if you don’t need a scout. </p><h2 id="h6459"><a id=""></a><strong>Oh yeah, you can use scouts to clear your wanted status</strong></h2><p>I didn’t realize this until way too many hours into the game, but you can burn two scouts to clear your wanted status in a providence of the map. Seriously, I had no idea this option was in the game.</p><p> It can be spotted at the bottom-right corner of the map screen and will tell you to press a certain button depending on your platform. This can be useful if you need to play as a certain character in a region where you got in trouble and guards attack on sight. </p><h2 id="h6460"><a id=""></a>The seasons and weather can be helpful</h2><figure id="" data-id="bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-recommend-id="image://bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-recommend-id="image://bb32da8eff6aa3bccb01cb42c7e6a6cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t assume the change of seasons in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is purely cosmetic. Some weather conditions and seasonal changes can help you sneak into an area easily without being spotted. For example, deep snow can  hide you if you go prone, and heavy rainstorms can help conceal you as well, especially at night. Speaking of...</p><h2 id="h6461"><a id=""></a>Wait until nighttime to find more sleepy guards</h2><p>During the night you’ll spot sleeping guards more frequently. These guards can’t see you and can be easily taken out. Just remember loud noises can still alert them instantly. </p><h2 id="h6462"><a id=""></a><strong>Use the left trigger / focus mode! </strong></h2><p><em>Shadows</em>, by default, doesn’t give you specific map or in-game markers to go to. Instead, quests and tasks provide some hints about where to go and then a general area to search in. This can be annoying at times, but make sure to use your focus mode a lot and look for blue dots to find quest-related NPCs or items. This will save you from running around for 20 minutes trying to find the person you need to kill. </p><h2 id="h6463"><a id=""></a><strong>Use Naoe’s grappling hook to climb pagodas quickly</strong></h2><p>I suspect a big reason Ubisoft added the grappling hook at all was to help you quickly and easily scale pagodas, which can be annoying to scramble up normally.</p><h2 id="h6464"><a id=""></a><strong>Yasuke can’t climb ropes hanging across gaps</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Trust me. The rope will break and you’ll come crashing down to the earth. You can leap off high points into piles of hay, but the haystack will be destroyed and Yasuke will make a loud noise that will alert guards. </p><h2 id="h6465"><a id=""></a><strong>When attacking bases, destroy all bells</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Bells can be spotted easily as they are found on towers with ladders. These bells can be shot from afar or sabotaged by hand close up by either Naoe or Yasuke. And you should do this as it will stop enemies from ringing the bell, calling reinforcements, and making whichever character you are playing as wanted in the providence. </p><h2 id="h6466"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t ignore your HQ / Assassins base</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to decorate it or anything if you don’t want to, but periodically return (I tried to do so each time the seasons changed) to upgrade your favorite gear at the blacksmith and expand the HQ. I recommend building any facility that helps you earn XP faster and upgrading buildings to unlock new features, including the ability to create loadouts. </p><h2 id="h6467"><a id=""></a><strong>Use currency to unlock more safehouses around the map</strong></h2><p>These locations are extremely useful for fast travel, can refill your tools and rations for free, and you can refresh your scouts there, too. And if you unlock the Assassin building at your HQ and upgrade it, even more of them will pop up on the map and all of these hideouts will now cost less to unlock. </p><h2 id="h6468"><a id=""></a><strong>Focus mode can help you locate Samurai leaders and their chests </strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-recommend-id="image://0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-recommend-id="image://0ad87dd187bd6999b726d2475c9066b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When infiltrating a castle to kill its samurai leaders, use focus mode (pull the left trigger on consoles) to quickly find and mark them. The leaders will be marked as white dots. Even Yasuke, who doesn’t have fancy Eagle Vision like Naoe, can target them through walls using focus vision.</p><p>Once all the samurai leaders are dead, don’t forget to open the big red chest in the castle—also marked by a white dot—for some really good loot. </p><h2 id="h6469"><a id=""></a><strong>Hit the deck! (Go prone) </strong></h2><p>It’s a very useful new move that both Yasuke and Naoe can pull off and it can make sneaking around much easier. If an enemy starts to see you and there’s not a bush or wall nearby, try going prone. That will often be enough to help you escape without being seen. </p><h2 id="h6470"><a id=""></a><strong>Use shadows, too! </strong></h2><p>They are new to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, powerful, and worth using, especially as Naoe. Try blowing out candles and knocking over lamps to make environments darker and better for sneaking around. </p><h2 id="h6471"><a id=""></a><strong>You can roll-hop up most surfaces </strong></h2><p>Okay, this is not by design and it might get patched, but I discovered that if you quickly mash the roll and climb/jump buttons while pushing up, you can climb most steep cliffs and “unclimbable” slopes. This helped me cheese a few puzzle areas and dodge some castle defenses more efficiently. </p><h2 id="h6472"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t try to assassinate samurai who are on alert </strong></h2><p>Samurai are well trained and can’t be assassinated from the front if they are on high alert and are searching for you. Even if you come at them from the shadows, it won’t be enough. They’ll catch your blade and knock you back. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>History looks to be repeating itself as a recently registered domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on the way—and this is more than likely a remake from the ground up of 2008’s Persona 4.</p>



<p>Persona remakes have been creeping out over recent years. But it makes complete sense if you’re Atlus. The series has sold millions of copies and its popularity continues to rise. This is why Persona 3 received a remake in 2024 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-details-new-trailer-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Persona 3 Reload</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a year later, a domain name suggests Persona 4 Reload is on its way, and it could be announced soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-persona-4-reload-remake-could-be-announced-in-2025">Persona 4 Reload Remake Could be Announced in 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bringing back a classic. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p>YouTuber and social media personality <a href="https://x.com/ScrambledFaz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@ScrambledFaz</a> found the domain “<strong>p4re.jp</strong>” registered on March 20.</p>



<p>They discovered the listing featuring the domain name’s creation date and name. It doesn’t directly spell out “Persona 4 Reload,” but a brief history lesson tells us this is probably the case.</p>



<p>As told by Faz, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-remake-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">p3re. jp was registered in 2023</a>, and we got an official Persona 3 Reload announcement a few weeks later. This looks to be a carbon copy of these events, only this time we’re swapping the 3 for a 4.</p>



<div><article><p><span>p4re. jp was registered a few hours ago.

2 years ago, p3re. jp was registered. 3 months later Persona 3 Reload was revealed</span></p></article></div>



<p>This has to go down as speculation for now, but it’s very realistic speculation at least! Persona 3 Reload was lauded by fans of the series and critics and went on to become Atlus’s fastest-selling game at the time.</p>



<p>If Persona 4 Reload comes to fruition, it’s hard to see it not having similar results.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/10-times-assassins-creed-changed-history<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has activated the Animus once more, this time to take us back to Japan’s Sengoku Period. Assassin’s Creed Shadows features a number of historical figures from 1579, including Fujibayashi Nagato, Akechi Mitsuhide, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">Yasuke </a>– the African samurai who served Oda Nobunaga. As with the previous games in the series, these figures are woven into a story that combines fact with fiction to tell a tale of revenge, betrayal, and murder – including that time Yasuke had to kill everyone to gather enough XP to use a gold-tier weapon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, Assassin’s Creed is <em>historical fiction</em>, and its whole MO has been finding gaps in the past that can be used to tell a science fiction conspiracy tale about a secret society that’s looking to take over the world using the magic powers of a pre-human civilization. While the open-world playgrounds Ubisoft creates are genuinely rooted in history and based on a lot of meticulous research, it’s important to remember they are not actual history lessons – the developers have changed dozens and dozens of historical facts to better suit the story being told. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are far too many “historical inaccuracies” to include in a single article, but here are ten of our favourite times Assassin’s Creed completely rewrote the past.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Assassins vs Templars War</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/1-1742302213819.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s get this one out the way first: there is absolutely no historical evidence that the Order of Assassins was ever at war with the Knights Templar. The conflict between the Assassins and Templars is completely fictional, partly inspired by the (also fictional) conspiracy theories that emerged around the Knights Templar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Assassins were founded in 1090 AD, and the Templars were established shortly after in 1118. Both orders operated for around 200 years, and by 1312 both had been disbanded. The idea that these groups have been backstabbing each other through the centuries is absolute nonsense. In fact, the only conflict both orders were involved with was the Crusades, and so there’s only the first Assassin’s Creed game that’s even set in the right time period. While there is evidence they may have brushed against each other, there is absolutely nothing to suggest that either group was ideologically opposed to the other. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Borgias and their Superpowered Pope</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/2-1742302226407.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin’s Creed 2 and its follow-up, Brotherhood, focuses on Ezio’s conflict with the Borgia family. Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia is discovered to be the Grand Master of the Templar Order, which is pretty bad news for the Assassins, since Rodrigo - both in the game and in history – is elected as Pope, becoming Alexander VI. However, as we’ve already established, the Templars weren’t around in the late 1400s, so naturally there was no Borgia plot to obtain the magical Apple of Eden and install a pope who could control humanity with god-like powers. Sadly, that also means that Ezio’s brawl with Pope Alexander VI under the Vatican is also pure fiction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That much was, of course, pretty obvious. But perhaps less obvious is that Assassin’s Creed’s general depiction of the Borgias is pretty mixed as far as historical accuracy goes. While the family’s legacy is steeped in enough sin for them to be easily positioned as villains, the Borgias were not the moustache-twirling Renaissance-era gangsters that Ubisoft paints them as. Rodrigo’s son, Cesare, is reinvented as something of an incestuous, psychopathic leader, despite there being no historical evidence of this, just rumour –  in reality, he may not have been all that bad, if you believe Machiavelli, that is…</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Machiavelli, Enemy of the Borgias</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/3-1742302239841.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of…In Assassin’s Creed 2 and Brotherhood, famed political thinker Niccolò Machiavelli is depicted as Ezio’s right-hand-man. At one point he leads the Italian Assassin’s Bureau, and generally aids Ezio’s crusade against the evil Borgias. The problem with all this is that Machiavelli almost certainly wouldn’t have been an Assassin at all – his philosophies around strong authority simply don’t gel with the Creed’s fight against authority. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, Machiavelli’s own actions and writings suggest he did not find the Borgia family all that repulsive. He recognised Rodrigo Borgia as a con man, but one who was successful in all his deceptions. As for Rodrigo’s son, Machiavelli actually served as a diplomat in Cesare’s court and considered him a model ruler. Simply put, Machiavelli’s opinions and relationships with Assassin’s Creed’s Italian big bads don’t line up with the real history.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Incredible Leonardo da Vinci and his Flying Machine</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/4-1742302257289.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Just as famous as Assassin’s Creed 2’s pope battle is its bromance between Ezio and Leonardo da Vinci. Ubisoft’s depiction of the Italian polymath is actually pretty strong; historical records state he was a witty, charismatic man and that’s exactly what we get. However, his movements through Italy simply don’t match up to da Vinci’s real-life travels. In 1482, Leonardo left Florence and moved to Milan, where he stayed for over a decade. The game sees him move from Florence to Venice in 1481, ostensibly to paint portraits for a noble, but essentially to ensure da Vinci is in the same place as Ezio. This may seem like a small thing, but Assassin’s Creed is generally pretty good at tracking the movements of historical figures and aligning its story with them, so this is actually a pretty substantial change. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, that’s not the fun stuff. The real da Vinci was an outstanding engineer and crafted multiple designs that were far ahead of their time. Across Assassin’s Creed 2 and its sequel, Brotherhood, we see many of da Vinci’s designs made manifest, including a machine gun and a tank. There’s little historical evidence for these having actually been built, but the real flight of fancy is the flying machine that Ezio uses to soar across the rooftops of Venice. While da Vinci was indeed fascinated by the idea of human flight, and the glider-like machine used in-game is very close to the designs he drew, there is no historical account that suggests any of Leonardo’s machines ever took to the skies.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Bloody Boston Tea Party</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/5-1742302270733.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the most famous events of the American Revolution, the Boston Tea Party saw dozens of men – many dressed as Mohawks to disguise their identities – board three boats in Boston Harbour and dump boxes of tea into the water. While plenty of tea was destroyed, not a single person died – it was a non-violent protest against the recently implemented Tea Act.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Assassin’s Creed 3, things go pretty differently. Protagonist Connor is the only person among the protesters to wear Native American clothing, and he slaughters at least 15 British guards while his allies prepare to dump the tea. Two of the protesters also get involved in the killing as more guards turn up, resulting in casualties on both sides. Basically, it’s a bloodbath that significantly rewrites the actual events – peaceful protestors are turned into an aggressive mob, presumably because throwing boxes of tea isn’t considered dramatic enough for a video game.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, during the mission’s set-up, it’s revealed that the protest was masterminded by Samuel Adams, one of the Founding Fathers. In reality, historians have conflicting opinions on Adam’s exact level of involvement in the protest itself – it’s a good example of Ubisoft using inconclusive evidence to write its own version of history.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Lone Mohawk</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/6-1742302282633.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of Connor and his crusade against the British, Assassin’s Creed 3’s whole approach to Connor’s allegiances doesn’t align with the history books. Connor is a Mohawk, and the Mohawk people were actually <em>allied </em>with the British, not the Patriots, during the Revolutionary War. They had enjoyed a good trade relationship with the British, and hoped the Crown would protect their lands from American colonists. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of Assassin’s Creed 3’s launch, Connor’s depiction was <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/are-video-games-like-assassins-creed-rewriting-history/article9237302/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">debated by a number of historians</a>, who found the whole scenario incredibly unlikely. If Connor were to fight alongside the Patriots, he’d be considered something of a traitor among his own people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say such a thing never happened, though. Akiatonharónkwen, also known by his English name, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Cook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Louis Cook</a>, is one very rare example of a Mohawk fighting against the British. He became the highest-ranking Native American officer in the Continental Army, and it’s possible that his story inspired Connor’s creation. But, like we said, this kind of occurrence was incredibly unlikely, and so Connor represents the kind of “what if?” question that Assassin’s Creed thrives on. “what if a Mohawk allied with the Patriots?” is pretty fertile ground for a story full of conflict and soul-searching. As to if Assassin’s Creed 3 actually lives up to that premise… well, the game certainly does have its defenders. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Templar Revolution</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/7-1742302294023.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While Ubisoft’s take on the American Revolution has plenty of inaccuracies, its issues pale in comparison to Assassin’s Creed Unity's quite frankly bizarre take on the French Revolution. It reads almost like a counter-revolutionary manifesto; by pinning the blame on the Templars, it practically suggests that the French monarchy and aristocracy were victims of a conspiracy, rather than the corrupt cause of the people’s revolt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of Unity’s alt-history sparks for the revolution is a Templar scheme to create a food crisis. Famine was a significant part of the French Revolution, but it was the result of multiple years of food shortages, caused by drought, floods, and bad harvests – natural causes that simply couldn’t be manufactured by a group of Jacobin Templars skulking around Paris. Furthermore, Unity seems to suggest that the Reign of Terror - the historic name for all the street riots and head-chopping - is the whole revolution, rather than just one part of it. In reality, the French Revolution unfolded over many years and was the result of multiple issues – in short, even the smartest Templars would be completely incapable of manufacturing it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Controversial Killing of King Louis 16</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/8-1742302304056.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The most well-known aspect of the French Revolution is the monarchy ducking their heads beneath the guillotine, and the execution of King Louis 16 is naturally a prominent part of Assassin’s Creed Unity. The game depicts the vote on his punishment as being neck-and-neck (so to speak) with the ballot being swung by a single vote from a Templar conspiracist. Such a result suggests that killing the King was something of a controversial, divisive issue among the assembly, but this couldn’t be further from the truth; the real result was 394 to 321 in favour of execution – an easy majority. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unity is remarkably soft on the French aristocracy, who were the target of widespread anger across the population. In reality, The King was accused of treason in part due to his attempt to flee France to Austria, from where he could plot a counter-revolution. This naturally made him look even worse than his already tanked reputation, but this is barely addressed in Unity. It’s just one symptom of the game’s overall neglect to explain the true causes of the revolution. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Jack the Assassin</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/9-1742302317232.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the wildest, most borderline-offensive warpings of history committed by Assassin’s Creed is its version of Jack the Ripper. In reality, he was one of London’s most brutal serial killers, having murdered a number of prostitutes in the Whitechapel area in 1888. According to Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, though, he was a rogue Assassin attempting to take over the London Brotherhood. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As Syndicate’s story goes, Jack trained under Jacob Frye, but over the years became disillusioned with the Brotherhood’s Creed. He eventually wrestled control of the organisation away from Jacob, turning it into a ruthless gang that dominated the criminal underworld in London’s East End. In an attempt to stop his reign of terror, Jacob assigned a group of initiates disguised as prostitutes to kill Jack. They all failed, gruesomely murdered by Jack before they could complete their mission. Thankfully, Jacob’s sister, Evie, was able to step in and kill him before he could do any further damage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is all a pretty classic example of Assassin’s Creed’s “you don’t know the real story” shtick. Much of the police work surrounding the real Jack the Ripper was inconclusive, and to this day his identity and the true tally of his victims are unknown.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Assassination of the Tyrant Julius Caesar </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/10-1742302327762.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The killing of Julius Caesar is not only one of the most important political assassinations in the entirety of human history, it’s also one of the most well-documented. He was stabbed 23 times by a group of conspirators who believed his dictatorship was a threat to the values of the Roman Republic. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Assassin’s Creed Origins ignores many of the facts in order to paint its own picture of the events – one in which Caesar is a proto-Templar who must be killed to prevent global terror. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a multitude of issues with Origin’s depiction of Caesar’s assassination, including the design of the Roman Forum and the order of events that brings Caesar to the Senate. However, the strangest element of it all is the game’s depiction of Caesar. His opponents in the game are depicted as fighting for land for the people, not just the privileged – which, funnily enough, was exactly what the real Caesar stood for. In fact, his many political reforms included the redistribution of land to the poor and retired soldiers. Maybe his in-game adversaries should have checked his political record…  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When Aya confronts Ceasar’s grieving widow, Cleopatra, after having led the assassination plot, she says that "The people call you a dead tyrant's whore." In reality, while by no means a clear-cut hero, Caesar was an incredibly popular leader among the Roman people. Origins frames his death as a victory over a tyrannical pre-Templar leader, but historically, Ceasar’s assassination triggered the Liberators' Civil War, which led to the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire. It’s not exactly the victory Origins would like you to believe it is and, paradoxically, the assassination only creates a domino effect towards the exact kind of world the conspirators were aiming to avoid.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The teams working on the Assassin’s Creed games go to great lengths to create games that are packed with truly authentic historical elements, but as you can see, that authenticity is often far from accurate. And that’s okay! After all, this is historical fiction, not historical documentary. It is just a video game, after all. What are your favourite examples of Assassin’s Creed bending the truth?

                <p>Similar to The Sims, the in-game Zois in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inzoi-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529953/" data-ref-id="1100-6529953">InZoi</a> can die if you don't take care of them or if they suffer an accident. It's now come to light that the game has 16 unique types of death, including dying from a need for recognition. During the recent InZoi showcase event, InZoi game director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim confirmed that a significant element of the game is death, and the game will include numerous ways to bite the dust.</p><p>"In InZoi we have a lot of different types of death, because life comes with death. In InZoi you could go to the bathroom and if you slip you might die. Or if you eat some old food you might have to go to the bathroom and, again, die," he said, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/in-good-news-for-sim-murdering-sickos-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by PC Gamer</a>. "And when you fix broken-down electronics you might get electrocuted, so you need to be careful."</p><p>Another way to die in InZoi is getting hit by a car, "so you might want to be careful around cars," Kjun said. When InZoi launches, players can enable driveable cars from the menu as part of an experimental test, but otherwise, cars drive automatically.</p><p>Beyond all of these, InZoi will include a method of dying that Kjun said has never been in a game before, and that is "dying from the need for recognition."</p><p>"In the modern world you find a lot of people feel fulfilled from being recognized by others and this death reflects that," the director said.</p><p>As an example, Kjun said the game might present an opportunity to have a fight with someone that causes a rumor to spread--and the consequences could be deadly. "I could get a text message about it, or a friend of mine could tell me about the rumor and if the rumor is negative then my need for acknowledgement can go down. And if that drops too drastically then you might die from that," Kjun said.</p><p>Announced previously, InZoi also has a reputation system that allows for Zois who die with a bad reputation to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/inzois-game-director-teases-plans-for-ghost-zois-getting-shackled-to-the-mortal-realm-karma-starved-and-seeking-redemption-if-they-die-with-a-bad-rep/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">come back as ghosts to haunt the living</a>.</p><p>InZoi releases on Steam Early Access on March 28, priced at $40.

The headlines detailing developer harassment after a major release, for the "crime" of certain inclusions, exclusions, or design choices. A showcase livestream comments section filled with hateful commentary and abusive language at specific games and teams. Reports of whole studios being laid off days after the release of a highly anticipated title. We see it every day, but what can we do to change it? Celia Hodent, a game UX strategist, believes a cohesive Code of Conduct for the industry is the answer, and it’s a lot less intimidating than many might think.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hodent started her breakdown of ethics in games for Western audiences by mentioning several similar codes that exist in other parts of the world. “What is important in a code of ethics?” was the question she posed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone who has always been nervous about censorship and limitations, I was curious to know how a set of rules could make a community safer, and build better games. Her points on ethics in games genuinely changed my perspective on how such a code could make gaming and game development better for everyone.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is a Code of Ethics?">What is a Code of Ethics?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I think “code” in any capacity, I think of a list of rules. A set of guidelines that govern how people think and act. This is likely why I have perceived a code of ethics as potentially limiting to the creative process. However, Hodent broke down exactly what a Code of Ethics in games would look like. These rules would create protections for players, including safety expectations at events or within a community and security for the player both in purchasing and playing a title. It would also create solid expectations for what players purchase, putting down better rules around monetization and marketing.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/industry-wide-union-uvw-cwa-has-already-welcomed-over-100-new-members" target="_self" data-discover="true">Industry-wide union UVW-CWA has already welcomed over 100 new members</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most players are more than familiar with how predatory some live-service games can be. Loot boxes, season passes, and microtransactions plague communities, with few guidelines on how they function. Often, the only regulation present is player commentary, and even pushback from communities doesn’t always encourage companies to change or improve how they function.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, a code of ethics would create protections for developers and those making games. This would include better transparency of company values, worker protections, diversity, and impact on the environment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a time where anyone can lose their job for nearly any reason, these types of protections are invaluable for those who pour their heart and soul into a company’s IP. It would also create better protections for developers in the trenches, cracking down on harassment, and promoting healthier work environments for those in the industry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/unity-claims-79-percent-of-developers-are-feeling-positive-about-generative-ai" target="_self" data-discover="true">Unity claims 79 percent of developers are 'feeling positive' about generative AI</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It sounds amazing when broken down this way, so why has it taken so long for a code of ethics to be built and used in the Western industry? Unfortunately, a combination of misinformation and perceived barriers have left many unsure about a universal set of guidelines. Hodent explained that this bias has prevented companies from engaging or even pushing back on a potential code.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Barriers Are In Your Mind">The Barriers Are In Your Mind</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I mentioned above that I had several ideas of what a code of ethics could be like in the games industry. Unfortunately, these barriers are commonplace. Hodent said that a core reason a code of ethics hasn’t been implemented is that companies believe it is too expensive, too complicated, or too overreaching to be effective. There are concerns about censorship and many believe that policing to uphold a code would lead to legal and PR nightmares.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are more benefits than we can count when trying to make the industry a safer place both for creators and players. Hodent explained that "we care about players having fun," but much of that fun has been lost in recent years as hostility and anxiety of increased.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/players-lambast-activision-after-publisher-confirms-generative-ai-was-used-in-black-ops-6" target="_self" data-discover="true">Players lambast Activision after publisher confirms generative AI was used in Black Ops 6</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These codes could ensure the safety of players and developers, but also protect businesses by managing toxicity before it starts. Hodent explained that one of the biggest financial burdens companies shoulder comes from players avoiding titles due to normalized toxicity and harassment. Safe players want to play more, and this in turn helps those making the games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In reality, these "barriers" could be opportunities if we change our mindset. Instead of thinking about a code as expensive, we could see it as an investment. We are investing in an overarching set of guidelines that everyone is meant to adhere to, creating an agreed-upon set of expectations and behaviors.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Who Makes The Rules?">Who Makes The Rules?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The hardest part of making a code of ethics is deciding what should be included and how it should look. Hodent explained that we need to "protect our art from moral panics," and base the content of the code on studies and evidence/science-based data. "How are games actually impacting players?" and how can we make guidelines and rules that tackle real problems, not perceived ones?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We need to define what it means to be safe as gamers around the world," she explained, stating that the best way to do this is by agreeing as a collective on true issues, creating solutions, and then supporting these solutions with resources and guidelines.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reality is that a code of ethics in games won't be an easy task, but Hodent believes the time is now. "Together, we can make the industry a safer and more accepting place,” she concluded, “If there is any moment where standing up for our values in this industry matters, this is it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After having my perception of this issue completely altered by her breakdown, I couldn’t agree more.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Laura Gray, known as Ezra when not putting pen to paper, is a D&amp;D enthusiast with a love of all things written.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/digimon-alysion-time-stranger<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion</em>, a mobile game that will allow you to play the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>TCG on the go. The studio has also unveiled new information about the upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase,&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will let you collect and battle&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/digimon-card-game-2020" rel="nofollow">cards</a>. It's likely intended as a competitor to The Pokemon Company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">wildly popular</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>.</p>

<p><em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will, however, have some features&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>doesn't. For one thing, it looks like there will be a story; main characters Kanata Hondo, Futre, and Valner Dragnogh are all introduced in the debut trailer, along with what appears to be a new Digimon in the form of Gemmon.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-alysion-gemmon.jpg?itok=arRulbqW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-alysion-gemmon.jpg?itok=N6DPt37i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>will bring the card game to mobiles, as well as introducing new Digimon like Gemmon.</figcaption></figure><p>There's no word yet on when the game will release, but like Konami's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em></a>, it'll be a free-to-play game that includes in-app purchases.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Alysion&nbsp;</em>right here. The trailer shows text largely in Japanese, but it's pretty likely that the West will be seeing this game at some point as well.</p>




<h2>Bandai Namco also revealed new&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>details</h2>

<p>If you've been waiting for more info about upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, then you're in luck, since that's exactly what we got during the aforementioned showcase.</p>

<p>Sadly, that info didn't include a release date, but we did learn more about the game's story, its dual-world concept, and various other elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=NoG8DZ2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-greymon.jpg?itok=9cWsuEN7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>got a bunch of new info during the&nbsp;<em>Digimon&nbsp;</em>Con showcase.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will cast you as an agent of an organization called ADAMAS, which "specializes in investigating and solving anomalous phenomena", according to Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>After a mysterious explosion in which you encounter your first Digimon, you'll be blasted back eight years into the past, and you'll pursue "the mystery of the impending world's collapse". It all sounds suitably epic.</p>

<p>You'll split your time between two worlds: the Human World and the Digital World. Producer Ryosuke Hara says&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>will allow you to make "frequent visits to the Digital World", contrasting against the&nbsp;<em>Cyber Sleuth&nbsp;</em>games, in which you had "very few opportunities" to do so.</p>

<p>We also got tons more info about the game's characters, the Digimon that will be appearing (of which there will be more than 450!), and lots more. You can check out a new&nbsp;<em>Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>trailer, which shows off some of the Digimon's special abilities, right here.</p>




<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>yet, but the game will come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1984270/Digimon_Story_Time_Stranger/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S when it launches. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Like other games in the genre, <em>Digimon Alysion </em>will allow players to build and play with decks depicting characters from different parts of the franchise.

Of course, freedom of expression must be respected, but acts that demean local cultures should be avoided.” </p><p>The Prime Minister responded, “Defacing a shrine is out of the question—it is an insult to the nation itself. When the Self-Defense Forces were deployed to Samawah, Iraq, we ensured they studied Islamic customs beforehand. Respecting the culture and religion of a country is fundamental, and we must make it clear that we will not simply accept acts that disregard them.”</p><p>The concern seems to be primarily about the potential for the features in the game to encourage copycat attacks in real life, as politicians the world over have frequently worried about with regard to other games—primarily <em>Grand Theft Auto—</em>that mix hyper-realistic simulations with the freedom to commit violent acts. Another issue expressed in the meeting was the lack of express permission from the Shrine to have its name and likeness included in the first place. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, originally scheduled to come out last fall, has already been delayed twice.

<p>Jack Black became “the most passionate player” on set, logging over 100 hours on Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/a-minecraft-movie-game-microsoft-1236341672/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, Torfi Frans Ólafsson, Mojang’s senior director of original content, revealed some details about Jack Black playing Minecraft. Ólafsson had purchased Xboxes and set up private Minecraft servers for the cast and crew to enjoy the game. Within the group, Jack Black turned out to be the most passionate player, gathering over 100 hours of gameplay time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ólafsson added that Jack Black “was just completely manic” in Minecraft, and he is obsessed with ‘lapis lazuli’ “because he liked the way it sounds”. Jack Black also insists on talking about Lapis Lazuli in the movie. For those wondering, Lapis Lazuli is a blue mineral ore in the game that can be used for enchanting items, creating blue dye and other purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-jack-black-almost-played-a-talking-pig-in-a-minecraft-movie">Jack Black Almost Played a Talking Pig in A Minecraft Movie</h2>



<p>During the same interview, Ólafsson revealed that Jack Black was not going to play Steve originally; instead, his character was a “talking pig”. However, “very, very, very late in the development”, the crew realised that they “needed an expert and host”; hence, they decided that Black would play Steve instead. Ólafsson elaborated, “This is not my Steve or your Steve — this is Jack Black’s Steve”.&nbsp;</p>

Not only will there be a gamepad-specific layout for touch keyboards, but there will be controller shortcuts too, such as pressing X for backspace or Y for space. This should sound familiar to Xbox console owners when typing on the system. <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2025/03/18/releasing-windows-11-build-26100-3613-to-the-release-preview-channel/" rel="nofollow ">Microsoft's official language</a> for the update is below:</p><p dir="ltr">"We have enabled the gamepad keyboard layout for the touch keyboard in Windows 11.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Konami and developer Studio Far Out Games have revealed the release date for chaotic delivery-based action game&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, and it's coming later in spring.</p>

<p>As announced in a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs" rel="nofollow">in September last year</a>, is coming to PC and current-gen consoles on May 22nd. The game will be available across three different storefronts on PC.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with it,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is an isometric action game in which you play as courier Winston Green at the tail end of the 1950s. It's your job to deliver "highly unconventional cargo" while also leaving "a trail of havoc and chaos" behind you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=KVvITghD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-release-date-crash.jpg?itok=qhiyDCXe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>has a release date, and it's coming in spring.</figcaption></figure><p>Set against a backdrop of what Konami and Studio Far Out call "a time of rock'n'roll, polka dot dresses and the ever-looming dread of nuclear annihilation",&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>tasks you with making "bizarre deliveries" across a series of "highly destructible environments".</p>

<p>Of course, the packages you're delivering aren't just nondescript brown paper parcels; you'll be doing everything from "delivering a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of "a big bomb teetering on the edge of explosion".</p>

<p>Each of&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' levels is a semi-open environment full of things to do, and you'll discover a "story of mystery and intrigue" as you explore them as well. Konami and Studio Far Out are promising a three-act narrative with "a cast of distinct and memorable characters".</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>will also feature an immersive 50s environment with its own built-in radio ads and soundtrack, helping to give you that authentic late-50s feeling.</p>




<p>You're in luck this year if you're looking for delivery games that aren't actually about deliveries. Not only is&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>coming in May, but Hideo Kojima recently revealed that his own <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</i>is set for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release in June</a>, appropriate given Konami is his former employer.</p>

<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/deliver-at-all-costs/9pmwkz7ftnp0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 22nd, and pre-orders for the game are open right now.</p>
