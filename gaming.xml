		<p>Time is a concept that mankind has grappled with for… well… a long time. Is it just another dimension? Is it something that we perceive differently to other unknowable beings? Can it be manipulated? Certainly, that last one was proven true within the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">Life Is Strange</a> some 11 years ago. A stand-out moment for interactive fiction and storytelling, Max Caulfield’s tale was personal, fantastical and overwhelmingly emotional, and in the process, completely rewrote developer Don’t Nod’s fortunes. We’ve since had a decade of those personal, unique stories, with sequels and off-shoots populating this world with a vibrant and diverse characters and journeys. Now, Deck Nine is ready to complete this particular time loop, returning once more to Max Caulfield’s tale in Life is Strange: Double Exposure.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Announce Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TOYz4NCFIXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the original, music plays a huge part of the game’s appeal, and any preview that has you sitting at the opening screen just to listen to the song has chosen the right tone. Each chapter’s music is listed below the title, just in case you weren’t sure just how important it is to the game’s feel.</p>


<p>We join Max and her friend Safi as they indulge in a spot of urban exploration, breaking into a run-down bar and taking pictures of the debris and decay littering it. It’s more on-rails than you might expect, with specific points of interest and the option to take snapshots appearing at select moments, rather than simply letting you loose in the space. Still, that control means that the conversation between Max and Safi feels natural and well-timed, without cluttering up the world with unnecessary interactions.</p>
<p>That specificity leads to having to interact with each point of interest before you can move the story on, at times making conversational choices, at others taking a picture. It’s a slow pace, but one that let’s you get a feel for the characters, and for the world that we’re being reintroduced to.</p>


<p>As college students, Max and her friends’ conversation is suitably hip, cool, and natural, and just as the first game did, helps to put you firmly into Max’s shoes. In the process, you learn about her journey from saviour to traveller and finally to photography student. You can also choose her outfits, and influence her love life, though this isn’t voyeurism, it’s pure character-building. I’d forgotten how much Max’s story had meant to me originally, and rejoining her here was both a step backwards and forward in time.</p>
<p>That is, of course, an underlying notion, given the first game’s use of time, with Max’s powers of time manipulation lost to her at the outset of Double Exposure. It feels from the off that’s unlikely to stay the case for very long, and soon enough tragedy strikes, a murder completely upending Max’s world, providing the trauma needed to reawaken her powers and present them in some all-new ways.</p>
<p>Max is now able to rip the world back and forth, shifting between two distinct timelines, trying to prevent what happens in one from happening in the other, and figuring out what just happened. It’s a compelling way of tackling this style of mystery.</p>

<p>Visually, eleven years of technological improvements has helped to make Life is Strange Double Exposure a clear step up for the series, with a greater level of accuracy to both the characters and the spaces they exist in. The artwork that populates the first two locations is amazing, and it’s a further aspect of the series that’s well represented here.</p>
<p>Art, music, storytelling, emotion. The four key components of Life is Strange are here in full effect, and the return to Max’s story is hugely exciting after the time apart. We can’t wait to see where Deck Nine is going to take her, and us.</p>
<p><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure is launching in full on 29th October, but those who pre-order with the Ultimate Edition are able to leap into the game from today, 15th October, and play chapters 1 &amp; 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-essentials-mod-brings-31-performance-improvement-with-minimal-visual-downgrade.1010004/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-mod-31-performance-improvement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest version of one of the best Silent Hill 2 mods available online brings significant performance improvements with a minimal visual downgrade.</p>
<p>The 2.3 version of the Essentials mod by Hybred brings a 31% performance increase with its Balanced preset with minimal downgrade to visuals. Other presets offer better visuals at worse performance and even massive performance boosts of up to 99% with massive changes to visuals, allowing a wide range of system configurations to run the game with acceptable performance. You can download the mod from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/silenthill2/mods/23?tab=description">Nexus Mods.</a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, no mod is currently capable of fully addressing the stuttering issues that plague the Silent Hill 2 remake on PC.&nbsp;<span>As highlighted in a&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-pc-is-yet-another-unreal-engine-case-of-stutter-struggle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent analysis</a>, the game suffers from traversal stutters that are way too common in Unreal Engine 5 games and significantly impact the experience. It is a shame, considering how the Bloober Team exceeded all expectations with the game, as Chris highlighted</span>&nbsp;in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide.</p>

In addition to <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, which only returned to the service this past May, <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> is also departing. That one stings, since I just started the first game with my kids over the weekend. Here’s the full list of 16 games leaving in October:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (PS4)</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Definitive Edition</em> (PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Teardown</em> (PS5)</li><li><em>Chorus </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>What Remains of Edith Finch </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Overcooked! 2</em> (PS4)</li><li><em> Superliminal </em>(PS4 | PS5)</li><li><em>Blasphemous</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Moving Out</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em> (PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts III </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory </em>(PS4)</li><li><em>Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme Vs.

And the<em> Kingdom Hearts </em>saga marks the latest wave of Square Enix RPGs to leave PS Plus. </p><p>Players have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1fnk0n6/here_are_the_games_that_are_likely_to_leave_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actually gotten quite good at predicting</a></span> which games will leave PS Plus when based on the six, 12, and 18-month cycles that most companies seem to sign deals for. Based on those metrics, fans were predicting that<em> Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart </em>and <em>Humanity </em>might not be long for PS Plus either. Seems like they’re here to stay for now.

<p>In <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/15/announcing-playstation-the-concert-world-tour-2025-2026/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the PlayStation Blog, Sony promises "thrilling music, cutting-edge visuals, and legendary video game titles" during the concert, as well as "innovative technology and world-class production" powering the show.</p>
<p>You'll be able to hear music that features a "stunning fusion of multi-layered visuals, immersive surround sound, and an all-star ensemble blending classical and modern instruments".</p>

<p>The PlayStation concert tour will begin with a world premiere on April 15th, which will take place in Dublin in Ireland. From there, the concert will head to "more than 200 cities across Europe, the United Kingdom, the United States, and beyond".</p>
<p>At the moment, only the European tour dates have been announced, and they'll take the concert to all kinds of places, including the Netherlands, France, Italy, Switzerland, and more.</p>

<p>According to Sony, more tour locations around the world will be revealed "very soon", so if you don't see your city in the PlayStation Blog announcement post, you might just want to hang on a while.</p>
<p>If you want to grab tickets, you'll get the opportunity to do so by heading to the event's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/www.playstation.com/theconcert" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official website</a> (which didn't seem to be operational at time of writing) and using the code PLAYCONCERT24, which Sony says "will be usable from 7am PT tomorrow" (that's 10am Eastern).</p>
<p>Naturally, Sony isn't revealing a full program for the concert yet, but we may well get a glimpse into more of the music that will be featured at the show in the coming months. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>If you've read any of my stuff by now, you'd know that I am a simple man who enjoys violence in his games. No story? Absolutely fine by me - cuts the faff. This is why I like the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cop-bastard">Cop Bastard</a> a lot. It's set in early 90s Japan, where you'll smoke fools with guns in straightforward homage to 90s action movies. And it has an updated demo - not officially part of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/steam-next-fest">Steam Next Fest</a> - out right now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There are several things I like about Cop Bastard. The first is its look: slightly VCR, slightly N64 Golden Eye, with its blocky enemies. The environments you shoot people in also seem well-judged, in that they are believable yet expressly designed to complement your bullets. There's a nice mixture of little office spaces where sheathes of paper rocket into the air, or potted plants in corridors that'll splinter into an earthy mess as you shotgun a lad in the head. You might happen upon a room with a vintage Japanese poster for a movie with a young Keanu Reeves in.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Another thing I like is the punch. You've got a few weapons: a pistol, a shotgun, an uzi, and a magnum. All of which feel like they should and have adequate heft. Enemies aren't clever, per se, but they are a joy to blast. They ragdoll nicely in shafts of blood, occasionally calling you a "motherfucker", which I delight in.</p><p>Press H once you've built up a meter by killing dudes and you'll enter a slightly off-feeling slow-mo mode that makes aiming easier, I think? Really, I wanted a cool slide or a dive for the ultimate John Woo factor - but maybe those are coming in the full game.</p>
<p>You can give the demo a go over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2174740/COP_BASTARD_demo/">Steam</a> if you like.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Something else to take note of with Nintendo Switch games sold through Woot is that they're marked as region-free, so you might not get a US version of what you buy. This isn't an issue as one of the major differences you're seeing is a change in rating logo boxes, but if you are considering purchasing DLC, you could run into a few regional hurdles. For example, if the game you get is a UK version, you'll need to purchase from the UK eShop to get the DLC. Most of the games listed here--and below--don't have DLC, so you're largely in the clear.

A compilation of 50 full games evoking the 8-bit era, styled as a library from a long-lost fictional studio, created by the real-world developers who have given the world projects like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spelunky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Skorpulac</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Catacomb</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kids</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Downwell</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">? Without exaggeration, that sounds like a retro player (and pixel art enthusiast)'s dream come true.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While that sounds hyberbolic, the team appears to have truly pulled it off. The game launched on September 18 to plenty of acclaim (and currently, overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that I've played a bunch of the games in the collection (and watched dozens of hours of streams), I've been most taken by the marriage of design decisions that play with old-school and retro convention and the team's full commitment to striking 8-and-16-bit pixel art. I had the opportunity to send along a few questions to developers Derek Yu, Tyriq Plummer and Eirik Suhrke, focusing on the project's style holistically, the challenges of getting the 8-bit era's multitude of looks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>just right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the utter delight of the</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50">UFO 50</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://lospec.com/palette-list/ufo-50"> color palette.</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>First off, I know this was a huge collaboration (and undertaking!)—to create 50 games with a coherent visual language, style, and connective threads among them. While I am mostly going to ask about the visual aspects of the project, I want to start off with a basic production question. Did you produce the games individually as separate projects, or share assets/code across the spectrum while you were developing each title (and the meta elements?)</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tyriq Plummer: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">From a technology standpoint, the games were all made as sort of sub-projects in a larger overarching project which provided some essential shared infrastructure, including handling textboxes and certain particle effects, collision code or movement engines and such. There are also just generally a decent number of shared assets across the games; you’ll notice if you play for instance: "Oh hey I remember that rock from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Velgress</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">" or “This enemy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caramel Caramel</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks really familiar" and stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While it may have largely been a side-effect of just being efficient in terms of not wanting to make unnecessary work, it’s also pretty fun to be able to connect those dots and have a feeling sometimes that certain would-be-inconsequential enemies and tiles and such get to take on a certain "cameo" quality, sneaking in where you might not expect them and getting to go: "You again!"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Derek Yu: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Early on, the technical limitations of our resolution, palette, and color rules were probably the main unifying factors, since we worked separately a lot (in parallel is maybe more accurate). We did end up sharing quite a bit of tech, as Tyriq mentioned, but I always thought it was funny that the final collection has three different platform engines in it, for example. Some things you just want to be a certain way for your own comfort!</span></p><p>Via Mossmouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The further we got into development, the more everyone worked on everyone else’s games and the more sharing it felt like we did. And we were all looking for ways to connect the games together visually, thematically, narratively, etc.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regardless of the overall approach, how did you manage to work with a very consistent look and feel, even across genres/styles (and truly, the evolutionary epochs that were present in the comparatively short time of the 8-bit era)? Each game here (that I have played thus far) feels like a lost NES game, which I can only imagine was a huge undertaking.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I can't speak to the early process since I joined once all of those restrictions and stuff were already kind of laid down, but I mostly took my cues from what was already extant in the games when I started working on them, and just kind of made judgment calls as to what seemed like a reasonable thing on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think there were a couple times when someone (Eirik) pointed out that I should pull back on the particle effects or something because the number of sprites on screen drifted out-of-spec, but for the most part I think there’s great value in these sorts of aesthetic restrictions that can actually make things easier than not having them, because you don’t have such a paralyzingly vast possibility space. When you know where the bounds are and they’re clearly defined, you can immediately rule out a lot of dead ends and get closer to something workable much faster.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think starting with a consistent set of limitations and then everyone being very open to following each other's lead is what led to the final collection feeling so unified. A game that one person started would eventually go through multiple passes by multiple different people, and you pick up a lot of cool things from each other that way. We all have our own distinct styles and it was important to keep that intact, but over eight years of working together this way I’m sure that we’re all a little more similar to one another than when we started</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are a few cases of fairly direct homages—both in the spritework and in genre/mechanics—to existing NES games, and some cases where I can't find a direct predecessor. Did you mine trusty sources like MobyGames/VG Museum etc. for inspiration, or rely more on existing memory/other inspirations here in creating the various games? Were there any particularly weird or interesting inspirations in the bunch? Did anyone have a beloved obscure game from the era they got to highlight in the course of creating </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We have a Slack channel called "coolstuff" where we share inspirational screenshots, box art, flyers, playthroughs, etc., that we come across. I think Eirik and I both spend a lot of time following accounts that post those kinds of things. NES was certainly a big inspiration, but we were also influenced by arcade games, PC Engine, MSX, and PC-88… a lot of which we experienced only through the internet. Jon and I grew up digging through troves of freeware and shareware games on DOS and Windows, as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, I did look up NES title screens to get a sense for how they were put together and what the possibilities were there—title screens weren’t something I thought about deeply as a kid, particularly the details of the text and the transitions to and from. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.vgmaps.com/">VGMaps</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was also a helpful resource and I remember looking at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ninja Gaiden II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in particular to try and understand how they made their levels feel so dynamic and three-dimensional given the limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of times the best inspiration comes from some fleeting encounter, though. For example, I’ve never played </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>King’s Quest V</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on the NES, but seeing a few screenshots here and there has really stuck with me over the years. Both games have a compelling style that’s out of my comfort zone—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Otocky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with its vibrant, geometric shading and King’s Quest at the opposite end with its muddy and messy texturing. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the perfect opportunity to learn from everything we could and experiment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Eirik Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> One thing I would do while helping massage our palette into shape was to pull in screenshots of other exciting, cool or curious looking games from all kinds of different 8- and 16-bit systems to see what they would look like truncated down to our specific color set. This helped highlight some of the strengths we could lean into as well as illuminate some of the shortcomings we might want to iterate on still. I think a lot of 80s and 90s pixel art and tiling idioms also could have rubbed off on me as I was scrutinizing it like this as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>On that note, were there cases where specific visual design elements impacted gameplay or mechanics? Did something ever just look so cool/fun/weird that you felt the need to make a game out of it or go a particular direction with a mechanic/feature?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Campanella 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a rail shooter of sorts, definitely grew out of a fascination with 2D-based pseudo-3D in general and a question of what that could look and feel like within our framework. For example, we chose not to allow sprite scaling which meant here every enemy had to be manually rendered out for every applicable distance. Once the art and the depth perspective code was in and feeling cool it was just a matter of designing a game that was fun to play around that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Plummer:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I think when I first played an early version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Valbrace</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> my immediate thought was "this is rad and also these enemies super need to be able to jump into the background." The strong perspective of the classic first-person dungeon crawler necessarily leads to a kind of visual depth, and that depth carrying over during fights immediately made me want to make that extra visual space be mechanically relevant in combat as well.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bushido Ball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the presence of the referee also made me want him to have a more active role than just as a background character, so I made him give penalties for things like letting the ball rest for too long or hitting your opponent directly with your sword and stuff. I think that really made the game feel more alive and characterful, in addition to all the actual gameplay implications. Like—now you can imagine that this is a sport with a governing body that actually makes these rules, and suddenly there’s a small bit of a torn edge to the page instead of a clean cut, where you can fill in for yourself what lies beyond. I love that kind of stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What went into creating the UFO 50 palette (which is a fun one to play with!)—did you have original NES constraints in mind, or were you instead going after a sense of "how you might remember" these colors looking?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yu:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> My initial goal was to create a pretty broad palette of colors that included "useful" colors like greens for vegetation, blues for water and sky, etc., but also splashed some "fun" colors like pink and turquoise. I read up on how other people theorycrafted palettes and studied some of the more striking-looking NES games… at one point I believe Eirik posted some beautiful screenshots of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Kickmaster</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Low G Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as a reference for what he liked. But we also examined the palettes of other consoles, too.</span></p><p>Via MossMouth</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually I passed the palette over to Eirik and he adjusted it quite a bit to turn it into what we have today.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Suhrke:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I believe some of the pink/peach tones as well as the slime green were definitely influenced by the NES palette directly, whereas our sour yellow was more inspired by the MSX palette.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, at a certain point it became more about tweaking it to serve the specific needs we were seeing as we were developing the games. Specifically, we were happy with our mid tones but needed more dark colors for backgrounds and bright colors for highlights so we started nudging some around until the right compromise was made.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and NIS America have announced the&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the long-awaited JRPG set to arrive in the West in February.</p>
<p>Per a new release date trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on Valentine's Day in the West. It'll have some stiff competition, with the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day">Date Everything!</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>&nbsp;</em>vying for your attention on that date as well.</p>
<p>As you'd expect,&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>picks up where the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>left off. It once again follows the adventures of Van Arkride, a spriggan (think bounty hunter crossed with detective) who must investigate a series of murders.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=DuCcs5GS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date-fishing.jpg?itok=LdxTfC-E 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Van Arkride might have some murders to investigate, but that doesn't mean he can't stop for a spot of fishing.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, although&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak 2</em>&nbsp;takes the form of a murder investigation in terms of its plot and setup, it's still offering exactly the kind of classic action-RPG combat you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Daybreak&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>Two new systems, Cross Charge and EX Chains, have been introduced. Cross Charge lets you bring in a party member to deal damage if you manage to successfully pull off a perfect dodge, while EX Chains deal huge damage to stunned enemies once certain battle conditions have been met.</p>
<p>Each act of&nbsp;<em>Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>will contain multiple chapters, and some of those chapters may focus on Van's friends rather than him, as the party will frequently split up to deal with multiple issues in different locations.</p>
<p>Some chapters will even require the special skills of certain party members, like Swin's tailing skills or Mare's orbal hacking capabilities.</p>

<p>Given that the original&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak&nbsp;</em>only <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date">launched in the West this past July</a>, it's nice that you won't have to wait too long to check out the sequel.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668430/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_through_Daybreak_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004596" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Nintendo Switch on February 14th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-wave-2-october-2024-lineup-headlined-by-call-of-duty-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has announced the Xbox Game Pass Wave 2 October 2024 lineup.</p><p>The headline here is of course the October 25 release of Black Ops 6, the first Call of Duty game to launch day-one on Game Pass. It comes a year after Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, which has also seen the likes of Diablo 4 and Modern Warfare 3 arrive on Game Pass, and will, in November, see StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection hit the subscription service.</p><p>Black Ops 6’s launch straight into Game Pass is a big gamble for Microsoft. It hopes the power of Call of Duty will boost subscriber numbers and revenue (itself bolstered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">the recent Game Pass price rise and restructure</a>), but it comes with the risk of losing sales of the full-price game. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>In the shorter term, tomorrow, October 16, South Park: The Fractured but Whole (Cloud, Console, and PC) hits Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. A day later, on October 17, Donut County (Cloud, Console, and PC) returns to the Game Pass library via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard, and MechWarrior 5: Clans (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) hits Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass as a day-one release.</p><p>Then it’s the big one: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (Cloud, Console, and PC) on October 25 via Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass only.

There are a few miscellaneous and collectible trophies thrown in too, as well as the party member-specific trophies — although, curiously, not for completing a romance storyline.</p><p>BioWare games traditionally do include achievements for romancing characters, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> appears to be taking a different, perhaps more Platinum-friendly approach.</p><p>The names of the achievements tied to those story beats suggest various plot developments, locations, and even the final boss, so it’s worth a PSA for the perhaps inevitable ramping up of Dragon Age: The Veilguard spoilers on the internet as we near the release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-settles-gamers-antitrust-lawsuit-over-69-billion-activision-blizzard-acquisition<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft has settled the antitrust lawsuit filed on behalf of a group of gamers who objected to the company’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-antitrust-lawsuit-gamers-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>, details of the settlement were undisclosed, but we do know the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means it cannot be filed again. Lawyers agreed that "each party shall bear their own costs and fees."</p><p>The lawsuit was filed back in 2022 in California by a group of gamers from across multiple states who expressed concern about the potential negative impact of a Microsoft monopoly in the video game space sparked by absorbing the makers of Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, and Candy Crush, among many other games. It came soon after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began its work to block the deal from closing, work that ultimately failed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The lawsuit had claimed that if Microsoft were to acquire Activision Blizzard, it could lead to the company prioritizing Xbox versions of multiplatform games, prices going up, or the cancelation of certain games. There was specific concern about the potential impact on Game Pass subscribers should the buyout go through.</p><p>Since Microsoft successfully acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, Game Pass has changed significantly. It’s slowly added Activision Blizzard games to the subscription service (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">with Black Ops 6 set to be the first mainline Call of Duty game to launch in Game Pass day-one later this month</a>), but it’s also restructured Game Pass itself.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-standard-tier-doesnt-include-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-starfield-diablo-4-and-more">Day-one releases are now not a part of Game Pass’ revised basic tier</a>, and big-ticket games such as Diablo 4, Starfield, and Call of Duty are reserved for the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass subscriptions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft has also raised the price of Game Pass</a>, most recently in July when Xbox Game Pass Ultimate increased from $16.99 to $19.99 per month.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-hikes-were-inevitable-analysts-say">The price increase was described as inevitable</a> by analysts speaking with IGN, with some predicting that Game Pass will eventually see the introduction of ads. The changes are said to be part of a push by Xbox to recoup some of its $69 billion investment in Activision Blizzard.</p><p>In response, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ftc-blasts-xbox-game-pass-price-increase-and-new-tiers-as-product-degradation">the FTC called out Microsoft's Game Pass price rises</a> and labeled the new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier a "degraded product." The FTC claimed Microsoft was "exercising market power post-merger" of Activision Blizzard with its controversial changes to Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft responded to the FTC's filing about Xbox Game Pass price increases, calling the FTC’s complaint a "misleading, extra-record account of the facts." It insisted the FTC was wrong to call Game Pass Standard a “degraded” version because it includes multiplayer.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft has also cut an eye-watering 2,550 staff from its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard</a>, with multiple studios falling by the wayside. In February, the FTC claimed Microsoft contradicted its intentions during its acquisition of Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">when it laid off 1,900 employees from its games division in January</a>.</p><p>FTC lawyer Imad Abyad argued that Microsoft said it wanted Activision to "operate as a limited-integration studio." But because Activision staff were among those affected by the layoffs, Abyad claimed this contradicted Microsoft’s prior claim. Microsoft responded to insist Activision Blizzard had already planned mass layoffs regardless of whether the acquisition was completed.</p><p>“As time passes, Microsoft continues to increase its market power, prices have increased, games continue to be canceled, development capacities continue to diminish, and Game Pass continues to trend towards a monopoly,” attorney Joseph Saveri said in a court filing.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising-announced-by-netease.1009869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase and Bungie have announced&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, a mobile spinoff of the hugely popular MMORPG-FPS hybrid&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>, and it's getting a closed alpha playtest next month.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/news/20240930/41118_1181986.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement</a>, NetEase describes&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>as a "new epic free-to-play mobile sci-fi RPG shooter" with a variety of playable heroes, a "shared world", and several game modes. It'll offer both first-person and third-person shooter gameplay.</p>
<p>The game will take place "within the rich tapestry of the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe" and will be both developed and published by NetEase itself, although naturally, the game is officially licensed by Bungie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=iWUcjBA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-rising-mobile-spinoff-shooting.jpg?itok=DGCVFYiA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will take place within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe, but perhaps not quite as you know it.</figcaption></figure><p>NetEase says that&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>will be set "in an alternate&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>timeline" and will explore a story "in the post-Dark Age era", likely to avoid any chance of tangling up the series' canon ahead of Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-new-release-cadence">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>efforts</a>.</p>
<p>The game will feature single-player, co-op, and competitive gameplay, just like&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>itself, and will also feature both "game modes familiar to&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>players" and "all-new modes that introduce new ways" to experience the core gameplay.</p>
<p>NetEase senior VP Ethan Wang says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver a&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>-caliber experience to mobile devices", promising an "action-packed RPG shooter set within the&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>universe".</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising</em>, which shows off the world of the game and just a little hint of gameplay towards the end, right here.</p>

<p>In addition to releasing this trailer, NetEase has also released a developer preview in which NetEase and Bungie staffers talk about exactly what&nbsp;<em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>is and how they're building it. You can check that video out here.</p>

<p><em>Destiny: Rising&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but you can sign up to get a chance to be part of the game's first closed alpha test in November by <a href="https://www.playdestinyrising.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">visiting its official website</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-brings-new-trader-new-mechanic-and-more-to-ptr.1009866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-bog-witch-update-ptr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iron Gate and Coffee Stain have released a new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>update on the game's public test realm, and it brings a new trader, a major new game mechanic, and more. Be aware that we'll be spoiling some of what's included in this update, so read on at your peril!</p>
<p>The update is currently available to try out in&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>'s beta, and its first major addition is the titular Bog Witch, a new trader who has new goods for you to buy. She can be found in the Swamps, and she'll sell you ingredients and materials for brewing potions.</p>
<p>She's also got things that will be useful for the update's new Feast mechanic, which lets you cook large meals you can share amongst several players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=f3UazCDN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valheim-the-bog-witch-update-food.jpg?itok=N2-vrynr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>The Bog Witch update brings a new mechanic for you to check out and lots more.</figcaption></figure><p>Three new skills are being introduced in this update: Cooking, Farming, and Crafting.</p>
<p>Cooking reduces food crafting time and gives you the chance to gain another food while crafting. Farming reduces Cultivator stamina cost and increases farming item durability, while Crafting reduces item crafting time and boosts crafting item durability. It's all pretty simple stuff.</p>
<p>You'll also find lots of new crafting materials and potions to try out, as well as some new emotes to help you communicate with your friends and much more besides.</p>

<p>You can read this update's patch notes, which also contain a ton of bug fixes and minor gameplay improvements, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/7514910232818862414" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a> if you wish.</p>
<p>Unlike previous major&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>updates along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-ashlands-update-ptr-launch">Ashlands</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valheim-mistlands-update-available-public-test-branch">Mistlands</a>, this update doesn't add any new biomes or creatures for you to fight, but it's still a pretty substantial addition to the world of&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>nonetheless.</p>
<p>If you want to join the beta branch and check out this game, you can do so by heading to the game's Properties menu in your Steam library. From there, select Betas and enter the code "yesimadebackups", which will grant you access to the PTR.</p>
<p>Xbox players, meanwhile, should use the Xbox Insider Hub app to find&nbsp;the "<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>Public Test" option within the Previews menu.</p>
<p><em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/valheim" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

Here is a breakdown of every set and how we’ve been able to earn them.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Shenron)</strong> - The most iconic set from the franchise, one that resides on planet Earth and summons Shenron. Finishing some of Whis’s missions can earn you a full set. They otherwise seem to have a small chance of dropping during offline or online battles. Those who bought the Season Pass will also receive one free wish to use.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Porunga)</strong> - The second set introduced, residing on Planet Namek, and summoning Porunga. These seem to have an even smaller chance of dropping during battles.</li><li><strong>Dragon Balls (Super Shenron)</strong> - The most powerful set that summons Super Shenron. One set can be earned from completing Goku’s Episode Battles, while another can be earned from Trunks’ Episode Battles. It seems likely that these could drop from offline and online battles as well, but if they do, they must have the lowest chances of all. Those who purchased the Ultimate Edition get one free wish to use.</li></ul><p>Given that we can confirm at least two of them will drop from Battles, you’ll want to complete as many as possible. <strong>The most effective method I’ve found for farming Dragon Balls is to play a Battle against a CPU on the World Tournament Stage, with Out-of-Bounds rules on.</strong> All you need to do to win is knock them off the stage and onto the ground. I acquired Dragon Balls more often when playing on higher difficulties, although you might enjoy the pacing of fighting against a weaker CPU.</p><p>Equipping some ability items to raise your Ki is a fantastic strategy if you can combo into a Beam or Blast Super. Starting a match with Gogeta Blue’s Stardust Blaster against Hercule or a larger opponent is practically guaranteed to send them out of bounds. Another option is to go in as Great Ape Vegeta and try to throw the opponent out of the ring, which can feel pretty cathartic after fighting the big monster. No matter who you use, your goal should be to finish a match within 30 seconds.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zeros-great-ape-vegeta-guide-1851669880">Struggling With <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Great Ape Vegeta? We’ve Got You</a></span></p><p>I do want to share a word of caution though: <strong>you cannot collect more Dragon Balls once you have a full set</strong>. A message will pop up to say that you can’t accept another one of the same type because you have too many. I held onto mine in hopes that it would make it more likely for the other types to pop up, but I ended up with more messages if anything. You should aim to use the Dragon Ball sets as soon as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-recommend-id="image://62941c3f4357d013bc4bf8875c9e0b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1028" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The iconic green dragon Shenron offers multiple options to wish for." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Summoning Shenron gives you access to a single wish. I’d argue he’s middle of the pack in what he offers, but that depends entirely on what you want to unlock. Here are your choices with this dragon:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 300,000 Zeni</li><li><strong>I want you to raise my Player Level</strong> - One of the first things I did after the tutorial was summon Shenron and choose this wish. I was pretty happy with the result, as it increased my Player Level to 8 and expanded the Shop quite a bit.</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - These are titles for your Player Card.</li><li><strong>I want New Outfits </strong>- These are cosmetic options for specific characters.

They’re both thematically appropriate to this dragon and they certainly are fan favorites.<br></p><p>The remainder of his choices are also pretty enticing. He gives you everything the other dragons can, and he grants far more Zeni and player experience. Here’s everything you can get from Super Shenron:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>I want more Characters</strong> - Allows you to unlock Goku Black or Fused Zamasu.</li><li><strong>I want more Zeni</strong> - Grants 1,000,000 Zeni.</li><li><strong>I want you to raise my Player Level</strong> - Using a different profile that was at a player level 2, this option skyrocketed it to 18.</li><li><strong>I want new Outfits</strong> - Offers the same outfits that Shenron does.</li><li><strong>I want more Titles</strong> - Super Shenron has some unique titles, and provides the same ones offered by Shenron and Porunga.</li><li><strong>I want Ability Items</strong> - Offers the same items as Porunga.</li><li><strong>I want to complete an Episode Battle</strong> - Offers a Dragon Orb item to make secondary objectives easier.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-recommend-id="image://728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-recommend-id="image://728d0a8167edb4d1cbbed95641114c87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The confirmation screen for using a Dragon Orb item." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every dragon can grant help completing an Episode Battle. Choosing that wish will give you an exclusive item called a Dragon Orb. <strong>These can be used only when hovering over an Episode Battle with branching paths, as they make the secondary objectives easier to meet.</strong> Even though a lot of these objectives just require you to win within a certain time, using a Dragon Orb for a bit more leeway can be a big help. The only caveat is that you won’t earn victory rewards from it, but that’s not too bad of a trade-off to see some really fun what-if stories.<br></p><p>This option won’t pop up until you’ve come across an Episode Battle with potential branching paths. Although that occurs early on in Goku’s story, those who immediately spent a lot of time in multiplayer modes or received a free Shenron summon—depending upon which edition they purchased—would likely not have seen this. Make sure to keep an eye out for this option if you didn’t see it during your first summon(s)!</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t spend much time explaining the nuances of summoning the dragons, and leaves it all for us to discover. As fun as that idea is, nobody likes to feel like they made the wrong choice, especially with how rare it can be to see Porunga and Super Shenron.<br></p><p>The best choice for you depends entirely on preference and how far along you are, but you should be better equipped to select a more favorable option. Go out and make your wishes in confidence!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
