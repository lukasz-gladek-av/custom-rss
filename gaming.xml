                <p>Lego <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> has been in a holding pattern since its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-may-the-4th-brings-star-wars-pass-for-lego-fortnite-and-new-skins-instruments-cars/2900-5337/" data-ref-id="2900-5337">Star Wars-focused Lego Pass</a> concluded in July, but popular mode is expanding in a big way this week with the Lost Isles update, which drops on Tuesday alongside Fortnite patch 31.20. Lost Isles will add a massive new area to your Lego Fortnite world--your island will stay as it is, but you'll be able to travel to another island with five different biomes that are unlike anything from your existing islands, and they're full of new items and weapons for you to discover. We've also got a new Lego Pass, a series of Marvel-oriented Lego kit bundles that include skins, and all players will now be able to build an airship for getting around.</p><p>While Lego Fortnite doesn't have seasons the same that way that battle royale and Festival do, this Lost Isles refresh is on the level of a season launch in terms of how much content it's adding. The world available for all players to explore is doubling in size with the introduction of the Lost Isles area. This new area is separate from your existing map, though. In order to reach it, you'll just need to use a battle bus station. Once you've arrived, you'll have five new environments to check out: the beach, jungle, plains, mountains, and the islands floating in the air above it all.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4367724"></a><figcaption>Here's a look at the new Lego Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4367724-tropical-treasures-pass-lego-fortnite-lost-isles-1920x1080-664476b97645.jpg"></figure><p>The new Lego Pass features island builds and a new Peely skin. Unlike the previous Lego Pass, which was all about Star Wars, there isn't a collaboration involved with this pass. The Lego Pass has two tracks, a free one and a paid one, which you progress at the same time by completing quests. If you do upgrade to the Premium track for 1400 V-Bucks, you'll get the new Island Adventure Peely immediately. But this pass is pretty short--it ends on October 11.</p><p>If you thought you were going to make it through this announcement without any Marvel stuff, you should have known better. This update is also introducing a trio of new Lego build kits featuring iconic Marvel locations like the Daily Bugle--and they're bundled with Marvel skins. There will be three such sets in the item shop soon: Mary Jane Watson and the Daily Bugle for 2800 V-Bucks; Spider-Man Zero and the Queens apartment block Peter Parker lives in for 2600; and the Weapon X Skin and Weapon X Labs decor items for 2600. Like most bundles that cost V-Bucks, the price will be discounted if you own the skins already--the Daily Bugle will cost only 1300 V-Bucks if you already own Mary Jane, for example.</p><p>Aside from all that, one of the most exciting additions in this update for longtime Fortnite players is the Klombo, a large, four-legged lizard who appeared in battle royale in Chapter 3 Season 1. The Klombo is a friendly fella usually, happy to have players ride on his back or to provide rewards if you fed him berries--but his wrath was legendary if you annoyed him. It's been more than two-and-a-half years since we last saw a Klombo, so this is pretty exciting.</p>

<p>If you've spent any time with retro gaming emulators, you're likely familiar with the joy of browsing through a long list of (legally obtained) ROMs and feeling overwhelmed at a wide range of titles you've never even heard of. Picking randomly through such a game list is like wandering through a foreign country, searching for hidden jewels among all the shovelware in the bewildering and wildly imaginative early video game history.
</p><p><em>UFO 50</em> captures that feeling perfectly, combining the freewheeling inventiveness of old-school game design with modern refinements and more consistent baseline quality bred over the ensuing decades. The result is an extremely playable love letter to the gaming history that will charm even the most jaded retro game fan.</p>
<h2>A loving homage</h2>
<p><em>UFO 50</em> presents itself as a collection of 50 dusty game cartridges made by UFO Soft, a fictional developer that operated from 1982 to 1989. Working through the company's catalog, you'll see evolution in graphics, music, and gameplay design that mirror the ever-changing gaming market of the real-world '80s. You'll also see the same characters, motifs, and credited "developers" appearing over and over again, building a convincing world behind the games themselves.</p>
<p>The individual games in <em>UFO 50</em> definitely wear their influences on their sleeves, with countless, almost overt homages to specific '80s arcade and console games. But there isn't a single title here that I'd consider a simple clone or knock-off of an old gaming concept; each sub-game brings its own twist or novel idea that makes it feel new.</p>

          </ul>
  </div>

<p><em>Bubble Bobble</em> homage <em>Kick Club</em>, for instance, replaces its inspiration's bubble-blowing dinosaurs with a soccer player that has to constantly chase down his only weapon: a soccer ball. <em>Vainger</em> combines <em>Metroid</em>-style shooting and gated, maze-like exploration with the gravity-flipping of <em>Metal Storm</em>. <em>Magic Garden</em> combines the avoid-your-own-tail gameplay of <em>Snake</em> with items that let you eat up obstacles, <em>Pac-Man</em>-style.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Anyone who remembers playing games in the '80s will instantly clock plenty of other clear references. A small sampling of ones I noticed includes: <em>Bad Dudes</em>, <em>Blaster Master</em>, <em>Gradius</em>, <em>River City Ransom</em>, <em>Shadowgate</em>, <em>Super Dodge Ball</em>, <em>Smash TV</em>, <em>Space Harrier</em>, and <em>Super Sprint</em>. And, just like any list of '80s ROMs, you'll also encounter plenty of grid-based puzzle games and shoot-em-ups, each with their own take on the popular genres.</p>
<p>But other <em>UFO 50</em> offerings are retro-stylized versions of genres and games that didn't really exist in the '80s. If you ever wondered what a caveman-themed tower defense game would look like on the NES, <em>Rock On! Island</em> has the answer. Or if you want to see a positional arena fighter in the style of <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> (complete with original characters that sport their own moves and weapons) then <em>Hyper Contender</em> has you covered. Then there's <em>Velgress</em>, which combines the retro run-and-gun platforming of the NES with the roguelike procedural generation of a modern classic like <em>Downwell</em>.</p>
<p>Still, other <em>UFO 50</em> games squeeze completely original concepts (as far as I can tell) into the limited technology of the time period. <em>Lords of Diskonia</em> is a tactical battler that has you flinging units represented by <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/521/crokinole">Crokinole</a>-style disks at the other side. <em>Party House</em> asks you to manage a Rolodex of party guests to maximize your money and popularity without attracting unwelcome attention from the cops. <em>Waldorf's Journey</em> involves flinging the titular walrus on lengthy blind jumps while carefully adjusting his landing with hilarious, energy-consuming flaps of his flippers.</p>

<p>The sheer variety of different gameplay ideas on offer here is incredible. There are real-time strategy games and cooperative two-player brawlers. There's a full-fledged golf RPG and also a 2D golf game with pinball-style hazards. There's a <em>Dave the Diver</em>-esque undersea exploration adventure and a couple of Final Fantasy<em>-</em>style RPGs. There's a game that combines <em>Crazy Taxi</em> and the original, overhead <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. There's a <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> homage that combines five different genres with five unique, fully realized anthropomorphic human-animal hybrids.</p>

        <p>Redundancies could affect over 40 employees.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
nDreams, the VR-focused developer behind the likes of Far Cry VR and Synapse, has confirmed restructuring and redundancies that could affect up to 17.5 percent of its workforce.
</p>
<p>
The UK studio, which was founded in 2006, currently consists of four teams - nDreams Studio, Orbital, Near Light, and Elevation -  employing around 250 people between them. That means upward of 40 staff could lose their jobs as nDreams' redundancy process proceeds.
</p>
<p>
In a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/uk-studio-ndreams-confirms-layoffs-could-impact-17-5-percent-of-workforce">provided to Game Developer</a>, nDreams CEO Patrick O'Luanaigh blamed the cuts on a "challenging VR games market" requiring a "renewed strategic focus". O'Luanaigh added that jobs may be cut at all levels, "including senior leadership".

<p>
"We are working tirelessly to support our team with the respect and care they deserve throughout this challenging process," O'Luanaigh wrote, "including all our efforts to comprehensively assist those whose positions may be impacted to move into new roles within nDreams or elsewhere."
</p>
<p>
"Having been fully-focused on VR development since 2013," he continued, "we have inevitably faced many challenges in building a modest independent studio into a world-leading VR game developer... These necessary considerations of losing valued team members are the most difficult yet, but our belief in XR gaming is undimmed."
</p>
<p>
VR games Frenzies and Vendetta Forever, both currently in development at nDreams, are said to be unaffected by the restructuring, with O'Luanaigh insisting the changes will "better serve current and future audiences in creating medium-defining titles for years to come."
</p>
<p>
Today's news follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-and-powerwash-simulator-vr-developer-ndreams-acquired">nDreams' $110m USD acquired</a> by Swedish conglomerate Aonic last November, and continues a year which has now seen over 12,500 games industry workers lose their jobs. In February, Sony <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">laid off 900 PlayStation employees</a>, while Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">latest Xbox layoffs</a> means over 2,550 workers have lost their jobs at the company in the last year.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-appears-to-be-targeting-40-launch-price/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Marathon, Bungie's new project, supposedly targets a $40 launch price. Marathon is an upcoming PvP extraction shooter originally revealed in May 2023. Sources have reportedly spoken to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-marathon-targeting-40-launch-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Post</a> about the upcoming title and that they're considering a $40 launch price for Marathon.</p>
<p>This suggests that Bungie is opting for the game to be a pay-to-play premium model rather than free-to-play with microtransactions, as seen in plenty of current games, including their well-known Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Recently, Bungie and<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/"> Sony</a> have discussed Marathon's pricing strategy and how they will approach it. Conversations and an extended dialogue likely happened once Sony's latest live-service game, Concord, failed to take off and was shut down and refunded just two weeks later.</p>
<p>Since its announcement, Marathon has continued to stir up conversation and controversy, especially under its new director, Joe Ziegler. This is because people feel the game may be veering too close to hero shooters like Valorant and Overwatch. After all, Concord was one of those hero shooters, and it just didn't take off the way Sony expected it to.</p>
<p>According to The Game Post, multiple sources have since confirmed that Marathon is not "hero-focused. " Instead, the heroes in Marathon are classes with their own set of abilities and special abilities, making them all degrees of different from each other. Unlike other hero shooters, the gameplay structure is similar to Escape from Tarkov but with a "Bungie twist." Only two maps are playable, but it's uncertain whether it will get more than just two maps when it eventually releases.</p>
<p>In the past couple of months, Bungie has been conducting playtests with people from the internal teams, streamers, and content creators all participating. So far, the feedback suggests that it is somewhat positive but not worth the $40 price tag. If they continue to go through with it, they may risk facing the same treatment that Concord did.</p>
<p>Although the company is receiving positive feedback during the playtests, it's said that morale within Bungie is continuing to remain low as the developers are growing frustrated with leadership changes at the studio. As a result, concern continues to soar regarding the launch of Marathon. In addition, they are also facing anxiety about Destiny 2's future and how it will<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-celebrates-10-years-of-destiny-shares-codename-frontiers-details/"> shape up with the new expansion model</a>.</p>
<p>The team creating Marathon is riding high, and its success has the potential to be pivotal for Bungie and Destiny. A new trailer for Marathon is said to be in production, which may reveal some new details about the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-pubg-mobile-update-adds-new-maps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PUBG Mobile has revealed two new WOW maps and other content as a part of the Green Game Jam 2024 campaign, Play for Green.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-new-wow-maps-for-pubg-mobile">2 New WOW Maps for PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>The developers of PUBG mobile worked with climatologist Professor Mark Maslin to imagine how the world of this game would appear after 100 years of climate change. This collaboration led to creating two maps, Ruins of Erangel Sandstorm and Exploration, in the World of Wonder mode.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Through these PUBG Mobile maps, the developers hope to create a visualisation of the future, where climate change impacts the world in devastating ways. The maps feature elements like raging sandstorms, dead trees, sea level rise, and more.</p>



<p>In Ruins of Erangel: Sandstorm, players must race to collect medical supplies across the map. As the sandstorm closes in, the player who survives the longest wins the match. Ruins of Erangel: Exploration, players will be able to participate in a “unique narrative-driven experience” that features a “powerful story about the impact of climate change”.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Here are the <a href="https://x.com/PUBGMOBILE/status/1835720125594660923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">codes</a> to access the two new PUBG Mobile maps:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Ruins of Erangel Sandstorm: 8532400</li>



<li>Ruins of Erangel Exploration: 8532398</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-new-themed-wow-items">New Themed WOW Items</h2>



<p>Some new themed items have also dropped for the World of Wonder mode to keep the conversation about environmental change going. These Play for Green-themed items include two endangered plants, the Giant Baobab Tree and the California Redwood, a new Classic Blue Zone Device Effect (Sandstorm Zone), a new Water Cube Appearance (Lava and Polluted Water), and the Green Game Jam logo.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-mobile-run-for-green-event">PUBG Mobile Run for Green Event</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile also has a Play for Green-themed event for the game’s classic modes. Each player’s sprint distance across any of the game’s classic modes during the event will contribute to server-wide milestones. These milestones will help “aid projects worldwide in protecting vital habitats.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the Run for Green event, players can unlock a new interactive area in PUBG Mobile’s Home mode. The interactive area is a garden that brings attention to “5 endangered tree and plant species in the real world,” including the Giant Baobab Tree, Wollemi pine, Monkey Puzzle Tree, Pitcher Plant, and Corpse Flower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego Fortnite is getting a new expansion this week. Dubbed “The Lost Isles”, this new expansion to the game adds a number of new areas, weapons, creatures, and more.</p>



<p>“Landfall has been made on Lost Isles, a new addition to your world begging to be explored,” the description reads. “Step boldly ashore, face its unknown dangers, and prepare for a LEGO® adventure unlike any before.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Explore Lost Isles in LEGO Fortnite!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UqRxFLOG68?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>There are five new areas for players to explore, each with their own unique feel: Beach, Plains, Jungle, Mountains, and Floating Islands. </p>



<p>Some regions have friendly characters that just need help (the Plains). Others, however, could have you come up against Storm-Wild Tomatoes.</p>



<p>As part of this new expansion for Lego Fortnite, there will be a new battle pass called the “Tropical Treasures Lego Pass”. The pass will offer players more items and builds to unlock. It will run until October 11.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lego Fortnite’s Lost Isles expansion releases for everyone on September 17. Full details on the update can be found via <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/explore-lost-isles-in-lego-fortnite-v31-20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Games and Fortnite</a>.</p>

This means you can effectively host a local co-op game with a friend online, and their controller will be recognized as if it’s a second player right next to you. Even better, since it’s more akin to streaming than a proper online session, your friend doesn’t need to own the game!

You can’t make this work while offline, and you can’t invite anyone for Remote Play if you’re Invisible either. <strong>Once you’re visible online and running the game, go into the Steam Overlay (shift+tab) and click on the Remote Play Together button.</strong><br></p><p>This will bring up an overlay box where you can send invites, adjust what inputs they have access to, and change what kind of quality the stream prioritizes. <strong>Click on the Invite a Friend button to open your Friends List and choose which of your pals you’d like to go on a cult adventure with.</strong> After they accept, they’ll be able to see and interact with your stream through their Steam Application.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cult-of-the-tamb-tips-best-rituals-doctrines-1849428480">18 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting <em>Cult Of The Lamb</em></a></span></p><p>The rest works the same as it does for a typical local co-op session.

It is basically streaming a local co-op game, and Remote Play itself can have kinks and problems. Here are a few tips to make the experience more seamless:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Remote Play only allows for one Keyboard and Mouse input, so the second player must use a controller.</strong> If your friend doesn’t have one, their next best option is to look into a virtual controller setup.</li><li>Although this does avoid some of the issues in traditional online play, stable internet connections are still vital here. Just because everything is running fine on the host’s side, doesn’t mean the invited player is enjoying the same experience. <strong>Ensure everyone has decent enough connections to host and watch a stream.</strong></li><li><strong>Changing the Quality in the Steam Remote Play settings can also help make the experience less of a hassle.</strong> The host can change between Automatic, Balanced, Beautiful, and Fast Quality. Give them all a spin to see what works best for everyone.</li><li>Bouncing off of the above, I recommend the host to become familiar with the Remote Play settings in general. Although only one keyboard and mouse input will be recognized, all players can share the control of it. <strong>The host might need to limit keyboard and mouse access to only themselves if there are some weird input issues happening.</strong></li></ul><hr><p>You should now be better prepared to sway the non-believers in <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> with a friend, no matter if they’re next to you or joining from further away. Just don’t forget that this is a Steam-exclusive feature. You’ll be out of luck if you’re playing on a console or purchased the game through GOG. Adding proper online co-op would be a pretty big undertaking, and isn’t likely to be added in the future, but for now this is a pretty accessible alternative if you and your friends play on Steam together.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a new “handcrafted” world, according to Bethesda, who also explained that the entire <em>Starfield </em>expansion takes place here.

In the main game, you’d often fly to a few different worlds to finish a large quest. Here, Bethesda is promising that the entire expansion will take place on this one world and will be focused on the power vacuum that exists in House  Va’ruun following a devastating incident involving gravity-defying technology. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944">We’ve said this before</a></span>, but <em>Shattered Space </em>really seems like exactly what <em>Starfield</em> needs. While the main game played fine and looked alright, the worlds you visited were often empty or contained copy-pasted areas to explore over and over. What <em>Starfield</em> needed was some new, fresh, handmade content that feels weird and offers players a totally new experience. And <em>Shattered Space</em> looks to be just that. </p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>launches on September 23 on Xbox Series X/S and PC. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda describes Va’ruun as an “isolated, handcrafted new world in Starfield’s first major story expansion,” and compares it to some of the biggest and best expansions it has released for its The Elder Scrolls and Fallout games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The “handcrafted” note in particular feels deliberate. Starfield was criticized by some for leaving the handcrafted feel of Bethesda Game Studios’ previous titles behind in favor of a galaxy-spanning adventure filled with over 1,000 planets, most of which were fueled by procedural generation.</p><p>Shattered Space, on the other hand, revolves around a solitary planet, and in the deep dive video Bethesda developers stressed that the entirety of the expansion takes place on it. There is no need to leave it at all.</p><p>“From the minute you arrive on Va’ruun’kai the story never sends you off planet,” Tim Lamb, lead creative producer, said. “You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You’re free to leave at any time, but the story is fully centered around life on the Va’ruun home world.</p></div><p>“We wanted to give you the opportunity to explore every nook and cranny of this location and find clues as to who these people really are and what happened to them,” added lead producer Joe Mueller.</p><p>“When we first started thinking about what this experience would be like, we knew we wanted it to feel like a traditional Bethesda Game Studios expansion. Having the planet laid out so intentionally works perfectly with this isolationist society. Everything they’ve done since establishing themselves will be right here on Va’ruun’kai. The whole planet tells the story of these people who have never left their home and want to remain a secret.”</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In Shattered Space, players will visit the homeworld of House Va’ruun for the first time. Explore a fully handcrafted new location and unravel the mysteries surrounding the followers of the Great Serpent. House Va’ruun is on the brink of collapse and their people need help finding a path forward. When your sudden presence on their hidden home planet is seen by some as divine intervention, it’s up to you to restore House Va’ruun and decide the fate of this secretive faction.</blockquote><p>Bethesda also talked up Shattered Space’s more chaotic, aggressive, in-your-face combat, in contrast to the distance shooting of the base game. Expect ambushes from odd creatures that pop up through rifts in spacetime. Storywise, you end up caught up in a political feud between the planet’s various pockets of power, and ultimately decide the fate of House Va’ruun.</p><p>Starfield, which enjoyed the biggest launch in Bethesda Game Studios history, is available on PC and Xbox Series X and S. Shattered Space launches on those same platforms on September 30.</p><p>Owners of the Premium or Constellation Editions of Starfield get Shattered Space as part of their original purchase. Owners of the base edition can still purchase the Premium Upgrade for access to Shattered Space plus other digital items including the Digital Art Book, Original Soundtrack, 1,000 Creation Credits, and the Constellation Skin pack.</p><p>Bethesda is of course working on more than Starfield expansions.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/flappy-bird-crypto</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-new-flappy-bird-is-so-2024.982332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/flappy-bird-crypto<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s legitimately possible you’re too young to remember the whole <em>thing</em> about <em>Flappy Bird</em>, a short-lived 2013 mobile game that was pulled by its creator Dong Nguyen in February 2014, around eight months after release. Now the game is coming back via The Flappy Bird Foundation, who bill themselves as “a new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world,” and who appear to have crypto ties and have scooped up Nguyen’s trademark. It’s basically what you’d expect from 2024.</p><p><em>Flappy Bird</em> was a free mobile game where you steered a little bird between some pipes, amassing points until you inevitably crashed. It was a simple premise; as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/08/flappy-bird-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> wrote in their review, “<em>Flappy Bird</em> isn't a good video game. It's arguably not even a fun one. But its no-frills approach and exacting, relentlessly repetitious gameplay make it an addictive short-term distraction for the skill and score-obsessed.” Though released in May 2013, it hit its peak in early 2014, when <em>everyone</em> was playing it and freaking out about how much they were playing it, garnering 50 million downloads and reportedly earning creator Nguyen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/5/5383708/flappy-bird-revenue-50-k-per-day-dong-nguyen-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50k a day in advertizing</a>. For some, its simplicity made it a brilliant experiment in game design. For others, it was emblematic of everything wrong with mobile games: derivative in its visual associations with <em>Mario</em> and <em>Angry Birds</em>, about nothing but score-chasing, fearfully addictive at a time when <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-kept-playing-the-costs-of-my-gaming-addiction-5384643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game addiction</a> had been less studied. As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/flappy-bird-is-the-embodiment-of-our-descent-into-madness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CNET</a> wrote of it at the time, “There is little else as substantive and convincing as <em>Flappy Bird</em> that the smartphone era has driven us to the cliff of insanity when it comes to compulsive behavior, contracting attention spans, and a desire to succeed at something arbitrary and meaningless.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If <em>Flappy Bird</em> touched on the worst aspects of mobile gaming, it also touched on the worst aspects of the internet. Players–fans and haters alike–harangued then-unknown, solo creator Nguyen about the game’s difficulty, about whether it infringed on Nintendo, about what the press wrote about him and his game, about the fact that the game was successful. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303874504579376323271110900" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wall Street Journal</a> wrote that Nguyen had to avoid the internet and had trouble walking down the street in his town of&nbsp; Hanoi without being accosted, and that he’d taken a break from his day job to deal with the <em>Flappy Bird</em> attention, both positive and negative. This was all months before <a href="https://deadspin.com/the-future-of-the-culture-wars-is-here-and-its-gamerga-1646145844/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamergate</a> kicked off in August 2014, when the idea of harassment driving a developer off the internet hadn’t yet become so <a href="https://aftermath.site/sweet-baby-detected-conspiracy-theory-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depressingly</a> commonplace.&nbsp;</p><p>The response to the game led to its own flurry of discourse: to quote people who I hope don't cringe at having their takes from 2014 dragged into the present, Brendan Keogh at <a href="https://unwinnable.com/2014/02/11/flappy-bird/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unwinnable</a> defended the game as not a&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>sneaky, malicious conspiracy to steal everyone’s money or undermine the game system. Just a person – one person – who makes games having some success. But online games culture can’t stand this. We can’t <em>stand</em> a game that doesn’t do something innovative being so successful, so popular, so profitable. How <em>dare</em> it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Game designer <a href="https://www.blog.radiator.debacle.us/2014/02/an-alternate-history-of-flappy-bird-we.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Yang</a> wrote that “I suspect that if Nguyen were a white American, this would've been the story of a scrappy indie who managed to best Zynga with his loving homage to Nintendo's apparent patent on green pixel pipes and the classic ‘helicopter cave’ game genre.” Yang went on to write</p><blockquote><p>For many indie game developers, Nguyen reminds us a lot of ourselves. What would happen if we were financially successful? If success is somewhat out of our control, how (or WHY) should we be blamed for it? Why do we have to work so hard to maintain our image and reputation, why can't we just make the games we want to make?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>In February 2014, Nguyen made the decision to pull the game from app stores, <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/432227971173068800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> “I am sorry 'Flappy Bird' users, 22 hours from now, I will take 'Flappy Bird' down. I cannot take this anymore.” Nguyen told<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lananhnguyen/2014/02/11/exclusive-flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-says-app-gone-forever-because-it-was-an-addictive-product/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Forbes</a> that the game had “become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down <em>Flappy Bird</em>. It's gone forever." Nguyen received <a href="https://www.vg247.com/flappy-bird-creator-receives-death-threats-following-games-withdrawal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">death threats</a> for the decision, the discourse surged–was he sacrificing his fame and fiscal security to save us from ourselves? Had we driven a developer who’d made a hit away from games forever?--some people sold their <em>Flappy Bird</em>-containing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/10/phones-flappy-bird-ebay-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">phones on eBay</a>, and that was pretty much it.&nbsp;</p><p>Until last week, when The Flappy Bird Foundation arrived to announce it would be bringing the game back. Unlike the simplicity of the original, the <a href="https://flappybird.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new<em> Flappy Bird</em> </a>will have different characters and modes, as well as multiplayer and progression; as chief creative Michael Roberts said in the game’s press release, “We are beyond excited to be bringing back <em>Flappy Bird </em>and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come.” It sounds like a far cry from the simplicity that made the original so compelling, but it’s also all the features you’d expect from a mobile game in 2024. Whether these changes make it antithetical to the original’s magic or whether they solve some of the criticisms that made it so controversial remains to be seen.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="FLAPPY BIRD IS BACK!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xn6Yd-j8DeE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite the fire with which the original took over everyone’s lives, the return of the game felt to me like it was met at first with indifference. In the decade since <em>Flappy Bird</em>, we’ve been inundated not just with <em>Flappy Bird</em> clones, but with remakes and re-releases of every type of media under the sun–a new <em>Flappy Bird</em> feels like yet another tired <a href="https://aftermath.site/wb-earnings-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IP cash grab</a>. Everything is <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ephemeral</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vanishes</a>, dulling whatever sting fans might still feel about its original disappearance. We’ve also had a decade for internet discourse to carve grooves into our brains and for online harassment to explode, turning the original’s rise and fall into a certain depressing par for the course. To me, <em>Flappy Bird’</em>s enduring legacy is what it meant in a specific time and place in games and on the internet; in some ways, we never left it.&nbsp;</p><p>On Sunday, Nguyen <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> for the first time since 2017, writing of the new game, “No, I have no related [sic] with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don't support crypto.”&nbsp;</p><p>The first part of the comment seems to be a reference to how the Foundation apparently acquired the rights to <em>Flappy Bird</em>. The press release explains that “The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and affiliates have acquired the official <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark rights from Gametech Holdings LLC.” According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flappy-bird-creator-speaks-out-after-revival-sparks-backlash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, Gametech was able to claim Nguyen had abandoned the <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark and scoop it up when he failed to reply to notices from the US trademark office. This is not, in itself, nefarious, but it’s disappointing if you were hoping Nguyen was involved, and certainly complicates the Foundation’s narrative about the thrilling return of a beloved game.&nbsp;</p><p>The second part of Nguyen’s tweet refers to the game’s connection to crypto: IGN notes that Michael Roberts is the founder of a game company called 1208 Productions, which is <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/fcancer-and-1208-productions-unveil-laydeez-301605008.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">behind an NFT cringingly called “Deez.”</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24245216/flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-not-involved-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> points to some digging done by Varun Biniwale, a cybersecurity researcher, who <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found</a> references to Web 3 in the new <em>Flappy Bird</em>’s website, quotes such as “Artists, developers and creators can build, play and earn from the legendary <em>Flappy Bird</em> IP,” and various crypto people listed in the leaderboards of what appears to be an early prototype of the game. There’s no public-facing indication that the new <em>Flappy Bird </em>will be a crypto or NFT game, but, like the trademark saga above, it complicates any kind of feel-good narrative. And given crypto’s well-earned association with scams, it’s easy to imagine the new <em>Flappy Bird</em> going the same route.</p><p>If the drama around the original <em>Flappy Bird</em> defined, or would come to define, 2014, then the new <em>Flappy Bird</em> is exhaustingly definitional of 2024: the unnecessary IP rehashing, the connections to tech grift–the newest thing about this is that AI hasn’t made an appearance yet, though I’ve probably cursed us by saying that. It’s so exactly what you’d expect these days, and that’s to say nothing of what the game will be when it actually releases through the end of this year and 2025. Why <em>Flappy Bird</em> matters feels like a product of its time, and why it matters today does too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Intel’s bid was blocked because they couldn’t agree on how much profit Intel would make from each chip it would design as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) handled the manufacturing process.</p><p>Besides the recent embarrassment of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24216305/intel-13th-14th-gen-raptor-lake-cpu-crash-news-updates-patches-fixes-motherboards">crashing Raptor Lake CPUs,</a> Intel has been a bystander in the AI chip boom and ceded manufacturing of some next-gen tech to TSMC as it attempts to rebuild its capabilities. The chipmaking division also racked up $7 billion in losses last year, and last month, the company announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24210656/intel-is-laying-off-over-10000-employees-and-will-cut-10-billion-in-costs">15,000 layoffs</a>.

            <p>
In theory, vampires and immersive sims go together as naturally as bats and caves. Immersive sims tend to involve a balance of stealth, acrobatics, raw strength and crafty manipulation, and vampires are celebrated for all of these things. Despite this, actual vampire-themed immersive sims are rare. My list starts with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: the Masquerade: Bloodlines</a>... and sort of ends there. In a devastating betrayal, Arkane Austin's Redfall wasn't an immersive sim but an open world co-op shooter (a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/redfall-review">not very good one</a>). The much-delayed Bloodlines 2 was recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rebooted-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-wont-be-an-immersive-sim-the-chinese-room/">downgraded</a> from immersive sim to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> by new developers The Chinese Room. Arkane Lyon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-blade">Blade</a> adaptation seems promising, but it's a ways off. 
</p>

Here to paper over the immersive vamping gap in the market is Byte Barrel's Trust, "a new first-person shooter with immersive sim elements". It takes place in a world where the vampires are hunted for their blood, which has become an everyday human energy source, used for everything from car batteries to streetlights. The irony! I feel like, in the circumstances, the ideal solution would be for humans to let vampires suck their blood in return for vampires letting humans use their blood for electricity, but that wouldn't make for a very thrilling shooter. Anyway, here's the trailer.

You play a recently awoken elder vampire, who is trying to survive in a quarantined Central European city. "On your path to regaining power, you can choose to openly engage in combat with humans using their technology and weapons, or remain true to vampire abilities, allowing you to achieve goals unnoticed," the press release explains. "But remember, either way, you need the most precious substance in the world to function. Hunt to obtain blood and satisfy your unending hunger."

The press release doesn't give much sense of abilities and terrain setups, but vulnerability to sunlight is a factor. "Depending on the time of day, you will have to achieve a different goal on each given level," the developers note. You'll also apparently be able to make use of objects in the world. Levels teem with gun and bat-wielding mooks, and the architecture seems faintly steampunk, with huge glowing silos of what I'm guessing isn't very hot strawberry jam. "Every run offers a different experience, allowing everyone to find their own playstyle," the developers promise.

<p>
Barrel Byte are the creators of well-received Lovecraftian boomer shooters <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgive-me-father">Forgive Me Father</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forgive-me-father-2">sequel</a>, which I shall henceforth refer to as Cthulhoomer shooters, or possibly even Cthulhooters oh wait no no no no no no. You can see that shared DNA in Trust's comicbook art direction.</p>
<p>I'm disappointed that Trust's announcement teaser doesn't show us more of the game in action, but as a wannabe Vlad The Infiltrator, I'm keen on Trust as concept. Here's hoping we get a proper overview trailer soon, to say nothing of a release date. In the meantime, please let me know if there's a blood-sucking immersive sim I've missed. Could we gingerly reclass <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampyr">Vampyr</a> as an immersive sim?
