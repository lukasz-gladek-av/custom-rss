<p>And it's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Surprise, folks! Larian Studios has dropped a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>. Oh, and it's out <em>right now</em>, and if you already own the game on Switch 1, you can upgrade for free.</p>
<p>It's <strong>$49.99 / £44.99</strong> (or your regional equivalent) on Switch 2. However, if you buy the Switch 1 version and then grab the free upgrade pack, it'll only cost you <strong>$24.99 / £22.49</strong> until <strong>7th January 2026</strong>. So save some pennies and grab the Switch 1 version!</p>
<p>Larian, clearly riding on a high after its showcase for a new Divinity game at The Game Awards last week, are treating fans to a sparkly version of the critically-acclaimed CRPG. We don't know what the Switch 2 Edition adds to the experience besides higher resolutions and a better frame rate; can we hope for Mouse Mode?</p>
<p>Here's a little flavour text about the game, just in case you missed out on this pre-Baldur's Gate 3 classic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of Baldur’s Gate 3, experience the world of Divinity in this epic adventure where your choices shape fate itself.</p>
<p>The Divine is dead. The Void approaches. And the powers lying dormant within you are soon to awaken. Choose your role in a BAFTA-winning story, and explore a world that reacts to who you are, and the choices you make. With five races to choose from, and an adventure playable solo or as a party of up to four, lay waste to an oppressive order in a world afraid of magic. Become the God the world so desperately needs.</p>
<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2: Definitive Edition is the most complete version of the best-selling, Metacritic Must-Play RPG.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The game was already <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/divinity_original_sin_2_-_definitive_edition">brilliant on Switch</a>, so we're excited to dive in and lose another hundred hours to this behemoth.</p>

			<p>As creative collaborations go, the combination of Spec Ops: The Line’s Cory Davis and Robin Finck from Nine Inch Nails is as enticing as it gets. When Sleep Awake was first announced, the names involved left me anticipating a thrilling and subversive narrative backed up by a thumping industrial soundtrack. The actual game we got certainly ticks those boxes to some degree, but is it another success story for Blumhouse Games after the excellent Fear The Spotlight?</p>
<p><iframe title="Do. Not. Sleep... SLEEP AWAKE is Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gogkM13Cqcc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Developers Eyes Out state on their website that they “believe in a powerful synaesthesia emerging from music, narrative, and interactive experiences,” and this manifesto perfectly explains the nature of Sleep Awake. Mixing traditional first person exploration with surreal live action cutscenes, and with all the action being accompanied by a superbly varied and atmospheric score, Sleep Awake takes the ‘walking simulator’ and makes it far more cinematic in scope and feel. It feels strange that this title hasn’t been released on VR devices to be honest. Regardless, it is essential that you play this through decent headphones if you can.</p>


<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a strange world that has been ravaged by the Hush, a mysterious presence that steals away anybody who falls asleep. The few remaining survivors of this nocturnal apocalypse must find new ways to stay awake by whatever means necessary, but different sects have very different ideas of how to do this. You play as Katja, a young girl who uses combinations of herbs to concoct eyedrops to stave off tiredness whilst other groups prefer pain and/or bodily mutilation to achieve the same goal. Your first actions in the game are to find the herbs around your flat in order to make such a tincture, a tutorial section that works well to immerse you into the game’s world. Once you have made the drops you set out to deliver them to Amma, and then the strangeness really begins.</p>


<p>At times, Sleep Awake is visually stunning with neon drenched skylines and dingy, dilapidated buildings at ground level. Other areas feel a little more repetitive but there isn’t much backtracking so the game is always pushing you forward to see new things. Enemies are present but act as moving obstacles rather than antagonists with their presence mostly restricted to several scripted chase sequences and thankfully short stealth sections. The vibe here is very much that of a walking simulator with occasional horror and puzzles to mix things up.</p>
<p>The narrative in Sleep Awake is mostly relayed through environmental storytelling (and Katja’s frequent monologues in response to said environment) but there are also microfiches to find that reveal some of the backstory and lore of the world. There are also spiritual echoes called void shadows left by some taken by the Hush. Katja is able to tap into these shadows and reveal the trapped memories within. Whilst it is never really explained &nbsp;how she is able to do this, the latter parts of the game point to some kind of family connection to the Hush, a connection that is clearly foreshadowing for future entries in the Sleep Awake universe.</p>
<p>This points to one of the most divisive aspects of the game – it feels very much like the prologue to a greater story and, as such, is quite a short experience. I took my time and found almost every collectable and still didn’t get to the five hour mark.</p>

<p>Let me be clear here, I’m not arguing that games have to meet a minimum number of hours to be considered worthwhile (indeed I’ve given high scores to many shorter and more focused titles) but the story here feels like it stops just as it starts to get going. The pacing within those five hours is a little uneven as so much happens towards the end that the game before it feels more like an opening chapter. I hope that Blumhouse support Eyes Out to continue the story but recent experiences in the world of game development leave me apprehensive.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There's a lot of promise to Sleep Awake, which makes its short runtime all the more frustrating.&nbsp;The fusion of visuals, music, and narrative are reminiscent of peak Remedy titles and the inevitable cliffhanger ending definitely leaves me wanting to find out more about Katja’s story. I’ll be listening to that Robin Finck soundtrack in the meantime and crossing my fingers.	</p></div>

		<p>Hot on the heels of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-revealed-by-larian-studios-who-probably-watched-the-wicker-man-recently/">Divinity’s announcement at The Game Awards</a> (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-could-be-imminent-following-sequel-announcement/">some rumours swirling</a>), Larian Studio has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2 –&nbsp;Definitive Edition</a> is now available on Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with free upgrades for existing owners.</p>
<p><iframe title="Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Now Available On Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X/S, &amp; PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_K_vKMo7DEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Larian’s original fantasy setting, Divinity: Original Sin 2 was an acclaimed sequel to the studio’s turn-based RPG revival through the 2010s – a revival that eventually led to the even more acclaimed and beloved <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/05/baldurs-gate-3-review-ps5-pc/">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>!</p>
<p>While Larian hasn’t dug into the technical details, you can expect that this upgraded release will offer improved resolutions and frame rates compared to the game on original Switch, PS4 and Xbox One. There was already support for 4K on PS4 Pro and Xbox One X, but native versions on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S should allow for 60fps.This isn’t a remake or remaster, just a fairly simple port.</p>
<ul>
<li>On PS5, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now simply a cross-buy PS5 and PS4 game – i<a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP3383-PPSA06866_00-ORIGINALSIN2XPS5">t’s also on sale for £12.49</a> right now!</li>
<li>On Xbox One and Series X|S the game is now cross-gen – <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition/bw8pvl4cj2q6">it’s on sale for £14.52</a> currently.</li>
<li>On Switch 2, however, you’ll want to head to the Nintendo eShop and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2988295.html">search for the free upgrade pack</a> if you own the game on original Switch. The RRP is £44.99 for the game on Switch 2, but <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Divinity-Original-Sin-2-Definitive-Edition-1633057.html">you can currently buy the Switch 1 edition for £22.49</a> and then upgrade for free, so…. uh…. go and do that instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>While free in most locations, Japan has a nominal ¥100 fee on Switch and PlayStation.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/26/divinity-original-sin-2-review/">Divinity: Original Sin 2 review</a> we scored the game a smashing 9/10, saying that it was “the strongest CRPG in decades, with a fascinating plot that enthrals, despite taking a while to get going and being hard as nails at times. It’s the little adventures that flesh out the world and so much of it can be missed at first glance because you didn’t have the right skill or failed a persuasion check. Massive in scope and jam packed with features that includes a GM mode that shows a surprising amount of customisation with great ease, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a bumper package.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[2025’s Break-Out Roguelite Megabonk Gets, Er, Spooky For The Holidays]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/megabonk-update-patch-vampire-survivors-2000653410</link>
            <guid>1383538</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Megabonk</em>, a 3D reimagining of <em>Vampire Survivors </em>that became one of 2025’s surprise hits, has somewhat belatedly released its Halloween update just in time for the winter holidays. But hey, Christmas has always been spook-adjacent, right? There’s <em>A Christmas Carol</em>,&nbsp;<em>Krampus</em>,&nbsp;<em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em>…</p> <p>“yoo I’ve finally finished the update I was working on,” said solo developer Vedinad <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3405340?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791474891212&amp;emgid=523110495538905880">in a post on Steam</a>. “Was originally going to be a small halloween update, but I wanted to make it a bit bigger so it turned into a bit more work than I initially planned.” He goes on to list the new content added in the Spooky Update:</p>

 <ul> <li>New Map</li> <li>New Character</li> <li>New Weapon</li> <li><wbr>New Items</li> <li><wbr>New Enemies and Bosses</li> <li><wbr>New Achievements and challenges<wbr></li> </ul> <p><em>Megabonk</em>&nbsp;is an unabashed reinterpretation of Poncle’s <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, albeit with a few original twists of its own, not least that it’s now a 3D, third-person action game. It came out in September this year and absolutely exploded in popularity almost right away. And deservedly so! <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-vampire-survivors-clone-steam-pc-2000627591">It’s a great game, even if most of its ideas aren’t entirely original</a>. It also came out a couple of months ahead of Poncle announcing its own reinterpretation of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Survivors</em> as a 3D version of itself</a>, although in that case it’s also being combined with a deckbuilding roguelite.</p>

 <p>Alongside the new elements listed above, the Spooky Update also comes with a bunch of bug fixes, some new “advanced” settings for very niche tweaks, and a host of balancing changes. There’s also access to the game’s console, with the intention of making the game more open to speedrunning. And even this update has since received an update, fixing a few issues the spookiness introduced.</p> <p>The game’s well worth checking out. A lot of people already have, to the degree that it was nominated in this year’s Best Debut Indie Game category at the Game Awards, before the pseudonymous developer <a href="https://kotaku.com/megabonk-dev-officially-withdraws-it-from-the-game-awards-2000645270">withdraw it from consideration on the basis that it’s not really his first game</a>. (Something <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">the category’s eventual winners</a> did&nbsp;<em>not</em> choose to do.)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-g-driving-force-shifter-drops-to-its-lowest-price-ever-compatible-with-racing-wheels-and-pedals-for-xbox-ps5-and-pc-2000653077</link>
            <guid>1383535</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With Forza Horizon 5 making its way to the PS5 earlier this year, now’s the perfect time to jump in and enjoy one of the standout racing games of this generation. To elevate the experience even further, you’ll want the right gear—something that makes it feel like you’re in the driver’s seat. The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC is currently seeing a major price drop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/">Normally $60 on Amazon, it’s now discounted by 17%, bringing the cost down to just $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>As funny as it would be to use the Logitech G Driving Force Shifter alongside a standard controller, I’m afraid that’s not possible. This product is part of a larger kit. Logitech’s G Series racing setup is crafted for maximum realism with a driving wheel, pedals, and this optional shifter. Real race cars are manual, not automatic. So if you want to complete your driving simulation setup, you’ll need this last piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6395/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Logitech G Driving Force Shifter is compatible with Logitech G29 and G290 Driving Force Racing Wheels in order to enhance your experience behind the wheel. The shifter plugs in via cable to the rear side of your Logitech driving wheel.</p>
<p>You get real, quality construction that has the weight and feel of an actually shifter you might find in your own vehicle. It’s made with a solid steel gear shaft. The knob and boot are covered in a high-quality hand-stitched leather, which makes it look and feel like the real deal. It’s also durable and can put off wear and tear for a long time.</p>
<p>The shifter can be securely mounted to your driving rig. The lever is designed to be grabbed and pulled around, so the whole unit needs to be able to hold it’s ground while you race. That’s why it has built-in clamps and bolt points. The clamps just twist on either side to screw into a secure fit, then you push down the knobs to lock it into place. Easy peasy.</p>



<h2>Ultimate Precision</h2>
<p>Using the six-speed shifter is fluid. You’re met with a satisfying, tactile click as you shift between each gear. You’ll be able to execute smooth, accurate gear transitions whether you’re speeding up down a straight away or coming out of a turn. Pull down to put your rig in reverse.</p>
<p>Aside from just enhancing your experience playing a racing game, a driving sim like this makes for a not so bad method of learning to be behind the wheel. Particularly if you’ve only ever driven automatic, this can provide a safe way to learn how to drive stick. If you travel a lot, especially in Europe, you’ll find that renting an automatic is far more expensive than renting manual. Plus, you’ll have a lot more options of vehicle choice with manual. It’s a good skill set to have.</p>

<p>Dragon Ball Z Kakarot devs have just revealed the release window for Daima Pack Part 2, along with details on the new content. </p>



<p>Back in February 2025, developers revealed that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot will receive Daima—Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack as additional DLC <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-dlc-part-1-and-2-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across two packs</a>. The first pack was released in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-has-revealed-new-daima-dlc-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July 2025</a>. The release window for the second pack has now been announced, and it is arriving early next year. </p>

<p>A new <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-daima-pack-part-2-arrives-early-2026-new-character-and-fresh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> by Bandai Namco reveals that Dragon Ball Z Kakarot Adventure Through The Demon Realm Pack part 2 will release in 2026. This new pack will add Vegeta (mini) as a new playable character, along with a new boss fight against Tamagami Number Two, and new enemies from the demon realm. The announcement also came with a new trailer showcasing Mini Vegeta’s moveset and Super Saiyan 3 transformations. They also revealed Tamagami Number Two’s Skills along with the other enemies. </p>

<p>Players will also face two new enemy types as they explore the First Demon World. The first enemy type is the Gendarmerie Tank, known for its heavy hitting and powerful ranged and charged attacks. The other enemy type is Gendarmerie Officers, strong enemies that can summon reinforcements and attack from every angle. </p>



<p>From the looks of it, the Daima DLC might not end with the second part, as we are yet to see Goku’s glorious Super Saiyan 4 transformation arrive for the game, which was teased at the very end of the new trailer. </p>

<p>At The Game Awards 2025, Larian Studios announced the next game in the long-running Divinity franchise. And with the new game on the mind of players, Larian has decided to give owners of Divinity: Original Sin 2—the last game in the series—a free update.</p>



<p>Available starting today, Larian has released a Divinity: Original Sin 2 – Definitive Edition upgrade for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2.</p>







<p>Details on what the free update entails from a technology standpoint haven’t been revealed just yet. The only thing certainly known is that, for PlayStation players, the game it’s PS5 Pro optimized. When more details become available on what the optimizations are and differences from the base version, they’ll be added to this story.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Released originally in 2017, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a sequel to 2014’s Original Sin. While the games are intertwined a bit, Larian has said that Original Sin 2 is a “standalone game and can be experienced on its own.” However, they “ecommend trying out Divinity: Original Sin for the best experience!”</p>



<p>The premise of the second game in the Original Sin subseries is you playing in a world where the Gods are dead. Your player holds powers of a “forbidden magic”, and you find yourself quarantined because of it.</p>







<p>“The Magisters of the Divine Order want to “cure” you of your powers,” the description reads. “But the Order has secrets of its own. Secrets that threaten everyone. If the world remains godless, chaos will rule.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Larian giving a free update for Divinity: Original Sin 2 on current-gen consoles?

    <p><span>New quests, areas, characters, and features.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > GSC Game World [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> will release a free content update for <em><a title="Games > S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl [23 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a></em> on December 16 featuring a new storyline with eight new quests, seven new locations, six new characters, a new weapon, and a new hub, the developer <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-2-drops-a-free-story-and-content-update-on-dec-16/" target="_blank">announced</a>. <span id="more-1015235"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via GSC Game World:</p><blockquote><p><strong>So What is This New <a title="Platforms > Quest [164 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>?</strong></p><p>Strange things start happening near the Malachite on the western part of the map. The research groups sent by scientists were reporting a signal interfering with their usual PDA communications. After listening to it, stalkers were suffering from headaches, nose bleeds, and hallucinations.</p><p>Professor Medulin witnessed everything with his own eyes. While being good at scientific research, he didn’t know enough about the radio signal and what to do to figure out what was happening. That’s where Banzai steps in, a radio enthusiast, who also joined the investigation, but something went wrong.</p><p>You may hear their emergency transmission almost anywhere in the Zone. Pay close attention to the Red Forest Region on your map, and from here on, your intuition, rationality and choices will lead you down the rabbit hole to see how deep it is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Never Forget About Your Gear</strong></p><p>No stalker embarks on an expedition unprepared. That’s where the new weapon comes in handy.</p><p>The GP37V2 is a modified version of the GP37 rifle, crafted for the most tactically proficient players.</p><p>It features a pre-installed suppressor and a low-magnification scope. The trigger group has been modified to support single and burst fire modes only.</p><p>The cost of failure is higher, but in the hands of a skillful operator, the GP37V2 can reward you with its precision and power. And even if that somehow doesn’t sound like the best fit for your playstyle — you still have 30+ weapons (plus attachments) in S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 to choose your favorite from.</p><p><strong>New Locations and Places</strong></p><p>As a bounty hunter, you need to explore, loot, and survive. Believe us when we say that the Fairy Tale Pioneer Camp and the Old Mine in Red Forest are worth your time.</p><p>If you have already travelled the Zone south-to-north and east-to-west, you’ll see some familiar locations are now re-inhabited by stalkers. The story will lead you through Car Dump, Army Warehouses, City Boiler Room, Rail Depot near Malachite, and Volkhov SAM.</p><p>Your choices may also lead you to completely uncharted places. Trust your instincts to see how it pays off.</p><p><strong>New Hub in the Burnt Forest Region</strong></p><p>Your choice matters in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>—-and it literally shapes and changes the Zone. It stays true in this new story, as one of the outcomes is a whole new hub appearing in a not-so-populated area of Burnt Forest. Technician, trader, medic, guide—-everyone will be there. Of course, including a place to take a nap, and your stash!</p></blockquote><p><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,079 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,472 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chernobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-windows/9N3D6V4N58JR" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-free-story-content-update-launches-december-16]]></content:encoded>

                <p>At The Game Awards, Lucasfilm and Mass Effect veteran Casey Hudson announced a brand-new Star Wars game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic/" data-ref-id="5000-706357">Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</a>. It was one of the biggest, most unexpected reveals from the event, and people are pretty hyped for it.</p><p>The game is in early development and still a long way off (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">but reportedly due before 2030</a>), and there is plenty we still don't know about pretty much all facets of the game. But for now, here's what we know so far about Fate of the Old Republic. We will continue to update this post as more details become available.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_">Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_platforms">Fate of the Old Republic platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_preorders">Fate of the Old Republic preorders</a></li><li><a href="#Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_story__setting__and_characters">Fate of the Old Republic story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Hudson_s_history">Hudson's history</a></li><li><a href="#One_of_many_Star_Wars_games">One of many Star Wars games</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="When_will_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_be_released_">When will Fate of the Old Republic be released?</h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic does not have a release date. Immediately following the game's announcement, people theorized that the game was a long way off, in part because Hudson only just started the studio making the game, Arcanaut, back in July 2025. His previous studio, Humanoid Origin, opened in May 2021 and closed in December 2024; the studio never released a game.</p><p>Amid speculation that Fate of the Old Republic may not release until 2030, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-director-says-the-game-will-launch-within-the-next-1477-days/1100-6536957/" data-ref-id="1100-6536957">Hudson assured fans that won't be the case.</a> "Don't worry about the 'not till 2030' rumors," <a href="https://x.com/CaseyDHudson/status/1999652683972489385" rel="nofollow ">Hudson wrote online</a>. "Game will be out before then. I'm not getting any younger!"</p><h2 id="Who_is_making_Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_"><strong>Who is making Fate of the Old Republic?</strong></h2><p>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic is in development at Arcanaut Studios, a team based in Edmonton with another office in Kelowna, British Columbia. The studio said its "mission is to create magical, interactive storytelling by connecting talented creatives to powerful tools in a safe and rewarding environment."</p><p>The studio said one of its goals is to "push the boundaries of what is possible," and that the team does not "fear failure."</p><p>"We are doers. We're not passengers. We are drivers,"<a href="https://www.arcanautstudios.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> the developer's website says</a>.</p><p>Hudson is the CEO and game director at Arcanaut, and his management team includes Chris Bain as CFO, Cordy Rierson as COO, and Ryan Hoyle as CTO. The developer's website states that people who worked at Microsoft, Epic, Remedy, The Coalition, and ZeniMax make up the current team.</p><p>As mentioned, Arcanaut was only just founded in July 2025, so it's a very new studio, and the developer said the game is in "early development." The developer is collaborating with the Star Wars rights-owner, Lucasfilm, on the project.</p><h2 id="Fate_of_the_Old_Republic_trailer">Fate of the Old Republic trailer</h2><p>The first trailer for Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was released at The Game Awards on December 11, 2025. The video is more of a mood piece, taking players to somewhere far, far away, and raising more questions than it answers.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="626469893" data-promo-id="0"

The developer also claims that "every decision deepens" the player's journey "toward light or darkness."</p><p dir="ltr">"With Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic, we're telling a completely new and different story with everything we've learned since--crafting an adventure about choice, destiny, and the timeless struggle between light and dark.

He also directed Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. In 2015, Hudson joined Xbox to work on the "mixed reality" team, but he left after two years to re-join BioWare. In his second stint at BioWare, Hudson worked on Anthem and Mass Effect: Legendary Edition, before leaving again in 2021 to start a new studio, Humanoid Origin, which was making a AAA sci-fi game. The studio closed in November 2024, due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-veterans-new-studio-which-was-making-aaa-sci-fi-game-is-shutting-down/1100-6528039/" data-ref-id="1100-6528039">"unexpected shortfall of funding."</a></p><h2 id="One_of_many_Star_Wars_games"><strong>One of many Star Wars games</strong></h2><p>Long gone are the days when Electronic Arts had the exclusive license for Star Wars games on console/PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Last week, the Game Awards surprised us with not one, but two Tomb Raider-related announcements: Catalyst, a new entry in the series, and Legacy of Atlantis, a remake of the original Tomb Raider. With a legacy as long as Lara Croft's, however, it raises some questions. First, how do these games fit in a larger timeline?</p><p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/"><em>GamesRadar+</em> got the scoop on that</a>. "From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld," game director Will Kerslake told the outlet. "With the reboot trilogy serving as her origin story, so we're seeing a more experienced Lara Croft."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n6JxVxSHjqE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This means the most recent trilogy of games – Tomb Raider (2013), Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Shadow of the Tomb Raider – occurs sometime before the original 1996 game. By extension, that means they all come before Legacy of Atlantis as well. This is consistent with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_gO4xj5u9k">an update the Tomb Raider team put out back in 2021</a>, when Kerslake said, "We envision the future of Tomb Raider in all its forms as unfolding in a time beyond these established adventures, telling stories that build upon the breadth of both Core Design’s and Crystal Dynamics’ games and working to unify these timelines."</p><p>This new duo of games is still serving as a soft reboot, however, which is partially evident by the recasting of the title character. Alix Wilton Regan replaces Camilla Luddington as the voice of Lara Croft in both Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis, tying the games together as the new future of the Tomb Raider series.&nbsp;</p><p>In a press Q&amp;A session following the Game Awards, Crystal Dynamics head of studio Scot Amos spoke about the casting process for the new era. "[Alix Wilton Regan] was already a fan when we met her. And then being able to talk to her, and [we got] a sense that she has that wit and that charm and charisma that is a natural essence and core for Lara, but she also has that confidence and that depth of emotionality that we need for telling these great stories."</p>

<p>Amos also broke down how the development process of Catalyst and Legacy of Atlantis is surprisingly intertwined. "We actually have two distinct development teams, so we're working together," Amos says. "But we have Flying Wild Hog running the Legacy of Atlantis, and we have the Crystal [Dynamics] team from the core working on Catalyst. But we're connected. We actually share technology, we share resources, we share assets. We have one leadership team, visionary team, over top of that, that makes sure everything is on track, everything is within canon, everything makes sense in the various games and the storytelling."</p><p>It also emphasizes the "unity" the teams are trying to achieve with Lara Croft going forward. "Same character; Two different time periods in her life," Kerslake says during the Q&amp;A.</p><p>For more Tomb Raider, check out the reveals of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-catalyst-takes-lara-croft-to-northern-india-in-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="00d416d9-e569-40af-805a-22822aae745c" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Catalyst </a>and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-is-a-remake-of-the-first-game-in-the" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22919195-3e7d-45ff-9ee7-9d0fc3924b8d" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Legacy of Atlantis</a> from last week's Game Awards.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/tomb-raider-devs-explain-series-timeline-lara-crofts-new-voice-and-links-between]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> now has current gen versions available for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Larian's previous RPG, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, was already available on Switch, PS4, and Xbox One. But now it's available on newer platforms with higher resolution and increased framerate. There's also a free upgrade available if you already own the game.</p>
<p>The shadow drop follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-divinity-original-sin-trademark-the-game-awards-statue-larian">leak last week of a PS5 version of the Definitive Edition of the game</a>, so this isn't totally out of the blue.</p>

<p>Divinity: Original Sin 2 was first released in 2017 for PC, with PS4, Xbox One, Switch and iPad versions following. While already available to play on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, it's been via backwards compatibility only.</p>
<p>"Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse on the leak last week.</p>
<p>That leak arrived alongside new trademarks for the Divinity franchise, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">pre-empted Larian's announcement at The Game Awards that the studio is developing a new Divinity game</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement finally solved the mystery of the strange statue in the Mojave Desert. Revealed with a gruesome trailer, Divinity is going to be even larger than Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>Until then, it seems Larian is keen for players to revisit a refreshed Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-a-17-3%e2%80%b3-laptop-to-holiday-deals-at-nearly-70-off-with-399-worth-of-free-accessories-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-windows-11-pro-2000653266</link>
            <guid>1383496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tech purchases tend to be expensive, but they don’t have to be – if you know where to look for the best deals. Our team scans the internet for the top discounts that are actually worth your money, and those for a reliable everyday laptop under $800; we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">The 17-inch HP laptop (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) can be yours for just $760 at Amazon, after the retailer took an unbelievable 67% off its usual $2,200 price.</a> It’s a straightforward discount, so you don’t need to worry about entering any complicated coupon codes or following twisted checkout steps to score it. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the offer applies automatically. The bundle comes with a free accessory kit worth almost $400, too, which sweetens the deal even more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid Performance for Demanding Tasks</h2>
<p>Starting off with the freebies; you’re getting an external CD/DVD drive, a Redragon mouse, a clean cloth, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. All of this is useful, but we especially like how you’re getting an efficient OS installed and ready to go. Microsoft has packed the system with a bunch of productivity and security tools that are specifically made keeping remote workers and creatives in mind. Windows 11 typically comes with specific installation requirements, but having it pre-installed means you can skip that entire setup hassle and get started with using it right away.</p>
<p>As for the laptop itself, it’s got a nice, expansive 17.3-inch Full HD screen that delivers stunning clarity and vibrant colors consistently. The anti-glare panel reduces reflections for a more comfortable viewing experience in all lighting situations, whether you’re using the machine out there in the sun or in your room at night. There’s a built-in HD camera with a physical privacy shutter right at the top of the screen for better video calls, too.</p>



<p>Those who need to type long documents frequently will appreciate the ergonomic keyboard that features soft keys to reduce finger and wrist fatigue during long sessions. It’s even got a dedicated Microsoft Copilot key for instant AI-powered assistance 24/7. Battery life is another strong selling point, as it delivers up to 7 hours of usage on a single charge. That translates into going an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever either, as HP Fast Charge boosts your battery from 0% to 50% in just about 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop runs on an Intel Core i3-N305 8-Core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 3.8 GHz. There’s 32 RAM to keep things running smoothly, and it’s especially great for multitaskers who prefer juggling at least a few tasks at the same time. It keeps noticeable slowdowns at bay, even when things get intense. Storage is made easy with the 1TB SSD. It’s not only spacious, but also gets you fast boot/transfer times, helping you stay productive throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6394/">There’s a lot more to appreciate about this HP laptop, especially at its current price of $760.</a> For well under $1,000, you’re getting a machine that’s ideal for work professionals, creatives, students, and even casual users. It’s a limited-time discount that somehow managed to crawl through Black Friday, but it won’t be around forever. It’s best to snap it up as quick as you can, as we’re expecting the offer to expire soon.</p>

<p>Tomb Raider’s co-creator has commented on the new remake, Legacy of Atlantis, revealing that he prefers new chapters. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a fantastic event for Tomb Raider fans. Players got not one, but two full games revealed at the event, with Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for 2026</a> and Tomb Raider: Catalyst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-tomb-raider-catalyst-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for 2027</a>. Check out what the original co-creator had to say about the new remake. </p>

<p>In follow-up posts, he first acknowledged the arrival of Tomb Raider: Catalyst, stating “Aha! We get the best of both worlds…” with a flag of India and dinosaur emojis. Later, Douglas <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cnhyv.bsky.social/post/3m7xuyl2oa224" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">noted</a> that he is “looking forward to seeing both new games,” adding that both games are visually stunning and are something they could only dream of 30 years ago.

            <guid>1383490</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has fully detailed the game’s Cold Snap update and its new cold-weather survival mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The update, out December 16, adds the new Cold Snap map condition, which is a winter variant across Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport, and The Blue Gate maps. Cold Snap adds cold-weather survival mechanics fueled by snowstorms across Speranza. Snowfall reduces visibility, lakes freeze over, and the open surface becomes even more dangerous. Exposure to extreme cold causes frostbite, thus encouraging new strategies around healing items, loadouts, and indoor shelter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap gameplay changes, from Embark Studios:</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Environmental Hazard:</strong> Cold, harsh weather introduces new risks for raiders who remain outdoors too long. Players must watch out for frostbite, a creeping condition that slowly drains their health bar. </li><li><strong>Shelter Mechanics:</strong> To prevent frostbite, raiders will need to adapt their tactics as the cold gradually seeps into their bones. Raiders must rethink their loadouts, ensuring they can heal themselves or their teammates and plan their extractions with care, finding shelter if needed.</li><li><strong>Visual Overhaul:</strong> Frost buildup, frozen lakes, snow accumulation and more across Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport and The Blue Gate maps.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, unique loot and rewards are available through the Flickering Flames event and Candleberry Banquet project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flickering Flames Event:</strong> An act of endurance and patience that tests Raiders’ survival skills during the Cold Snap. Raiders can unlock rewards across 25 levels, including new gear, customizations elements and Raider Tokens by earning Merits, which are automatically gained from XP in rounds. To activate the event, Raiders must have played five rounds of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Candleberry Banquet Project:</strong> A new project that brings Raiders together to feel the fragile warmth that shines through the frigid cold. Raiders can earn rewards by scavenging unique items topside and collecting Candleberries. It features five stages, each revealing a new scene on the banquet table. Completing stages grants rewards such as cosmetic items, Raider Tokens and Merits, with Merits contributing progress in the Flickering Flames event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting December 26, the Goalie Raider deck will be included in the base game. The new deck includes new items and feats for players to complete, offering rewards such as Raider tokens, cosmetic items and more. These include a hockey-inspired Raider outfit in several color variants, along with a hockey stick Raider tool.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arc Raiders Cold Snap Update Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the Expedition Project Raider Reset lets players restart their journey with certain buffs, advantages, and rewards. The Expedition Project will provide Raiders with an opportunity to undergo a reset, bringing a new raider and a new story for the player. This optional reset is unlocked by collecting key materials to build a Caravan for the existing Raider then signing up for the departure during the Expedition window. By departing, players will reset their character progress for a new Arc Raiders journey with exclusive buffs, advantages and rewards that carry over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/de/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Embark explained why it’s doing the seasonal reset. “Progression wipes are a notoriously difficult thing to balance in online multiplayer games — we get that,” the developer said. “Mandatory global wipes have some obvious benefits: heavily invested players get to re-experience the initial grind once again and, for a time, the playing field is levelled. The optional Expedition Project is our solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes — specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game. We want to offer you the choice:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not completed as much as you’d like? Keep on raiding, building, and growing. Ready for a new challenge and to grind once again? Depart on the Expedition, and receive buffs, rewards, and bragging rights.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Arc Raiders Cold Snap update release times:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios launches Cold Snap on Tuesday, December 16, at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap includes limited-time events and elements running from Tuesday, December 16 until Tuesday, January 13, 2026 at 10.30am CET / 9.30am UK time / 1.30am PT / 4.30am ET. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold Snap is the last update listed as part of Arc Raiders' 2025 content roadmap, and Embark has yet to outline what's coming in 2026. Arc Raiders sold over 4 million copies worldwide within two weeks of launch, cementing its commercial success. Nexon also revealed that the extraction shooter had reached <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-officially-a-hit-with-over-4-million-copies-sold-and-a-peak-concurrent-player-count-of-700000-across-all-platforms"><u>a huge concurrent count of 700,000 players across all platforms</u></a>.

Cementing its success, Arc Raiders won Best Multiplayer at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">last week’s The Game Awards</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review"><u>Arc Raiders review</u></a>, returned a 9/10.

            <guid>1383460</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems just like yesterday we were handing out our Game of the Year 2024 awards, but time has passed and another year is close to wrapping up. Which means it is time for our Game of the Year 2025 Awards! We are starting this year’s awards with one that is the epitome of the saying “everything old is new again”, and that is the Best Remake Award! Which game has come back from years past to grab our attention again?</p>

<p>What could be a better winner than <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> for this award? This package takes us back to the very beginning of Dragon Quest, the origin point of a franchise that has enamoured millions of fans around the world, and done it in such style with the use of the HD-2D engine bringing new life to two classics.</p>


<p>It is not just the way Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake looks that make it our winner this year. Both games were essentially rebuilt and expanding, adding new stories, party members, changes to the battle system, as well as an orchestral soundtrack. Not only does this remake offer something new to newcomers, older fans of Dragon Quest get a new experience with the remake.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake is so good in fact that the only negative thing we could find when reviewing it was that progression could be vague. Other than that, the total package offered and the improvements has made Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake our Best Remake of 2025.</p>

<h4>Yooka-Replaylee – Runner Up</h4>
<p>Back in 2017, Yooka-Laylee promised to bring back the 3D collectathon platformer in the vein of Banjo-Kazooie. It succeeded, in some ways, but the original release didn’t quite live up to being a bird and bear’s spiritual successor. Instead of letting things lie, Playtonic Games decided to remake the game and re-release it as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/yooka-replaylee-review-banjos-tribute-act-gets-their-encore/">Yooka-Replaylee</a>. What we got was an experience where the potential of the original release was finally realised with major gameplay improvements and more content.</p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is a remake that does what a good remake should, and that is vastly improve upon what came before. Quality of life changes has made Yooka and Laylee’s adventure much more friendly for players, which makes it appealing to young and old players alike.</p>
<h4>The Talos Principle Reawakened – Runner Up</h4>
<p>How do you improve upon one of the most critically acclaimed puzzle games of all time? Ten years ago <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/the-talos-principle-reawakened-review-more-in-heaven-and-earth-than-your-philosophy/">The Talos Principle</a> was released to huge acclaim, and this year Croteam re-released the game after upgrading it to Unreal Engine 5, and taking the opportunity to update other parts of the game as well. What we got is a game that retains all of the excellence the original had combining it with a fresh new look, the Road to Gehenna and the new chapter In the Beginning, which added a good few more hours’ worth of gameplay.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest addition to The Talos Principle Reawakened is the Puzzle Editor, allowing the community to create and share their own challenges with others. That alone makes this remake bigger than the original, as it provides fans with a possible endless supply of content. And providing ways to keep a much loved game active for the long term should be applauded.</p>
<p><strong>Honourable mentions (in alphabetical order)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span data-sheets-root="1">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></li>
<li><span data-sheets-root="1">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>That’s all for today’s award. Come back for tomorrow’s Best Narrative award, and all the tall tales that video games can tell.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Not Everyone Is Excited That Leon Is Back In Resident Evil Requiem]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-grace-playable-split-2000653406</link>
            <guid>1383448</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After weeks of rumors, speculation, and leaks, Capcom confirmed at last week’s Game Awards ceremony that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-leon-kennedy-is-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem-re9-game-awards-2000652755"><span>Leon Kennedy is returning in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a><span> as a playable character. The older version of the Raccoon City cop will co-lead the upcoming survival horror game alongside new hero Grace Ashcroft when it launches on February 27. For some, this reveal was a moment of celebration, as Leon is a fan-favorite character who hasn’t been playable in a mainline game since 2012’s </span><i><span>Resident Evil 6 </span></i><span>(though he’s playable in two of Capcom’s more recent remakes), but for others, the fact that Grace doesn’t have the spotlight to herself is a disappointment.</span></p> <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849"><i><span>Requiem</span></i></a><span>’s surprise announcement at Summer Game Fest, the game</span> <span>has been marketed as Grace’s story, one that would </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216"><span>lean into a more survival horror/puzzle-centric playstyle</span></a><span>. So imagine everyone’s surprise when Leon showed up with a small arsenal, his trademark cheesy one-liners, and much more action-focused gameplay. Capcom says that </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span> will be a </span><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60614"><span>roughly 50/50 split</span></a><span> between the two characters, which sounds like a good way to keep the game from getting stale, at least. But some feel that </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>is leaning too heavily on its original cast of characters, and that the series</span> <span>could use some new blood.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After two games starring the deliberately nondescript Ethan Winters, and most of the games before that passing the protagonist ball back and forth between Leon, Jill Valentine, and the Redfield siblings, fans were excited about Grace and </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>putting the spotlight on a relative unknown. She has ties to previous games through her mother Alyssa Ashcroft, who appeared in the </span><i><span>Outbreak </span></i><span>games, but Grace is the first new </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>hero in a hot minute. So some fans are a little disappointed that she’ll be sharing the spotlight with one of the series’ biggest names.</span></p>

              <p>One of the huge joys of&nbsp;<em>Saturday Night Live</em> over the last 50 years has been the extraordinary level of craft that goes into every episode. The sketches might often suck, but the sets, costumes and make-up will be incredible, despite the long-experienced crew often having less than 24 hours notice of what needs to be prepared. It’s been a stunning achievement for five decades, which makes this week’s episode’s extensive use of AI slop an extraordinary letdown.</p> <p>From the opening moment of the Josh O’Connor-hosted episode, it looked like AI art was being used in place of the usually superb creations of the long-running show’s incredible prop and design team. A storybook with a poem loosely in the style of <em>The Night Before Christmas</em>, leading up to a cold-open with Trump giving interviews on Air Force One, was illustrated with artwork that looked incredibly likely to be AI-generated. While not egregiously bad, little details appear to give the game away, like the suddenly broken path in a picture of a snowy village:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653400"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653400">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And this girl’s frighteningly thin leg and then entirely missing second foot:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000653401" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653401"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653401">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Plus it all just has that&nbsp;<em>look</em>, that sheen that rings hollow. As soon as it appeared on screen it looked off to me, and I remember thinking how disappointing it is to see a real artist denied the chance to draw something lovely for the show.</p>

 <p>Things became more egregious during Weekend Update, where the usually amusingly poor Photoshops and stock images that appear over Colin Jost and Michael Che’s shoulders were replaced with extremely suss slop. A gag about a horse on a plane received this image that—in fairness—looks like the usual amusingly slapdash Photoshopping, until you look a bit closer at details like the foreheads of the people in the rows behind. And then what might be an attempt to remove the horse’s genitals, but it’s damned weird.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653402">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>More obvious was the image of a woman on O2 at a slot machine, seen at the top of this post. The hose doesn’t actually touch the O2 canister, the slot machine is weirdly shaped, and the lights and buttons are all irregular shapes.</p> <p>Alongside these, there was an almost certainly AI-generated image of a man taking off an Elsa costume, and the most horrifically poor rotating head of Kristi Noem in a joke based on&nbsp;<em>The Exorcist</em>. It all gave the usually fun segment of <em>SNL</em> a grim edge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000653408" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000653408"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000653408">© NBC / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>People on social media were quickly to call out the apparent AI, disappointed that a program known for its creativity would sink to smothering itself in AI slop. It presumably makes sense when a show is put together from start to finish in six days, with cold-opens and Weekend Update usually written in the final 24 hours before live broadcast, to try to find ways to speed up production, but cutting corners and replacing creative work with this kind of dross isn’t it.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A lot of reasons why SNL using AI for stuff like this sucks, but my main gripe is just that it’s less funny! The intentionally kind of janky photoshops are part of the joke and beat the weird smooth AI aesthetic. <a href="https://t.co/ZBBoXQSgUS">pic.twitter.com/ZBBoXQSgUS</a></p> <p>— Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/jbillinson/status/2000212581206655450?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was more of a shame given that this was, overall, a decent episode of the hit-and-miss show. Lily Allen was a great musical guest, and appeared in a fun and silly sketch spoofing her own on-the-nose lyrics, Bowen Yang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1sTpOSv8XU">reprised one of his creepiest characters</a>, and this sketch of the most sensitive bachelorette strippers was the funniest of the night:</p>

  <p>Plus Jane Wickline did another of her adorable Weekend Update songs, this time about the greatest threat to the survival of humanity:</p>  <p>Yeah, most of the show’s sketches are overlong duds, and sure,&nbsp;<em>you</em> stopped watching years ago, but&nbsp;<em>SNL</em> remains a crucial fixture in comedy, still creating viral sketches and beginning the careers of many of the best comedians. It also boasts one of the most talented behind-the-scenes crews in television, and to see their talents eschewed for AI slop is devastating. <em>SNL</em>, don’t do that; be better.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil Requiem director has arrived with new details about the upcoming title after their big reveal at The Game Awards 2025, stating it’s almost like playing two games. </p>



<p>Capcom has kept a lot of stuff under wraps since Resident Evil Requiem was revealed, with Leon Kennedy being playable as the biggest secret of them all. However, we had an idea from the leaks, but confirmation was required. Now that Leon has been officially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>, the director has revealed how the gameplay of both characters contrasts. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-leon-and-grace-sections-are-almost-equally-split-but-heavily-differ-from-each-other">Resident Evil Requiem’s Leon and Grace Sections are ‘Almost Equally Split’, But Heavily Differ From Each Other</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/resident-evil-requiems-dual-protagonist-system-will-be-like-repeatedly-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna-we-ask-the-devs-about-leons-role-and-re4-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, Resident Evil Requiem director Akifumi Nakanishi&nbsp;spoke about Leon and Grace’s gameplay, along with other details. Nakanishi first revealed that “in terms of gameplay, Grace and Leon’s playable sections are almost equally split,” with the structure being similar to Revelations. The director added that Leon isn’t “well suited to horror”, hence his sections “focus on intense, adrenaline-pumping action”. Grace has the scarier sections, and the devs are “really emphasizing the difference in their experiences this time.”</p>



<p>Nakanishi explains that the two experiences are “almost like having two games with completely different types of tension mixed together.” Players would feel like “jumping into a cold bath after sitting in a hot sauna,” he said while laughing. The director also revealed that Leon’s chapters are where the players will feel safer and scared again when Grace comes back on. It is a “consciously designed horror structure,” he stated. </p>

Additionally, Requiem might have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveal-new-playable-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another playable character</a>.

<p>Resident Evil insider has revealed details about the release windows for Code Veronica and Zero Remakes. </p>



<p>Based on insider information, it was already known that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next remakes</a> in development for the Resident Evil franchise are allegedly Code Veronica and Zero. The insider had also revealed earlier that these games are scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-resident-evil-remakes-are-releasing-in-2027-2028-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2027/2028</a>, but didn’t have exact details. Now, he is back with more. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-code-veronica-remake-will-reportedly-be-announced-next-year-and-release-in-2027">Resident Evil Code Veronica Remake Will Reportedly be Announced Next Year, And Release in 2027</h2>



<p>The new details about Resident Evil Code Veronica and Zero Remakes come from a prominent insider, Dusk Golem. Most recently, their highly anticipated leak about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leon-kennedy-the-game-awards-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leon being playable</a> in Requiem was proven to be true through a new trailer at The Game Awards 2025. Now they are back with a new scoop, this time providing us with the announcement and release windows for the next remakes in the franchise. </p>



<p>According to Dusk Golem’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/aestheticgamer1/status/1999736688848113831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), they have heard that Code Veronica will be announced in 2026 and released in 2027. The Zero Remake is scheduled to release in 2028. Readers should take this information with a grain of salt, as there is no official announcement regarding these release windows, and they may change depending on how development progresses. </p>







<p>Back in October 2025, it was reportedly revealed that Resident Evil 0 Remake is in development under the nickname ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-0-remake-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chamber</a>‘ and won’t be released until 2028. Additionally, Resident Evil Requiem leak suggests there’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-leak-reveal-new-playable-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another playable character</a>.

            <p>The Tomb Raider: Catalyst team has confirmed where the upcoming game sits in the series timeline.</p>
<p>According to game director Will Kerslake, Catalyst - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards">which will see the globe trotting Lara Croft heading to Northern India</a> - takes place after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-underworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>. That's the game where Lara pops along to Helheim whilst wielding Thor's hammer, Mjolnir.</p>

<p>"From a timeline perspective, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is set years after the events of Tomb Raider: Underworld," <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-catalyst-picks-up-years-after-2008s-underworld-finally-continuing-lara-crofts-story-from-the-legend-trilogy-after-almost-two-decades/">Kerslake told GamesRadar+</a>. He added the more recently concluded Survivor reboot trilogy, which saw Lara taking on Trinity in the likes of Siberia and South America, will still serve as Lara's origin story.</p>
<p>"So we're seeing a more experienced Lara Croft," the Catalyst developer said, before adding you won't need to have played or hold a deep knowledge of the other <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a> to be able to follow along.</p>
<p>"What's important to know is that this is a new chapter in Tomb Raider," he stated. "So whether you followed Lara from the start, or this is your first Tomb Raider game, Tomb Raider: Catalyst is designed to stand on its own as an adventure that can be enjoyed by everyone."</p>
<p>If you want a visual representation of how Catalyst and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fully-fledged-from-the-ground-up-tomb-raider-remake-announced">newly-announced Legacy of Atlantis remake</a> fit into the unified Tomb Raider timeline, you can check out the infographic by <a href="https://x.com/FeoUltima">@FeoUltima</a> below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A little while back, conservatives discovered the existence of cartoons, but only their existence. What they do not know, and perhaps can’t know, is that for a brief moment cartoons got really good, and really gay, and now they are dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I’ll be using the term ‘cartoons’ here, but when I do I’ll be referring to animated content released commercially for children and early teenagers in English-speaking countries. The term definitely excludes many things that are obviously cartoons: <em>The Simpsons</em>, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>, <em>Arcane,</em> <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, even <em>Bluey</em> since its core audience is too young. It’s cartoons as in ‘Saturday morning cartoon’: thirty minutes long if you count commercials, narrative-based, usually with other concerns like a toy line, with an audience who are older than toddlers but younger than teenagers.</p><p>On September 29th of 2025, the X account LibsofTikTok, run by former real estate agent Chaya Raichik, discovered the Netflix show <em>Dead End Paranormal Park</em>, which had been cancelled in 2023 after two seasons. In a short clip, the show’s lead character Barney talks about how working at a haunted amusement park allows him to be himself rather than just the one trans kid at his school. Having seen the show, Barney’s gender is mentioned at most a handful of times, the word ‘trans’ might only appear in the clip that Raichik excerpted.</p><p>A day later, Raichik posted a video sourced from Instagram in which a man with a British accent films his TV playing the Netflix show <em>Jurassic Park: Camp Cretaceous</em>, a teen-centric sidequel to the film Jurassic World in which a group of teenagers try to survive on Isla Nublar while Chris Pratt is riding motorcycles and the like. In the clip, the character Yasmina confesses that she’s fallen for the character Sammy—they are both female. The adult watching the cartoon whines ‘lord have mercy.’ The final season of this show aired in 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>Elon Musk encouraged his followers to ‘<a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1973292474375479556?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Cancel Netflix for the health of your kids</u></a>’ shortly after Raichik shared the clips above. Culture war content isn’t exactly uncommon on Musk’s account, though it is often submerged by his genuinely side-splitting comedy and cutting-edge memes, but what are rare are references to children, childcare or fatherhood. Musk is the world’s foremost pronatalist: he believes that the world is dangerously underpopulated and that we should be ‘teach(ing) fear of childlessness’, and yet it doesn’t seem to interest him.&nbsp;</p><p>You already know <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/feb/25/elon-musk-pronatalism-mothers-social-media-parenting?ref=aftermath.site"><u>what he is doing personally to solve this problem</u></a>, but something he never does is talk about his own experiences as a father. As Joyce Carol Oates has pointed out, despite posting on average <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EnoughMuskSpam/comments/1fjrunp/elon_musks_outofcontrol_tweeting_habits_i/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>68 times per day</u></a>, he never talks about anything remotely human: ‘pride in a friend’s or relative’s accomplishment; condolences for someone who has died; pleasure in sports; acclaim for a favorite team; references to history’. More important than any of that: somebody with an estimated fourteen children never talks about them. Obviously security and privacy concerns mean that he can’t share everything, but he never posts a picture one of his children drew or a celebration of good grades.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that he was surprised by the content of years-old Netflix cartoons points to something else: he doesn’t have much interest in what his own children are interested in, and it appears that few conservatives do. In this case, it means that his calls to #cancelnetflix fail to take into account the sweeping changes that have changed the cartoon industry into something unrecognisable.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Dogs in Space/Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can separate kids cartoons into rough phases. The first was the Golden Age of Saturday Morning cartoons: <em>Transformers, G.I Joe, She-Ra </em>and<em> Thundercats</em>. These were almost always tied to a toy line—they were functionally commercials, with plots dictated largely by what stock needed to be moved in a given quarter. That didn’t stop them from being incredibly popular: although viewing figures are difficult to come by because of the nature of how they were syndicated, we can see their impact through toy sales: <a href="https://www.seibertron.com/transmissions/poor-sales-may-deal-toy-robots-fatal-blow/18246/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Hasbro made $950 million from the Transformers franchise alone in the 1980s</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The second stage I don’t want to call the Silver Age, because that implies a level of value that it didn’t have. Throughout the nineties and into the early 2000s cartoons tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to replicate the success of the eighties shows. Remember <em>Exo Force</em>, <em>Pirates of Dark Water, Biker Mice from Mars or SWAT Cats</em>? With this model exhausted, new creators who wanted to make cartoons first and move product second entered the scene thanks to newly established networks like Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, producing cult hits like <em>Ren and Stimpy</em> and breakout successes like <em>Spongebob Squarepants</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> was an anomaly during this time. Though it was Nickelodeon shows like <em>Rugrats</em> and <em>Fairly Odd Parents</em>, it was tonally different from almost everything else out there. You could even call it a continuation of the failed experiments of animation’s not-quite silver age: long-form stories with a large cast, a more adult approach to morality, complex worldbuilding, as well as a very clear attempt to bring anime sensibilities into western animation. It was successful, not only critically but with audiences: <a href="https://www.theanimationblog.com/avatar-the-last-airbender-ratings-hit-all-time-high/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>5.6 million people watched its finale</u></a>, it launched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-egQ79OrYCs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>one bad live action adaptation</u></a>, one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByAn8DF8Ykk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>okay live action adaptation</u></a> and will soon become a trilogy when <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/avatar-last-airbender-seven-havens-animated-series-nickelodeon-1236313495/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Avatar: Seven Havens</u></a> debuts. It helped that <em>Avatar’s</em> release in 2005 came at the high point of the Young Adult fiction wave, so it didn’t seem that kids who were, say, thirteen to sixteen, had to choose between genuine children’s content and adult shows. It blazed a trail that nobody would follow for a long time—for almost a decade it remained the only show that tried to hit that sweet spot of children’s animation that teenagers and even adults could enjoy.</p><blockquote>In a short time it became uncommon to have long-form narrative animation without at least one queer character.</blockquote><p>If Avatar showed that kid’s shows could be blockbusters then 2006’s <em>Adventure Time</em> showed that they could be arthouse. Pendleton Ward’s ten minute long trips were deeply idiosyncratic, down to the strange cadence of the dialogue and the leisurely unfolding of what turned out to be one of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYXo8HxJj3Q&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>most complex and unique fantasy stories of the 21st century</u></a>, one that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSbyC1A9KHk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>still going two decades later</u></a>. I can’t say that the show has directly influenced anything else -except for <a href="https://www.cbr.com/adventure-time-chainsaw-man-crossover-illustration/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Chainsaw Man</u></a>- but it has instead functioned as a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/02/arts/television/adventure-time-animators-reflect-on-its-legacy.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>talent incubator for a new generation of animators</u></a> (storyboard artist <a href="https://www.papermag.com/rebecca-sugar-noelle-stevenson?ref=aftermath.site#rebelltitem47"><u>Rebecca Sugar created <em>Stephen Universe</em></u></a>, for example) and a general call to the industry to raise its game. Also, while it was not the first <em>ever</em> cartoon to feature a queer couple (as far as I can tell that was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jziWWARbG30&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Hey Arnold </em>&nbsp;in 1998</u></a>), the centuries-long on-again-off-again <em>thing</em> between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline was the first involving main characters and not presented as a Very Special Episode.</p><p>In 2012, the Disney Channel released Alex Hirsch’s <em>Gravity Falls</em>. It’s rare that a single show can cause a paradigm shift in the industry—usually they come about from market over-saturation of the creation of new networks. <em>Gravity Falls </em>was different: it looked like a kids cartoon, but, speaking as an adult, it’s genuinely smart and funny. Kids could watch it, but teenagers would <em>get</em> it and adults would appreciate it. It wasn’t purely a cult phenomenon: the series finale, ‘Weirdmageddon’, <a href="https://www.bubbleblabber.com/2016/02/ratings-are-in-22316-gravity-falls-finale-sets-record-for-disney-xd/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Disney reported</u></a>, was ‘a dominant #1 in its time period across all cable TV among Total Viewers, Kids 6-11, Boys 6-11 and Boys 2-11 demographics’.&nbsp;</p><p>While this was happening, a parallel development in young adult fiction would have ramifications for the cartoon industry: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/apr/30/more-than-a-quarter-of-readers-of-ya-are-over-the-age-of-28-research-shows?ref=aftermath.site"><u>adults were starting to read books written for teenagers</u></a>, which meant that books were being written for adults who wanted to read books for teenagers. The fandom for these books skewed&nbsp; female and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365675750_Queer_Literary_Ecologies_and_Young_Adult_Literature?ref=aftermath.site"><u>queer</u></a>, and the publishing industry responded by <a href="https://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/93417-who-is-ya-for.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>buying up books that appealed to this audience</u></a>. That seems to have made solid business sense: Young Adult fiction is <a href="https://www.thebookseller.com/spotlight/2024-young-adult-fiction--booktok-boom-continues-to-sound-for-ya?ref=aftermath.site"><u>still on an upward trajectory</u></a>, even without blockbusters like the Harry Potter franchise, thanks in part to the cross-pollination between YA and Romantasy and its promotion through BookTok.</p><p><em>Gravity Falls </em>and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> didn’t have any overt queer representation (<a href="https://screenrant.com/gravity-falls-disney-lgbtq-representation-alex-hirsch/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Disney cut it out</u></a> from the former and it was only present in the sequel to the latter), but their tone and style pointed the way for shows like Cartoon Network’s <em>Steven Universe </em>and Netflix’s <em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power</em>, which caught on like wildfire in the larger ‘fandom’ community. Pretty soon most significant cartoons married the deep storytelling of <em>Gravity Falls</em> and <em>Avatar: the Last Airbender</em> with themes, such as queer representation, reflecting the adult-YA community: <em>The Owl House</em>, <em>Centaurworld, Dogs in Space, Star vs. the Forces of Evil, Voltron: Legendary Defender, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, Amphibia, The Dragon Prince</em>, <em>Battle Kitty</em>, <em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts, Hilda, </em>and the aforementioned <em>Dead End Paranormal Park </em>and <em>Jurassic World: Camp Cretaceous</em>. In a short time it became uncommon to have long-form narrative animation without at least one queer character. Sometimes the representation was subtle, as in <em>Hilda</em> where they were background characters. Several shows, like <em>She-Ra and the Princesses of Power </em>and <em>The Owl House</em> had queer <em>main</em> characters and their love stories were key plot points.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah Cortez was showrunner on Netflix’s <em>Dogs in Space </em>during this period. He grew up loving animation, took every class he could take on it in college, and drew free-form stories about a Corgi named Garbage’s adventures in space while working at a factory job (he had no emotional connection to dogs and didn’t like sci-fi so it felt like something he could do for fun, with no emotional connection). His co-workers liked it, which led to him producing a rough short, and a chance meeting led to the opportunity to pitch Netflix.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Dogs in Space/Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>“So I went to Netflix,” he told me, “pitched in person, and then left, and I just thought, like, yeah, they're not interested. It was nice that I got to go to the Netflix building and see inside, but I just took it as a nice opportunity, a nice experience. And I left, went back to my job. And then, yeah, about two weeks later, they called me again and said, hey, we want to buy the show.”</p><p>There was a good vibe at Netflix at the time: “Netflix was a great studio to work with when I was there. When I got there, that was the dream studio I wanted to go with. They really believed in what they were selling—Netflix was the place where the shows that other networks wouldn’t get picked up got picked up. They were the place where all the overlooked ideas can come and be a show.”</p><p>The studio was perfectly willing to take a chance on a first-time showrunner, and were collaborators with him rather than the cliche of out-of-touch studio executives handing down notes. The only major change they pushed for was casting Haley-Joel Osmet as Captain Garbage—Jeremiah would have preferred somebody with an older-sounding voice like Will Forte. When Osmet auditioned he nailed it and Jeremiah remains extremely happy with the performance.</p><p><em>Cuphead </em>and <em>Centaurworld</em> were both being made in the same Burbank studio, and both shared <em>Dogs’</em> adults-can-enjoy-it-too vibe. As Jeremiah tells it, this came from Netflix’s genuine desire to make the best shows possible, but there’s business logic there: children are a very small and very fickle demographic, but bringing in what would be traditionally regarded as more adult elements opens animated shows up to a larger audience that includes adults. We still see this today: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zlmswo0S0e0&amp;t=18s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Hazbin Hotel</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlahNrlcgS4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Helluva Boss</u></em></a>, both by Vivienne ‘VivziePop’ Medrano are definitely for adults in terms of swearing and sex references, but have the vibe of children’s cartoons in a way that other adult cartoons like <em>Scavengers Reign</em> and <em>King of the Hill</em> don’t. They seem made for the generation that was just the right age when <em>Gravity Falls</em>, <em>Adventure Time</em> and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> were at their peak and are now in their twenties and thirties.</p><blockquote>These shows were being made during a major shift in the way that children consumed entertainment.</blockquote><p>The second this golden age of animation became unprofitable it stopped. You can practically pin a date down to the very week this happened: on November 15th of 2024, ten days after Donald Trump’s second election, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/479614/disney-reportedly-pulls-marvels-moon-girl-and-dinosaur-episode-over-trans-athlete-story/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Disney removed an episode of <em>Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur</em></u></a> that dealt with trans athletes. It wasn’t the first show that a network had censored —Cartoon Network <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5Mt7S7U2KA&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>even fired somebody over the ‘Bubbleine’ romance</u></a>—but this time felt different. Disney wasn’t just giving notes to writers to keep things PG, they were actively removing a show that dealt with a very specific topic that conservatives are particularly focused on. That felt like the permissive, progressive attitude that had defined the late 2010s to early 2020s was officially over.</p><p>At nearly exactly the same time, the entire age of peak animation collapsed. There were <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/whats-driving-the-animated-tv-series-falloff/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>86 new children’s animated series orders on streaming platforms in 2022 and 113 overall</u></a>. In 2025, that number dropped to 24 on streaming and 35 overall. The only major new animated show for middle-childhood and teen viewers that debuted on streaming platforms in 2025 was Netflix’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqDDuVe9dw8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Wolf King</u></em></a>. My own son was growing up when these shows were airing, so I watched them with him. They were all genuinely good. The second Golden Age of animation was brief, but intense—<em>Over the Garden Wall</em> is, in my estimation, a classic; <em>Dogs in Space</em> and <em>Centaurworld</em> needed much bigger audiences than they got.&nbsp;</p><p>And that was the problem. These shows were being made during a major shift in the way that children consumed entertainment. A good portion of these shows were produced by Netflix, and the world’s largest streaming media company is <a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>notoriously bad at promoting its content</u></a>. Why should it bother when, being a subscription service, it doesn’t need anyone to actually <em>watch</em> its shows, just keep up their monthly payments?</p><p>This goes double for children’s shows: it is very difficult to actually promote children’s content. In times past you could rely on children being around on Saturday mornings and after school, watching whatever was on. Saturday morning cartoons ended on October 4th of 2014, when the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-the-first-weekend-in-america-with-no-saturday-m-1642441646?ref=aftermath.site"><u>CW ended Vortexx</u></a>, which had been holding out long after other networks had cancelled their Saturday morning shows, due largely to FCC regulations that mandated three hours of education programming a day on broadcast TV. Later, when viewers had to actively seek out shows on Netflix, and later Disney+, these companies didn’t have a marketing strategy beyond giving them prime spots on their own platforms and uploading trailers to YouTube. There was no place where you could put an advertisement for a relatively high-budget show like <em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts</em> that would establish ‘this is important’.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Centaurworld/Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, some children’s content does break through. <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em> is a phenomenon, but Netflix’s efforts had little to do with that—marketing analysts might say that it ‘<a href="https://www.contentgrip.com/kpop-demon-hunters-viral-strategy/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>activated fandoms at scale</u></a>’, but viral clips like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DLqV_-XyNTd/?utm_source=ig_embed"><u>Jay from ENHYPHEN dancing to ‘Soda Pop’</u></a> came <em>after</em> the film had become successful, not before. What really happened was that enthusiasm spread virally because the film was always going to ‘activate’ the kind of people who are going to spread things virally—K-pop stans, TikTokkers, cosplayers and so on. Importantly, that level of viral success just doesn’t seem to happen for serialised shows: Netflix’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHYcymIQ7xo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Jentry Chau vs. The Underworld</u></em></a>, which also features K-pop and the hunting of demons, isn’t anywhere near as successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremiah explained that “We're still in this flux. In 2024 people would say: survive ‘til ‘25, when there's going to be all these new shows getting green lit, and everyone's going to be back. We’re already at the tail end of 2025 and it's stayed pretty flat. But Netflix has <em>K-Pop Demon Hunters</em>, and I think this will be the catalyst for a change.”</p><p>The difficulty of (reliably) marketing to young people today has meant that an entire section of the media has functionally disappeared in a very short time. Every one of the shows above is still on their respective streaming services (save for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cooujuNHsBU&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>deeply queer</u></a> <em>Battle Kitty</em>, which was removed when Netflix stopped supporting interactive content), but <a href="https://luminatedata.com/blog/whats-driving-the-animated-tv-series-falloff/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>new shows simply aren’t being commissioned</u></a>. Of the shows mentioned above, only <em>Jentry Chau</em> has any possibility of getting another season as of time of writing.&nbsp;</p><p>The reasons are pretty obvious: <em>Roblox</em> is <a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Number_of_users_joining_Roblox_each_year?ref=aftermath.site"><u>adding millions of players each year</u></a>, <em>Fortnite </em><a href="https://www.tekrevol.com/blogs/fortnite-revenue-usage-statistics/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>is a major force in popular culture</u></a> and the first generation of ‘iPad kids’ are entering their mid teens. <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - The Movie: Mugen Train</em> became the highest grossing Japanese film of all time, with <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Demon-Slayer-Kimetsu-no-Yaiba-The-Movie-Mugen-Train-(2020-Japan)?ref=aftermath.site#tab=summary"><u>$512.7 million in ticket sales on a budget of $15.7 million</u></a>&nbsp; while <em>Wish</em>, a film that Disney promoted as the celebration of a century of filmmaking, made <a href="https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/Wish-(2023)?ref=aftermath.site#tab=summary"><u>$237.9 million on an estimated $200 million budget</u></a>. Anime and manga are handily beating western cultural products among young people: when the French government <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/arts/france-culture-pass.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>gave children €350 each to spend on culture</u></a> they didn’t spend it on Proust and Balzac, but manga, starting a ‘<a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/le-pass-culture-entraine-une-ruee-vers-les-mangas-20210610?ref=aftermath.site"><u>manga rush</u></a>’. The country’s most popular animated show is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-KZwTAkijc&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>magical girl anime</u></a>. Netflix, Amazon Prime and Disney+ have little reason to chase an audience that shows little interest in western animation, so they have dramatically cut their output and bought up shows like <em>Demon Slayer</em> and <em>Jujutsu Kaizen</em> to fill the gaps (though a good portion of Netflix’s anime isn’t suitable for pre-teen kids). Within three years the entire format of long-form English-language children’s animation functionally disappeared.</p><blockquote>Now that animators can no longer rely on networks and streaming platforms for employment, many are turning to independent animation.</blockquote><p>Or evolved. If the second Golden Age is over on streaming platforms then it continues on YouTube. Prompted by the success of ViziePop’s shows, studios like Australia’s <a href="https://www.glitchprod.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Glitch Productions</u></a> were born online and are continuing the style of peak children’s animation in shows like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mImFz8mkaHo&amp;t=8s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Murder Drones</u></em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwAPLk_sQ3w&amp;t=705s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Amazing Digital Circus</u></em></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC8KsZniulw&amp;t=1113s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Gaslight District</u></em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCAdbUaMlAE&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Knights of Guinevere</em> </u></a>(the latter two being more adult-orientated, but still fine for older kids if you don’t mind them hearing a couple of PG-13 swears). Success is no longer getting your show picked up by one of the major streaming platforms but building an entirely digital fanbase.</p><p><em>Knights of Guinevere</em> is significant because it is being helmed by Dana Terrence, the showrunner of Disney’s <em>The Owl House</em>, and is a very clear indictment of Disney. Terrace is an interesting figure here as the only creator who has worked across the old and new children’s media. Beginning her career as a storyboard artist on <em>Adventure Time</em>, she became a director on Disney’s <em>Ducktales</em> reboot, then got to helm her own self-created show, <em>The Owl House</em>. There was, it seems, a falling out between her and Disney, hence the move to Glitch.&nbsp;</p><p>She <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lm6tEcvVUy4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>explains in an interview</u></a> that “I was pissed off one day and this became a cathartic release… I worked with big mainstream studios for about ten years and now I don’t and I’m enjoying myself quite a lot.” The experience of working with Disney left her quite willing to burn bridges: when the company started to use generative AI in their shows, she tweeted ‘<a href="https://x.com/DanaTerrace/status/1989147042904699271?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Unsubscribe from Disney+. Pirate Owl House. I don’t care. Fuck gen AI</u></a>.’&nbsp;</p><p>Collectively, these shows are chalking up hundreds of millions of views—<em>The Amazing Digital Circus</em>’s pilot has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwAPLk_sQ3w&amp;t=706s&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>398 million views</u></a> as of time of writing, and though some will be repeats (about eight are mine) that’s an incredible viewership for a show with zero marketing budget beyond the Glitch brand name. These shows are also interesting for their business model. YouTube alone wouldn’t fund the large, professional operation that is currently producing three high-quality shows, so they supplement their funds with merchandising.&nbsp;</p><p>Glitch Productions’s output and other web series like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vffu6FG4YP4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Lackadaisy</u></em></a> are syntheses of the two golden ages of animation: relatively sophisticated Young-Adult orientated stories supported by business models heavily reliant on merchandising (though unlike eighties Saturday morning cartoons, the stories far and away come first). Despite their success, they are a niche within the larger online world and, although some are now available on streaming services, are hamstrung by releasing episodes every few months and the fickle nature of virality. Now that animators can no longer rely on networks and streaming platforms for employment, many are turning to independent animation, and unfortunately few are breaking a million views.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Centaurworld/Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>The Amazing Digital Circus</em> racks up hundreds of millions of views per episode, while <em>The Gaslight District</em>’s pilot has just broken twenty million views after six months. Non-Glitch indie animations exist, but none have broken through like <em>Digital Circus,</em> which has been snapped up by Netflix.) Independent animation can be successful on its own terms, but there are no points for indie cred in children’s animation, especially when you have something to say. This isn’t like the indie music boom of the 1980s, where the <em>This Band Could Be Your Life</em> generation were creating sounds that nobody could hear on commercial radio and MTV. Music would still exist if Steve Albini never sat behind a mixing deck–if these shows don’t fill the void left by major studios, then there will be no animated narrative fiction for children.</p><p>That matters. I can see what these shows meant for my son and how they benefited him. He is more emotionally intelligent than I was at his age and better able to understand complex narratives, and that isn’t just going to make him better at understanding fiction, but better at understanding people. Part of that is not having parents who were lead-poisoned in a decaying mining village then hammered into the rough shape of adults by the military like I did, but part of that is that he grew up watching stories about people with feelings instead of extended toy adverts. Kids younger than him are going to grow up watching other kids play videogames or whoever replaces Mr. Beast after his inevitable cancellation and/or arrest. That type of ‘content’ (because it is content, not art) is fine in moderation, but people need stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More than that, while children’s cartoons can’t undo centuries of systemic racism and sexism, representation does still matter. Fiction is inherently destabilising because it cannot help but force viewers to see things outside of their perspective. If a creator feels that a character should be black or queer, or if an artist draws a character wearing a hijab because that’s where their inspiration takes them, then that’s what viewers get. Because long-form narratives can put in the work to develop diverse characters,viewers can learn the most important lesson that stories can teach us: we are somehow both radically similar to and radically different from each other. There needs to be more than one production company making these shows or a whole way to communicate to kids is going to disappear.</p><blockquote>It turned out that capitalism won the battle before reactionaries even knew that they were fighting.</blockquote><p>Which brings us back to LibsofTikTok. Because of the way that conservative parents relate, or rather don’t relate to their children they will have little interest in what they are consuming. The number of conservative families who will genuinely raise their children fully outside of the mainstream is going to be very small. Living a trad lifestyle takes money that only a tiny percentage of people will have. Most conservative households are going to parent for the most part like more liberal households, by doing the best they can with limited resources, and part of that is allowing kids to have time in front of a TV or iPad.</p><p>The difference will be emotional coldness, indifference to suffering and a greater incidence of abuse. Starting after <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>, the Christian far-right in particular has developed a parallel theory of child-rearing as disciplines like attachment theory and critical pedagogy made most childhoods kinder and freer (with support from shows like <em>Sesame Street </em>and <em>Mr. Rogers Neighborhood</em>). Talia Lavin’s book <a href="http://bookshop.org/p/books/wild-faith-how-the-christian-right-is-taking-over-america/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Wild Faith</u></em></a><em> </em>details how this mirror-world came into being: home-schooling, religious schools and camps, and parenting manuals like James Dobson’s 1970 book <em>Dare to Discipline</em>. This instructed parents to ‘bring some pain to the child when it is necessary for his eventual good.’ One person who grew up in a conservative Christian household told Lavin that “almost every spanking I’ve ever received was a result of asking ‘why?’”. This is not a lesson that is compatible with the worldviews of the kind of people who want to make children happy by making fun shows for them. The long-term effects of this type of parenting <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4760853/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>are very well documented</u></a>.</p><p>Not every conservative is Christian (Raichik is Jewish, Musk atheist), but every part of the authoritarian ecosystem puts their own spin on these ideas. For most it’s nothing as systematic as the dictates of a parenting manual—more likely its arbitrary punishment, inconsistent discipline and general disinterest in the emotional life of children. Plenty more are more like Finn from <em>Adventure Time</em>’s parents: kind of, sort of okay people, but so wrapped up in their own problems and so laden with their own baggage that they can’t really ‘parent’ as such. Nowhere in authoritarian (or simply shitty) parenting is there space to sit down with your kid and watch shows together.&nbsp;</p><p>We can see that in one of the largest and most successful authoritarian parents’ campaigns in recent years, <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/moms-for-liberty-where-are-they-and-are-they-winning/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Moms for Liberty</u></a>: their target was books. Only <a href="https://literacytrust.org.uk/research-services/research-reports/children-and-young-peoples-reading-in-2024/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>one in three children enjoys reading and one in five actually reads every day</u></a>, while they spend <a href="https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Children-And-Watching-TV-054.aspx?ref=aftermath.site"><u>seven and a half hours each day in front of screens</u></a>. However, parents can pick up books, flick through them and see horrors like the <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/27/us/tennessee-school-board-removes-maus?ref=aftermath.site"><u>mouse penis in Maus</u></a>, while they have to actually sit down and concentrate to find out that the protagonist of <em>Dead End Paranormal Park</em> isn’t just trans, they’re trying to save demons from an angel. Their lack of concern for their children as human beings meant that they never noticed the second golden age of cartoons, which let dozens of shows grow and a generation of artisans hone their craft.</p><p>So it turned out that capitalism won the battle before reactionaries even knew that they were fighting. If they were more invested in the lives of their children <em>as children</em> then they would have seen that animation has so fundamentally changed in the past two years that there is no need to #cancelnetflix. Netflix cancelled itself, or its animation arm at least, and with it an entire medium for communicating with children, one that I believe they benefitted from. Perhaps in 2028 LibsofTikTok will notice that Zooble from <em>The Amazing Digital Circus</em> is an allegory for trans experience and get all worked up about that, but until then the rest of us, and our children, are going to have to live in a media environment that is increasingly less human.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>Gaming laptops, especially the muscular options from high-end brands, don’t come in cheap. Most models with solid graphics, a powerful processor, and massive memory sit well over $2,000, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6391/">Right now, you can grab the 16-inch ASUS ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop at a 31% discount, which drops its price to $1,800.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s going to be worth it. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, and you also get a pair of headphones with a gaming mouse for free with your purchase. Amazon is offering it as a limited-time deal, though. We recommend placing your orders sooner rather than later to avoid last-minute disappointments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6391/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Graphics</h2>
<p>This powerhouse is equipped with the latest 16-core 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14650HX processor, featuring 30MB cache and 5.2GHz clock speed. It’s got enough muscle to tackle gaming, streaming, creative workloads, and even intense multitasking during your busy days. Backing the processor up is a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 laptop GPU, with a max TGP of 115W. Features like DLSS 4 and ray tracing technology create a hyper-realistic visual experience, bringing all your favorite titles to life. You will be able to play both the classics and the latest releases in an immersive way like never before.</p>
<p>There’s a massive 32 GB of blazing-fast DDR5 5600MHz RAM that ensures quicker game access, faster loads, and smoother frame rates. It’s also great for work professionals looking to multitask their way through busy days, where they can juggle a whole bunch of tasks at the same time without slowing down. The spacious, expansive 1 TB PCIE 4.0 SSD storage takes the experience even further in two ways. First, it lets you house all your important titles and projects in a single place. Secondly, SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives, and make for faster boot and transfer times. Even better, the PCIe Gen 5-ready SSD slots let you easily upgrade the space as your needs grow in the future.</p>



<p>As for the display, you’ll enjoy fighting the bad guys on a bright, vibrant 16-inch screen that offers an impressive 165Hz/3ms refresh rate. The 300 nits of brightness provide consistent visuals in all lighting conditions, while the exceptional color accuracy makes sure all the high and low lights stay exactly as intended by the creator. But despite all this incredible power, the laptop stays calm and cool as it works. Thanks to its ROG Intelligent Cooling tech. The tri-fan airflow, vapor chamber, and liquid metal come together to offer peak performance while maintaining temperatures on the inside.</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention are Dolby Atmos audio for a surround sound experience, plus an HD+ webcam for better video calls and clearer streaming sessions. Freebies include pre-installed Windows 11 Pro, a pair of headphones, and an efficient gaming mouse.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking for a solid gaming laptop, this powerful ASUS ROG Strix G16 is an excellent option to consider. I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6391/">t usually goes for around $2,600, but you can snap it up for $1,800 today.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, but the offer ends soon. Grab it before the price shoots back up, or the stock runs out for good.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/</link>
            <guid>1383409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has published all the information you could want to know about the upcoming Cold Snap update, which includes the Flickering Flames event and the new Raider Deck. The update drops on all platforms <strong>tomorrow</strong>, and there are stacks to learn about what’s coming next in ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The update includes a new community challenge, a fresh series of Feats to complete to unlock free rewards, and map conditions that present a dire threat to Raiders everywhere.</p>







<h2 id="h-cold-snap-new-map-condition">Cold Snap: New Map Condition</h2>



<p>From December 16, ARC Raiders players will be able to jump onto maps blanketed with snow and featuring a new map condition: Cold Snap. This condition is harmful and poses a serious threat to players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>During the&nbsp;<strong>Cold Snap&nbsp;</strong>condition<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>the clock is ticking. The freezing weather will cut your Raider down in minutes unless you get indoors, or heal up quickly. Bear this in mind when engaging other Raiders – getting pinned down in the open is a death sentence during a Rust Belt winter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Flickering Flames is the new event coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. The details have been outlined in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/whats-coming-in-the-december-update">recent blog post</a> published by Embark Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Below ground, the tenacity of the human spirit endures. Despite food scarcity and rolling blackouts, survivors gather to light candles, swap war stories, and appreciate what little they have. The festival of&nbsp;<strong>Flickering Flames</strong>&nbsp;is about to begin.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Candleberry</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Bush&nbsp;</strong>forms the centerpiece of these festivities. For Speranzans, this hardy plant is a versatile asset during the winter months: boiling the berry creates a wax that burns for hours. Crushing them yields a refreshing juice while the roots make for a tea that drives out the toughest colds. Candleberries make hearty stews, warming soups, and gifts of perfume and soap, while the wreaths can be fashioned into festive decorations that offer Speranzans a hint of Topside’s greenery. Speranza needs A LOT of them for the Candleberry Banquets!</p>



<p>Speranzans rely on other essential items through the winter too.&nbsp;<strong>Light and heat sources</strong>&nbsp;boost morale and help keep Speranzans comfortable, while giving them the best chance to fight through to the spring.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you collect Candleberries and ‘other special items’, you’ll receive Raider Tokens, new items, rare utility items, weapons, cosmetics, and merit tokens, so there’s some give and take there. Players can unlock Merits simply for playing ARC Raiders, but finding and extracting Candleberries will elevate their gains.</p>



<p>An all-new Raider Deck will be introduced from <strong>December 26th</strong>, featuring a series of exclusive <strong>and free </strong>unlocks:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With our Winter Update, we’re also introducing our second<strong>&nbsp;free, permanent Raider Deck. Available from the 26th December</strong>, The Goalie Raider Deck lets you unlock a series of items, Raider Tokens, and Cosmetics as you earn Cred Topside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The flagship skin of the new Raider Deck is an old world outfit that some Speranzans have claimed was worn by the world’s most fierce and respected gladiators. Who knows, really? But hey, it comes with a pretty cool new hockey stick Raider Tool.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As explained, the new skin comes with the first new Raider Tool, which takes the form of a hockey stick, because why not?</p>



<p>Flickering Flames is a limited-time, winter-themed event that runs from December 16 until January 13, so be quick if you want to maximize your rewards.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re looking forward to the Cold Snap update.</p>
