            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-state-of-play-july-2025-everything-revealed">Ghost of Yotei’s very own State of Play showcase</a>, we sat down for a chat with creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell to talk about what we saw of Sucker Punch’s upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive — and what we were left wondering about. Read on for answers!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The backdrop of Ghost of Tsushima was a real-life invasion by Mongol forces on the island of Tsushima. With Ghost of Yotei, what's the historical setting of what's going on in Japan at this time and how will that play into Atsu’s journey?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> The game takes place in the year 1603. Peace has just broken out in Japan after decades and decades of civil war and there are a lot of sellswords that suddenly are out of work. So they travel north to the edge of the Japanese empire, an island called Ezo, modern day Hokkaido. And this place becomes a powder keg. It's very, very dangerous with all these sellswords walking around trying to make a buck. This moment in history combined with the beauty of Ezo, these lush mountainscapes and forests and rivers, creates a dynamite combination for an open world game, and it's where we wanted to set Atsu’s quest for vengeance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: During your presentation at the State of Play, you mentioned that Ghost of Yotei focuses on more freedom than any game Sucker Punch has ever made. That's a large claim considering the amount of freedom that was already offered in Ghost of Tsushima, I can definitely attest to that. Can you elaborate on some of the ways in which you've enhanced the feeling of freedom compared to what the player could already do in Ghost of Tsushima?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> When we started to think about what the next game would be for us at Sucker Punch, we really had to take stock of what we loved and what our fans really loved, and how we saw people play Ghost of Tsushima. And one of the aspects of Tsushima that we wanted to carry forward was the sense of exploration. We saw people play very wide in their experience. We saw some people drop 80, 90 hours and just exploring and using modes like photo mode just to soak in the nature and the beauty of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That really resonated with us. We're big wide players as well, so when we set out to make Yotei, especially once we decided that it was going to take place in Hokkaido — back then it was called Ezo, this vast, vast landscape that just frankly had a nice overlap with us having a desire to have a more open game design because it's such a vast place — led us to a whole host of features, ranging from simple utility features like spyglass, being able to pull your spyglass up really quickly and look around the environment really is the way that I think Nate and I both really love to play, just see something on the horizon and go to it, to traversal features. We have flower streams that are just woven into the environment and help you get across vast landscapes. If you follow those flowers you'll get a little bit of a speed boost because they're joyful for Atsu to ride in, but they also might lead you to something. Or developing features like our clue system, or camping features, which just really celebrate the wilds of Ezo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of the coolest moments at the State of Play was the seamless switch from present day to Atsu’s past when she was looking around the remnants of her childhood home, and then you actually saw her reliving those memories in the past with just the press of a button. I wondered where this idea came from, and is it the kind of thing where it'll be tied to specific spots throughout the game world, so there'll be an area where it's clearly time to switch back to the past? Or is it up to the player to discover those for themselves?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> In Ghost of Yotei there are a number of places in the world that Atsu visits in which she has a lot of memories from her youth. And at the touch of a button, you can go back into the past and you control Atsu as a child, you get to play as her interacting with her brother and her parents and other people in Ezo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We wanted you to be able to really control her as a kid so that you would feel like you knew what her life was like, you could experience that, and of course because this shows you what she lost. It’s a feature we really love because the player is in command, they can hit the button to go back and see what it used to be like and then hit it again and see what it's like now, comparing and contrasting for instance, what her own homestead looked like in her youth to what it looks like now after it's been run down by weather and lack of use, it's become a ruin. So you get to see the before and after of her experience in the landscape.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So was it from day-one work on the sequel? Did you know that you were starting fresh with a brand new character, or were there ever some initial ideas for maybe continuing Jin’s story on after the events of Ghost of Tsushima?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> For us at Sucker Punch, one of the things that, especially if you look back on our catalog of games, we have a deep love for making origin stories. It's something we have a lot of passion for. We like coming up with those stories, those arcs, the characterizations, how they might come through in the game experience, what type of features it might sort of spark as we create this new character. And so really from the beginning we knew that we were going to be charting on new territory here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then once we pretty quickly started looking at Hokkaido and this region and this time period and just how vast and stunning and big and filled with wilderness, and you combine that with this idea of doing a tale of vengeance where Atsu is hunting someone inside of that landscape, it was just such a great match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not hunting for somebody in a safe environment. This is a massive landscape that she'll be going under quite an undertaking hunting them here. We felt like that was an exciting connection. I'll say also the story of the folk legend of the onryō, this Japanese folk legend of tale of vengeance, often women who've been wronged in life and now they've come back to seek vengeance, we got really excited about that folk legend and decided that we were going to inject that pretty heavily into our version of a Ghost story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ghost of Yotei Popcorn Bucket Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: One of the other new features involving campfires you mentioned was a system that allowed members of your wolf pack to visit you at night. You sort of hinted that you don't have to leave where you're exploring, the game comes to you. Can you tell us a little bit more about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> First and foremost any feature that makes it into the game has to be tonally celebrating the land of Ezo. And as I mentioned earlier, this vast landscape, there's nothing better than celebrating the camping aspects of it. That is something we felt was really important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now secondly, I must say we're always looking for ways to make the game feel approachable. And I mentioned it a little bit in the State of Play, is that, open world in big games, managing resources is kind of challenging. In our game you can fast travel. In our last game, you could fast travel anywhere. If you want to go upgrade your bow, you could fast travel over here and upgrade your bow, that's fine and you can do that again in this game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But after you meet people and your wolf pack grows, we show this screen briefly, you can go into those wolf pack screens and see what people have to offer for you. Say you like that bow here, if they have an upgrade available to you, you might be able to pull them into your campsite. So if you're exploring a region of the game, it sometimes can be really discordant to just like stop there, go warp to another area, upgrade, and then come back to where you're exploring. This is what we mean. You can actually just stay here, set up camp, briefly engage with this person, this bow, your person comes over, you get your upgrade and then you go back on your way all while celebrating the wilds of Ezo. And that's where camping has been an iteration and evolution of the Ghost game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Ghost of Tsushima Legends was objectively awesome. How happy were you with that mode as a team and is there a possibility to see something like it again for Ghost of Yotei, either at launch or maybe in the far off distant future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> We were extremely happy with Ghost of Tsushima Legends and allowing players to connect with friends and use their skills fighting with the katana against a variety of enemies. We loved it. Right now we are very focused on completing Ghost of Yotei to the highest quality possible and putting it in players' hands very soon on October 2. That is our absolute focus right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Masterfully answered! What has it been like developing combat based around a whole arsenal of weapons this time as opposed to just a katana and the variety of different stances?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> In Tsushima, we really loved our stance system where the player could choose one of four ways to hold the weapon to combat a particular type of enemy. In Ghost of Yotei we took that system and we expanded it. Instead of four stances, there are now five. Instead of stances with one weapon, we took that same system and we said, okay, instead of stances it's new melee weapons. Functionally it's the same as stances but it's more. For instance, if you use a spear, you can use that weapon to knock enemies backwards in space. So if you're standing near a cliff fighting them, you can knock them off the cliff into the abyss. Works just like stances, but there are extra abilities attached to each of these weapons to give the player more options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So should the player be expecting to juggle weapons and learn which is going to work against which type of enemy, perhaps what weapon they're using? Or is it more a case of unlocking the right skills for the right weapons?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> The game definitely would like players best to learn how to switch weapons when it is appropriate. It is the most efficient way to play. Let's face it, people sometimes want to play in the way that makes them feel the coolest and the game will not hurt you if you do that. If you want to play with just two swords in each hand because it looks cool, you can play through the whole game that way. It's A-okay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Can you mention any of your favorite skills that you're able to unlock or moves you're able to do with any of the weapons?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> I love the kusarigama because while it's really good for taking down people with shields, it also allows you to do an area of effect attack by spinning that chain above your head. If you're surrounded by enemies, you can hit them all. This is something we never had in Tsushima, but in Yotei it's absolutely there for you. It is a moment where you're kind of improvising, and these weapons allow you to do a broader selection of abilities that give you more choice and more freedom in how you deal tactically with the enemies around you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Jason, do you have one as well?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> I think my favorite when it comes to combat is the dual wielding. It really rewards the feeling of being really fast, and when she hits with those two swords you can kind of get into a flurry and get into a groove where it just keeps going. You're like, this is going to stop, but it just keeps going. There's speed there, it feels really lethal. It doesn't feel like you're swinging a lot and doing little damage. It feels like you're actually really hurting them. I like dual wielding... that’s my fantasy melee weapon set up for me. That might be different for other people, but that's why there's five of 'em. Everybody's going to try something new and different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So Jason, in a New York Times interview, you mentioned that you were left in awe by the sight of Mount Yotei reflected across Lake Tōya during a research trip. Was that the site that inspired the setting of Ghost of Yotei, or were there ever any other locations or historical settings that could have perhaps been the home for Atsu?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> By the time we had gone on the research trip, we definitely knew that we were making a game up there. We had seen enough images. We had embraced the idea that this is where our game was going to take place, and it was about just getting immersed in the culture up there because it's quite different than Honshu mainland Japan. A number of us, it was our first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So really opening the door to all of the unknowns that we could take home and be inspired by and develop new relationships for new advisors. That's the real reason to go. But that Lake Tōya moment where — and I bet Nate had a very similar experience — certainly was some of the birthplaces of thinking about what the actual name of the game would be, because it was just such a majestic moment where the mountain is sort of towering over you. It was a nice middle point of the trip for us, and really symbolized a lot of what we learned and felt while we were there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there were a bunch of natural decisions and some implicit decisions that were made over the course of the game that suddenly, our home is at the foot of Mount Yōtei, this massive mountain that’s casting this shadow over and we were naming things based off of it. It really felt like it was the geographical heart of the experience, and the story was spiraling out from there. It felt like just a great moment for us as we were getting towards the early parts of making the game, and it ended up transforming into the actual name.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: And I know this is going to be hard, but Nate, starting with you, I'd love to know one thing you're super excited for players to be able to see and play with when the game comes out in October?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nate Fox:</strong> Oh, I'm very excited for players to get out into the wilds, the dangerous lawless wilds of Ezo and hopefully they're really entranced by Atu’s quest. The wind's blowing them towards a mission start, but what's that over there? They see something on the horizon that stokes their curiosity and they say, you know what? I'm going to go check it out. And they ride to that thing and they're going to find something worth discovering, whether it's a story or some piece of valuable treasure, you name it. We wanted to make sure in this game that we honored players' curiosity, that we would reward exploration. And to me that's the magic of Yotei. It's those spaces in between missions when players just find themselves propelled by the smallest little puff of curiosity and it takes them on an adventure they hadn't anticipated doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What I'm hearing from that is I'm going to be having a lot of late nights, way later than intended. Jason?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Connell:</strong> I actually want to say something we haven't talked about much, which is Atsu’s shamisen, which is the instrument that she carries, which is her mother’s shamisen. Just like in Ghost of Tsushima, we had features in that game, I think it was called the Traveler's Attire in the last game… it would help you find content nearby, you could use it almost like a completion tool or a navigation tool in order to get through the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I love that the shamisen exists and there's actually songs that you can learn inside of the open world, and those songs can then guide you to certain types of things. So you want to collect some of these songs because they'll guide you. The Song of Vanity might guide you to cosmetics, and we know how people love dressing up in the game and putting on cool outfits. So I'm really excited about showing more of that and for players to get an opportunity to use that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Interview conducted by Rachel Weber.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Itch.io has announced that is delisted and “deindexed” all adult NSFW titles from its store front, following similar steps taken by Valve’s Steam, due to pressure from payment processors, such as Visa and Mastercard, regarding NSFW content. The pressure has also come from the pressure group <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/">Collective Shout</a>, an Australian charity whose stated mission is <em>“challenging the objectification of women and sexualisation of girls in media, advertising and popular culture. We target corporations, advertisers, marketers and media which exploit the bodies of women and girls to sell products and services and campaign to change their behaviour.”</em></p>
<p>In a <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">blog post</a> about the removal of NSFW content, itch.io said, “<em>We have “deindexed” all adult NSFW content from our browse and search pages. We understand this action is sudden and disruptive, and we are truly sorry for the frustration and confusion caused by this change.</em></p>


<p><em>Recently, we came under scrutiny from our payment processors regarding the nature of some content hosted on itch.io. Due to a game titled No Mercy, which was temporarily available on itch.io before being banned back in April, the organization Collective Shout launched a campaign against Steam and itch.io, directing concerns to our payment processors about the nature of certain content found on both platforms. Our ability to process payments is critical for every creator on our platform. To ensure that we can continue to operate and provide a marketplace for all developers, we must prioritize our relationship with our payment partners and take immediate steps towards compliance.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a time critical moment for itch.io. The situation developed rapidly, and we had to act urgently to protect the platform’s core payment infrastructure. Unfortunately, this meant it was not realistic to provide creators with advance notice before making this change. We know this is not ideal, and we apologize for the abruptness of this change. We are currently conducting a comprehensive audit of content to ensure we can meet the requirements of our payment processors. Pages will remain deindexed as we complete our review. Once this review is complete, we will introduce new compliance measures. For NSFW pages, this will include a new step where creators must confirm that their content is allowable under the policies of the respective payment processors linked to their account.</em></p>
<p><em>Part of this review will see some pages being permanently removed from itch.io. Affected accounts will be notified via their account’s email address from our support address. You can reply to that email if you have any follow up questions. We ask for your patience and understanding as we navigate this challenging period. I’m sorry we can not share more at this time as we are still getting a full understanding of the situation ourselves. We will post a follow up on our blog if the situation changes. Thank you.”</em></p>

<p>Last week, Steam introduced a rule regarding NSFW content in response to pressure from payment processors. This rule says, <em>“Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.”</em></p>
<p>Collective Shout claimed this as a win, following an<a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/open-letter-to-payment-processors"> open letter</a> it sent to the CEOs of various payment processors including Visa, Mastercard, Paypal, Paysafe Limited, Discover, and Japan Credit Bureau. <a href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/win-new-steam-policy-games-removed">Collective Shout has stated that 1047 people</a> sent emails to these companies about payments on Steam and Itch.io going to games depicting rape and incest, and credits this action as the reason for the bans on the platforms. However, the payment processors could also be using this as cover so they can show compliance with the US FOSTA (Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act) and SESTA (Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act) laws that passed in 2018, which could, in theory, make payment processors and platform holders liable for payments that could be seen to be going to products or content that breach those laws. Additionally, the UK’s Online Safety Law, which goes into effect on 25th July, will also require platform holders that host anything adult to have people prove their identity using ID and credit cards to access them.</p>

			<p>This morning, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announ</a>ced in a press release that it has entered a strategic partnership with fellow Japanese entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco. Sony agreed to acquire 16 million Bandai Namco shares for roughly 68 billion yen (around $465 million), gaining control of 2.5% of the company's total shares.</p>



<p>Nobuhiko Momoi, Executive Vice President at Bandai Namco Holdings Inc., said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>The Bandai Namco Group promotes an "IP axis strategy" that aims to maximize IP value by leveraging the appeal and worldview of IP, providing the optimal products and services at the optimal timing in the optimal regions. We are filled with excitement about the potential to create new entertainment by combining Sony Group's strengths and technological capabilities across various entertainment fields with Bandai Namco's IP axis strategy. Through this collaboration, we aim to connect with IP fans worldwide, co-create the future together, and realize our Purpose, "Fun for All into the Future," and Mid- to Long-term Vision, "Connect with Fans."</em></p>



<p>Toshimoto Mitomo, Chief Strategy Officer and Representative Corporate Executive Officer at Sony Group Corporation, added:</p>



<p><em>Through this partnership, we aim to co-create an array of content and experiences that exceed expectations and deliver Kando （emotion） to even more fans, alongside Bandai Namco Group, with its outstanding capacity for multidirectional expansion of diverse IP and deep connections with fans at real touchpoints, both domestically and internationally. By combining the strengths of both companies in the field of entertainment and unlocking the potential of compelling IP, we will further accelerate our efforts to maximize IP value and realize Sony's long-term vision, "Creative Entertainment Vision".</em></p>



<p>The press release mainly emphasizes that Sony will produce and distribute anime and 'other video content' based on Bandai Namco's intellectual properties. That said, the collaboration could extend to other areas like games and music. Even so, it is highly unlikely that Bandai Namco's games will become exclusive to PlayStation consoles, especially given the minuscule share percentage.</p>



<p>In late 2024, Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became</a> the largest shareholder of Kadokawa Corporation (the parent company of FromSoftware) with 10% shares. However, a few months ago Tencent also <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-has-increased-its-stake-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-edging-closer-to-sonys-share/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increased its own shares</a> up to nearly 8%, almost as much as Sony.</p>

                <p>Retro gaming fans might have to make a difficult choice soon, as ModRetro has revealed that its modern-day tribute to the Nintendo 64 console will cost $200. First teased last year, this could make it a viable alternative to the Analogue 3D, which costs $250.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/palmerluckey/status/1948186521737302455" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>ModRetro's newest product is M64. The best and most authentic way to play your favorite N64 games, bar none. Prepare your wallet and brace your mind.</p><p>Launches at the same price as the original Nintendo 64. Inflation isn't nostalgic. <a href="https://t.co/LYDyiBBx2O" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/LYDyiBBx2O</a></p></div>  — Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1948186521737302455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 24, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogue-3d-delayed-to-late-august-due-to-tariffs/1100-6533190/" data-ref-id="1100-6533190">Like the Analogue 3D</a>, the M64 is also an FPGA console that aims to replicate the experience of using an N64 at a hardware level. This is the same direction that ModRetro took for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-review-a-remarkable-recreation-of-the-game-boy-color/1100-6528473/" data-ref-id="1100-6528473">ModRetro Chromatic</a>, a well-designed Game Boy successor that combines several modern conveniences with an authentic handheld gaming experience that can easily run all of your original Game Boy cartridges. The handheld also feels great to use, thanks to all of the premium materials incorporated into its design.</p><p>Beyond that, ModRetro hasn't revealed any other details regarding the M64. The teaser trailer posted by company founder Palmer Luckey does have a very blurry tease of the device--and a "do not open until Christmas" message--and it looks like it'll sport a grey color scheme. The video also suggests that you'll be able to use your original N64 cartridges, and it'll be interesting to see if it has any of the other modern features built into the Chromatic, like native video streaming and multiplayer support.</p><p>FPGA consoles like this are generally seen as the best option for enthusiasts, due to them being able to play these games in HD via HDMI on a modern television. The Analogue 3D can do this in 4K, and it offers a variety of filters to make the experience look like you're playing on a CRT TV, so it'll be interesting to see if the M64 can offer a similar experience.</p><p>If you're a bigger fan of Nintendo's handheld gaming age, you can order the ModRetro Chromatic right now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modretro-chromatic-is-back-in-stock-and-available-in-new-colors/1100-6533058/" data-ref-id="1100-6533058">as new stock has arrived</a> and it's also available in several new colors.</p>

<p>If you're wondering how development is tracking, the latest update is the Switch 2 title has just been rated by the classification board in Brazil.</p>
<p>This information comes from <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/07/23/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-has-now-been-rated-in-brazil/">Universo Nintendo (via My Nintendo News)</a>, with the outlet suggesting an update about this game could be coming very soon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The game here was rated "over 12 years old", despite Nintendo's request that it be classified as "over 10"."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The previous title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a> was rated 'T' for 'Teen' and contained fantasy violence along with in-game purchases.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, this follow-up is scheduled to arrive "this winter" although some official online pages currently list 'TBD'.</p>
<p>As previously revealed, this game will take place <em>before</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and is set to feature the classic 'Warriors' gameplay. Here's a bit extra about it from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></strong> is the newest title in the Hyrule Warriors series and is developed by Koei-Tecmo Games with support from Nintendo. The game features epic battles against hordes of enemies as it tells the untold story from Hyrule's distant past of the Imprisoning War that ultimately led to the events of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em><em>. Fans of the Legend of Zelda series and players of both</em> <em>The Legend of Zelda:</em> <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> can experience the thrill of battle and this canonical tale featuring Princess Zelda, King Rauru, and other familiar characters.

<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV gives an already fantastic party game a huge shot in the arm, with a bunch of brilliant Mouse Mode and mic-based games that also allow you to see your big silly face as you play. It's all very knockabout, very easy to use, and very easy to enjoy."</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184958 @ 1753346162 -->
<p>What did other outlets have to say then? Starting the party with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review">IGN</a>, this outlet awarded the Switch 2 package <strong>7/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Super Mario Party Jamboree itself is still fantastic, but the mixed new content of the Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV re-release adds frustrating limitations and strange design decisions to what was otherwise a polished, customizable experience."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/mario-party-jamboree-switch-2/">VGC</a> gave it <strong>4/5</strong> stars, noting how this upgrade elevates what's already one of the best series entries:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By itself, then, Jamboree TV is a bit of an uneven expansion. However, Switch 2 does power some genuinely great new mini-games and, when it works (and if you own one), camera support does elevate the general experience, making this almost by default the definitive version of one of the best Mario Party games. Whether that’s worth the $20 / £17 upgrade, however, is very much dependent on your personal affection for the series."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/615084/super-mario-party-jamboree-tv-switch-2-edition">Polygon</a> labelled it the Switch 2's best tech demo yet, even though it labelled the upgrade as "falling on the inessential side":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The upgrade winds up falling on the inessential side – especially since it misses a chance to add some new maps or characters – but the full package is one of the Switch 2’s smartest value propositions at present. <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> now stands as a robust party game that makes up for its shortcomings in sheer variety."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.vooks.net/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-review/">Vooks</a> scored it <strong>3/5</strong> stars, describing it as one for "superfans":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mario Party superfans will enjoy the new modes for the main board games, but the Jamboree TV additions—aside from the mouse games—are a bit average. <em>Jamboree</em> was a solid and complete package, and this just splits it all up and breaks the flow."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/review-super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-jamboree-tv-is-perfectly-fine/">Siliconera</a> said this update was "perfectly fine", awarding it <strong>8/10</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Super</em> <em>Mario Party Jamboree</em> remains a solid game... <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</em> is a natural pick-up for families. If someone is in a home with multiple players who own both Switch or Switch 2 systems, it could be great for game nights. However, if you’re going to go with one Switch or Switch 2 system for a group session or plan to play only online... you might be fine sticking with the original game."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV launches this week on <strong>24th July 2025</strong>.</p>

After <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339971/nintendo-game-boy-lego-release-date-october-2025">revealing this January</a> that it would take up the challenge, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgame-boy-72046" rel="sponsored">it has revealed</a> a most impressive take on the 1989 classic that’ll cost a relatively reasonable $60 in the US. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Game-Boy/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">It’s already up for pre-order today</a> for an October 1st ship date. At 3.5 inches (14cm) wide and 5.5 inches (9cm) tall, it looks like it’ll have almost as same dimensions as the original.</p></div><p>As you’ll see in the many images below, this Game Boy doesn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">rely on miniature hats</a> for its iconic fuchsia A and B buttons — Lego has seemingly created pitch-perfect buttons that appear to recess into the frame. The console’s curves are also captured remarkably well!</p><p>And unless I’m very much mistaken, it comes with <em>printed</em> tiles rather than sticker labels to help replicate the Game Boy’s many, many iconic labels for its buttons, volume dial, on-off switch, “Dot Matrix With Stereo Sound” highlight, as well as larger features like the Game Boy’s mono speaker grille, battery compartment latch, and serial number around back that have proven difficult to emulate in bricks. (That serial number has an easter egg, by the way.)</p><div><p><cite>GIF by The Verge / video by Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But perhaps best of all, this Lego Game Boy can show off actual scenes from the classic games using swappable lenticular lenses that’ll show you different images when viewed from different angles. You can pop in a brick-built cartridge of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening </em>or <em>Super Mario Land</em>, and “watch” the classic Nintendo logo drop as you rotate the screen downwards (you’ll have to imagine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz2QPBkDkFc">the Game Boy’s da-DING beep</a>). Or, pop in a different lenticular lens to see Link cozy up to Marin on the beach in <em>Awakening</em>’s most bittersweet scene:</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24073412/i-built-that-lego-game-boy-and-now-its-even-better">I built Nick Lever’s fan-designed Lego Game Boy myself</a>, and have the real deal that plays actual cartridges too, but I’m going to be mighty tempted to pick up the official Lego one as well. If those buttons move when you push them, I doubt I’ll resist! Do wish it came with <em>Tetris</em>, too, though.</p><div><p>Lego and Nintendo have also recreated part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3eYc6dMOhw">the original US Game Boy commercial</a> using the set. It’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMeI3BwtTje/">on Instagram</a>, and you may be able to play it (with a tap) in its embedded form below.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display]]></content:encoded>

The campaign itself is long and arduous, filled with numerous challenges that serve to test your skills. If you're patient, then you might just reach the game's conclusion.</p><h2>How long to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers - Campaign length guide</h2><p>If you're ready to dive straight into a dark fantasy adventure in Ming Dynasty China, then you need to allot enough time for the campaign. On average, it should take you <strong>roughly 25 to 35 hours</strong> to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers on your first try. Granted, this is primarily if you just focus on the main objectives, but we also take character deaths into consideration given the challenge presented by numerous bosses.</p><p>If you want to tackle optional content, then you might spend anywhere from <strong>40 to 50 hours</strong> as you explore every nook and cranny. Of course, there's also New Game+ mode, a staple among soulslike games, which further increases your playtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537178"></a><figcaption>Bosses like Commander Honglan will probably kick your butt and put an end to your speedrunning goals.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537178-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers campaign structure</h3><p>As far as beating Wuchang: Fallen Feathers' campaign goes, you might be wondering about the structure or presentation itself. Here's a quick summary that's fairly light on spoilers:</p><ul><li>The initial area, Worship's Rise, consists of several sprawling areas. These include Reverent Temple, Shu Sanctum, Tang Palace, and various caverns and villages.</li><li>Upon finishing the key objectives, you can head to a junction point. One path leads to the snow-capped peaks of Cloudspire, while another takes you to the temples and pavilions of Mount Zhenwu.</li><li>Naturally, there are other locations, but we don't want to spoil you with all the details here.</li><li>All of these areas are crawling with insidious enemies and ferocious bosses. Needless to say, your speed of completion will depend on the viability of your build and weapons, as well as your overall skill when it comes to soulslike action.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4537179"></a><figcaption>There are various areas to explore and some have hidden secrets, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4537179-wuchang-fallen-feathers-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-2.jpg"></figure><h3>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers additional objectives</h3><p>Generally speaking, progression normally entails defeating enemies/bosses, leveling up using Red Mercury, and buying/upgrading your gear. That said, there are other activities that you can tackle while you're exploring distant lands, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Manna Vase upgrades </strong>- You can find several items that boost your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-manna-vase-upgrades-forgotten-remembrance-lost-remains-guide/2900-6791/" data-ref-id="2900-6791"><strong>Manna Vase/healing flask</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Armors and outfits</strong> - There are dozens of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-all-armors-costumes-outfits/2900-6793/" data-ref-id="2900-6793"><strong>armors and gear pieces</strong></a> to discover.</li><li><strong>Wu Gang items</strong> - You can gather valuables to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-wu-gang-items-guide/2900-6788/" data-ref-id="2900-6788"><strong>unlock new items for Wu Gang</strong></a>, a vendor NPC in your hub.</li><li><strong>Giant Panda Bamboo Shoots</strong> - Little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bamboo-shoots-panda-guide/2900-6794/" data-ref-id="2900-6794"><strong>Bamboo Shoots</strong></a> run around when they spot you.

And, yes, you might be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wuchang-fallen-feathers-summon-companions-bone-whistle/1100-6533363/" data-ref-id="1100-6533363"><strong>summon companions</strong></a>, too.</li><li><strong>Optional locations</strong> - There are certain areas that you won't visit as part of the main story, but you can reach them if you're keen on exploring.</li></ul><p>That does it for our guide on how long it takes to beat Wuchang: Fallen Feathers. Other activities are a given when playing soulslike games, such as obtaining all weapons, armors, and spells, so you can expect to add more hours if you're a completionist.

<p>Following the LEGO Game Boy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/nintendo-and-lego-are-collaborating-on-a-new-game-boy-set">teaser earlier this year</a>, this new model building set has now been officially revealed.</p>
<p>It will be available for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> (<em>or your regional equivalent</em>) and will be released on <strong>1st October 2025</strong>, with pre-orders now available on LEGO's website in select locations. Here's a video of this new set shared by Nintendo of America on social media:</p>

<p>This new kit is described as being a "scale of near 1:1" of the original Game Boy, and includes <strong>421 pieces</strong> in total. Additionally, it comes with "all the memorable features" including the control pad, 'A' and 'B' Buttons, and select and start. There are even details such as the contrast adjustment and volume dials.</p>
<p>To enhance the nostalgia, this set comes with insertable "brick-built" versions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> Game Paks. The display can also showcase different screens, including the "classic Nintendo start" screen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JEHFv10kUS0" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JEHFv10kUS0?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38eeb6nqvtls&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEHFv10kUS0" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Well today, as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-san-diego-comic-con-2025">San Diego Comic-Con 2025,</a> we're back with an exclusive look at some of the first cards that will actually be a part of that Standard-legal set – and this cast of five spideys will surely look familiar to any <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse">Spider-Verse</a> fans out there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the slideshow below to see all five Spider-Man cards</strong>, as well as an alternate comic book art style for the titular webslinger himself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering x Spider-Man - First Look at 5 New Cards</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering developer Wizards of the Coast <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-magic-the-gathering-crossover-reveal-card-spoilers">previously told IGN</a> that it wasn't limiting this set to a single comic run, and that's made quite clear with this early look. All five cards are different versions of Spider-Man depicted as legendary creatures: at Uncommon you have Spider-Man Noir and the robotic SP//dr piloted by Peni Parker, at Rare are Spider-Man 2099 and the delightfully goofy Spider-Ham, and finally at Mythic Rare is the man himself, Peter Parker, who flips over to become the Amazing Spider-Man.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That last card is especially interesting as it is double-sided. The front is simply Peter Parker, while the back is his Amazing Spider-Man alter ego, and you have some flexibility in how to cast him. Magic has had what are called "modal double-faced cards" before that allow you to cast either side from your hand, but this is the first I know of that <em>also</em> allows you to pay a cost to flip it while the front side is already in play - in this case, you can play Peter Parker for two mana, and then pay four more on a later turn to have him transform. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do, you get access to his very flavorful ability called web-slinging, which allows you to pay just three mana to cast Legendary spells if you also return a tapped creature to your hand. This card is sure to be a popular leader in Magic's most popular format, Commander, as it will let you cheat all sorts of big and expensive legendary creatures into play far earlier than expected. And because this card will also be legal across Magic's regular competitive formats, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/lci/185/ghalta-stampede-tyrant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">giant dinosaurs</a> and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dsk/120/valgavoth-terror-eater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">terrifying demons</a> alike could be swinging onto the table.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The rest of the cast here is a clear nod to Sony's excellent Into the Spider-Verse animated films, only missing a take on Peter B. Parker and Spider-Gwen to complete the first movie's main cast (though there's plenty of time for those to potentially be revealed themselves before the set launches in September). But before you get too excited, this was almost definitely just a nod to their reveal as part of this year's Comic-Con, as these cards and this set in general are not actually tied to that series in any direct way. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel's Spider-Man x Magic: The Gathering - First Card and Packaging Reveal</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while we may not have a second version of Peter to show here, we do have an alternate art treatment for this one – one that is sure to excite any comic book fans out there. This secondary version shows off what's called the "Iconic Moments" Booster Fun treatment for this set, and all of the cards that use it will feature art from the pages of Spider-Man's adventures. This first one is taken straight from the cover of 1963's The Amazing Spider-Man #1, complete with artist credits for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-marvel-creator-jack-kirby-honored-by-new-york-city-with-two-streets-named-for-him">Jack Kirby</a> and Steve Ditko. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you happen to be in the San Diego area yourself, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/magic.wizards.com/post/3lu6j5n5puv2g" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wizards of the Coast is hosting a Spider-Man event</a> at the Hard Rock Hotel where fans will be able to go hands-on with the set's Welcome Decks – smaller preconstructed decks themed around Spider-man that are meant to be an intro point for new players as they learn the ropes.

<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Camera" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/80a6a2352b266/nintendo-switch-2-camera.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've just heard how around "1 in 3" Switch 2 owners <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/around-1-in-3-switch-2-owners-bought-new-pro-controller-despite-high-price-point-us">bought a new Pro Controller</a>, but how did other accessories like the official camera perform?</p>
<p>Game File has now been able to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/even-85-switch-2-controllers-just">provide some additional information</a>. Speaking to Circana's gaming analyst Mat Piscatella, it was noted how Nintendo's camera had a "mid-single digit percentage" attach rate with Switch 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Switch 2’s $55 official camera had a “mid-single digit percentage” attach rate with the Switch 2, Circana gaming analyst Mat Piscatella told Game File."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This was apparently "in line" with Piscatella expectations, but we don't know yet if it's matched Nintendo's forecast. As mentioned, though, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2">third-party cameras are also compatible</a> with the Switch 2 – so the official one isn't necessarily an essential purchase if you want to play games with this functionality, or participate in GameChat.</p>
<p>Nintendo launches <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a> next week, which adds new minigames utilising features such as the camera as well as mouse mode. If we get an update about the sales figures of Nintendo's camera accessory in this region or elsewhere, or find out more about its performance in general, we'll let you know.</p>

| Releases September 9</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Though Lego DC Arkham Asylum isn't officially categorized as an Advent Calendar, the build is seemingly a great fit for one-piece-per-day setup of the popular holiday countdown calendars. You can build one chunk of the building each day for 24 days. Considering it comes with sprawling collection of 16 Batman heroes and villains as minifigures, you'll get a new character most days, too.</p><p>Here's the full list of minifigures included with Lego DC Batman Arkham Asylum:</p><ul><li>Batman</li><li>Robin</li><li>Batwoman</li><li>Catwoman</li><li>Batwing</li><li>The Joker</li><li>Harley Quinn</li><li>The Riddler</li><li>The Penguin</li><li>Bane</li><li>Mr. Freeze</li><li>Poison Ivy</li><li>Scarecrow</li><li>Killer Croc</li><li>Security Guard (x2)</li></ul><p>Lego's <em>actual </em>Advent Calendars are substantially smaller than this--the 2025 editions retail for $45 and release September 1--so this would be quite the lavish choice for your countdown this year.</p><p>You can, of course, completely ignore the Advent Calendar approach and build the entire set in one weekend. The full three-story asylum is 10.23 x 9.84 x 12.59 inches. If that sounds a bit small based on the piece count, it's because this is more densely packed with a huge emphasis on the rooms inside. Plus, unlike some Lego sets that don't have exterior walls around the sides and back, Arkham Asylum is a complete structure.</p><p>After finishing the build, you can separate the three floors to show off and make changes to the furnished rooms and holding cells. Sections on each floor are designed to be easily removable, too. Prison cell doors can swing open with the press of a button, and you can let the villains decorate their cells with 65 stickers pulled from Batman lore.</p><p>All of the minifigures come wit transparent stands that attach to the building or front yard. The stands are designed to create active poses, as if you paused a movie.</p><p>The build also comes with an Arkham Asylum inmate transport van. In the promotional images, the van is operated by Harley Quinn, who is clearly on the verge of successfully breaking Joker out of the hospital.</p></div>                      </div><h3>San Diego Comic-Con Lego Sets</h3><p>Arkham Asylum is one of several exciting Lego sets making its debut at SDCC. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-game-boy-preorder-nintendo-building-set/1100-6533358/" data-ref-id="1100-6533358">Lego also unveiled its Game Boy building set</a>, a 421-piece replica of the original Nintendo Game Boy.

It doesn't have the most pieces, though. That honor goes to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Heroes-76271/dp/B0CPYQB38F?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Batman: The Animated Series Gotham City</a>, a large piece of 3D wall art featuring the skyline. It retails for the same $300 price as Arkham Asylum, but it has 4,210 pieces. The Arkham Asylum build will likely be more dynamic, though, as these 3D art pieces have high piece counts partly because of all of the tiny bricks that create the backdrops.</p><p>Moving beyond Lego, Batman fans should also check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-knight-trilogy-4k-blu-ray-steelbook-library-collection-amazon-exclusive/1100-6533345/" data-ref-id="1100-6533345">Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Library Edition of The Dark Knight Trilogy</a>. It comes with four steelbook cases, a bunch of collectibles, and metal case to store and display all of it.
