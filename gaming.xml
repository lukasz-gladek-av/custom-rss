			<p>Today, CD PROJEKT has <a href="https://x.com/CDPROJEKTRED_IR/status/1828701181020872768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> its earnings for the first half of 2024 while updating investors on the status of its main projects, chiefly The Witcher 4 (codenamed Polaris).</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD PROJEKT, said:</p>
<p><em>Work on Polaris (The Witcher 4) is progressing – its development team is nearing a major milestone which will mark the end of the preproduction phase. The first half of the year was also a busy period for our Boston studio, which is laying the groundwork for Project Orion – a new game set in the Cyberpunk universe.</em></p>
<p>The Witcher 4 will enter production soon, then, and it will do so with 410 active developers, as shown in the latest infographics. CD PROJEKT as a whole gained nine employees in total between April and the end of July, with three additional developers on Polaris, four on Orion (the sequel of Cyberpunk 2077), three on Sirius (the rebooted multiplayer The Witcher spin-off in development at Molasses Flood).</p>
<p>The headcount on Project Hadar (a secret brand new IP) remains at 20, while three more developers are working on shared services across all projects, such as AI, localization, Quality Assurance, etc. Lastly, only eight developers have been assigned to other projects, down from twelve in April.</p>
<p>CD PROJEKT also commented on the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of the REDkit for The Witcher 3. Nowakowski stated:</p>
<p><em>It's been several months since our dev tools were released to gamers, and there’s already a slew of interesting modding projects out there. We are happy to see the engagement of the gaming community, which is eager to share its ideas, bringing new strength to The Witcher 3 – a game set to celebrate its 10th anniversary next year.</em></p>
<p>The Polish company's financial results are quite positive. Its net profit (170 million in local currency, which translates to around $44 million) outperformed the comparative period by nearly 90%. CFO Piotr Nielubowicz also said:</p>
<p><em>In H1 2024 we also noted an increase in our financial reserves. Despite having paid out almost 100 million PLN in a dividend, and allocating over 150 million PLN to new projects, our reserves nevertheless grew by more than 55 million PLN.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>There's no release date for The Witcher 4 yet, but given the triple-A ambition, it's easy to imagine at least two if not three years of production. As such, the game could launch between late 2026 and 2027.</p>

I came away really enthralled by its world and how it seems to be toying with the barriers of fantasy and reality. I was less thrilled with how Atlus <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394">attempted to distance its in-universe political drama from reality</a></span>, but I’m still intrigued by what the game itself seems to be saying. I saw a lot of the game in those four hours, and I think I’m still waiting to find the flair in its turn-based combat, which felt like it was missing some of the bells and whistles that make games like <em>Persona </em>feel more complex than just hitting elemental weaknesses. But despite any lingering concerns, I still experienced a handful of standout moments in which I could feel <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> worming its way into my brain, sparking my curiosity, and alleviating some of the problems I’ve had with some of Atlus’ previous games. Here are a few moments from my play time that have stuck with me.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-recommend-id="image://0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl stands next to the rest of the party. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Strohl stands next to the rest of the party. " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-recommend-id="image://0e169e7ed9533dc42ec8714a7334c789" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Strohl stands next to the rest of the party. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Much of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s structure seems evocative of the modern <em>Persona </em>games. This includes the party’s journey, with each member going through an “awakening,” similar to how Joker and the rest of the Phantom Thieves do when they acquire supernatural powers. In <em>Metaphor</em>, these awakenings happen when they gain their Archetype ability, a transformation that essentially functions as a malleable job system, giving characters different powers and roles in combat.</p><p>These awakenings occur during dramatic, character-defining moments, and the scenes are pretty hardcore. The party members rip their own hearts out and shout into them like a megaphone. We saw two of these during the demo, including Strohl’s, and it was easily one of the best moments of those four hours. Strohl is a warrior from a noble family, and without getting into too many spoilers, he’s a bit downtrodden about the state of things. When he finally awakens, he rips his heart out and then shouts into it as he rallies a crowd. It’s slightly derivative of <em>Persona</em>, sure, but it’s also fucking metal. I was immediately energized by the scene and am stoked to see the game riff on this further as we meet new party members. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-recommend-id="image://aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-recommend-id="image://aaf5e4f3a2803102a31dfff5542e82f0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist stares at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most frustrating things about <em>Persona </em>games is that if your protagonist falls in combat, that’s all she wrote. It means keeping your main character alive and well is a core part of your strategy, even in a game with instakill spells that don’t discriminate. I had completely forgotten about this when I started playing <em>Metaphor</em> and got real nervous when a boss started focusing all their resources on my hero and draining his health. But much to my delight, the battle continued after he fell to the ground. I was able to revive him with some items and keep the fight going, eventually overcoming my foe and continuing my journey. This has always been one of my least favorite restrictions <em>Persona </em>has arbitrarily enforced over the years, and I was glad to see <em>Metaphor</em> buck the trend.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-recommend-id="image://370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-recommend-id="image://370549e37c63e6817b9cc0eb8738399a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Metaphor Party menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Atlus games are well-regarded for their stunning menu design. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is no exception, as pausing the game opens up a delight for the eyes. From the gorgeous illustrations of its characters to the ways its text boxes resemble the worn pages of a storybook, <em>Metaphor </em>makes flipping through the menu feel tactile, like turning pages in a long-forgotten tome and uncovering its secrets.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-recommend-id="image://e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-recommend-id="image://e6693ea589bb26b10a04ec74a29f458d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist attacks an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Turn-based RPGs are notorious for grind. Atlus has been gradually introducing ways to mitigate it with mechanics like <em>Persona 5</em> <em>Royal</em>’s Instakill stealth maneuver that allows you to defeat low-level enemies without having to waste your time on the whole turn-based song and dance. <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>takes this a step further and allows you to attack overworld enemies in real time. Typically this allows you a preemptive strike advantage, but if you can overpower an enemy with these attacks, you can circumvent fights entirely and still reap the rewards. It’s a satisfying, expedient way to get through something often synonymous with tedium.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-recommend-id="image://796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-recommend-id="image://796c19ff3c1e64e7f3f3ffbcf102c21c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist reads a book in Akademia." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The moment <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> clicked with me was when I sat with Gallica, my fairy companion, as we thought back on the early days of our adventure. I opened a book the protagonist had been carrying around for the whole game and it described a “fantasy” universe that sounds a lot like ours. The book illustrates a world full of cityscapes and devoid of the divides and otherings of <em>Metaphor</em>’s universe. That’s obviously an idealized vision of the real world, but I was hooked when I realized Atlus’ fantasy world might have something interesting to say about ours. That curiosity only grew when I stumbled upon a small detail in a library…<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-recommend-id="image://85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-recommend-id="image://85e4c83734cffe9a83e0cf2365b8babb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1777" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks down at something." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When I started the demo, <em>Metaphor</em> asked me to enter my name. No, not the protagonist, but myself as the entity that would guide the hero through the world. That was an interesting request on its face, but it became more compelling when I visited Akademia, the Velvet Room-esque space in which I would learn more about the world and my character’s Archetypes. Books were scattered around the room, and there was one that was mostly illegible to my character, with the exception of my name. The implication that I, the player, exist in this world already has my mind racing with all the possibilities of where this story could go. <em>Metaphor </em>is clearly playing with the divides between fantasy and reality, and that is almost more compelling to me than its A plot of elections and power struggles. I can’t wait to see where this thread takes me.<br></p><hr><p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on October 11. That’s coming up pretty soon, but if you’re already feeling the Atlus itch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-answer-preview-aigis-price-dlc-1851622486"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>’s <em>The Answer </em>DLC</a></span> is coming up on September 10.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether you're looking to target the minimum specs or hoping to hit the recommended ones, you won't need a cutting-edge machine to play this year's CoD game--in fact, you're not being asked for anything more than with 2023's Modern Warfare 3.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of minimum specs, the game only calls for an Intel Core i5-6600 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400, 8GB of RAM, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 960/1650 or AMD Radeon RX 470. These are years-old GPUs, so if you're someone who routinely plays PC games, it's not a leap to assume you'll check these boxes. The most stringent requirement for some might be the need to have an SSD, where the game will take up 149GB at launch--though you'll only need 78GB free if you already have CoD HQ and Warzone installed.</p><p dir="ltr">On the recommended-specs side, the storage requirements remain the same, but the CPUs called for move up to an i7-6700K or Ryzen 5 1600X paired with 16GB of RAM. The GPUs still aren't the most recent set, as Activision calls for a GTX 1080Ti/RTX 3060, RX 6600XT, or Intel Arc A770.</p><p dir="ltr">Of note, Activision doesn't specify exactly what type of experience you'll get at these various hardware levels--if you're intent on running Black Ops 6 at 4K, max settings, and a high frame rate, you'll undoubtedly need to go well beyond what's outlined above. We may still get a Competitive/Ultra 4K set of specs, as we did last year; in that case, Modern Warfare 3 called for an RTX 3080/4070 or RX 6800XT, which is much more recent hardware. More details may come as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-watch-call-of-duty-next-and-what-to-expect-for-black-ops-6-multiplayer-zombies-and-more/1100-6526113/" data-ref-id="1100-6526113">Call of Duty: Next event</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever your rig might be equipped with, you'll soon have a chance to try the game out, as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">Black Ops 6 beta</a> is right around the corner.

            <p>As another month rolls around and the nights start creeping ever so slightly in, Sony has revealed its monthly PlayStation Plus games for September.</p>
<p>From 3rd September, all PS Plus members will be able to get their hands on the following titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quidditch Champions (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>MLB The Show 24 (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Little Nightmares 2 (PS4, PS5)</li>

<p>In Quidditch Champions, as you may have surmised, players will be able to hop onto a broom and take to the skies to play a match or two with their friends and family (or mortal enemies, whatever works for you). MLB The Show 24 is another sports-based game, and will allow players the opportunity to live out any unrealised baseball dreams they may have.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-ii">Little Nightmares 2</a> pivots away from the sports theme, and instead dishes up a healthy serving of horror.</p>
<p>"While my every instinct is to tell you that Little Nightmares 2 is a frustrating encounter that's likely better watched than played, I can't help but admit I love it - fervently and ferociously - even if it was such an unmitigated ballache to play to completion," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-2-review-a-brilliantly-horrifying-often-infuriating-return">Little Nightmares 2 review from 2021</a>.</p>

            <p>
A little over a week ahead of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>'s 9th September arrival on PC and consoles, developer Saber Interactive has whipped the cover off its post-launch roadmap, promising the likes of new missions, new modes, and new enemies, all for free.
</p>
<p>
Space Marine 2 - which charts the continuing adventures of Ultramarines Space Marine Lieutenant Titus - was announced back in 2021, but following a substantial <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-delayed-into-the-second-half-of-next-year">delay</a> and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-developer-battling-full-game-leak-months-before-launch">unfortunate leak</a>, it's finally almost upon us and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-delivers-maximum-warhammer-to-glorious-effect">looking very promising indeed</a>.
</p>
<p>
So if Saber can stick the landing, there should be plenty of interest in what's coming to Space Marine 2 after launch, which starts with a free "Season 1" update sometime this September, bringing the Battle Barge Sparring Arena, private PvE lobbies, and ultra wide support.
</p>

<p>
Things get a little more exciting once Season 2 rolls around at some point before the end of the year, with Saber's roadmap promising new PvE missions, a new enemy, the new Neo-Volkite pistol, and a new Lethal difficulty setting for the masochists in the house.
</p>
<p>
Space Marine's next free update - unsurprisingly titled Season 3 - won't arrive until 2025, but it looks like a pretty substantial one, introducing a new PvE mission, a new PvP game mode and new PvP arenas, plus PvE Prestige ranks, and the Battle Barge expansion. Saber's current roadmap then wraps up by introducing a horde mode, another new enemy, and a new weapon as part of a Season 4.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
And for owners of the Space Marine 2 Season Pass - which is included in the Gold and Ultra editions of the game - each new season will be accompanied by a host of new cosmetics packs, so you can fancy yourself up a bit while taking on the Tyranids and the forces of Chaos.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series /S, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183900/Warhammer_40000_Space_Marine_2/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Epic Games Store</a>) when it releases on 9th September.

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/4572929880423149849" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>, 11 bit says that while mod support has been talked about in the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>community "ever since the launch of the first&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>", that game's engine limitations prevented official modding support from being introduced.</p>
<p>However, since&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is being built on Unreal Engine, "things are totally different" this time around, and official modding support will be available for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september">arrives in September</a>.</p>

<p>11 bit says you'll be able to make cities that are "ancient, cosmic, or differentiated in thousands of other ways from the original frosty-apocalypse setting", so if you've ever wanted to create a Lovecraftian city builder, it looks like your time has come.</p>
<p>At first, the tool will be released in beta, but it will include "most of its functionalities" at launch. 11 bit then plans to iterate on the tool based on community feedback.</p>
<p>However, before it's launched, 11 bit says it will hold a closed beta prior to&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s release in order to test FrostKit out "with selected members of the modding community". It's not yet clear how - or, indeed, whether - you can apply to be one of those members.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 20th.

However, the latest discovery blows the rest out of the water. Here is the full translation, per Reddit:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Three there were who made the journey, without whose knowledge there is no returning.

The three represent the different sides of the force: the Son is the dark, the Daughter the light, and the Father represents the balance between both. Each also mirrors characters throughout <em>Star Wars</em> canon, with many seeing Anakin as the Father, Ahsoka as the Daughter, and perhaps Baylan as the Son following the conclusion of season one. The pathway connecting near to far is clearly the Pathway to Peridea so it seems that season two of Ahsoka will delve even further into the attempts of the cast to find that long lost route to another galaxy. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ahsokaofficial/status/1745147241579303084&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ahsokaofficial/status/1745147241579303084" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concept art</a></span> for the second season revealed Ahsoka and Sabine standing atop the Mortis statues that Baylan discovers at the end of season one, hinting that the two will follow after Baylan on the journey laid out in the cryptic message, though the “no returning” bit could mean someone might lose their life on the trip—or be stranded there forever. But as there is currently no release date for <em>Ahsoka </em>season 2, fans will have to wait a little longer to find out what is in store.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-reveals-aggressive-multiplatform-target-plans-with-catchy-new-name/1100-6523394/" data-ref-id="1100-6523394">Square Enix revealed a new aggressive multiplatform plan going forward</a> in May. "So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles," the developer said. "So with Final Fantasy XIV as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox."</p><p dir="ltr">Other mainline Fantasy Fantasy games have launched exclusively on PS5. For example, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth came out earlier this year and is still only available on Sony's system. Meanwhile, Final Fantasy XVI released last year on PS5 but will arrive on PC on September 17.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on the MMO, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-a-new-world/1900-6418254/" data-ref-id="1900-6418254">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail review</a>.</p>

            <p>Demonschool - the upcoming RPG inspired by Persona and Italian horror films - has been delayed.</p>
<p>The game was initially meant to release next month, on 13th September. However, after careful consideration, the team has decided to postpone the launch to ensure it reaches a higher standard.</p>
<p>"You never want to delay a game, but Demonschool means a lot to us. We've really put everything we have into this project, and as we got closer to release we realised that meeting the 13th September deadline would necessarily mean a game with less content than we originally envisioned," developer Necrosoft Games said today.</p>

<p>It continued to state the team could have shipped the game in September as originally planned, or delay it a touch to "allow us to manifest our bigger dreams into reality". It chose the latter.</p>
<p>"Realistically, the player would never have known. It still would've been a finished product. But we would have known that the game could have been more, and that's the game we want to share," it wrote, adding Demonschool's publisher Ysbryd had given everyone involved the flexibility to do this.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while work on Demonschool continues behind the scenes, Necrosoft Games will also be releasing some "short dev diaries" to keep everyone up to speed on what it is doing.</p>
<p>"We're sorry for those who are eagerly awaiting the game, but are very hopeful that all the extra content will be worth the wait," Necrosoft Games closed. "2024 has been a very trying year for the team, so we appreciate your understanding."</p>
<p>Demonschool is now targeting a release during the first quarter of 2025.</p>

<p>Our Ed gave the demo for Demonschool a whirl earlier this year, calling it a mix of Persona meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer.</p>
<p>"It's playful, funny, nostalgic, and spooky in equal measure and I can't wait for the full release," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/demonschool-is-persona-meets-buffy-and-i-love-its-90s-vibes">Demonschool Wishlisted feature from June</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After a long period of dormancy, the Legacy of Kain franchise is poised to make a return as a prequel graphic novel.</p>
<p>This graphic novel is known as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise, and earlier this week Crystal Dynamics revealed the project had surpassed $1m in Kickstarter funding.</p>
<p>"This is more than just a milestone - it's proof of the power of this community," Crystal Dynamics celebrated on social media platform X. "We're beyond grateful. Let's keep the momentum going!"</p>

<p>This particular Legacy of Kain project was first announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-is-making-a-comeback-but-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/1100-6524621/">several months ago</a>, and promises readers the chance to "discover an untold tale", as the graphic novel bridges the gaps between Blood Omen and Soul Reaver.</p>
<p>"Readers will discover Raziel's origins as a human child, the events that led him to join the Sarafan, and the mysterious emergence of his wings," reads the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-prequel-graphic-novel?ref=dtv72k">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - The Dead Shall Rise Kickstarter page</a>.</p>
<p>"The graphic novel offers fresh insights into the lore, revisiting iconic moments and characters like Kain, Moebius, and Raziel's brothers, while introducing new faces such as Elaleth, whose connections to Raziel, Kain, and the Hylden bring unexpected twists to the tale."</p>
<p>If you are interested in backing the project, there is still time. The Kickstarter will end in a little over two weeks from the time of writing.</p> <div>

<p>Fans have been hopeful for a series remaster of sorts following some perhaps unintentional teases from the developer in recent months.</p>
<p>Along with the upcoming re-release of both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/blood-omen-legacy-kain">Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</a> and Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-legacy-of-kain-games-will-be-re-released-for-evercade-next-month">Evercade retro handheld console</a>, logos for an unannounced "Legacy of Kain: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a> 1 &amp; 2 Remastered" were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remaster-hints-surface-at-comic-con">included on display plaques accompanying statues of game characters Kain and Raziel</a> during a Comic-Con event held in San Diego earlier this year.</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Crystal Dynamics sent out a survey asking if recipients would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-wants-your-thoughts-on-legacy-of-kain">interested in seeing the Legacy of Kain series make a comeback</a>. This survey followed an announcement from the developer that it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crystal-dynamics-now-has-control-of-tomb-raider-following-square-enix-sale">regained "control" of its Legacy of Kain series</a>, as well as that of the Tomb Raider IP, following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix's sale of its Western studios</a> (which included Crystal Dynamics) to Embracer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
