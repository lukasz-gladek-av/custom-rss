            <p>While it hasn't taken as commanding a stranglehold over the world's collective consciousness as its debut series did, the second helping of Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> is succeeding in helping drive a number of extra Steam players back to the wasteland. That said, a number of said wastelands being heavily discounted as part of the platform's recently concluded winter sale likely hasn't hindered those efforts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fallout-season-2-has-doubled-the-number-of-people-playing-the-fallout-games-on-steam/">Psycho Consuming Gamer</a>, SteamDB's charts since the episodes of the show started to drop on December 16th feature lines going up. Getting into <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/377160/charts/#3y">specifics</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s gone from oscillating around the 20,000 players mark to hitting a peak of 44,000 players on January 4th, following a gradual rise over the festive period. So, that number's effectively doubled, though it's comfortably dwarfed by the mammoth 187,000 peak the game hit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">thanks to the show's first series</a> back in April 2024.</p>
<p>Beavis and Butthead pairing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> have also seen bumps in the same timespan. The former's naturally prospered more, rising from the region of 8,000 to a peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22380/charts/#3y">just over 19,000</a> the same day Fallout 4 had its biggest recent spike. Fallout 3's gone from averaging around 100 players to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/22300/charts/#3y">just under 200</a> at its version of this peak.</p>
<p>Then, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, the game Bethesda clearly pushed to be the intended main beneficiary of any second series player bump, with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/take-a-tour-of-fallout-76s-burning-springs-with-our-recently-defrosted-ohioan-historian">Goggins ghoul-toting Burning Springs expansion</a> dropping just before the show. The multiplayerpocalyspse's numbers jumped from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1151340/charts/#3y">around 10,000 to around 20,000</a> with Burning Springs' release in early December, and have since peaked at just under 30,000. For context, it hit a peak of 73,000 players with the show's first season. These latest New Vegas and Fallout 3 numbers are similarly dwarfed by their season one marks.</p><p>That's not too suprising. The first series of the Fallout show had that debut novelty to it and dropped at a time of year when everyone wasn't busy with the holidays and new year celebrations. That also usually means plenty of free time, something Amazon are almost certainly banking on in terms of watch numbers.</p>
<p>What's not clear is the extent to which the games being discounted in Steam's wallet-zapping winter sale helped, but for context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> Special Edition's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/489830/charts/#1y">player count</a> has remained relatively close to the marks in the region of 30,000 to 40,000 players it was hitting prior to December 16th - its highest mark over the festive period was just over 46,000 players.</p>
<p>With the fourth episode of Fallout season two set to drop today, January 7th, we'll have to see if the lines continue to go up as things build up to the series finale in early February.</p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded developer 1047 Games has shared some words regarding how its rereleased and repackaged game is doing over on Valve's PC platform, stating: "Steam Charts don't measure fun."</p>
<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded started life as Splitgate 2. However, Splitgate 2 as it was failed to hit the mark, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">1047 Games took the game back to beta in July of last year</a>, which resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio. In November, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-take-two-coming-next-month-as-1047-games-announces-relaunch-for-its-free-to-play-shooter">Splitgate 2 would relaunch in December</a>. A new name - Splitgate Arena Reloaded - was then revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-returning-to-beta-splitgate-2-is-coming-back-with-a-new-name">along with a relaunch date of 17th December</a>.</p>

<p>Since that relaunch less than a month ago, many picked up that Splitgate Arena Reloaded still wasn't bringing in big numbers over on Steam. As our Connor reported just this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-a-controversial-marketing-campaign-splitgate-2-fails-to-find-an-audience-despite-two-official-launches">the relaunch saw an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297</a> on the PC platform, before that number dropped down to a relatively stable concurrent count of around 1,000 players in more recent days. It is unclear what its console player base is.</p>
<p>1047 Games has now addressed these Steam figures, saying you can't simply equate player numbers on a single platform with the amount of fun that is being had. "They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment," the Splitgate Arena Reloaded team said.</p>
<p>"They don't show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don't capture the community that's actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale)."</p>
<p>Continuing, the developer said: "Over the past six months, we rebuilt Splitgate from the ground up because we believe in the game, our team, and our community. The 1047 team remains committed to delivering the best version of Splitgate possible."</p><p>It went on to thank Splitgate's community of players for their passion and feedback, before closing with an encouragement for others to give the game a go and "form your own opinion" on the relaunch. "To everyone who hasn't played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay's the best it's ever been... A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it."</p>

<p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded is hosting a selection of competitive events in an effort to drum up interest. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>
<p>Will this second go at things still yet be the time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">Splitgate makes FPS great again</a>? We will see.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/07/duel-corp-early-access-release-date-has-been-confirmed-for-january-21st/</link>
            <guid>1399105</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Dreameffect Entertainment has confirmed that its third person openworld soulslike Duel Corp. will be launching into early access on January 21st. Duel Corp. is described as having an MMO feel as you will be able to meet other players in the world, and tackle the game in co-op with up to three other players too. There is no linear story path with players working out what has happened by interacting with the various factions that populate Duel Corp’s world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Early Access Release Announcement #shorts" width="563" height="1000" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4iESGgcI-qY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the world of Duel Corp everyone has been cursed with darkened eyes which has also caused everyone to be immortal. This curse has also raised all of the dead that are a danger to the living. The factions in this world have been borne out of the fallout from the curse, with each faction having its own theories and ways of coping with the new reality. In this world, players will have access to an unrestricted class system so different builds can be experimented with to suit different playstyles. The world of Duel Corp will react to player actions. For example, destroying a caravan will mean a village does not get vital resources. This can be used to cause friction between different factions, or weaken the village so you can take it over yourself. It is not just villages that can be taken over, with cities ripe for conquering. There are co-op quests to take part in as well as 1v1 and 2v2 PvP encounters. Duel Corp also contains procedurally generated encounters that can have unique items and NPCs to encounter.</p>
<p>Duel Corp will be launched with a 20% discount, priced at $19.99.</p>

			<p>A new rumor suggests <strong>Microsoft</strong> is preparing to use its <strong>layoff axe</strong> once again, for the <strong>fourth consecutive January</strong>, cutting between 11 and 22 thousand jobs across various divisions (including <strong>Xbox</strong>) because of the <strong>rising costs of AI investment</strong>. If the figures were confirmed, it would be the biggest layoff round yet.</p>



<p>The rumor <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/news/microsoft-msft-eyes-major-january-layoffs-as-ai-costs-rise" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes from TipRanks</a>, which adds that the layoffs are expected to fall upon employees at some point <strong>in the third week of January</strong>. According to workers' anonymous sources, even the <strong>Azure</strong> cloud team could be affected.</p>



<p>Analyst projections had previously suggested that Microsoft may need to cut at least 10,000 employees annually just to offset increased capital depreciation costs from data center expansion. Looking back over the past few years, the current <strong>fourth-largest company in the world by market capitalization</strong> reduced its workforce by 5% in <strong>2023</strong>, primarily as part of a resizing effort following the pandemic's mass hiring spree. That year in January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-slashing-10k-jobs-bethesda-the-coaltion-343-industries-affected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">started with 10,000 jobs lost</a>, when the gaming teams affected were <strong>Bethesda</strong>, <strong>The Coalition</strong> (developers of <strong>Gears of War</strong>), and <strong>343 Industries</strong> (developers of the <strong>Halo </strong>series). </p>



<p>In January <strong>2024</strong>, gaming really took the brunt of the hit as Microsoft 'only' <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cut <strong>1,900 employees</strong></a>, around 1% of its workforce. It happened just three months after the finalization of the acquisition of <strong>Activision Blizzard</strong>, which cost <strong>$75.4 billion</strong> when all was said and done. Activision Blizzard was indeed the most affected studio, with the new survival game franchise codenamed <strong>Odyssey</strong> canceled as a result, but other teams at Xbox and Bethesda also suffered cuts. The worst was yet to come for gaming, though: <strong>Arkane Austin</strong> (<strong>Prey</strong>, <strong>Redfall</strong>), <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong> (<strong>The Evil Within</strong>, <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>, <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>), <strong>Alpha Dog Games</strong>, and <strong>Roundhouse Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were all abruptly shut down in May 2024</a>. Later that year, around 1,000 employees were removed from the HoloLens and Azure cloud teams, and another 650 from corporate and support divisions, but it was still a relatively quiet year compared to the other two for Microsoft as a whole.</p>



<p><span><strong>2025</strong>&nbsp;was&nbsp;<strong>by far the worst</strong>, and it once again began with a January cut of slightly less than 1% of Microsoft's employees based on performance.</span> That was just the start: 3% of the workforce was cut in May, and an even heavier blow landed in July, when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed another 4% of its employees</a>, shutting down <strong>The Initiative</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">and its </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark reboot</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"> project</a>) and cutting a lot of employees at <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> (leading to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a>) and Rare (<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">axing </a><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a></strong>). <strong>Turn 10 Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was hit hard</a>, too, essentially becoming a support studio for the <strong>Forza Horizon</strong> franchise following a few unsuccessful <strong>Forza Motorsport</strong> releases.</p>



<p>Following that round, a report from the inside <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft was 'trying their damndest' to <strong>replace human jobs with AI agents</strong>. A couple of days later, another report <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned</a> that the layoff rounds were fundamentally needed <strong>to fund increased spending in AI infrastructure</strong>, and that seems to be the case even with the new round that might be announced soon.</p>



<p>The TipRanks report also reveals that Microsoft plans to enforce stricter office policies starting from February 23, 2026. Employees residing within 50 miles of an office will be required to work on-site for at least three days per week. Internally, some people view this new rule as a subtle way to encourage even more people to leave.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Embark Studios' founder Patrick Soderlund has stated that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, a game initially meant to release as a free-to-play title, launched as a $40 premium price point in part due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s approach.</p>
<p>Speaking to Gamesbeat, Soderlund stated: "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit'</p>
<p>Soderlund continued: "We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."</p>

</figure>
<p>A further reason why the $40 price point was decided was a desire to sell the game without its cost acting as an "offender" to anyone, given that Arc Raiders is a purely multiplayer game without a campaign. Soderlund remarked: "We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."</p><p>It appears to have been the correct decision. According to analyst estimates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-12-million-sales">Arc Raiders recently passed the 12m sales milestone</a>, bringing in over $350m in revenue. It also was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">one of Steam's best selling games over the Christmas period</a>, thanks in part to a well-timed discount as well as an ongoing wave of positive word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>Part of this word of mouth surrounds the interesting social dynamics at play in Arc Raiders, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-are-arc-raiders-players-so-averse-to-pvp-to-find-out-we-spoke-to-a-sociologist">with a significant portion of the community opting out of PvP gameplay where they can</a>. This, supported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-aggression-matchmaking-is-now-a-thing-in-arc-raiders">by matchmaking that takes aggressiveness into account</a>, has resulted in a surprisingly friendly extraction shooter for many players.</p>

                <p>This past weekend has seen a new spate of Pokémon TCG-related crimes, with over $300,000 worth of rare cards stolen in two seperate incidents in Southern California. In one, thieves broke into a trading card store and smashed display cases, while a second incident saw a collector held up at gunpoint for a briefcase of rare cards.</p><p>Trading card store Simi Sportscards in the Simi Valley was the target of a break-in early Sunday morning, <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/thieves-target-valuable-trading-cards-in-brazen-southern-california-heist/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">KTLA reports</a>, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se-_LQPR98Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CCTV footage</a> showing a group of at least five thieves smashing display cases to steal the cards inside. Store owner Jake Miller says the group stole rare sports trading cards and valuable Pokémon TCG cards after sawing through the front door. He estimates the break-in will cost the store over $50,000 in repairs, lost merchandise, and security upgrades.</p>

            <guid>1399084</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Stranger Things recently wrapped after almost a decade of being on the air. On New Year’s Day, the final episode, with a whopping two-hour runtime, aired on Netflix and broke the hearts of millions of fans worldwide. Whether you loved it or hated it, the ultimate episode wrapped up almost every core story put forward by the writers over the last ten years.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, the Duffer brothers, the creators of Stranger Things, revealed what Dungeons &amp; Dragons-themed game inspired the <strong>ending battle </strong>against the Mind Flayer and Vecna in Stranger Things.</p>







<h2 id="h-that-s-how-you-take-down-these-monsters">‘That’s How You Take Down These Monsters’</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-finale-is-eleven-alive-vecna-killed-rock-spinoff-1236621528/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Ross and Matt Duffer, the creators and directive minds behind Stranger Things, offered up all kinds of information about the show, how it wrapped, and what it took to get to this point.</p>



<p>Midway through the interview, the talk turned to the final battle between Vecna, the physical manifestation of the Mind Flayer, and the good guys from Hawkins. It was a phenomenal sequence that showed how these unlikely heroes were able to get the upper hand on a behemoth of an opponent like the Mind Flayer.</p>



<p>Matt Duffer explained what inspired the final battle:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We were thinking about D&amp;D, and I was playing&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;at the time, and&nbsp;we felt it was very important that the only way for them to defeat it was for the entire party to work together. Everyone had fully realized — either through self-acceptance or they’ve resolved all their various issues — moving into that final battle, they’re absolutely primed. </p>



<p>They’re the ultimate team, and it’s the party working all together to defeat this thing. And they each have their own individual skills, right? And that’s where I go back to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and something like&nbsp;Baldur’s Gate. Because that’s how you take down these monsters that seem otherwise unstoppable. Lots of video game references were applied to that final battle.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Baldur’s Gate 3 and Stranger Things are inherently linked to the same Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The core exception is that Baldur’s Gate 3 remains more aligned with the source material, while Stranger Things is more <strong>inspired by </strong>it and uses references in an alternate way.</p>



<p>For instance, the young heroes in Stranger Things name the series’ Big Bad the ‘Mind Flayer’, flanked by ‘Vecna’, but that’s not their true identity; it’s just what the D&amp;D-loving kids refer to them as based on their attributes and make-up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Detroit: Become Human is one of the best story-driven adventure titles ever made. It was pieced together by Quantic Dream and released way back in 2018, emerging on Steam as a port in 2020. The game tells the story of a race of androids breaking free from their programming and conditioning to rise against their human creators and oppressors.</p>



<p>In the last two weeks, Detroit: Become Human has established itself as a best-selling game on Steam, becoming the second-most bought title on the platform behind ARC Raiders and shifting almost (an estimated) <strong>one million copies</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-is-detroit-become-human-surging-on-steam">Why is Detroit: Become Human Surging on Steam?</h2>



<p>A recent report from Alinea Analytics revealed that Steam generated substantial revenue in December 2025. The Valve-backed storefront generated a whopping $1.6 billion, a year-over-year increase of more than 22%. The growth was elevated by games like ARC Raiders being released and selling extremely well in a short period.</p>



<p>One unexpected title to storm up the charts was 2018’s Detroit: Become Human, which Alinea estimates sold approximately 993,000 copies from December 21 to January 5. That’s almost <strong>one million sales</strong> for a game that was released nearly eight years ago.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-steam-games-that-sold-the-most" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report from Alinea</a>, the staggering growth was spurred by the game having a deep discount – the steepest discount the title has ever seen on the platform. It crashed down from $40 to just $4, representing a fair amount of bang for the average gamer’s buck.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was only topped by ARC Raiders, which sold around 1.2 million copies on Steam in the same timeframe.</p>



<p>The likes of PEAK, Battlefield 6, and R.E.P.O. also claimed spots in the best-seller charts on Steam.</p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human is a phenomenal and emotional game that is totally open-ended. It mirrors titles like Beyond: Two Souls, Heavy Rain, and Until Dawn, giving players full control over every action their characters make, allowing them to influence the direction of a story that has multiple endings and branching concepts.</p>



<p>The sales figures also pushed Detroit: Become Human to an all-time high peak player count of 25,615 users on January 4.</p>

<p>How will it hold up on Switch 2?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> arrives on the Switch 2 and multiple other platforms next month, and ahead of the anticipated release, new footage has surfaced at CES 2026 this week.</p>
<p>During Nvidia's PC showcase of the title featuring path tracing and DLSS 4 with multi frame generation, a new setting in the series has reportedly been revealed. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/resident-evil-requiems-nvidia-trailer-includes-a-big-tease-at-a-new-environment/">highlighted by VGC</a>, it's a glimpse at a "new city environment" and what's believed to be the fictional location Wrenwood, where the game unfolds.</p>
<p>What's so unique here is it's a big contrast to what we're used to seeing in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> series. Instead of chaos and zombies in every direction, as you can see, it's actually a lively place, with humans and vehicles making their way through the streets. Of course, we don't know for sure how much activity will take place here, but it's an exciting glimpse!</p>
<figure data-uuid="71948ed41df8d"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/71948ed41df8d/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom, Nvidia</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the source further notes, <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Resident Evil enthusiast Dusk Golem</a> (who has a history covering Capcom-related rumours) has previously mentioned how Requiem could contain some "big open levels". It follows the news last month that the legend and video game icon <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/leon-kennedy-is-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem">Leon Kennedy would be returning</a> in the latest outing. You can check out Nvidia's full clip above, which shows the new protagonist and FBI intelligence analyst Grace Ashcroft walking around the city.</p>
<p>As for the game's performance and visuals on the Switch 2, Nintendo Life contributor Lowell Bell went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-resident-evil-requiem-switch-2-footage-a-surprisingly-tense-port">hands on with the handheld build at the Tokyo Game Show</a> in 2025 - mentioning at the time how this version still "looked amazing" (even though there was a "visual downgrade") and didn't notice any "dropped frames". So, hopefully, the final build for Switch 2 launches in a good state when this title arrives on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Promotes Strange Resident Evil Rip-off Named ‘Ebola Village’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-promote-resident-evil-rip-off-ebola-village/</link>
            <guid>1399069</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official PlayStation YouTube channel, gamers get a first-hand glimpse at ‘Ebola Village’, an upcoming first-person horror shooter coming January 23rd to PlayStation 5 and <strong>PlayStation 4</strong>. The title is the first bizarre note, and it only gets worse from there.</p>



<p>Fans were quick to point out the gen-AI cover for the video, the stark similarities to Resident Evil (right down to the game’s title font), and the low-quality make-up of the gameplay, which looks years out of date.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Ebola Village came out on PC several months ago. What’s even more perplexing is that this is the latest in a line of similar titles, none of which have ever managed to gain any traction.</p>











<p>The comments under the recent trailer upload for Ebola Village are immensely negative and accurately representative of the <strong>confusion </strong>PlayStation fans have about this game.</p>



<p>One wrote, ‘We got Resident Evil at home,’ playing on a classic meme, while another declared, ‘Official PlayStation account advertising a genuine ripoff shovelware game might be a new low.’</p>



<p>Here’s the full trailer, in case you want to see the content for yourself:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ebola Village - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HRM0AdPcs3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The trailer showcases a few sequences that closely mirror content seen across the Resident Evil franchise in the last two decades or so. For instance, the player character being chased by a deranged villager wielding a chainsaw, which is instantly reminiscent of 2004’s Resident Evil 4.</p>



<p>Everything from the animations to the visuals screams ‘low budget’, and while that’s not normally a problem (we love indie games here), the subject matter of Ebola Village is much more than just ‘inspired’ by games like Resident Evil. In the comments under the video, gamers were quick to parody the title:</p>



<ul>
<li>‘What’s next, COVID City?’</li>



<li>‘Tuberculosis Town next’</li>



<li>‘From the makers of Coronaland and SARSville comes a terrifying new chapter’</li>
</ul>



<p>Ebola Village will be released digitally on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on January 23, and perhaps it’ll be worth playing to see how it shapes up after all. On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306030/EBOLA_VILLAGE/?curator_clanid=33714941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, the game somehow managed to scrape a ‘Very Positive’ rating from 319 reviews, at the time of writing.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/slasher-retires-cod-esports-not-fun-anymore/</link>
            <guid>1399066</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Austin ‘SlasheR’ Liddicoat has officially stepped back from competing in the Call of Duty League. This revelation comes after the 31-year-old secured multiple Major wins and a world championship title over a career spanning more than a decade. The veteran player made the announcement a few weeks into the 2026 CDL season, stepping down from the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>



<p>In a recent stream, SlasheR went deep into why he retired, revealing that the competitive scene just wasn’t fun anymore. He stressed that the ‘new age’ competitors don’t have the same mindset, and he’s fed up with playing for the sake of playing.</p>







<h2 id="h-slasher-leaves-a-phenomenal-legacy">SlasheR Leaves a Phenomenal Legacy</h2>



<p>SlasheR has been one of the most impactful and stalwart players in the Call of Duty League over the years. At the time of his retirement, he was the most senior player in the scene and still putting up numbers.</p>



<p>His tenure at the topmost tier of Call of Duty esports saw him transition through some of the most prestigious teams in the space, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>FaZe Clan / Atlanta FaZe</li>



<li>Denial</li>



<li>Envy</li>



<li>100 Thieves / LA Thieves</li>



<li>OpTic</li>
</ul>



<p>In 2016, he won the CWL Championship while flying the Envy banner, fighting alongside JKap, John, and Apathy, all of whom have long since retired or moved on to content creation and coaching.</p>



<p>While streaming recently, SlasheR explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I started thinking about it over the… Honestly, even when we were practicing every day, I started thinking about it. It just wasn’t fun anymore. I feel like the way I approach practice and everything is very serious. Obviously, I want to have fun too, but I’m way more serious with it than a lot of the new-age kids.</p>



<p>It felt to me like a waste of time. We weren’t getting better, we were just playing to play, where I want to get better. I want to go hard every day. I was just like, ‘What’s the point of continuiing to Major I if I’m not enjoying it?’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He explained that he was only playing this long because he was still qualifying for LAN events, because the ‘online shit was just never fun’ for him.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Slasher REVEALS The Real Reasons why he Retired! 👀 (he is done with CDL)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bSJg8iobNHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>SlasheR also admitted that he hasn’t been ‘enjoying the games’, which is an unfortunate sentiment echoed by many pro players these days. The state of Call of Duty isn’t encouraging, and the reception of Black Ops 7 has been an all-time low.</p>



<p>Exceed will move up to take SlasheR’s spot on the Carolina Royal Ravens.</p>

<p>Square Enix's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> demo is now live in select locations around the globe, and we've got some early details about how this game runs. This comes from the <a href="https://youtu.be/nGIHRqRQWp0">YouTube channel SwitchUp</a>, which regularly investigates the performance of Switch and Switch 2 games.</p>
<p>Players on Nintendo's original hybrid system can seemingly expect 30fps (with some frame pacing stutters), and as you might have already guessed, there's a drop in resolution. On the Switch 2, the game will run at a "silky smooth" 60fps, with more consistent frame pacing. Both versions apparently deliver a respectable experience in handheld mode - with the Switch 2 build maintaining smoothness in portable play. The Switch OLED panel also makes the game look great, and Switch load times are "surprisingly solid".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jivqzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The TLDR is that on Switch 1, if you're playing on an OLED, it looks better, although it does run at 30 frames per second with a few visual downgrades. There are also some stutters below 30 frames in certain scenes and you'll notice that in the frame pacing...on the Switch 2, everything is silky smooth, 60fps - perhaps the very occasional stutter...it looks great"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's further mentioned how this reimagined version has gone "all in" with the shallow depth of field technique, as it gives everything a <em>proper</em> diorama look similar to Square Enix's previous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">HD-2D</a> games. There's also some "noticeable aliasing" across both versions of the game, but overall, it's a better experience in the "higher resolution" Switch 2 version, even with some jaggy edges.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"...Generally, it looks absolutely stunning. The ocean waves, the way they've designed those to overlap each other to kind of almost be an illusion of three dimensions works great. There are a couple of issues in terms of texture overlap. If you look carefully you might see the straight lines in certain scenes, perhaps a little work needed there but nothing major."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also differences in the level of detail and draw distance across the Switch and Switch 2 versions, but the overall image quality and amount of effects (minus some particle effects and other effects) remain intact on the original platform. Keep in mind the full game isn't out until <strong>5th February 2026</strong>, so the demo may not necessarily reflect the final release. When more information about the game's performance and resolution is revealed, we'll provide an update.</p>

<p>Last year, Nintendo lifted the lid on a brand new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_tennis">Mario Tennis</a> game for the Switch 2. It's called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and will be launching next month on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>We've not really seen or heard much about it since then, but now that the new year is officially underway (<em>and the tennis pro tour is back at it</em>), Nintendo has taken a brief moment out of its schedule to remind Switch 2 owners that this new entry will offer a stacked roster. In fact, in case you missed it, it's got the "most" playable characters in the series' history.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jivqzm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>This includes not only Daisy and Peach but also "36 other characters", and there's also a chance Nintendo could expand on this with updates. In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> on the Switch ended with a total of 30 playable characters (including unlockable and DLC characters).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nintendo:</strong> "This should be easy. Pre-order #MarioTennisFever and play as Daisy, Peach, and 36 other characters"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some of the other characters include Donkey Kong, Bowser, the Baby Mario crew, Rosalina, Yoshi and even Petey Piranha. Although a lot of characters have been spotted, the full roster hasn't been confirmed just yet. There'll also be 30 different "Fever Rackets", featuring their own special abilities.</p>
<p>Along with the large roster, players can also expect multiple modes including Tournament, Trial Towers, Mix It Up Mode (including Wonder effects), an Adventure Mode, and there'll also be Joy-Con 2 motion controls for the game's Swing Mode.</p>

There's so many great looking games that do interesting visual design, and here's our best of 2025.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Visual Design Award for outstanding, cohesive aesthetic.</p><ul><li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</li><li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</li><li>Hades II</li><li>Hollow Knight: Silksong</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is a hard game. It demands precision, and mere millimeters can mean the difference between success and failure. Because of that, the visual language of the game is paramount. Thankfully, <em>Silksong </em>is great at showing you exactly what you need to see in an absolutely gorgeous way.</p><p>The linework is impeccable, the silhouettes of the enemies and bosses unique and varied, and the animations are crisp and clean. Every enemy is choreographed wonderfully and fits the world of bugs incredibly well.</p><p>And it's not just the technical level that <em>Silksong </em>excels, either. There are beautiful vistas, backgrounds, and amazingly detailed environments in every place you get to explore. It's a gorgeous game in its own right that marries its style perfectly with the technical needs of the intense platforming and combat.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>It feels like any time a new game from Supergiant Games releases, it will end up somewhere on that year's list of beautiful games, if not just outright winning it. That was true with the first <em>Hades</em>, which won not only <a href="https://techraptor.net/blog/2020-techraptor-awards-best-visual-design-award" rel="nofollow">best visual design in our 2020 awards</a> but our overall <a href="https://techraptor.net/blog/2020-techraptor-awards-game-of-year" rel="nofollow">Game of the Year</a> as well.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> just shows Supergiant Games at the top of their game. Ever since <em>Bastion </em>they've shown a high degree of skill in creating amazing art, animations, and a cohesive visual language that perfectly fits their games. <em>Hades II</em> continues that, with just an incredibly high level of polish.</p><p>Every new area full of enemies is gorgeous, full of incredible detail, and the enemies themselves fit its weird underworld aesthetic perfectly. Character portraits in dialogue are delightful, the amazing effects on-screen dazzling, and the vistas you're treated to now and then truly beautiful to look at.</p><p><em>Hades II</em> is a clear sign that Supergiant has mastered their craft and approach to visual design.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>is the most beautiful game I’ve ever played, bar none. Before that, I might’ve said <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, but Sucker Punch Productions just one-upped itself with <em>Yotei</em>.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>is a realistic rendition of the Hokkaido region of Japan. What this title does different from other high fidelity, ultra-realistic games is there’s an exaggerated beauty to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>’s world. The colors are lively and the landscape is meticulously crafted so that just about every frame looks like its own painting. The leaves in the air or the ash falling from the sky create an atmosphere few games can match.</p><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an exceptionally detailed game. Give the photo mode a try and zoom in on parts of the environment to see the various wildlife up close, or even get right up in the face of Atsu and see the ever-present Mount Yotei reflected in her eyes.</p><p>Be sure to stop by one of many Sumi-e Painting locations and craft your own little work of art by flicking your finger across the Duelsense touchpad. Atsu is quite an artist herself, see, and so you can see her admiration of the beautiful lands of Hokkaido in these paintings, which she proudly hangs on the wall of her dilapidated family home.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date</link>
            <guid>1398994</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">One year ago</a>, Lenovo became the first company besides Valve to announce a handheld with SteamOS instead of Windows. The result was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/704903/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-os-review-z2-go-z1-extreme">the Legion Go S with SteamOS</a>; no Steam Deck killer due to price and battery life, but a big step forward in performance and pick-up-and-play portability.</p><p>Now, Lenovo’s doing it again — it’s bringing SteamOS to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">Legion Go 2</a>, its flagship handheld with detachable Nintendo Switch-like controllers and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/lenovo/769314/lenovo-legion-go-2-oled-vrr-nits-leak-evleaks">the most advanced screen in a handheld yet</a>. Lenovo plans to begin selling a SteamOS version in June starting at $1,199, the company just announced at CES 2026 in Las Vegas. Specs are otherwise the same.</p><p>Yes, that is <em>quite</em> the price tag and quite the wait before it arrives! Lenovo already launched the Windows version of this handheld at the end of October, so it’ll already be seven-to-eight months old by the time SteamOS debuts. (With the Legion Go S, the Windows version only had a three-month head start.)</p><p>By then, it’s possible we’ll have handhelds with more powerful <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/797146/intel-panther-lake-core-series-3-architecture-platform-feature-reveal">Intel Panther Lake chips</a> — we’ve already seen Intel’s existing Lunar Lake offering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience#:~:text=in%20my%20tests.-,720p%20benchmarks,-Game%20and%20power">better performance in some games</a> than the Legion Go 2’s AMD Z2 Extreme can offer.</p><p>But simply switching from Windows to SteamOS can offer a notable performance boost, too, and the Legion Go 2 isn’t just premium because of an AMD chip. As of this writing, it’s the only handheld on the market with a variable-refresh-rate OLED screen to make games look amazing and one of the few that doubles as a tablet, with an excellent integrated kickstand and comfortable sculpted detachable wireless controllers for tray table play. There’s even an FPS mouse built into one of those controllers, with a snap-on puck to let it glide smoothly across a table.</p><p>I called the original Legion Go <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">“the Swiss Army knife of handhelds</a>,” and my time with the Legion Go 2 is much the same. I still find the newer Legion Go 2 a bit heavy and awkward with all the extra mouse buttons beneath my fingers as I grip, but there’s no denying its versatility. Speaking of which: you can already load Bazzite onto a Legion Go 2 if you want a preview of SteamOS there. Everything seems to work, including the detachable controllers and RGB lighting.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/853587/lenovo-legion-go-2-steam-os-annoucement-price-release-date]]></content:encoded>

It was a move made amid layoffs at 1047 that saw both the sequel and its popular predecessor pulled offline as the studio promised to return with “big, sweeping changes.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those changes seemingly failed to attract players, with just around 2,300 players logging in to play the free-to-play game on Steam at launch and a little more than 800 playing at the time of this piece’s publication (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#max" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SteamDB</u></a>). The Splitgate community quickly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1q21pye/splitgate_has_fumbled_again_and_failed_to_secure/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>drummed up debate</u></a> about what another disappointing launch could mean for the future of the shooter, but 1047 has <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a different take</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">1047 Games Responds to Recent Steam Charts Conversations <a href="https://t.co/ir9W0BjFHo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ir9W0BjFHo</a></p>— SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/2008619575978479982?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 6, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Steam Charts don’t measure fun,” a message from the team says. “They show one number, on one platform, at one given moment. They don’t show the full picture or what it feels like to actually play, and they definitely don’t capture the community that’s actively helping shape what Arena Reloaded is becoming (including upcoming content like Arena Royale).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to separate Splitgate: Arena Reloaded’s launch player numbers from the nearly 26,000 users who showed up for Splitgate 2, but 1047’s targeted response does aim to remind players that the re-launch also came to consoles and the Epic Games Store. Metrics for those platforms aren’t as openly available as they are for Steam, so it’s unclear if interest is similarly quiet elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the studio wants both veteran and potential players to know it’s put work into getting Splitgate: Arena Reloaded ready for launch, and it doesn’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“To our amazing community: thank you,” 1047 continues. “Your feedback and passion have helped make Arena Reloaded better every day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And to everyone who hasn’t played yet: Arena Reloaded is free, the gameplay’s the best it’s ever been, and we’d love for you to jump in and form your own opinion. A lot of passionate people worked very hard on it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As 1047 takes to social media to combat the negative sentiment surrounding its re-launch effort, its Arena Royale component is expected to launch in the near future. Splitgate: Arena Reloaded <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-relaunches-this-month-as-splitgate-arena-reloaded"><u>came with</u></a> a rebuilt progression system, new and reworked maps, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering sealed product is making waves at big box retailers and TCGPlayer, but who has the best prices this week? Well, both Amazon and secondary marketplace TCGPlayer have their bargains, so I’ve noted the best deals down to save you looking, as well as the other best deals of the day.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals for Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alienware has just dropped a massive discount on their NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 build, coupled with one of the best gaming processors on the market right now in AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Looking for a cheap and cheerful deal instead? How about two 6.6ft braided USB-C cables that can handle up to 240W for the price of a coffee? Thought so. Coming in at the product you didn't know you needed today is a cordless air duster for easy cleaning of desks, PCs, fans and more that's currently half off from $39.98. Let's get into it:</p><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at Amazon">MTG: Cheapest at Amazon</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Amazon is putting out some decent pricing, with my favorite pick here being the "Game Edition" of Cloud Strife-themed Limit Break Commander Deck. It's around the same price as TCGPlayer, making it market value, with the artwork being based on in-game moments instead of the traditional MTG artwork.</p><p>The same can be said for the Marvel's Spider-Man Play Booster Box containing 30 booster packs with the following:<br>• 14 Magic: The Gathering cards<br>• 1–4 cards of rarity Rare or higher<br>• 3–6 Uncommon cards<br>• 6–9 Common cards<br>• 1 Land card (Traditional Foil Land replaces a Land in 20% of boosters)<br>• 1 card of any rarity is Traditional Foil; Foil Showcase Mythic Rare in 1% of boosters</p></div><p id="mtg-cheapest-at-tcgplayer"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer">MTG: Cheapest at TCGPlayer</h2></p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Meanwhile, TCGPlayer is the place to go for MTG preorders. It's the cheapest for the Lorwyn Eclipsed Play Booster Box and Bundle, with the next Universes Beyond entry Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Play Booster Box, Turtle Power! Commander Deck and Bundle, the latter being over $15 cheaper than Amazon.</p><p>There's some gorgeous Final Fantasy scene boxes coming in cheaper than Amazon too, not to mention the standard Limit Break Commander Deck being just under $5 cheaper on TCGPlayer. It pays to shop around for sure.</p></div><p id="alienware-area-51-rtx-5090"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090">Alienware Area-51 RTX 5090</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234132"><div id="234132" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D, 32GB DDR5 RAM, 1TB M.2 SSD</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Area-51 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 32GB GDDR7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This beast is loaded with an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU, GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card, 32GB DDR5-6400MHz RAM, and a 1TB SSD. That alone sells this system with the custom cooling that makes Alienware's Area-51 builds worth the premium. The good news is we're seeing a rare discount on something that has an RTX 5090 in it, a solid 10%, or $550 off, knocking this build down to $5,049.99. What's not to love?</p></div><p id="2-pack-lisen-66ft-240w-usb-type-c-c"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C C">2 Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234131"><div id="234131" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>2-Pack Lisen 6.6ft 240W USB Type-C Cables</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to my kids destroying countless USB cables over the years, I know what makes a USB-C charging cable that lasts. Braided wins out over rubber cable every day of the week due to its flexibility and durability. Thick caps on either side protecting the port will also be a lifesaver, but getting 240W-capable cables can sometimes cost a fortune.<br>Not today! You can get Lisen’s 6.6ft double pack for a ridiculously reasonable $5.60. These will handle fast charging for pretty much everything you can think of, from a mobile phone or Switch 2 to a MacBook. Even if you don't need a new cable, it's worth buying spares when deals like this crop up.</p></div><p id="jvscam-cordless-electric-air-duster"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster">JVSCAM Cordless Electric Air Duster</h2></p><div catalogid="eab3ddf4-df4e-4312-bd6d-0ff777612420" id="234133"><div id="234133" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>JVSCAM 130,000RPM Cordless Electric Air Duster with Adjustable Tips</h3></p></div><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Cleaning dust or crumbs out of your keyboard is a pain. No-one likes doing it and it takes ages to brush them all out. I was in the "Why the hell do I need an electric duster" camp, but then I bought one and I’m using it quite a lot.</p><p>I use mine to clear out vents, fans, GPU and more inside my PC, and even use it to get to hard-to-reach places in the car and on my desk. They're very handy to have in your desk drawer and it’s a great deal for $20.</p></div></div><p id="market-value-at-amazon"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Market Value at Amazon">Pokémon TCG: Market Value at Amazon</h2></p><div><div id="234070" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box</h3></p></div><div id="234078" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At Market Value at Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</h3></p></div><div id="234085" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Q4 Poke Ball Tins</h3></p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, the good news is you can get the Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box with Prime delivery without getting stung.

It’s $13 cheaper than Amazon right now and works out at $4.66 per booster pack, which is one of the best prices I’ve seen for Destined Rivals booster packs recently.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a decent Mega ex card for your Grass-type deck, I’d recommend the Mega Venusaur ex Premium Collection. If you run Meganium alongside it from Mega Evolution, you can double your Grass Energy value while being able to move a Grass Energy from one Pokémon to another thanks to their abilities. That means you can set up and use Mega Venusaur ex’s “Jungle Dump” attack for 240 damage in one turn (it costs four Grass Energy).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll also get the following booster packs:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>2 × Mega Evolution</li><li>2 × Destined Rivals</li><li>4 × Journey Together</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-patent-ai-ghost-ps5-megabonk-2000657230</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whenever my kids get stuck playing a game, they run around the house yelling for me to help them. Doesn’t matter where I am or what I’m doing. Making dinner, taking out the trash, going to the bathroom, nowhere is safe. I patiently try to explain to them that back in my day, there was no grownup to help me beat Snake Man in <em>Mega Man 3</em> or find Excalibur in <em>Final Fantasy IV</em>. I just had to bash my head against the wall until I figured it out or give up until I got older.</p> <p>They never find this paternal wisdom satisfactory, so there I am finding them Zonai devices in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> or turning off damage in the <em>Minecraft</em> settings menu like a personal accessibility assistant. Will they do the same for their children? They might not have to. New AI “ghosts” might be able to do everything in the game for them. The games will, on command, be able to play themselves. Perfect for grinding crypto-currency in the Roblox mines while the oceans rise. RIP my future grandchildren.</p>

 <p>A Sony patent for these AI ghosts has been making the rounds online today. As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-ai-patent-will-see-playstation-games-play-themselves-when-players-are-stuck/">reported by <em>VG</em>C</a>, the September 2024 registration documents which were publicized earlier this week reveal a technology that would allow people to get AI to help them beat games. These AI “ghost players” would be trained on existing game footage and either demonstrate the solution to an obstacle (“Guide Mode”) or beat it entirely (“Complete Mode”).</p>

 <p>It’s not clear from the patent whether Sony actually plans to move forward with this new AI help tool now or in the future. People have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ramiismail.com/post/3mbr3vakjwk2p">made jokes online</a> about how bad current AI is at hallucinating gameplay, showing you something that looks normal enough before shifting into surreal nightmare fuel just moments later. There are also concerns about how the AI “helper” would be trained, which would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moomanibe.bsky.social/post/3mbrpdt63tk2f">seemingly include</a> footage shared on social media and YouTube.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v/app.bsky.feed.post/3mbr7p6eg3c2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigfbv6ihj3s732hiqdpwh2lfogthvvzvuz7ldy26pot2thmypli3a"> <p lang="en">the point of a movie is not to be done watching it. the point of a song is not to be done listening to it. the gamers' obsession with completion as the only motivator to play a game has directly led to the medium's worst traits. "AI gaming ghost" is a reflection of the lack of willingness to engage</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v?ref_src=embed">funbil (@funbil.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:7zpntsbraj7cbishj4haru2v/post/3mbr7p6eg3c2k?ref_src=embed">2026-01-06T14:58:57.706Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Gaming has a long history of companies trying to help players overcome the difficulty that they themselves designed into their games. In the past there were hotlines and strategy manuals. More recently, companies have tried to embed guides directly into the games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-community-game-help-1851366566">Game Help on PlayStation 5</a> shows you videos of how other players have completed a particular section of a game. It’s a neat idea whose implementation is messy and incomplete. Microsoft is trying to go a step further and embed <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ai-copilot-minecraft-overwatch-insider-microsoft-1851769746">its Copilot AI</a> into games to offer chatbot-style assistance as an overlay like a new version of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-life-death-microsoft-clippy-paper-clip-loved-hate">Clippy</a>.</p>

 <p>Tools like this could be a boon for helping more people enjoy games or at least “unstuck” themselves before bouncing off in a fit of boredom or frustration. But there’s also a <em>Black Mirror</em> version where all of the friction of actually playing a game is offloaded to AI agents entirely. How many games would be improved by adding a skip button that lets you fast-forward your progression by 20 seconds or 20 minutes? How many games would you stop playing entirely if you could offload the drudgery entirely?</p>

 <h2>AI ghosts grinding AI optimized battle passes</h2> <p>Players love to optimize strategies and get one over on the games they’re playing. Sometimes that means doing a lot of work to grind as effectively as possible or craft the most broken build. Other times it means wrapping a rubber-band around an analog stick and going to sleep while the game does all the work for you. What would it be like to play <em>Diablo 4</em> if those builds you had to look up online were automatically recommended inside the skill tree menu?</p>

 <p>What would be the point if at any time you could put the mouse and keyboard down and let an AI agent, trained on YouTube or even your own play history, take the wheel and grind until all of that hyper-rare loot finally drops? Not everyone would go for it. Maybe some would. We already know <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-poe2-diablo-4-paid-boosting-fake-controversy-1851743670">what choice Elon Musk would make</a>.</p>

 <p>Experience-based games would probably be safe. The ones where you’re there for player choice or the story, though even fans of things like <em>Dispatch</em> might be tempted to have someone else handle all of the less engaging mini-games. Multiplayer games have faced an ongoing arms race with cheaters for years. Who wouldn’t be tempted to take credit for a duos Battle Royale win pulled off by their AI counterpart? None of this is in the Sony patent for AI help, but it’s all in the same Pandora’s box.</p> <p>In fact, some of the most popular games of the past few years play with automating the player’s role to some degree until they are irrelevant to the outcome. That’s what made people obsessed with <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. It’s what helped <em>Ball X Pit</em> sell over a million copies. It’s what made <em>Megabonk</em> so popular, it ended up being nominated for an award at the Game Awards that the developer had to recuse himself from. Some games call upon us to embrace the moment-to-moment drudgery of simulated work. Others lure us with the siren’s call of participating in a high-score chase where the big reward <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155">is seeing our own participation incrementally diminished</a>.</p> <p>In 20 years, even that concept might sound as alien to my grandkids as calling something a “button masher.” By then, the computers will no doubt be able to read the inputs directly from their minds. What the AI chooses to do with those, well, that’s anybody’s guess.</p>

              <p>Good news! Amazon is doing its 3 for $33 4K UHD Blu-Ray sale <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-4k-uhd-bluray-sale-godzilla-joker-3-for-33-deal-1851777167">again</a>. If you’ve been wanting to build up a physical collection of your favorite movies (or grow your current collection), you should take advantage of this deal before stuff starts selling out.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mbr2skj6dk2h">As spotted by deals guru Wario64,</a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/promotion/psp/A118PVMFHMZXZ1?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon is once again offering up 4K UHD movies for just $11 each</a>. The catch? You have to buy at least three for the deal to kick in. But, once you have three in your cart, you can just keep adding movies, and they each only cost $11. Want 7 4K UHD movies? That will be $77. That’s a heck of a deal considering a new 4K UHD movie can cost upwards of $20 or $30 normally.</p>

 <p>Before you start buying these movies, remember you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these 4K UHD films. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable. You’ll also want a 4K TV, too. With that all out of the way, here are some of the newer UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon, as well as some classics.</p>

 <h2>New Movies On Sale</h2> <ul> <li><em>F1 The Movie</em></li> <li><em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em></li> <li><em>Superman</em></li> <li><em>Wicked</em></li> <li><em>1917</em></li> <li><em>Megan 2.0</em></li> <li><em>Nobody 2</em></li> <li><em>Fall Guy</em></li> <li><em>How To Train Your Dragon (2025)</em></li> <li><em>Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire</em></li> <li><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></li> <li><em>Nope</em></li> </ul> <h2>Older Movies</h2> <ul> <li><em>The Maltese Falcon</em></li> <li><em>American Pie</em></li> <li><em>Twister</em></li> <li><em>The Lost Boys</em></li> <li><em>Purple Rain</em></li> <li><em>The Blues Brothers</em></li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em></li> <li><em>Schindler’s List</em></li> <li><em>Vertigo</em></li> <li><em>Scarface</em></li> <li><em>Harvey</em></li> <li><em>The Matrix</em></li> <li><em>The Shining</em></li> <li><em>Animal House</em></li> </ul> <p>Who’s bothering with movie discs in 2026? Well, for starters, anyone who wants to actually have control over their media library and not be subject to the curatorial whims and constant price increases of streaming platforms. Also, solving the question of what to watch by walking over and staring at a shelf is so much more satisfying than scrolling an endless list of bad algorithmic recommendations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cut Fallout: New Vegas Ending Shows Yes Man Was Even More Sinister Than He Appeared]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-ending-cut-content-yes-man-2000657243</link>
            <guid>1398913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We’ve known for </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-explains-what-happened-to-fallout-new-vegass-post-game"><span>some time now</span></a><span> that developer Obsidian Entertainment was forced to cut </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> post-game content during its development. But now, thanks to the data found on a recently unearthed Xbox 360 dev kit, we can finally take a look at what some of that scrapped content would have entailed. It turns out that a more sinister conclusion to Yes Man’s story once existed after the credits rolled.</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of who you side with during the Second Battle of Hoover Dam, there’s no squeaky-clean, morally sound conclusion to </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>. Going with Caesar’s Legion is the objectively cruel choice, yes, but the NCR aren’t exactly saints either. Another option is siding with Yes Man. It’s the closest thing </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> has to a good ending. Choosing Yes Man, the overtly amenable Securitron that has been forcibly modified by antagonist Benny, is akin to siding with no one, as the peppy robot will gladly carry out whatever orders you give it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Exactly whose side Yes Man is ultimately on has been a topic of debate for </span><i><span>New Vegas</span></i><span> fans since the game was released, and discussion surrounding his allegiances (or lack thereof) has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/1q0vcia/new_vegas_canon_ending_theory_yes_mans/"><span>once again intensified</span></a><span> following the reappearance of Mr House’s Securitron, Victor, in the second season of the </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>TV series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Following the New Vegas tease at the end of the first season, fans have been theorizing about which of the game’s endings is now the “canon” ending. Comments made by project director Josh Sawyer and the aforementioned cut content have led some to believe that siding with Yes Man may indeed be </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> true ending.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/fallout-new-vegas-lead-writer-loved-writing-yes-man-but-thinks-his-questline-may-have-been-a-mistake-it-lets-you-get-through-the-game-without-getting-your-hands-dirty/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span> recently interviewed </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas’</span></i><span> lead writer John Gonzalez, who stated that he believes offering players a “rebellious, individualistic” path with Yes Man, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fotv/comments/1munso2/reminder_the_yes_man_ending_to_fnv_only_exists_so/"><span>one in which they don’t have to pick a faction to ally with</span></a><span>, might have actually been a misstep on Obsidian’s part. “I think that questline may have been a mistake, because it lets you get through the game without getting your hands dirty,” Gonzalez said.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Despite Gonzalez’s comments, however, the ending to Yes Man’s path does imply that you may have still gotten your hands at least a little dirty. After you dispatch Legate Lanius, who serves as the second-in-command of Caesar’s Legion and is one of two potential boss fights during your fight to retake Hoover Dam, there are implications that the robot takes quite a heel turn. Yes Man informs the player that they’ll be “going off-line” to “reprogram” their personality, and their comment about becoming more “assertive” in the process may imply that Yes Man no longer wishes to take commands from the player; a scary thought, considering they now control an army of machine gun-wielding robots. Still, considering how jovial the exchange is, you’re left with enough wiggle room in your interpretation to read the choice as fairly neutral from a moral standpoint, and there’s ultimately no way to know the true outcome, considering the end credits roll immediately after this conversation ends.</span></p>

 <p><span>But based on recently discovered cut dialogue ripped from a Beta build of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, it seems that Yes Man may have played a much darker role in the originally planned post-game.</span></p> <p><span>On November 26th of last year, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfp9pfxnqz4"><span>Games’ Past</span></a><span> uploaded a video detailing the discovery of two prototype builds of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, found on an Xbox 360 dev kit in a store in Utah. Games’ Past also uploaded the contents of the dev kits online, and modders managed to uncover and restore a wealth of previously unseen cut content from the builds.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>As detailed in a separate video by </span><a href="https://discord.com/channels/@me/1458090158170570805/1458139450071847004"><span>Alternative Gaming Channel</span></a><span>, dozens of post-game lines of dialogue were hidden in these prototype builds. The cut Yes Man dialogue is particularly interesting, with him outright telling the player character to “fuck off” if you choose to respond negatively to an announcement he makes about his new “assertive” personality.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Another cut Yes Man line is even more chilling, with the generally chipper robot talking about slaughtering </span><i><span>New Vegas</span></i><span>’ civilians and “using their blood and their skins” to “decorate the Securitrons.”. He does shout “Exterminate!” afterwards, though, so hopefully it was just a goofy little </span><i><span>Doctor Who</span></i><span> reference that could only be triggered with the Wild Wasteland perk. In any case, it seems that helping Yes Man might be just as morally damning as the rest of New Vegas’ endings, which may explain why the Mojave’s future isn’t looking too bright in the TV series.&nbsp;</span></p>

          <p>For the first time in years, Nvidia declined to introduce new GeForce graphics card models at CES. CEO Jensen Huang’s characteristically sprawling and under-rehearsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/0NBILspM4c4?si=XYiz9rxj0iK5LXI0&amp;t=6206">90-minute keynote</a> focused almost entirely on the company’s dominant AI business, relegating the company’s gaming-related announcements to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foltcapx62E">a separate video posted later in the evening</a>.</p>
<p>Instead, the company focused on software improvements for its existing hardware. The biggest announcement in this vein is DLSS 4.5, which adds a handful of new features to Nvidia’s basket of upscaling and frame generation technologies.</p>
<p>DLSS upscaling is being improved by a new “second-generation transformer model” that Nvidia says has been “trained on an expanded data set” to improve its predictions when generating new pixels. According to Nvidia’s Bryan Catanzaro, this is particularly beneficial for image quality in the Performance and Ultra Performance modes, where the upscaler has to do more guessing because it’s working from a lower-resolution source image.</p>
<p>DLSS Multi-Frame Generation is also improving, increasing the number of AI-generated frames per rendered frame from three to five. This new 6x mode for DLSS MFG is being paired with something called Dynamic Multi-Frame Generation, where the number of AI-generated frames can dynamically change, increasing generated frames during “demanding scenes,” and decreasing the number of generated frames during simpler scenes “so it only computes what’s needed.”</p>
<p>The standard caveats for Multi-Frame Generation still apply: It still needs an RTX 50-series GPU (the 40-series can still only generate one frame for every rendered frame, and older cards can’t generate extra frames at all), and the game still needs to be running at a reasonably high base frame rate to minimize lag and weird rendering artifacts. It remains a useful tool for making fast-running games run faster, but it won’t help make an unplayable frame rate into a playable one.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>To Nvidia’s credit, the new DLSS 4.5 transformer model runs on GeForce 20- and 30-series GPUs, giving users of older-but-still-usable graphics cards access to the improved upscaling. But Nvidia said that owners of those GPUs would see more of a performance hit from enabling DLSS 4.5 than users of GeForce 40- and 50-series cards would, and initial testing from some outlets seems to be bearing that out. Compared to the DLSS 4.0 transformer model, Mostly Positive Reviews <a href="https://x.com/mpr_reviews/status/2008449637200367930">found</a> that the new DLSS 4.5 model reduced performance on an RTX 3080 Ti by between 14 and 24 percent depending on the game and the settings, though performance is still presumably better than it would be on the same card if you tried to run those games at native resolutions.</p>
<p>The DLSS 4.5 transformer model is available now, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/results/">after a driver update</a>, and you can use the Nvidia App to select the new transformer model in games that already support DLSS upscaling (whether the option appears in any in-game menus remains up to the game developer). The Multi-Frame Generation updates will be available sometime in spring 2026.</p>
<p>One feature that hasn’t broken cover yet? Nvidia’s Reflex 2, an update to its input lag reduction technology <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/reflex-2-even-lower-latency-gameplay-with-frame-warp/">that the company announced at CES last year</a>. Upscaling and frame generation technologies generally, something that Reflex helps to offset, and the company claimed an up to 75 percent reduction in lag when using Reflex 2 on a 50-series card. But Nvidia didn’t mention Reflex 2 this year, and hasn’t provided any updates on when it might be released.</p>

<p>In another era, CES 2026 would have been a good time to introduce a 50-series Super update, a mid-generation spec bump to keep the lineup fresh while Nvidia works on whatever will become the GeForce 60-series. The company used CES 2024 to launch <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-4080-4070-ti-4070-super-gpu/">the RTX 40-series Super cards</a>, helping improve the value proposition for a bunch of cards that had launched at prices many reviewers and users grumbled about.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Indeed, the rumor mill <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/106675/geforce-rtx-50-super-series-on-track-for-holiday-2025-release/index.html">suggested</a> that Nvidia was working on a 50-series Super refresh for the 2025 holiday season, and its biggest improvement was going to be a 50 percent bump in RAM capacity, said to be possible because of a switch from 2GB RAM chips to 3GB chips. This would have given the theoretical 5070 Super 18GB of RAM, and the 5070 Ti Super and 5080 Super were said to have 24GB of memory.</p>
<p>Assuming those rumors are correct, those plans could have been dashed by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/for-just-a-couple-of-months-in-the-middle-of-2025-it-was-an-ok-time-to-build-a-pc/">the abrupt RAM shortages and price spikes</a> that started late last year. These have been caused at least in part by sky-high demand for RAM from AI data centers; given that modern-day Nvidia is mainly an AI company that sells consumer GPUs on the side, it stands to reason that the company would allocate all the RAM it can get to its more profitable AI GPUs, rather than a mid-generation GeForce refresh.</p>
<p>In fact, none of the major dedicated GPU manufacturers has introduced new products at CES this year. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/amd-reheats-last-years-ryzen-ai-and-x3d-cpus-for-2026s-laptops-and-desktops/">AMD</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2026/01/intel-launches-core-ultra-series-3-cpus-made-using-its-long-awaited-18a-process/">Intel</a> announced products with improved integrated GPUs, which use system RAM rather than requiring their own. But there wasn’t a peep about any new dedicated Radeon cards, and Intel hasn’t introduced a new dedicated Arc graphics card in almost a year, despite some signs that <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/344664/intel-arc-battlemage-b770-spotted-in-more-software-libraries-launch-imminent">a midrange Arc B770 card</a> exists and could be nearly ready to launch.</p>
