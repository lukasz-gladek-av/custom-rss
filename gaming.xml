            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2025">Football Manager 2025</a> has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-manager-2025-has-been-delayed-until-march-2025-to-avoid-compromising-our-usual-standards">delayed until March 2025</a>. This means football fans don't have a new iteration of the series to play alongside the real-world football season, and many players have been wondering whether Sports Interactive could instead release a data update for Football Manager 2024.
</p>
<p>Alas, SI say they've looked into it, and it just isn't possible.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following the announcement of the delay to FM25, many of you have called for an official FM24 update with season 2024/25 data. This is something we have been exploring since the initial internal conversation about postponing the game’s release," begins <a href="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1848709640751927326">the statement shared on social media</a>.
</p>
<p>"Having now scoped the work that would be required, and despite a good initial response from many of our licensors, we cannot lift assets that we are using in FM25 and make them work in FM24 without recreating them in full. The same applies to the many competition rules, translations and database changes that cannot be back ported. The updated assets and data would both be required to obtain licensor approval – they cannot be separated. 
</p>
<p>"This is a substantial undertaking which would take critical resources away from delivering FM25 to the highest possible quality, which we simply cannot compromise on."
</p>
<p>I'm honestly surprised - but pleased - that Sports Interactive explored the potential of an update, and publicly acknowledged that they had. I assume a modder will step in to the fill the void, if they haven't already, as far as the bundled database editor allows.
</p><p>Football Manager 2025 has been delayed several times because it's aiming to be the series' first "true sequel" in decades, according to Sports Interactive. The series is moving over to Unity, rather than an in-house engine, to pave the way for a new generation of updates - although SI seem keen that people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/football-managers-biggest-technical-and-visual-advancement-for-a-generation-arrives-november-but-sports-interactive-are-keen-to-lower-expectations">lower their expectations for FM2025 itself</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The recently released fighter is the first installment in the long-dormant <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>subseries in years, and abandons the old title to instead adopt the “Sparking” designation that the series has always used in Japan, which was lifted from the lyrics of <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>’s opening theme song, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYnLO7MVKno" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cha-La Head-Cha-La</a></span>.” If the endless references haven’t already suggested as much, <em>Sparking Zero </em>is a grand homage to the arena fighters that many of us grew up loving, the iconic shonen manga and anime that shaped our tastes, and the late-and-great man who brought it all to us, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Akira Toriyama</a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Appropriately, <em>Sparking Zero </em>tries to fit a lot in. Its roster dwarfs those of every other game in the multimedia franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dbz-budokai-4-sparking-zero-full-roster-reveal-182-goku-1851652826&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dbz-budokai-4-sparking-zero-full-roster-reveal-182-goku-1851652826">capping out at 182 playable characters</a></span>. Granted, about 20 of them are variants on Goku, and other popular characters have alternate forms as well, but that’s still an incredible number, and <em>Sparking Zero </em>makes the most of it, pulling from all of the franchise’s history. That means there are beloved characters and references from series like the original and <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, as well as folks like Pan and Omega Shenron from <em>Dragon Ball GT</em>, which most fans don’t look back on as favorably as the former. The developers are only going to keep adding characters too, which I reckon will cover more of <em>Dragon Ball Super</em>, and could even grow to include the newest show, <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em>. This isn’t even its final form!<br></p><p>Since the release of <em>Sparking Zero</em>, fans have been celebrating the return of their favorite frenetic arena fighters. Though there have been countless fighting games in the <em>Dragon Ball </em>series over the years, many of them have taken slightly different shapes since the last <em>Budokai Tenkaichi </em>installment, like the <em>Xenoverse </em>RPGs, as well as the gorgeous 2D-fighter <em>FighterZ</em>. <em>Sparking Zero</em> has been received with general acclaim, but the praise is tinged with a heavy dose of nostalgia. Until it was announced, I think many had given up on the series, and the comeback has been received like a long overdue hug, especially in light of Toriyama’s passing earlier this year.<br></p><p>You can see a lot of the love for the game, Toriyama, and the series in the Steam reviews I’ve been poring over. The <em>Dragon Ball </em>fanbase is one of the most raucous collectives I’ve ever known, and their adoration for the franchise, as well as their humor, is pretty singular. Unfortunately, despite the acclaim, <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s got issues that even the most diehard fan is having trouble looking past. The story mode, which features branching what-if possibilities, has been knocked for being particularly shallow and featuring some glaring gaps, but some players have also had a bad time with <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s enemy AI beyond just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-great-ape-vegeta-reactions-1851667987">Great Ape Vegeta wiping the floor with them</a></span>. The biggest concern among the community, however, is the state of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s online play, which sounds pretty busted. Lots of reviews are currently parroting the error message that players are getting, and a few weeks in, that infrastructure still sounds like it needs some fine-tuning to get to a reliably playable place.<br></p><p>Still, the overwhelming majority of reviews are packed with love and admiration for the scope of <em>Sparking Zero </em>and its cavalcade of fan service. It sounds like it’s a few quality-of-life patches away from being the best <em>Dragon Ball </em>game ever made, and I desperately hope it gets there sooner rather than later. In the meantime, here’s a peek at what folks are saying about <em>Sparking Zero </em>on Steam.</p><figure id="" data-id="a9fb5f212b86e90794de85da4cd4ffbf" data-recommend-id="image://a9fb5f212b86e90794de85da4cd4ffbf" data-format="png" data-width="1276" data-height="518" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Ape Vegeta has beat my ass countless times—around twenty, to be exact—and I savored every moment of it!

At the very least, a small, normal baby is a problem for 18 years. Homo Jaluzo just <em>feels</em> like you’re dealing with it for 18 years, and this thing is a lot bigger and screams a lot louder over time.</p><p>And sadly, because “track down the House Beneviento baby from <em>Resident Evil Village</em> and set these two up on a playdate” isn’t a menu option, it is still 100 percent your problem. It’s fine, though, we’ll give you all the lowdown on what to expect when you’re expecting.</p><p>Click on for our detailed guide on how to pacify this blighter. And be warned, there are spoilers for events that lead up to this second boss encounter.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="69f63dbbc40fa3eaa64ddfa875abbfeb" data-recommend-id="image://69f63dbbc40fa3eaa64ddfa875abbfeb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baby Jaluza with a golden pacifier in its deeply creepy face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Baby Jaluza with a golden pacifier in its deeply creepy face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69f63dbbc40fa3eaa64ddfa875abbfeb" data-recommend-id="image://69f63dbbc40fa3eaa64ddfa875abbfeb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Baby Jaluza with a golden pacifier in its deeply creepy face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like any colicky baby, the kid will start yelling his head off with a move called Deafening Din, which does a chunk of damage to your entire party, but also lowers their defense. It’ll then settle into its normal repertoire. Eager Bite means the kid teethes on you for a bit of Pierce damage. He’ll also stare at one of your crew weird and either inflict Daze, which lowers the target’s Accuracy, or charge up for a tackle attack, which just plain hurts. Occasionally, he’ll take a turn to charge up, then throw a tantrum called Jumping Playtime, which damages everybody. I saw a kid do this on a plane once for two hours straight.. It damaged everybody there too.</p><p>After a few turns, Gallica will get the bright idea to take out this kid’s eyes which is…well, that’s just dark, but okay. It does help that eventually the eyes regenerate, but still.</p><p>When the kid’s finally about to tucker out thanks to all the stabbing you did, he’ll use a special called Sour Scream to give himself five turn icons to absolutely demolish your party. And because he has the ultimate helicopter mom, soon after that, Joanna will stroll in and heal her poor baby’s wounds and about half his health.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff8093b431a610216495894dab059050" data-recommend-id="image://ff8093b431a610216495894dab059050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff8093b431a610216495894dab059050" data-recommend-id="image://ff8093b431a610216495894dab059050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, hey, don’t suppose you took the time to do the Providing A Spark sidequest for the Gunner Archetype before you got here, did you? Be a lot cooler if you did, because the Gunner’s Piercing attacks are the biggest help when it comes to keeping the most annoying parts of this fight under control, especially since you can stick them in the back row of your party, and they’ll still do the same damage. It’s not a necessity, though, especially for <em>Persona</em> veterans who like to get the crit path dungeon out of the way first before fucking around with sidequests for two weeks.<br></p><p>What is a necessity, in that case, is having a Magic Knight and either a Warrior or Brawler on hand, because the Leap Thrust Synthesis is about to be your bread-and-butter for the next however-long-it-takes. The Magic Knight also has Marakukaja, which raises defense for the whole party. That’s also going to come in very handy.</p><p>Have a Seeker hang out in your back row. They can help out with pure damage when able, but largely, they’re gonna be your support, using Patra to get rid of Daze, and healing the party when they get low on HP. The Seeker also unlocks some pretty excellent Synthesis moves that do some hefty damage, but you’re gonna want to save those for your Leap Thrust turn more often than not.</p><p>Naturally, by now, you’ll have the honorable Heismay in your crew. Again, if you just Leeroy Jenkins’d this dungeon and didn’t do any of the side missions in town yet, you can keep him as a Thief. His Dark Magic spells do okay damage, and his Plunder spells mean you don’t have to worry as much about him running out of health or HP during all this. If you have the cash to spare, let him inherit the Merchant’s Gold Attack, which is at least a near-guaranteed critical every time. In an ideal world, though, you give him the Gunner Archetype, or you give him the Faker, and have him buffing your party and debuffing Baby Herman the whole time.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac83b17698a1834c1c95065bc2a8c7be" data-recommend-id="image://ac83b17698a1834c1c95065bc2a8c7be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac83b17698a1834c1c95065bc2a8c7be" data-recommend-id="image://ac83b17698a1834c1c95065bc2a8c7be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, let’s start off with the bad news: Homo Jaluzo has zero exploitable weaknesses. On one hand, hooray, that means you can hit him with absolutely anything, and it has an equal chance of doing damage. On the other, it means you’re getting four chances to hit, no more, no less, before the baby gets his turn, and everything that comes after Deafening Din hurts like hell. So, the first couple of rounds are gonna be rough, largely spent keeping Daze off your people, and keeping your health topped off while the baby goes absolutely bugshit with tackle attacks and Gazes. That’s especially true if you brought a Brawler, since Perfect Punch can do a nice bit of damage, but only if they’re topped off on HP.</p><p>Eventually, though, Gallica will chime in with that wild-ass proposal that you should try to shoot the baby’s eyes out. That’s fucked up, and gross, and wrong, and despicable, and she’s absolutely right. Once you get the chance, let a Gunner use one of their Shot techniques for massive damage, or get the Magic Knight to use Leap Thrust, which will also take down an eye’s Defense so the rest of your party can do some decent damage. Also keep in mind that while the main body doesn’t have any weaknesses, you can lower its Defense, and your Seeker can raise your party’s attacks. Take advantage of that if you’re running with a Magic Knight.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-homo-avades-boss-fight-how-to-beat-1851673862&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-homo-avades-boss-fight-how-to-beat-1851673862"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s Homo Avades Is An Egg-Monstrosity That Must Be Destroyed At All Costs</a></span></p><p><br>Now, technically, you could take out both eyes for a bit of peace and quiet in this fight, because it can drag on if you let it—but the eyes regenerate so quickly at this point, it’s actually better just to keep one intact but with low health. Then have your Seeker deal with Daze and heal incoming attacks a lot more often. You’ll eventually have to focus on one eye or the other again, but that’s better than getting caught out there with two eyes able to debilitate your entire party with one turn.</p><p>What’s more important, in that case, is doing as much damage as possible to the main body. Eventually, Lady Joanna will show up and heal up both eyes and a chunk of the main body’s health, typically right around the time he casts Sour Scream, and has a really painful round where he gets five turn icons. You might wanna take a round just to get healed up after that, but once everybody’s 100 percent or close enough to it, you can go right ahead and take out both eyes at your leisure. Now, once they’re destroyed, they’re gone for a while, and even better, occasionally, the wee baby Jaluzo will give up a turn because it’s “writhing in pain from having its eyes crushed.” Yeah, well, that’s what you get for throwing a tantrum in front of company. Now tell the nice heterochromatic boy you’re sorry.</p><p>Eventually, Big Baby Jesus will be done for, and your reward, aside from a shitload of XP and Reeve, is one of the saddest damn backstories in the entire game. I’d say that came out of nowhere, but, I mean, you did just kill a baby, you fucking monster you.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The backlash to Update 4.0 spread to Space Marine 2’s Steam page, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-responds-to-steam-review-bomb-campaign-over-nerf-patch">where disgruntled players review-bombed the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Update 4.1 patch notes were <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/103-patch-notes-4-1-and-game-director-commentary" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> alongside a message to fans from game director Dmitriy Grigorenko, who, having digested the criticism of the last week, admitted: “The key takeaway for me, personally, is that I forgot that once the game comes out, it's no longer a dev's game. It's yours first and foremost.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Saber will establish Public Test Servers (PTS) that will let players try out major balancing updates and make their voices heard before they are pushed onto public branches. Expect PTS to go live early 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the changes made with Update 4.1 there’s plenty to dig through (patch notes below), but overall they should make Space Marine 2’s PvE Operations mode feel easier via a series of buffs to weapons and the Space Marines, nerfs to the enemies, and in some cases the removal of controversial mechanics entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players of Space Marine 2’s new Lethal difficulty will be delighted to hear the universally hated 'Tight Formation' system, exclusive to Operations mode’s hardest difficulty, is not long for this world. Grigorenko revealed that the system was designed as a first step towards the introduction of gameplay modifiers down the line, both negative and positive, “but your feedback showed that the proximity requirements felt too restrictive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Classes like Assault and Vanguard felt especially penalized as playing them effectively requires a certain freedom of movement,” Grigorenko added. 4.1 ditches the Tight Formation system entirely, and Saber will continue to work on modifiers until they’re ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a nerf to the Tyranid’s dreaded Zoanthropes, too, with a reduction in their shield’s effectiveness. Indeed, enemy spawns have been nerfed across the board. From 4.1, Extremis enemy spawn rates in Minimal, Average, and Substantial difficulties will revert back to their pre-Patch 4.0 levels and will be significantly reduced in Ruthless difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Bolters are finally getting a buff. Ever since Space Marine 2’s explosive launch last month Bolters have underperformed, much to the disappointment of Warhammer 40,000 fans who love the weapons from the Games Workshop tabletop and lore. From 4.1, damage across the Bolter family of weapons is increased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if you were wondering whether 4.0 had nerfed the Space Marine roll, Saber confirmed that it had, although this was a bug and not a design decision. 4.1 fixes a bug that caused roll distance to be shorter than before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These are all welcome changes, and players have already reacted positively, but what caused Saber to go so hard with 4.0 in the first place? Grigorenko said that Patch 3.0 had caused an increase in win rates (Ruthless went from 60% to over 80%, for example), and it had received feedback that Space Marine 2 had become too easy even at its maximum difficulty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addressing this, 4.0 went too far in a number of areas, particularly spawn rates even on lower difficulties. “Your feedback made it clear that the game had become more intense and stressful on lower difficulties, and this was never our intention,” Grigorenko said. “As I’ve personally emphasized in interviews, Space Marine 2 is all about the power fantasy, and Patch 4.0 negatively impacted it for many of you.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has plenty more on Space Marine 2, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-update-40-secretly-clamped-down-on-pvp-modding-publisher-confirms-but-doesnt-have-a-problem-with-pve-modding"><u>a deep-dive on the game’s burgeoning modding scene and accompanying complications</u></a>. Last month, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/eagle-eyed-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-spot-chapter-all-but-confirmed-to-get-cosmetic-pack-after-the-dark-angels"><u>eagle-eyed fans have spotted the Space Marine chapter now all-but confirmed to get a cosmetic pack after the Dark Angels</u></a>, and even an unannounced new Thousand Sons enemy type.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Update 4.1 patch notes:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gameplay and Balancing Tweaks - Operations mode</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AI director and enemy spawns</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>Here was our reasoning before Patch 4.0: When the game came out in September, the Ruthless difficulty win rate hovered around 60%. Weeks later, and with the changes introduced by Patch 3.0, we saw that the same win rate had jumped to over 80%, and we received a lot of feedback stating that the game had become too easy—even at its maximum difficulty (at the time).</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>With Patch 4.0, our aim was to tweak enemy spawns to increase the overall number of enemies rather than reverting to buffing their Health. Unfortunately, this had an impact on the easier difficulty levels as well.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>For example, the win rate on the easiest difficulty dropped slightly after Patch 4.0, from 95% to 93%. This may not look like a lot, but numbers aren’t everything. Your feedback made it clear that the game had become more intense and stressful on lower difficulties, and this was never our intention. As I’ve personally emphasised in interviews, Space Marine 2 is all about the power fantasy, and Patch 4.0 negatively impacted it for many of you.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This is why we’re rolling back these changes. Extremis enemies’ spawn rates in Minimal, Average, and Substantial difficulties will revert back to their pre-Patch 4.0 levels and will be significantly reduced in Ruthless difficulty to hopefully strike a balance between how hard the game was at launch and how “easy” it became with Patch 3.0.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><u>Minimal, Average, and Substantial Difficulties</u>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Reduced spawn rate of Extremis enemies to match pre-Patch 4.0 levels</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><u>Ruthless Difficulty</u>:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Significantly reduced spawn rate of Extremis enemies</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Weapons (only in Operations mode)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>We've been wanting to address the Bolter family for a while, as they've been underperforming across all difficulty levels. This has been a frequent piece of feedback from many of you, and the data confirmed improvements were needed across the board. The percent Damage increase is based on which classes have access to which kind of weapon and how the Bolters compete with the other options available.</em>‎</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Auto Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 20%</li><li>Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Heavy Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Stalker Bolt Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Marksman Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Instigator Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 10%</li><li>Bolt Sniper Rifle -&gt; Damage increased by 12.5%</li><li>Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Occulus Bolt Carbine -&gt; Damage increased by 15%</li><li>Heavy Bolter -&gt; Damage increased by 5%</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Difficulty</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><strong>⚙️ Ruthless: Player’s Armour is increased by 10%</strong></u></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>We are partially rolling back the change from the previous patch on Ruthless difficulty following your feedback. With Patch 4.1, we’re hoping to find the right compromise between how easy Ruthless difficulty felt after Patch 3.0 and how it felt after last week’s Patch 4.0.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The reason why it was reduced last week was that we noticed a very substantial bump in win rates on Ruthless after Patch 3.0, as Minoris enemies would no longer remove the entire Armour bar with their attacks, ranged AI Damage was nerfed across the board, and the ability to regenerate Armour by parrying normal Minoris attacks was added.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Additional note: Despite the last patch notes listing a decrease in Armour in Substantial difficulty, this change was mistakenly left out of our last update, hence why you won’t see it being reverted as part of this week’s patch.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><strong>⚙️ Lethal: “Tight Formation” system is removed</strong></u></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>Before anything else, let us clarify our reasoning for the introduction of this mechanic. As we worked on adding a new difficulty tier, we needed to make sure this new challenge was meaningful and interesting. With “Tight Formation”, our objective was to add a new layer of challenge for our most skilled players by adding horizontal progression rather than just vertical progression (i.e., dealing more damage to ever stronger enemies). This game is about the power fantasy, and enemies that take dozens of melee hits break it. Thus the challenge needed to come from other sources.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This system was also designed as a first step towards the introduction of gameplay modifiers down the line, both negative and positive—something World War Z players will be familiar with—but your feedback showed that the proximity requirements felt too restrictive. Classes like Assault and Vanguard felt especially penalised as playing them effectively requires a certain freedom of movement.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>As a result, we’re removing the system entirely and will continue to work on modifiers until they’re ready. We will continue to monitor your feedback after the deployment of Patch 4.1 to make sure Lethal difficulty feels as challenging and rewarding as it should.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><u><strong>⚙️ AI</strong></u></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>A recurrent piece of feedback we’ve seen is that the AI allies can feel useless at times. We already improved allies’ behaviour in Patch 3.0, and we hope this additional buff will help solo players complete their Operations.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Bots deal 30% more damage to bosses.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>Fighting Zoanthropes is often reported as a source of frustration. Alongside the changes to the AI Director, we’re taking away some of their shields’ effectiveness to alleviate some of that frustration.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Zoanthrope: Shield swap cooldown with another paired Zoanthrope is increased by 10%.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>General Fixes &amp; Tech</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed a bug that caused roll distance to be shorter than before.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>DG</em>: <em>This was probably the most impactful and annoying consequence of Patch 4.0. While i-frames were the same, the distance difference made it much less effective versus ranged attacks. With this bug fixed, you should feel a great improvement in your fights against ranged enemies and bosses.</em></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed bug with unlocking Lethal difficulty rewards decals.</li><li>Crash fixes and general stability improvements.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Our teams are constantly working on improvements to the game’s stability. This patch is no exception, so you should encounter fewer crashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/echo-point-nova-impressions-steam-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people use point scales to score games. Others use letters. My review system is simpler: Would a game make sense alongside the “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/guys-will-see-this-and-just-think-hell-yeah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guys will see this and just think ‘hell yeah</a>’” meme? My name is Guys, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1836730/Echo_Point_Nova/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Echo Point Nova</em></a> has made me say “hell yeah” more times than I can count.</p><p><em>Echo Point Nova</em> is a first-person shooter in which you play as an explorer who’s crash-landed on a mysterious planet that’s overrun with murderous mercenaries. The plot barely matters. The real stars of the show are the planet’s structure – a vast series of fully-open floating islands – and traversal, which sees you hoverboard and grappling hook at downright deranged speeds across any surface you can see, horizontal or otherwise. If you are Old, imagine the skiing from <em>Tribes </em>plus <em>Titanfall 2</em>’s wallrunning.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Echo Point Nova LAUNCH DATE ANNOUNCEMENT" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MQiKJlTWGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Physics are floaty, but the game is so forgiving both in terms of checkpoints and your ability to panic-latch onto nearby surfaces that you’ll rarely feel frustrated when you accidentally overshoot your intended landing pad by roughly 1,000 miles. Oh, <em>Echo Point Nova</em> also has <em>Crackdown</em>-esque agility orbs, another key ingredient in making it the perfect shooter for me, personally. They’re not quite as central to the experience as they were in that seminal <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orb Genre</a> classic, but the principle remains the same: collect more orbs, spend less time on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>Combat does not clash with all these high-flying shenanigans; rather it gels with them, providing a cool, smooth series of close shaves. The ability to temporarily slow down time, especially, ensures that just as you start to feel nauseous from encounters’ rollercoaster pace, you’re able to bob and weave between baddies and regain your composure. Individual enemies rarely pose much of a threat, but the game throws a lot of them at you, meaning that you’re always a few mistakes away from death’s door. That said, you’re also just a Tony Hawk 900 no-scope headshot away from a much-needed health pickup. Anything is possible if you dare to dream (or barrel forward with as much force as you can muster, heedless of the potential consequences).&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The children yearn for Titanfall" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3lA9bNRkxo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I also appreciate the game’s structure: You’re given a series of objectives to complete, which lead to fights against gigantic, terrifying mechs (that you can grapple onto and skate up – fuck yeah), but you can also just do your own thing. If you see an ice isle or a forest biome or a lava spigot off in the distance and think “I bet I can launch myself nearly into the sun and then fall, screaming and on fire, like my boy Icarus, onto that,” you probably can.&nbsp;</p><p>I could complain about how some weapons feel less useful than others or a handful of similarly minor quibbles, but I won’t. <em>Echo Point Nova</em> is cool as hell, a game that punches so far above its weight that it’s in danger of collapsing into a black hole. It feels like an alternate evolution of the FPS genre, pieced together from raw materials that were discarded despite their obvious quality. They don't make 'em like this anymore – or at least, the studios that brought us <em>Echo Point Nova</em>'s inspirations don't. I’m happy<em> </em>it exists, and I hope its developers get to make many, many more games like it (in addition to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1227690/Severed_Steel/?curator_clanid=45193315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the other one they already made</a>).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/clayster-retire-from-cod-esports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks, one of the greatest esports competitors of all time and a legend in the Call of Duty space, has officially announced his retirement after more than 15 years in the game. His origins in Call of Duty stretch back to COD 4: Modern Warfare, and his career spanned 14 unique titles.</p>



<p>In his retirement video, Clayster explained he ‘came across from Halo’, like so many Call of Duty pro players did, and that he’d been neck-deep in the COD world since he was 16 years of age. Now, at 32 years old, he’s retiring from COD esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-the-beginning">From The Beginning</h2>



<p>Clayster’s retirement marks the end of an era. He’s the last ‘OG’ player to pull out of active competition at the top tier of Call of Duty esports, having played through the last season of the Call of Duty League in the Carolina Royal Ravens. His stretch around the block has taken him through some of the most prestigious organisations and teams in esports, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>OpTic</li>



<li>Kaliber</li>



<li>Envy</li>



<li>FaZe Clan</li>



<li>eUnited</li>



<li>NYSL</li>



<li>Dallas Empire</li>
</ul>



<p>In a 29-minute video, Clayster poured his heart out to his community, expressing how tough it is just to keep up these days as an active competitor.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know how much it takes to win, especially now. In Call of Duty now, it’s so hard to win. It’s incredibly difficult to not only compete but just win a match against good teams. It’s so hard in the CDL nowadays. I tried my heart out, I did want to succeed for her, in her memory. It’s just hard to play with so much on your mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In that line, Eubanks was referring to his younger sister who passed away in her sleep in August 2022.</p>



<p>Clayster has refused to relent as a competitor season after season, even when many of us knew the end was getting close. He remained a stalwart leader and a ferocious personality, always trying his utmost best to bolster that status as a three-time world champion. With 19 chips and more than $1.1 million in earnings, he’s one of the winningest players of all time.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to talk. I’m thankful I got to see it from playing out of my mom’s house in my bedroom to then playing in huge arenas, so I’m grateful that I got to see the wave go while I was competing.</p>



<p>I feel really blessed to have had the career that I’ve had, the fanbase I’ve had… It has just been a dream come true. For a kid from a small town in Virginia, you know? I’m a hometown hero back there, it’s crazy. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full video from Clayster:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>For any Call of Duty esports fan, this is a huge moment. It’s not <strong>unexpected</strong>, but seeing it up there in lights is pretty tough to come to terms with. I fell in love with competitive Call of Duty way back when Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was doing the rounds in 2009, and the likes of Scump, Crimsix, Karma, and Clayster stuck with me for <strong>years</strong>.</p>



<p>What a way to usher in the Black Ops 6 season.</p>

The game, which aimed to deliver a physics-based multiplayer co-op experience, raised only $2,388 of its $15,183 goal (converted from Singapore dollars) with just 50 pledges. In a statement posted on <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734" rel="nofollow ">social media</a>, the studio indicated that Escape Factory had not generated sufficient interest and would be placed on hold, while announcing the development of a new project called Items, an action-horror prop hunt game.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic took "full responsibility" for the failures associated with The Day Before--which ranged from misleading marketing, severe technical issues at launch, and accusations of scamming players--and committed to transparency and community engagement as it transitions to the newly announced project. As a result, all funds will be refunded to backers, and development on Escape Factory will be temporarily suspended.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic mentioned that the studio had received numerous requests for a prop hunt game, influencing its decision to pivot towards Items. "We have received many requests for a prop hunt game, and after careful analysis and discussion with the team, we have decided that our Escape Factory project has not generated enough interest," Fntastic stated.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer also indicated plans to release mobile games alongside Items, with revenue from these apps allocated directly to development costs. "All funds generated from these apps will go directly into development," the team added.</p><p dir="ltr">Fntastic previously released Propnight, which faced its own set of challenges, including a server closure earlier this year.

Every character has their own motivations, connections, goals, and feelings towards you. Befriending, killing, or even turning an NPC can have a host of unknowable consequences.

To preserve your humanity, you can choose to only suck the blood of rats and the like, but this will keep your level incredibly low throughout.

The fact that your decisions have real stakes is what makes <em>Vampyr </em>one of the best vampire games you can play. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-marketing-budget-is-close-to-a-%E2%80%98major-motion-picture-blockbuster%E2%80%99.1017603/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-marketing-budget/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is everywhere, and everyone knows it. From billboards and commercials to restaurant takeovers and social media promotions, Black Ops 6 is being thrust into the eyes of hundreds of millions of gamers (and of course, non-gamers) worldwide. In the last couple of weeks, ‘The Replacer’ has been everywhere, and the orange and black iconography of Black Ops 6 is on every applicable surface, digital or otherwise.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Activision and Microsoft really pushed the marketing budget to the limit for this game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-heights">New Heights</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 is probably the most highly anticipated Call of Duty game in several years. It has everything fans have been asking for, and a little more besides. There’s a round-based Zombies offering, a stacked multiplayer platform, and a campaign that should offer more than a few hours of entertainment.</p>



<p>It did superbly in the open beta, and fans are eagerly anticipating the game’s first season, the competitive scene ahead, and of course, the <strong>launch </strong>of the game itself on October 25.</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-activision-xbox-microsoft-1236185153/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Variety</a>, Activision’s CMO, Tyler Bahl, revealed how big the team went on marketing Black Ops 6:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(It’s comparable to a) major motion picture blockbuster that would be launching this year.</p>



<p>Obviously, we want to generate sales, but I think overall, just awareness of the new game coming out. That’s always a focus, making Black Ops 6 the number one game this fall. </p>



<p>Overall, I just want people to like the campaign and the work that we’re doing as marketing group. I think some of the work is really innovative. Like we’re not just making a spot – The Replacer is showing up in all these weird and different places that are truly exciting. That’s what gets me excited.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Before the marketing campaign for Black Ops 6 kicked off, The Replacer hadn’t been seen in commercials since 2018. His return has been a stunning one, and he has replaced everyone from presenters on DAZN to presidential candidates, and from restaurant workers to NFL quarterbacks.</p>



<p>All that’s left is for Black Ops 6 to take over the LA Sphere, or something.</p>

Like previous expeditions, The Cursed is only available for a limited time and it starts soon, lasting for approximately two weeks.</p><p>This expedition focuses on players experiencing the lines of reality and other dimensions being blurred. Players won't be able to warp between star systems with their hyperdrive technologies. However, interstellar travel can still be achieved by using the ancient portal network.</p>

<p>Players will wear the Anomaly Suppressor, which will anchor them to reality. Ghostly figures called spectral anomalies will appear and are normally harmless.

Titles like <em>Contra</em>, <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, and <em>Mega Man 2</em>, all from the late ‘80s, provided a unique gaming experience that’s hard to replicate today with modern technology. Hard, sure, but it’s possible—as we’ve now witnessed firsthand with the release of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865"><em>UFO 50</em></a></span>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196358,196789" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The collection—presented as a lost collection from a forgotten developer of the era—features an assortment of single- and multiplayer games across multiple genres, from platformers to roguelikes, with even a few in-depth RPGs mixed in. All are created with an 8-bit retro style that harkens back to the days of gaming in your living room after school. You can beat some of the games in mere minutes, then move on to the next; others, however, require a few hours and multiple playthroughs. They’re all unique, many of them are memorable, and some deserve no more than a single run-through.</p><p>When we sifted through the Steam user reviews, we found an overwhelmingly positive reception from the gaming community. Most people love the indie retro collection and cannot praise the fun factor enough. As you’ll see below, nostalgia plays a significant role in many of the reviews. Numerous players gave a thumbs up because it felt like playing a game from their childhood, and there’s nothing wrong with feeling young again and enjoying your hobby!</p><p>But a few couldn’t get past many titles, which lack the quality-of-life features in modern gaming, or--they say--feel outdated and unnecessarily complex just for nostalgia’s sake. Despite the positive reviews, the negative ones prove highly negative. Many curse out the game and its developers; they shout from the rooftops about how unfun they thought most of the retro titles were to play.</p><p>Surprisingly, we didn’t find many meme reviews, just plenty of positive or negative reviews to help you better understand the game. Here is <em>UFO 50</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="9cf88cf8eb6f665cc0da8da701d224b1" data-recommend-id="image://9cf88cf8eb6f665cc0da8da701d224b1" data-format="png"

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/">Sea of Thieves</a> players recently celebrated a long-awaited addition to the game: After six years, players finally had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-finally-gets-a-much-requested-feature-after-more-than-6-years/1100-6527259/">the ability to crouch</a>. The game's latest update added a number of new stealth features for players to make use of, but unfortunately, almost all of those features have now been disabled due to bugs.</p><p dir="ltr">The additions were part of the game's stealth-focused 14th season, and two of the season's biggest features--trap-laying and ledge-hanging--were cut before they even hit the game due to stability concerns uncovered during a last-minute round of playtesting. Now, just a few days after Season 14's launch, even more features have been removed.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're dealing with some significant issues," production director Drew Stevens admitted in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwUlQFtY-rw">a video update</a> posted to the Sea of Thieves YouTube channel.</p><p dir="ltr">"I want to be clear that we're taking this situation very seriously," Stevens continued. "We're really unhappy about the quality of Season 14's launch, and we're going to be be taking some pretty drastic steps to get us back in control. Our first priority is stabilizing your experience in Live [Mode], we'll then move to reenabling features once we're confident they meet our quality bar. So today, we're taking Sea of Thieves down for a short maintenance [period]. Now, given it's only been a few days since launch, we don't have a hotfix that addresses the high-impact issues yet. We will, however, be making some changes today."</p><p dir="ltr">Some of those high-impact issues include the return of several exploits Sea of Theives developer Rare has previously addressed in the past, like the ability to swap weapons rapidly and control a character's movement after being shot out of a cannon.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, new features like disguises and crouching have been disabled, leaving blowdarts and grappling guns as the only Season 14 features to survive its launch. Stevens says Rare hopes to have a hotfix for crouching, gun swapping, and the game's other "high-impact" issues by next week, with plans to implement the promised trap-laying and ledge-hanging sometime in November.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know I've spoken about it before, and I'm sure you're sick of hearing it, but we know we need to do better here, and Season 14 has suffered from a lack of quality control," Stevens admitted in the video announcement, before reassuring players that Rare is taking Season 14's issues very seriously.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to be all hands on deck through the next releases to get back in control of game quality."</p>

<p>In the announcement video four of the main cast of Critical Role; Sam Riegel (Scanlan Shortholt), Marisha Ray (Keyleth), Laura Bailey (Vex'ahlia) and Taliesin Jaffe (Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III) gather to share the news.</p>
<p>"We have some amazing news to share. We've been picked up for a season four!" - Sam Riegel</p>
<p>An incredible feat that the first three seasons of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> has managed to maintain is that all are rated 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
<p>Season four of <em>The Legend of Vox Machina </em>will likely continue the story where the party left off, with Thordak's demise and the party separating for some time they will be coming back together as rumors of a new&nbsp;Ziggurat surface.</p>
<p>Season three has already made all kinds of interesting changes to the original story of Vox Machina so who knows what's in store as it continues.</p>
<p>Sam Riegel, executive producer and founding member of Critical Role released the following statement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond thrilled - and grateful - to continue the epic and wild adventures of Vex, Vax, Keyleth, Percy, Pike, Grog and everyone’s favorite character - Scanlan,&nbsp;With each season, this show levels up, and we already have big plans to level up both our heroes and villains in Season Four.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this time it isn't known when we should be expecting to see season 4, but it's likely it will be sometime after the first season of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">Critical Role's TV show for their second campaign, The Mighty Nein.</a></p>

<p>Fntastic just refuses to give up. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-day-before-devs-return-fntastic-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcing a comeback</a> in September and launching a Kickstarter for a new game called Escape Factory, Fntastic is back with yet another announcement. This time it’s to tell everyone that funding attempts for Escape Factory failed and it would no longer move forward with its development.</p>



<p>But don’t worry, Fntastic isn’t going away that easy.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">same statement</a> claiming that interest in Escape Factory wasn’t there, Fntastic announced the development of yet another game: Items. Items is, supposedly, an “action-horror prop hunt game” that it says people “have been waiting for”.</p>



<p>Unlike with Escape Factory, there is no trailer or demo currently available for Items. However, the studio claims that once there is a “fully playable demo” they may start yet another Kickstarter for funding.</p>



<p>“It’s important to us that our players get the chance to play and test the game in advance,” they said in the statement.</p>



<p>Lastly, Fntastic said that it will be launching new mobile games as well in order to fund the development of Items. None of those games were announced as well. </p>



<p>After Fntastic first announced its comeback attempt in September, it was quickly discovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fntastic-new-game-asset-flip-dataminers-escape-factory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape Factory was an asset flip game</a>. The studio, however, denied those claims.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fntastic announcing yet another game after their first attempt at a comeback failed? Let us know in the comments, or join the discussion in the Insider Gaming Forums.</p>

<p>The C9 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>‘s take on the classic MP5 SMG, which is one of Call of Duty’s most iconic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons</a>. Just like its predecessors, it’s an extremely powerful close-range weapon with a fast fire rate and excellent mobility, especially with the right attachments.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for the best attachments, Perks, and Equipment to use with the C9, here’s the best loadout for it in BO6.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-c9-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-c9">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-c9">Best Secondary for C9 </a></li>

<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-c9-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-c9-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best C9 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong>&nbsp;Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;Ergonomic Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong>&nbsp;Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Kicking off our best C9 loadout in Black Ops 6 is the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, which keeps you off the minimap when shooting and has no negative effects. The <strong>Reinforced Barrel </strong>boosts the gun’s damage range and bullet velocity, making it stronger when outside of close-quarters combat. </p>



<p>Then, the <strong>Extended Mag II</strong> is a no-brainer, as it gives you 50 rounds instead of 30, while the <strong>Ergonomic Grip</strong> improves mobility so that you can stay on target while jumping, sliding, and diving.</p>



<p>Lastly, <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> improves the C9’s already great rate of fire, making it more deadly in close-combat situations, as you can get more shots off in a shorter period.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-c9">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for C9</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-comms-equipment-perks-scorestreaks-intel#enforcer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Perks</a>, I love the <strong>Enforcer Perk Combat Specialty,</strong> so <strong>Gung-Ho</strong>,<strong> Double Time</strong>, and <strong>Dexterity</strong> all combine nicely to not only improve mobility but also provide the bonus, which regens your health after getting a kill.  Thanks to the <strong>Perk Greed Wild Card</strong>, you can then select Ghost as a fourth Perk, which keeps you hidden whenever an enemy gets a UAV.</p>



<p>To support your attack, <strong>Frag Grenades </strong>are always a great option when enemies are on an objective or in a dangerous position. <strong>Stim Shots</strong> will allow you to stay in the fight for longer too, regenerating your health much faster.</p>



<p>Lastly, for the Field Upgrade, the <strong>Trophy System</strong> means you can support your team and protect them by blocking enemy Tacticals and Lethals.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-c9">Best Secondary for C9</h2>



<p>To support the C9, the <strong>Stryder .22 </strong>is the best Secondary option for finishing off kills when you need to reload or you run out of ammo. It’s semi-automatic, so you’ll need a fast trigger finger to get the most out of it. If you don’t have it unlocked yet, any Pistol makes for a good backup to the C9.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-c9-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock C9 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You will <strong>immediately unlock the C9 once you gain access to Custom Loadouts at Level 4</strong>. You won’t have any issues reaching this level and will probably get it done in a few matches of multiplayer. You can also rank up in ZOmbies, so if you prefer slaying the undead, head into Terminus or Liberty Falls.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-c9-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the C9 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, The C9 is a meta SMG in Black Ops 6, which may be surprising since it’s unlocked so quickly, however, you still need to play to its strengths. It’s not overpowered, but it excels at close range, so don’t try to use it outside of its limits.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-c9-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the C9 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking for another dominant SMG, <strong>Jackal PDW</strong> is an amazing choice, with high damage and clean iron sights. If you want to move away from close quarters, give the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">AK-74</a> a go, as it’s a heavy-hitting Assault Rifle that shreds in the mid-to-long ranges.</p>

            <p>
Following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-is-ditching-psvr-support-next-year">recent decision to end PSVR support</a> for Minecraft, developer Mojang has announced it'll be doing the same for VR on PC, with the ability to don VR goggles and stroll through Minecraft set to be removed from both platforms from March next year.
</p>
<p>
"Our ability to support VR/MR devices has come to an end, and will no longer be supported in updates after March of 2025," Mojang wrote in a notice buried midway through its <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-1-21-40-bedrock-changelog">patch notes for Minecraft's latest Bedrock 1.21.40 update</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following March's update and the demise of Minecraft's official VR support, all existing worlds will at least still be available to build in using non-VR/MR devices, and all Marketplace purchases (including Minecoins) will continue to be available too.

<p>
But while Mojang is waving goodbye to VR in an official capacity (meaning no PSVR2 support for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">Minecraft's newly launched native PS5 release</a>), all is not lost for VR-loving Minecraft players on PC. As noted by <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/minecraft-openxr-pc-vr-psvr-support-dropped/">Road to VR</a>, virtual reality support can still be modded into Minecraft's Java edition using <a href="https://www.vivecraft.org/">Vivecraft</a> (which supports LAN and server multiplayer, but isn't compatible with official servers or console cross-play), and there's also <a href="https://questcraft.org/">Questcraft</a> for Meta's Quest headsets.
</p><p>
As for everything else in Minecraft's Bedrock 1.21.40 update, there's the full launch of Mojang's previously experimental Bundles feature - which gives players a way to stack different blocks or items together in the same inventory slot to save space - and a new Hardcore mode, all detailed in the studio's latest patch notes. This follows Mojang's recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-ditching-single-summer-update-for-more-regular-releases-ps5-version-incoming">ditch its traditional single summer Minecraft update</a> in favour of multiple content drops throughout the year.

		<p>Capcom’s latest <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> showcase has delved into more biome and monster reveals for the much anticipated new game, as well as confirming an open beta test that will take place next week across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxYKTXuoxXQ">the full showcase here</a>, or just catch the latest snazzy trailer below.</p>

<p>Let’s cut to the chase, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test will take place at the following dates and times next week, with PS Plus subscribers getting a two days early access window.</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 with&nbsp;PlayStation Plus Early Access – October 29 at 03:00am GMT – October 31 at 02:59am GMT</li>
<li>PS5 (Non-PlayStation Plus), Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam – November 1 at 03:00am GMT – November 4 at 01:59am GMT</li>
</ul>
<p>PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are not required for the wider open beta from 1st November, but will be for the full game next year.</p>

<p>The open beta test will feature three parts: the complete character creation tool (which you can transfer to the full game), a Story Trial from the opening of the game with tutorials and a Chatacabra hunt, and the free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt where you can pursue the Doshaguma pack or explore the Windward Plains.</p>
<p>It will feature full cross-play between all platforms, and take part will award players with a bonus pendant to decorate their weapons or Seikret mount in the full game.</p>
<p>We’ve already tried out this content with our hand on time in early September. Check out our preview!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preview – A Seikret ride on the wild side</a></h2>
<p>And then for the new gameplay reveals and details from the stream. Capcom dipped a toe in to the Oilwell Basin, &nbsp;named after the boiling oil wells that feature in this region. These can cause firestorms during periods known as Firespring, making the world dangerous in its own right!</p>
<p>Here the newly revealed Brute Wyvern Rompopolo (not as cute as it sounds) is on the prowl, expelling toxic gas to weaken prey, both from its mouth and by injecting gas into the tar on the ground. Lovely. Ajarakan also live here, the two species often vying for terrirory. The Ajarakan is a fanged beast with a thick shell to cover itself in high temperature armour.</p>
<p>Within this region, you’ll be able to visit the village of Azuz, which features a massive forge at its centre, and where you’ll hear tale of the Black Flame that lies beneath the basin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is set for a 28th February 2025 release date, the long-awaited monster hunting sequel coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-scrap-failed-kickstarter-announces-a-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-team-fntastic-are-back-asking-for-15k-to-develop-new-game/">that the Kickstarter</a> that Fntastic put out failed. The developers behind The Day Before came back with a statement, talking about how they deserved a second chance and that their game Escape Factory would be just that. However, the Kickstarter didn't go according to plan, and they decided to postpone any work on Escape Factory and cancel the Kickstarter. Luckily, it means those who donated to Kickstarter will be able to get their money back. It's been specified that no funds have been collected, so those who donated don't need to panic about what happens next.</p>
<p>However, that isn't all for The Day Before developers, as they are surprisingly persistent. Despite the fact that their return wasn't accepted with open arms, they are announcing that they are developing a new game. This title is an "action-horror prop hunt," similar to Propnight, mostly likely. Propnight was one of their more popular titles and was well-received by audiences who played it. However, they lost the rights to that game and are now working on making their very own prop hunt game called Items.</p>
<p>Fntastic said that the community was asking for a prop hunt game, so this time, they are working on delivering exactly that. Considering that they had a Kickstarter to try and be able to make Escape Factory, it begs the question of whether or not they will now boot up one for this game. In the announcement for Items, they've stated that the development of the game will "require significant resources," and as a result, they will be releasing mobile games parallel to the development of Items to ensure that they can support the progress of the prop hunt game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their statement on X</a>, they also mentioned that they "may launch a new Kickstarter campaign or explore other options for release." While they sound optimistic and rather hopeful about their upcoming project, it doesn't mean that it is being well-received by the gaming audience. It's going to be hard for Fntastic to build up any sense of trust with their audience after what happened with The Day Before, and rely heavily on the community to fund their projects that may never even come to light.</p>
<p>Whether or not Items takes off and manages to become a full-fledged game remains to be seen, and we're just going to have to sit back and watch this unfold.</p>
