            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-has-more-shitty-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamurs Group, owner of sites like Dot Esports, Destructoid, and Twinfinite, had another <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamurs-group-employees-reportedly-hit-with-more-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">round of layoffs this morning</a>, with several former staffers reporting they were laid off via impersonal emails while they slept. </p><p>A former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath that they woke up today to find their Slack access and work email had been cut off. The email they received informing them they'd been laid off addressed them by first name but included no mention of their position or other inclusion of their name.&nbsp;</p><p>Other former staffers echoed this experience on Twitter. Former Dot Esports and Tech Radar Gaming Editor Vic Hood <a href="https://x.com/hood_vic/status/1838483276064788549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> on Twitter that she “woke up to an email that I’ve been let go.” Former Twinfinite and Game Skinny Managing Editor Tom Hopkins <a href="https://x.com/tomhopkins9/status/1838489596448928131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> “I have also been made redundant by Gamurs and Twinfinite over a generic email when I woke up this morning.” Former DotEsports employee Isaac McIntyre <a href="https://x.com/isaacmcintyre/status/1838485662498259151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> their layoffs was “Done by a 5:00pm email (no calls) and instant account-wide logouts, which was frankly disappointing considering my time with the company.”</p><p>This is seemingly par for the course for Gamurs layoffs, with former employee Mike Straw <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1838553591981670451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeting</a> that "This is exactly how they let me go last year...a boilerplate email that simply read 'Dear Freelancer' despite me being a staffed editor."</p><p>The former Gamurs staffer told Aftermath, “I'm honestly just a little heartbroken. Some really good people were let go today, with no warning, and it's going to just leave more scars on what's left of the sites under Gamurs. I don't know how a company can expect good writers to flourish when the ground beneath them is so shaky.”</p><p>Gamurs as a company seems to have no interest in writers flourishing, with <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-gamurs-group-games-journalism-escapist-dot-esports?giftLink=565a53d46178fcc56baa5645a6273ae9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former and current Gamurs employees</a> telling Aftermath back in March about low pay, chaotic layoffs, and a company flailing after traffic in the face of changing search and social media algorithms. One former writer told us then,</p><blockquote><p>It's hell…Everyone is stressed out. Coworkers are randomly getting cut for 'performance issues' week-to-week across all sites. The articles are all mindless. The only thing that matters is Google and what Google readers want. Creating a balance between work and life? Impossible. Corporate is breathing down everyone's necks to make sure every single writer is doing four articles a day. Gamurs is now a race to the bottom where every site is at risk of becoming an SEO content farm. The days of actually reporting are over. The acquired sites are losing all semblance of meaning and brand.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Before today, Gamurs previously had layoffs in <a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>. Meanwhile, despite regularly conducting layoffs, over at the Gamurs Group <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career page</a> you can find a host of open roles, with freelance positions paying per piece at abysmal rates that include <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/804a21810e09-prima-games-freelance-games-writers-general" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$11-60 USD</a>, <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/708956bd1bd6-the-escapist-freelance-ea-fc-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$15-75</a>, and <a href="https://gamurs.breezy.hr/p/4331529b541f-destructoid-freelance-weekend-writer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$16-90</a>.</p><p>Everyone involved here--from former Gamurs staffers, to the remaining folks at Gamurs, to people looking for work in games journalism, to people reading the work these sites put out--deserves better than this. We all deserve work <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/gaming-sites-writers-ai-editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">made by humans</a>, for humans to read, and the people who make that work deserve to be paid fairly and treated humanely, including when layoffs happen. </p><p>But that's not the day we're having today! Seeing this happen, time and again, is infuriating and heartbreaking, and my sympathy and rage go out to all affected.</p><p><strong>Update, 12:34pm:</strong> An email from Gamurs CEO Riad Chikhani and Chief Content Officer Kevin Morris, shared with Aftermath, said 30 people have been laid off across Gamurs. The message cites the company "restructuring our operations" and points to changing algorithms, including <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google's Helpful Content update</a> and <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google Discover</a>, as making "clear that a larger reset and re-adjustment of priorities is necessary to ensure long-term sustainable growth for our business."</p><p>The execs also write that "we will be changing our pay structure for freelance writers to better reflect the value of longer, more in-depth work" and promise future details into what exactly that means.</p><p>They write that "As search has changed, it’s more clear than ever that doing what we love is actually the best path forward: creating great, high quality content about topics our audience cares deeply about." Given that this is the strategy writers at these sites were employing prior to Gamurs' acquisition of many of them, and given Gamurs' relentless pursuit of the exact <em>opposite</em> strategy since, I'm curious to see how this works out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is 100 percent working. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The company announced its new Cipher Series for the Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 from its Xbox Design Lab today and the results look really good. The new translucent shells come in five colors: green, pink, red, purple, teal, as well as a completely clear one. The controllers have black handles that make the colors pop, and new Chroma D-pads and back paddles that add a nice finishing touch.</p><p>Because the Cipher series is part of the design lab, Xbox owners can mix-and-match their favorite translucent shell with their preferred color scheme for the rest of the buttons and triggers. The Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 starts at $150, which isn’t too bad for one of the best controllers out there, even if it still doesn’t come with all of the bells and whistles like drift-resistant hall-effect joysticks. </p><p>In addition to the new Elite variants, players looking for a cheaper option have something new to choose from as well. The Ghost Cipher Special Edition controller is only $70 and makes the entire body of the controller see-through with white and grey pieces inside and golden accents on the D-pad and triggers. It’s a companion piece to the previously announced Sky Cipher controller which is transparent blue. </p><p>At this point, I’d love to see them do that with the full set of the Elite’s colors, but for the base controllers. Especially that old-school Xbox green. And remember, you don’t need an Xbox Series X/S to make use of the new controllers. They work on PC, android, and iOS as well. Also the Nintendo Switch if you’re willing to jump through some extra hoops. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each game also comes with a screenplay and explainer “Master” book, and <strong>on Steam and Xbox at least, the mainline <em>MGS </em>games are being sold for $16 apiece</strong>. If you’ve wanted to get into the legendary stealth series, this is as good a deal as any, and it’s a journey well worth taking.</p><p>Should you decide that you want to keep going, some of the later entries in the franchise, especially some spinoffs, are also on sale. <strong><em>Metal Gear Solid 5: The Definitive Experience</em>, which bundles both the prologue <em>Ground Zeroes </em>and <em>The Phantom Pain</em>, is going for $18 on Steam and Xbox</strong>. My opinion of them is mixed, but most folks hold them up as standard bearers for open-world stealth games. <strong>The increasingly popular </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-rising-revengeance-xbox-series-x-s-pc-kojima-1851274738"><strong>cult classic <em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></strong></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>is a completely different type of game, following the cyborg ninja Raiden as he hacks enemies to pieces in exceptionally bloody fashion, and you can also get it for $18 on Steam or for $12 on Xbox via backwards compatibility</strong>. If you’ve come this far, <strong>you might even be interested in checking out the widely panned zombie-themed <em>Metal Gear Survive</em> for $18,</strong> though most people would probably say you’re better off saving that money. I’m not your parent though, just your friendly neighborhood writer.</p><p>Outside of the <em>Metal Gear </em>games, Konami’s catalog isa little all over the place, but that’s kind of great in a way—it means that the publisher has a little something for everyone. For example, <em><strong>Silent Hill: Homecoming</strong></em><strong>—no one’s favorite </strong><em><strong>Silent Hill </strong></em><strong>game—is on sale on Steam for $8 in case you’re looking for a horror game to pick up ahead of the scary season</strong>. A pair of <em>Yu-Gi-Oh </em>games—<em>Legacy of the Duelist </em>and its updated version <em>Link Evolution</em>—are on sale for $5 and $10, respectively, and I’ve learned that this franchise’s video games are quietly popular, so go nuts picking them up and all their discounted DLCs.</p><p>Elsewhere, Konami publishes a lot of retro collections and modern games that are deliberate throwbacks to the early days of video games. <strong><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Cowabunga Collection</em>, for example, is currently $15 on Steam and Xbox, and <em>Rocket Knight Adventures: Re-Sparked Collection </em>can be picked up for $21.</strong> Even the most recent <em>Contra </em>title, a remake of the 1987 original, is on sale, as well as a collection of previous games in the series.</p><p><strong>There’s also a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/konamipublishersale2024/?tab=2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>number of bundles on offer</strong></a></span><strong>, but the most significant one is the <em>Castlevania Collections Bundle</em>, which packages pretty close to 20 <em>Castlevania </em>games from the series’ decades-long history for $58.47. </strong>You get it, there’s a lot here and there’s miraculously even more:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>CYGNI: All Guns Blazing - $</strong>23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Contra: Operation Galuga - </strong>$23.99 (was $29.99)</li><li><strong>Super Bomberman R 2 - </strong>$29.99 (was $49.99)</li><li><strong>GetsuFumaDen: Undying Moon - </strong>$14.99 (was $24.99)</li><li><strong>Arcade Classics Anniversary Collection - </strong>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Contra Anniversary Collection</em></strong><em> - </em>$3.99 (was $19.99)</li></ul><p>So regardless of whether or not you’re in the mood for a stealth game, a 2D beat ‘em up, a bloody good hack ‘n’ slash, or one of the foundational series to gaming’s favorite made up genre (Metroidvania), Konami’s sale might have something that’ll interest you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A former QA at 343 Industries says that Microsoft is directly to blame for the issues that seemed to plague Halo Infinite from the start.</p>



<p>In a response to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnDrkD1ejGU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video covering</a> the Halo Infinite campaign, DLC, and more, former QA Briggs William Crane posted a lengthy comment — h/t to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/ex-343-qa-claims-microsoft-contracting-policies-one-of-the-biggest-issues-ms-exclusives-seeing-a-downturn-in-quality-and-halos-struggles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st </a>for spotting the message — on his thoughts as to why game struggled. He says it was due to a number of factors, but one of the biggest is Microsoft’s “contracting policies”.</p>



<p>“Microsoft’s contracting policies are single handedly one of the biggest issues that Halo faces,” Crane, who now works at Epic Games, said. “Can you imagine how difficult it is to do your best work knowing that they’ll get rid of you in 18 months and there’s nothing you can do about it? Plus that forces people out the door just as they become fully trained and competent at their positions.” </p>



<p>He then continued that a “significant” number of 343 Industries’ workforce is made up of contracted workers, including the past Master Chief Collection team.</p>



<p>“The self inflicted brain drain is maddening to watch, and it’s (in my opinion) why most Microsoft exclusive titles are seeing a downturn in quality,” he said. “They’ve created a business environment in which the talent they should be trying to cultivate is being pushed out the door and is then nabbed by other studios.”</p>



<p>He added that it felt like it was done so Microsoft can “have the luxury of being able to easily lay off employees” at will.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that this is one former employee’s thoughts on the state of Microsoft and, more specifically, the Halo franchise. As such, it should be </p>

<p>Earlier today, Ubisoft canceled its online appearance at the Tokyo Game Show due to “various circumstances”; however, Isndier Gaming has learned that Ubisoft has also canceled its press previews of Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>According to various sources, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows press previews were scheduled to take place next week, and the embargo date for the previews would be announced then. </p>



<p>At the time of writing, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is still scheduled to release on November 12, 2024, however, the recent announcements may suggest that the game might be delayed.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Ubisoft for comment but, as of yet, has yet to reply on the cancellation of the previews, but did not offer comment on the cancellation of the Tokyo Game Show. Earlier today, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://x.com/UBISOFT_JAPAN/status/1838504341289783532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a> about Tokyo Game Show:</p>



<p>“We regret to inform you that due to various circumstances, we have decided to cancel our online participation in Tokyo Game Show 2024 which was scheduled to start at 3:00 PM on September 26th,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>“We apologize for the short notice. We sincerely apologize to everyone who was looking forward to the broadcast.”</p>



<p>The company said that the “currently ongoing giveaway campaign” would continue despite the fact that the broadcast was no longer happening.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-unforgotten-echoes-and-heihachi-mishima-hands-on-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You think some measly lava can kill Heihachi Mishima?!</h2></div><section><p>It turns out that it’s really hard to kill a Tekken character, especially with gravity. Despite Tekken series creator Katsuhiro Harada doing his best to convince us that Heihachi Mishima was actually, really, <em>truly</em> 100% dead this time around, lo and behold the third DLC character for Tekken 8 is none other than the King of Iron Fist himself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The upcoming free story expansion for Tekken 8, titled Unforgotten Echoes, is all about explaining the how and the why of Heihachi’s return, and as part of a preview event, I got to play the entirety of the two-hour-long DLC campaign. My general impression? If you’re able to turn your brain off and just let it take you for a ride, it’s more good (albeit quite silly) ass Tekken story content.</p><p>While Unforgotten Echoes is an eight-chapter story of how and why Heihachi survived being tossed into a pool of lava at the end of Tekken 7, it actually begins by catching you up with what Eddy, Yoshimitsu, and Lidia were all doing during Tekken 8’s campaign. Eddy now works under Lidia as a part of a resistance force against G-Corp, alongside Yoshimitsu, who… I’m gonna be honest, largely just feels like window dressing throughout this entire DLC. Sorry Yoshimitsu fans, if you were disappointed at his lack of a presence in the base Tekken 8 story, this DLC still doesn’t really give him much of a chance to shine. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The early fights with Eddy do largely feel like filler, as there isn’t really much story consequence to them, but at least they’ve got some cool moments like Eddy reuniting with Jin for the first time since Tekken 6, and they also do a good job of including snippets of gameplay from old Tekken games as flashbacks, which is a very cool touch. </p><p>Eventually, Eddy, Lidia, and Yoshimitsu all get wrapped up in the lives of a group known as the Tekken Monks, which is where Heihachi comes into play. I don’t want to spoil how Heihachi managed to survive, or anything regards to his specific journey through the DLC, but I will say that the DLC does a good job of showing another side of Heihachi, and the way it ties back into the main storyline of Tekken 8 left me with a big old smile on my face, even more eager to see what’s next in the storied series. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play is "powerful".</p></div><p>As for Heihachi himself, the word that comes to mind when describing what he feels like to play as is “powerful”. That’s not to say that I think he’ll be one of the best characters in the game, but rather that his moves hit with such incredible force that “powerful” is just the first word that comes to mind. His attacks feel extremely impactful and brutal to look at, with a moveset that is filled with screen shaking stomps, slams, chops, and no shortage of electric wind god fists. It’s all extremely satisfying, even if he seems like a character that will require some serious time in the lab to get good with, thanks to usual just frame timings of the aforementioned Electric Wind God Fist that all Mishimas share, on top of also having a new stance in the Wind God’s Kamae, and a new mechanic that seemingly buffs his attacks and gives him access to new moves once he gets it to level 3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Ultimately, Unforgotten Echoes was a fine way to spend two hours, and does a good job of setting up whatever comes next in the world of Tekken by reintroducing Heihachi into the fold. Most importantly though, it’s free, and is a neat way to give the DLC characters a test drive to see if they fit your style of play before you drop actual money on them. Time will tell if Bandai Namco decides to do something similar for future DLC packs, or if this was just a special one-off due to Heihachi’s role in the story, and as a celebration of Tekken’s 30th anniversary. </p><p>In any case, you’ll be able to experience it all for yourself once Unforgotten Echoes is released in for Deluxe and Ultimate Edition owners on October 1, and for everyone else on October 4.</p><p><em>Mitchell Saltzman is an editorial producer at IGN.

Even the statue in the middle of the city stands recreated in the Cities: Skyline version.</p><p>A top down view of the city is also compared with a map of Baldur's Gate, showing how the modern city similarly folds around the ocean with docks jutting out.</p><p>It's not the first time fans of one particular game have expressed their appreciation in another. Fellow fantasy role-playing game The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim is often the subject of such projects, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrims-whiterun-being-remade-with-far-cry-5-map-editor">having been recreated in the likes of Far Cry 5</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/skyrim-fan-recreates-entire-game-in-age-of-empires-2">Age of Empires 2</a>.</p><p>Baldur's Gate 3 was the surprise monster hit of 2023, as the Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based game captured the attention of fans in unprecedented ways with its seemingly unlimited ways to tackle a seemingly unlimited number of situations.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of the game</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>Sega has confirmed a collaboration with DC on a series of Sonic the Hedgehog comics that will see the blue blur teaming up with the Justice League.</p>
<p>Earlier this week for Batman Day, the Sonic the Hedgehog social media account teased the collaboration, but at today's Sonic Central live stream further details were revealed.</p>
<p>The comics will see mash-ups like Shadow as Batman, Sonic as The Flash (naturally), and Knuckles as Superman, beginning as a series of comics in March 2025 written by Sonic writer Ian Flynn.</p>

<p>The comics will be accompanied by tie-in merchandise, including apparel and toys, and the collaboration will continue into 2026.</p>
<p>Indeed, much of the stream's focus was on merchandise as Sonic becomes something of a cash hog for Sega.</p>
<p>That included a Shadow motorcycle helmet from HJC, a Shadow PalVerse Palé figurine, and even (bizarrely) a collaboration with TopGolf.</p> <div>

<p>As for actual games, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-fall-guys-like-sonic-rumble-as-sonic-mania-plus-hits-mobile">previously revealed Sonic Rumble</a> will arrive this winter on mobile and PC. It's a 32-player battle royale with multiple modes that sees players racing through levels, surviving the longest, or battling for rings.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead By Daylight</a> developers Behaviour Interactive have announced that they're acquiring Red Hook, the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon-2">Darkest Dungeon</a>. This is the same Behaviour Interactive who recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-are-laying-off-almost-100-staff-mere-months-after-they-cut-dozens-of-devs">laid off a bunch of people</a>, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dead-by-daylight-spin-off-project-t-has-been-cancelled/">cancelled a game</a> and closed a studio, Midwinter Entertainment, after snapping up a bunch of developers (the others are SockMonkey, Codeglue and Fly Studio) over the past two years. Darkest Dungeon is a horror game like DBD, so I guess the acquisition chimes from that perspective. All the same, my snap judgement is "yikes".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Red Hook will remain "a fully independent studio" under Behaviour, according to a definition of "independent" that has yet to be shared in full. "Darkest Dungeon has long been a series we've admired, enjoyed (and maybe even lost a little sleep over) as fans, and the opportunity to welcome Red Hook as a fully independent studio under the Behaviour banner is nothing short of a thrill," reads <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1838533897698603388">a statement on social media</a>. "We look forward to supporting Red Hook as they continue to do what they do best: put your sanity to the test." 
</p>
<p>
In a separate release, Behaviour CEO and co-founder Rémi Racine characterised the move as, essentially, a corporate exercise in adopting a fresh child because your festering, stay-at-home, gimlet-eye son needs a new playmate, bless him. "Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher - to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround Dead by Daylight with a library of similarly exceptional horror games," he wrote. "Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come." 
</p>
<p>
'Surrounds', eh? I'd keep your distance, Red Hook. If there's one thing Dead By Daylight is known for, it's cannibalising characters from other horror fictions. They said the Alien couldn't be tamed, Red Hook. I give it two months before the Entity abducts Wayne June and turns him into DLC.
</p>
<p>
Red Hook themselves seem happy with the arrangement, as you'd expect. In the same press release, co-founder Chris Bourassa described Behaviour as "kindred spirits", because "both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games". 
</p>
<p>
"The benefit from Red Hook's Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities," Bourassa added. "Behaviour's support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook's future, and focus fully on transforming Darkest Dungeon into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre."
</p>
<p>
Again, I'm not clear on how the 'independence' thing works here in practice - what will Behaviour do, besides providing development funds? They've confirmed that all 29 of Red Hook's existing team have been retained, at least.
</p>
<p>
Acquisitions aside, Red Hook are currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darkest-dungeon-2s-free-strategy-game-kingdoms-update-is-coming-in-three-parts-with-the-first-due-in-2024">a kingdom-sized expansion for Darkest Dungeon 2</a> that turns it into a turn-based boardgame.

These moments look cheap, rushed, and more in line with a spam ad for a fake mobile game than the rest of the game’s vibrant pixel art.</p><p>They are, frankly, a mess that feels weirdly inserted into the rest of what looks like dutiful but competent proceedings.

Maybe that’s why the game has fewer than 10 user reviews on Steam, with many of the ones that do exist expressing shock at the price tag juxtaposed with the bad cutscene art. </p><p>“The first problem I noticed was in the very first cut scene at the start of stage 1,” wrote on Steam reviewer. “If you are going to charge $40 for your licensed game, please at least get Daniel to actually look like Daniel and not some 30 year old random guy. I encourage everyone to take a short break from this review, go to YouTube, Google a long play of this, and watch the first cutscene. It is so bad it is worth witnessing for yourself.”</p></div><p>Hopefully the game eventually gets a steep price cut from publisher GameMill Entertainment, so that more people actually get to see the small Argentina-based team Odaclick Game Studio’s beautiful pixel art.

Instead, you have a set number of perk slots on each mask you equip, and you’ll need to manually go in and equip your perks on each loadout.</p><p>You can do this at any reality thread (this game’s version of bonfires) that you visit along your journey, so be sure to swap them around when you buy powerful new options from the Path of Innovators.</p><h2 id="h9850"><a id=""></a><strong>The Preparedness perk is awesome</strong></h2><p>Speaking of perks, I must recommend Preparedness. This perk is unlocked from the get-go and provides your character with a really cool passive ability. With Preparedness equipped, you’ll Unravel enemies slightly when dodging their attacks.</p><p>This can be surprisingly useful, particularly early in your adventure while you’re still learning the ropes, as it will typically apply enough Unravel to weak foes to stun them with a single well-timed dodge. In turn, this opens them up for a nice critical attack certain to drain their health.</p><h2 id="h9851"><a id=""></a><strong>Fast travel is unlocked from the beginning</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jyamma Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-recommend-id="image://1637dbb74b5f03d0f006234a18f9cde6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The fast travel options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike many soulslike titles, which force you to reach a certain point in the story to unlock fast travel, <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em> offers you the ability to teleport between reality knots from the very beginning.</p><p>As such, you’re able to revisit any previously explored areas that felt a bit difficult during the first few hours, so that you can show those enemies your new-found power with a few more levels under your belt.</p><h2 id="h9852"><a id=""></a><strong>Farm any crabs you come across</strong></h2><p>You’ll come across some crab enemies very early in the game, and they’re an excellent source of Memoria (XP). While they only grant 40 Memoria per kill individually, they have a relatively decent chance of dropping consumable items called Valuable Shells, which can be used to receive 2,000 Memoria at once. That’s a hell of a lot of XP during the first area of the game.</p><p>If you want to tackle these little crabs, fast travel to the Shores of Quinta reality thread. Turn around from where you spawn, and head into the little beach cave behind you where three of these enemies will be waiting. Slay them and hope for a Valuable Shell, then rinse and repeat as necessary.</p><h2 id="h9853"><a id=""></a><strong>Ranged attacks can be parried</strong></h2><p>There are a lot of pesky archers scattered throughout <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em>, but if you can get a feel for the timing of their shots, there’s some good news: You can parry them.</p><p>Even better, parrying the arrows of the weak archers will automatically Unravel them and allow you to approach for a one-shot kill. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h9854"><a id=""></a><strong>Get prepared before fighting the first major boss</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-recommend-id="image://bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Jyamma Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-recommend-id="image://bce22989b59669db4b4fa8905b016af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Getting ready to battle Curtis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game’s first major boss, Curtis, isn’t necessarily an overwhelmingly difficult encounter, but he hits like a truck, meaning a few missed dodges or parries can land you in a bad spot.</p><p>I’d really recommend that you aim to have around 20 points in your Bruiser stat to raise your health and defense, 20 points in your damage stat of choice, and a weapon leveled to at least +3 before you head in and fight him. You can farm the aforementioned crabs for Valuable Shells if you’re looking for Memoria to make all of this happen.</p><h2 id="h9855"><a id=""></a><strong>Weapon upgrade materials can be refunded</strong></h2><p>And hey, don’t worry about any materials you’ve used on leveling a weapon early in the game. If you find something else you prefer later on, you can head to an anvil and enter the weapon upgrade menu, then select “Refund” to receive all of the materials back for use on another armament of your choosing.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, you won’t be refunded any Memoria you invested. However, that shouldn’t be a huge deal as the game rolls on—it’s much more plentiful later.</p><h2 id="h9856"><a id=""></a><strong>Yes, you can respec…later</strong></h2><p>Lastly, you should absolutely try to design your character’s stats in a way that best suits your early game build, but don’t worry if you find that you’ve tossed a point or two in the wrong place while experimenting. While I won’t spoil how, you will find an NPC later in the game that will let you respec, so you’ll be able to fix up your stat spread mistakes—or completely reevaluate your build if you prefer.</p><hr><p>Good luck out there in the beautiful but dangerous world of <em>Enotria: The Last Song</em>. You’re going to need it!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>T1 recently celebrated its twentieth anniversary, looking back on two decades of success as an esports organisation. Over many years, T1 has become one of the most recognisable brands in the industry, boasting multi-million-dollar wins, rockstar players, and iconography that millions of fans feel proud to represent.</p>



<p>During ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO and COO took to the stage to reflect on the last 20 years before pivoting and focusing on what comes next for the legendary organisation.</p>



<p>It seems that the company’s leadership team is going all in with Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-here-to-stay">‘It’s Here to Stay’</h2>



<p>At ESI Lisbon, T1’s CEO, Joe Marsh, and the firm’s COO, Josh Ahn, graced the stage to deliver a presentation focused on the company’s success over the last two decades. Marsh had bold things to say about the future of the esports industry, which T1 has spent many years trying to spearhead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports is the new version of sports for the younger generation, and it’s here to stay.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The pair revealed that in the past five years, they’ve increased T1’s revenue by 3300%, even during COVID-19, which saw many organisations face a massive downturn. From a business perspective, Ahn revealed that T1’s merchandise sales are posed to overtake the revenue earned from sponsorships for the first time, which is a huge deal.</p>



<p>Typically, most revenue in the esports space is made up of advertising and sponsorships. This is a testament to the power of the T1 brand and the popularity of the product, particularly in South Korea.</p>



<p>Ahn then explained that they’re putting more eggs in the ‘Faker basket’. Faker has long been a superstar of the esports industry and has been branded the GOAT by many millions of fans. He’s one of the most instantly recognisable competitors on the planet, and his passion is nothing short of intense and inspirational.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to make something similar to the Jordan brand but with Faker.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ahn was referring to Michael Jordan’s prolific partnership with Nike, which was kickstarted in 1984. It’s now worth almost $7 billion to Nike.</p>



<p>It’s tough to see Faker-branded products hitting those lofty heights, but there should be a comparable success, downscaled a little to accommodate for the still-growing market that is esports. He remains one of the most appreciated and storied competitors in the business, so if anyone can do it, it’s him.</p>



<p>T1 recently landed in the top spot at the inaugural Esports World Cup, a win that came months after a victory at the League of Legends World Championship. The team is now preparing to go back-to-back at this year’s LoL Worlds, which starts tomorrow.</p>



<p>Do you think Faker is an iconic enough player to have a successful lifestyle brand built in his image? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>Sony's decision to require a PlayStation Network sign-in for the PC port of the single-player <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>&nbsp;is drawing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWar/comments/zeosg2/god_of_war_rag_being_review_bombed_on_metacritic/">expected levels</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1d4gnpe/god_of_war_ragnarok_pc_requires_a_psn_account/">ire</a> from frustrated PC gamers. Now, though, those angry players can actually do something about the problem thanks to a new mod that removes the PSN log-in requirement from the game entirely.</p>
<p>The NoPSSDK mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">hosted on NexusMods</a>, promises to "fully strip the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarok." The <a href="https://github.com/iArtorias/nopssdk">open source mod</a> makes use of a simple <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Detours">Microsoft Detours</a> library to get around the game's calls to the PlayStation Network API without "touch[ing] or modify[ing] any original game code."</p>
<p>The mod, which has already seen one update related to simulating offline mode, has been downloaded just under 2,000 times as of this writing. "I will try to maintain the tool even if something changes, but hopefully nothing crucial happens," mod author iArtorias <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=posts">wrote in a NexusMods post</a>.</p>
<h2>Not a new problem</h2>
<p>Sony initially <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/sony-will-soon-demand-helldivers-2-players-on-steam-have-psn-accounts/">required a PSN account to play the PC version of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> in May, but <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/sony-backs-down-wont-enforce-psn-accounts-for-helldivers-2-pc-players-on-steam/">backed off of that requirement</a> after just a few days of widespread complaints among the player base. Weeks later, though, the PC release of <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2215430/Ghost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT/">did require a PSN account</a> to access the game's online multiplayer Legends mode.
</p><figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gowpsn.png" data-height="780" data-width="1284" alt="With the mod installed, simply clicking &quot;No&quot; lets you play the game without a PSN login."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/gowpsn.png" data-height="780" data-width="1284">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> With the mod installed, simply clicking "No" lets you play the game without a PSN login.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike those recent Sony PC ports, though, <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>&nbsp;is a completely offline, single-player game that nonetheless requires a PSN sign-in for access. It's a difference that thousands of negative user reviews are <a>angrily pointing out on Steam</a>, often with links to the NoPSSDK mod for good measure.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"The game is amazing and I'm really enjoying it, however I can't recommend it in its current state," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198197991033/recommended/2322010/">one representative Steam review</a> reads. "A single player game requiring a Sony PSN login and not being able to play it offline? Really Sony? Are you serious?"</p>
<p>Sony's PSN requirement, which was <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc/">first announced back in May</a>, subjects players to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/psn-terms-of-service/">Sony's PlayStation Terms of Service</a> in addition to those of the PC storefront. The requirement also effectively limits the game's sales to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-countries-have-psn/">the 70 countries where PSN accounts are available</a>.</p>
<p>PC ports have been an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-estimates-its-pc-games-sales-will-jump-375-over-next-year/">increasingly important</a> part of Sony's gaming strategy <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/sony-estimates-its-pc-games-sales-will-jump-375-over-next-year/">for years now</a>, with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/playstationstudios">15 high-profile, big-budget titles</a> making the jump from PlayStation to Steam since 2020. "The strategy as we were developing it when I was there was that we need to go out to where these new customers are, where these new fans could be," former Sony executive Shawn Layden <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/ex-sony-exec-opens-up-about-efforts-to-bring-playstation-hits-to-pc/">said in 2021</a>. "We need to go to where they are..."

                <p>Sony is expanding its catalog of gaming monitors today with the reveal of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Compatible-DisplayHDR-Anti-Glare-DisplayPort/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M10S</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Monitor-DisplayHDR-Speakers/dp/B0D9R8YPK3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M9 II</a>. The M10S is designed as a premium, tournament-ready display--in fact, it was created in collaboration with esports team Fnatic to ensure it checked all the right boxes for professionals. The Inzone M9 II, meanwhile, is the successor to the existing M9 and should be a nice companion for your PS5. Preorders for both are now live at Amazon.</p><h2>Sony Inzone M10S</h2><h3>$1,100 | Releases October 18</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371850" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371850"></a><figcaption>The Sony Inzone M10S</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371850-1727110173-b8706db7b3c1143a529c0.jpg"></figure><p>Though it’s quite expensive, the Inzone M10S is packed with features that make it a great choice for competitive gamers. Along with a large 27-inch OLED display and 1440p resolution, it supports a blistering 480Hz refresh rate, up to 0.03ms response time, and comes with an adjustable stand that lets you quickly tilt or swivel the display. Of course, it also comes with both DisplayPort and HDMI inputs.</p><p>It’s also noticeably compact. Built with a 159mm-diameter base that’s just 4mm thick, it should free up plenty of space on your desktop for your mouse and keyboard. Here are the rest of the monitor's specs:</p><ul><li>DisplayHDR True Black 400</li><li>1300-nits HDR peak brightness</li><li>Custom heat sink</li><li>Nvidia G-Sync compatible</li></ul><hr><h2>Sony Inzone M9 II</h2><h3>$800 | Releases October 4</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4371851" data-ratio="0.561" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4371851"></a><figcaption>The Sony Inzone M9 II</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4371851-m9llfront.jpeg"></figure><p>Despite its lower price, the Inzone M9 II actually offers a better resolution than the M10S. Its 4K IPS display gets you a refresh rate of 160Hz, a 1ms response rate, and support for both DisplayPort and HDMI. Like its more expensive sibling, it comes with a stand that swivels and tilts. Sony gave the M9 II a refreshed design as well. Unlike the original M9, which was a nice complement to PS5 with its white and black paint job, the new monitor is all black.</p><p>This monitor is a better choice for PS5 gaming than the M10S, as the M10S only supports resolutions up to 1440p. Best of all, the M9 II received a price cut--the original M9 retailed for $900, but this new model is just $800.</p><p>Here are the rest of the monitor's specs:</p><ul><li>Full array local dimming</li><li>Backlight scanning technology</li><li>750 nits HDR peak brightness</li><li>VESA Certified DisplayHDR 600</li><li>Nvidia G-Sync compatible</li></ul><hr><p>If you’re interested in the old M9 and its dual-color design, you might want to snag it while you can. It appears that the M9 II will be replacing its predecessor, so it’s unclear how much longer inventory will be available at retailers. You'll find it on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> for $648 (was $900).</p><p>Though it’s not new, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Gaming-Monitor-Dimming/dp/B0B6KHVR3K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony Inzone M3</a> is still a great option if you need a mid-tier display for your battlestation. It’s currently on sale for <strong>$498 (was $530)</strong>, and it gets you a 27-inch display, 1080p resolution, 240Hz refresh rate, and Auto HDR Tone Mapping when connected to your PS5. Consider giving it a closer look if these new monitors are a bit too expensive for your needs.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avatar-the-last-airbender-now-has-a-deckbuilding-card-game/1100-6526544/">Avatar: The Last Airbender Now Has A Deckbuilding Card Game</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p><iframe title="Remnant 2 - Dark Horizon DLC &amp; Boss Rush Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHWAlJ3J3LQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Boss Rush mode will be added to Remnant II as a free major content update. It is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. In this DLC, players will return to N'Erud and uncover a new location that has been preserved in time, where there are alien farmlands that are cared for by robots, as the previous inhabitants are long dead. However, rogue AI and robots are threatening while Travelers search for the secrets of the entity that dominates the skyline. In this storyline, players need to work to uncover the secrets hidden within N'Erud, where players will get to explore new dungeons, as well as a glider traversal system that isn't found in any of the other worlds. In addition, there will be new powerful gear to obtain, as well as "The Warden" archetype.</p>
<p>The Warden is all about enhancing your playstyle, and is accompanied by The Drone, which can shield, heal and attack enemies.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHz22PggehA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> A trailer</a> has been released explaining the new archetype in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding the Boss Rush update, players will be able to choose whether to play the mode by themselves, or alongside fellow Travelers via multiplayer, where they can choose from three different difficulty options. It includes a three-boss run, a seven-boss run, and a nineteen-boss run, and the game mode can be accessed by heading to the World Stone in Ward 13.</p>
<p>Alongside the Boss Rush update, there are new quality-of-life improvements, as well as a new system called Prisms. This feature rebalances the fragment system, and can add additional levels to give you stat bonuses as you explore the worlds of Remnant II.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has explained why Princess Zelda is the protagonist of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it turns out that she wasn't always intended to be the star of the game.</p>
<p>In the latest&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> Ask the Developer interview, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker">follows on from yesterday's</a>, producer Eiji Aonuma sits down alongside directors Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada to answer more questions about the upcoming top-down action-adventure game.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that initially, the team planned Link to be&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s protagonist, but given the "copy-and-paste" gameplay style, the developers quickly found that Link's sword and shield "got in the way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=EVto1fM4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=sjN7fRR5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>had to star Zelda for a very specific reason.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Aonuma, the team realized that "if you have a sword and shield, you can just fight using those", and that there would be no need for the echo system if Link simply had weapons.</p>
<p>Terada then chips in to say that the team originally considered having Link only be able to use echoes to begin with and unlocking the sword and shield later, but then they realized that "once [players] got the sword and shield, they would stop using echoes".</p>
<p>This led to a realization that the protagonist of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>would need to be a character that didn't fight with a sword and shield, which is where Zelda comes in.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that he and the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>team have been asked many times over the years whether Zelda would be the protagonist of her own story, and when he saw the team "struggling to identify"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s ideal protagonist, he realized it would be "exactly the game" for Zelda.</p>

<p>Later in the interview, Aonuma says that he and the team "had no intention of establishing any new theories" in&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>lore with&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, so don't expect any earth-shattering timeline revelations.</p>
<p>It's well worth reading <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full conversation</a> with Aonuma, Sano, and Terada, especially if you're a&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fan, as it's got some very enlightening tidbits of information regarding&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s development and the series as a whole.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. Check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom">our preview of the game here</a> to find out whether we think its more creative and freeform approach will pay off.</p>

In addition, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">announced</a> new chromatic options for the D-pads and paddles. Prices start at $149.99 for a custom design, but you’ll pay extra for some options.</p><p>The new translucent faceplate options are white (Ghost Cipher), green (Velocity Cipher), purple (Astral Cipher), blue (Surf Cipher), pink (Candy Cipher), and red (Pulse Cipher) options. Meanwhile, you can choose Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma for the paddles and D-pad. </p><p>Microsoft also released a new standalone <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fghost-cipher-special-edition">Ghost Cipher edition</a> of the standard Xbox Wireless Controller that’s much more transparent than the Elite options (the Elite rubberized grips keep the translucence from extending past the faceplate). It’ll set you back $69.99 when it arrives on October 8th, and preorders begin today.

Annoying, but makes sense. However, in this case, Sony is asking PC players who already have a Steam account to create a separate account on a different video game service just so they can play by themselves. That’s silly. And I expect players will continue to mod these odd single-player PSN requirements out of any future PS5 and PS4 ports that arrive on Steam. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[N0tail On The Esports Industry: ‘Games Are Not Going Anywhere’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/n0tail-on-the-esports-industry-%E2%80%98games-are-not-going-anywhere%E2%80%99.990261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Johan ‘N0tail’ Sundstein has done it all. He’s the highest-earning esports player of all time, he has secured some of the most prolific trophies in competitive gaming, and he contributed to the foundation of both OG Esports and Team Secret. He was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and started competing at just fifteen years of age.</p>



<p>Sundstein took to the stage at ESI Lisbon to appear in a ‘fireside chat’, clueing the audience in about his experiences with the esports industry and how he thinks everything is going, given recent struggles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-stabilising">‘It’s Stabilising’</h2>



<p>Johan Sundstein is perhaps one of the best-placed individuals to talk about the esports industry. He has been there since the sudden uptick took place that saw millions of fans pulled into the esports ecosystem, and he has contributed more to the industry than almost every other personality in the space.</p>



<p>Speaking at ESI Lisbon, Sundstein said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Where we’re at now, I think when esports went really high up a lot of investments were made, but I will also say that probably a lot of money was burnt. And now, I think it’s stabilising a bit. It went down, COVID happened to everyone, but I think we’re seeing a lot of interest from different regions in the world that are also ready to invest.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The esports industry has wavered in recent years in terms of financial struggles, viewership, and the need for organisations to diversify as much as possible just to make ends meet. There are a few outliers standing firm against that line of thinking, though. For instance, last year’s League of Legends World Championship event broke peak records, pulling in more than six million concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>N0tail remains optimistic – and more importantly, <strong>realistic</strong>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think games are not going anywhere. For as long as humans have been around, we’ve been practising sports and games in different shapes and forms. As long as we are around, I think people will continue to make games and those games will only continue to get better.</p>



<p>I think the future is electronic, mostly. I don’t think sports is going anywhere, like it’s not going to die off, but I do think that the majority of our new games will be digital and electronic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sundstein remarked that ‘we’re all in the same boat’, speaking about fans, spectators, organisers, and even team leaders and founders like himself. He said, ‘We’re all the same people in the same boat trying to enjoy the same thing together.’ </p>
