		<p>Ubisoft has created a new subsidiary dedicated to its three biggest IPs, bringing in a bulk investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent to have a roughly 25% minority stake for the sum of €1.16bn – the subsidiary valued at €4bn by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>This move hives off the Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry franchises, with this business unit the new home for Ubisoft’s teams in Montréal, Quebec, Sherbrooke, Saguenay, Barcelona, and Sofia. The new subsidiary will control each game from these series in the back catalogue, as well as any new games that are in development going forward.</p>


<p>The move follows a steady stream of reports that Ubisoft was looking to this creative way of raising fresh funds and investment, without handing over ownership of Ubisoft itself.</p>
<p>“Today Ubisoft is opening a new chapter in its history,” Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot wrote for the announcement. “As we accelerate the company’s transformation, this is a foundational step in changing Ubisoft’s operating model that will enable us to be both agile and ambitious. We are focused on building strong game ecosystems designed to become evergreen, growing high-performing brands and creating new IPs powered by cutting-edge and emerging technologies.”</p>
<p>He continues, “With the creation of a dedicated subsidiary that will spearhead development for three of our largest franchises and the onboarding of Tencent as a minority investor, we are crystalizing the value of our assets, strengthening our balance sheet, and creating the best conditions for these franchises’ long-term growth and success. With its dedicated and autonomous leadership team, it will focus on transforming these three brands into unique ecosystems.”</p>

<p>You’d be forgiven for reading that and thinking, “why didn’t you try that before?”&nbsp;Honestly, the main factor here is probably the “strengthening our balance sheet” part with Tencent’s funding. Ubisoft has had plenty ups and down in the last few years with some ignominious failures like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/26/skull-and-bones-review/">Skull and Bones</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> – some failures and other pressures have seen Ubisoft join the numerous companies enacting mass layoffs. Assassin’s Creed Shadows is a major hit, thankfully, already selling millions of copies and at a far greater clip than Outlaws, and there’s the major revamp of Rainbow Six Siege coming this summer, aiming to bolster that game’s audience for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>There’s a number of stipulations to this investment deal that mean that Tencent is locked in for at least 5 years with these shares, to prevent them from exerting pressure on Ubisoft or the subsidiary by trying to pull out – though this is moot if Ubisoft ends up no-longer having a majority stake in the subsidiary. In that regard, Ubisoft must hold a majority stake for a 2-year period.</p>

Now, but not for the first time, The Pokémon Company has promised it will be addressing these shortages. It’s just that their words don’t really match reality.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196165,197298" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In a new statement issued <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464">on the eve of the release of the next set Journey Together</a></span>, and posted to socials by <em>Serebii</em>’s Joe Merrick, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) explains that it’s aware of the difficulty people are having buying the cards, but promises that it is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible.” The thing is, that’s exactly the same thing they said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">when we contacted them back in January about the same issue</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s a quote from the new statement:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We’re aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) products due to very high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this.</p></blockquote><p>And here’s a quote from the statement in January:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this.</p></blockquote><p>Which, given there has been no noticeable increase in availability of <em>any</em> affected sets in the two months since, makes this repeated promise a little harder to take seriously. It’s almost word-for-word the same! Those who’ve been able to buy a pack of Prismatic Evolutions without paying scalped prices are the very lucky few.</p><p>The new statement goes on to say that, “For Pokémon TCG product releases at Pokémon Center, we are committed to providing a smooth purchasing experience and employ technology that helps get products into the hands of fans first and foremost.” As anyone who’s tried to use the Pokémon Center on days when new cards are made available for pre-order will tell you, this simply isn’t true.</p><p>The statement continues, “Currently, Pokémon Center implements a virtual queue for certain products to help provide a more seamless purchasing process during periods of increased site traffic.”</p><p>But TPCi has to know this isn’t working. When pre-orders for May’s set, Destined Rivals, went live this week, the site was just broken for hours. Sometimes, if you were lucky, you’d see the “queue” screen, but in my experience it never resolved to the site, and more often there was simply a message saying the site was down for repairs. To describe this as “seamless” is quite something.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-recommend-id="image://cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="864" data-height="591" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-recommend-id="image://cc3676373ba38f90026e685b78c8d3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="864" data-height="591" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Pokemon Center's message saying you're in line to visit the site." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By the time I was able to access the site, everything was of course sold out.

And limiting purchase numbers does almost nothing against an army of bots that can make multiple purchases to multiple accounts.</p><p>It just all sucks. Tomorrow, people will line up outside stores in desperate hope of being able to find some Journey Together product, and many will miss out. Scalpers will do all they can to scoop the majority of the cards, and kids and collectors will be disappointed. What we need at this point is not a copypasta of a statement issued two-and-a-half months ago, re-promising the same things that clearly haven’t happened.</p><p>We need The Pokémon Company to get on top of this, to actually start printing and delivering product to retailers (I’ve spoken to specialist shop owners who say they cannot get answers, let alone cards to sell), and more than anything else, to drop the disingenuous statements and offer a bit more honesty and clarity. We’ve reached out to TPCi to ask for that, to get some specifics on how much more product it intends to print and how, and what practical plans it has for its websites given things clearly aren’t “seamless.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At the time, it was just a blank square situated under the "Home" button on the right Joy-Con. It's roughly where the invisible NFC detector is on the original Switch, the tool that scans Amiibo. Given that the Switch 2 is slightly larger than its predecessor, it looks like there's still room for an NFC scanner even with the mysterious "C" button.</p><p dir="ltr">Granted, we still don't know what the button actually <em>does</em>. The last Nintendo console with a "C" button was the Nintendo 64, which had four of them--a set of four buttons roughly where "ABXY" is on the current Switch. Wario64's replies were full of suggestions about what the "C" might stand for, and while most of them were lewd, one seems like a reasonable fit: Cursor. If the Switch 2 lets users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-rumored-mouse-functionality-heres-how-it-could-be-used/2900-6247/" data-ref-id="2900-6247">imitate a mouse with the Joy-Con</a>, as Nintendo suggested in the console's reveal trailer, perhaps the "C" button is what tells the Switch 2 to change how it registers Joy-Con inputs.</p><p dir="ltr">Whatever it does, we don't have much longer to wait before we find out. Nintendo is hosting another Direct devoted to the Switch 2 and its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launching-in-june-with-three-phase-rollout-for-games-report/1100-6530366/" data-ref-id="1100-6530366">game launch plans </a>on April 2, 2025.</p>

                <p>After rumors and leaks floated about a potential collaboration, it's official: Sea of Thieves is bringing the looks of Destiny 2 to the high seas with today's update. Players can deck out their ship and crew with swanky Lightbearer items and gear such as Ghost anchors and sails bearing the signs of either Hunter, Warlock, or Titan. There are even class-themed figureheads, wheels, and a ship's crest, bearing Destiny insignias.</p><p>You can check out the trailer below to see the full Lightbearer assortment, including a Drifter costume and a Whisper of the Worm ornament for the Eye of Reach. Players can visit the <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/pirate-emporium" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pirate Emporium</a> to gear up for battle.

"We explored how iconic Destiny elements could be reimagined through a Sea of Thieves lens, translating tone, visual language, and character into something that felt fresh but unmistakably faithful. It pushed our teams creatively in the best possible way, and the result is something we're truly proud of!"</p><p>To get the Lightbearer Big Bundle, it'll set you back 4999 Ancient Coins--about $50, or $45 with game pass.

            <p>
Of all the unknowns still surrounding Switch 2, its rumoured 'C' button is perhaps the most mysterious - not least because when Nintendo finally revealed its Switch successor earlier this year, there was simply an enigmatic blank square where everyone was expecting a 'C' button to be. Now, though, with just a week to go until Switch 2's full reveal, the 'C' has finally, quietly been confirmed in an official image for Nintendo's newly announced mobile app.
</p>
<p>
Word of a Switch 2 'C' button - said to be situated below the 'home' button on the console's right-hand Joy-Con - first surfaced amid the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">various leaks circulating prior to Nintendo's official reveal</a>. And a button mostly fitting the leaked description did eventually show up when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2's hardware design was finally unveiled</a> - albeit shorn of its 'C'.
</p>
<p>
But now the 'C' is official. During <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-nintendo-direct-march-2025">Nintendo's latest Direct showcase</a>, it spent a bit of time introducing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">new calendar-style app</a> fans can use to keep track of different Nintendo events and read information about its games. And an accompanying App Store and Google Play promotional image just so happened to include a picture of Switch 2 - now with its mysterious Joy-Con button firmly emblazoned with its long-rumoured 'C':
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/switch-2-c.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Of course, confirmation of its existence doesn't get us any closer to solving the mystery of what it actually <em>does</em>. Some have speculated the letter 'C' is merely a nod to GameCube's 'C' button, itself an evolution of the yellow 'C' buttons on N64. But others have suggested the 'C' stands for more than just the first letter of the alphabet not already taken by other buttons on Switch 2.

<p>
Some, for instance, have reasoned it could stand for 'cast' if Nintendo was considering some sort of streaming functionality for the console, or perhaps 'chat' in the event it's planning more robust social features for its Switch successor. There've even been rumours it stands for 'Campus', claimed to be an evolution of Wii U's much-loved Miiverse. Alternatively, it could be a button to activate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's leaked mouse functionality</a>, with the 'C' not actually standing for anything at all. Or maybe pressing it will summon Chrom to have a little wink at you.
</p>
<p>
Whatever the now officially 'C'd 'C' button does, all will very likely be revealed next week when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo's hugely anticipated Switch 2-focused Direct</a> airs. It all kicks off at 2pm next Wednesday, 2nd April, in the UK. And needless to say, Eurogamer will 'C' you there.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-keyboards-are-superior-and-the-reason-i%E2%80%99m-the-writer-i-am-today.1147236/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many gearheads out there, I went through a “keyboard phase.” And though I did eventually settle in on a “daily driver,” I never really left that keyboard phase. I am only the writer that I am because the keyboards that you buy at the store simply will not suffice, are not specific and perverted enough to accommodate my aberrant typing. I have grown accustomed to my split keyboard, and my pursuit of perfection led me to DIY hardware, soldering, ordering PCBs, and most of my career writing about open source hardware.</p><p>A split keyboard is, appropriately, a keyboard split into two halves. Often these sides are tethered by a cord, although wireless alternatives do exist. This design is not new; in fact it goes back decades. It fundamentally comes down to ergonomics: Typing is unnatural, and having your arms angled inward with palms faced down to meet a single point doesn’t follow the resting shape of the human body. If the arms can be said to have a natural resting place, it is palms facing inwards or at least angled and shoulder width apart. Most keyboards are not shaped like this.</p><p>The effort to replicate a less stressful typing position has led to many absurd designs, including big U shaped keyboards that have you typing sideways. A good compromise is to split the board in half, and potentially to “tent” it by placing it on a slight angle pointing outward relative to the typing surface (many people settle on 20 to 30 degrees.). Some people go so far as to rig the keyboard under their desk or attached to their chair to better simulate this position. A split keyboard may sound like an unnatural arrangement, but as long as you’re not a hunt and peck typist, your hands behave the same way no matter where they are on your desk. All splitting the keyboard does is put them in a better place.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Tenting stands work at an angle to more clearly follow the natural shape of the hands. Credit: <a href="https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEIGEIGEIST</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other advantages to a split keyboard, namely splitting the space bar. The space bar is usually not well designed. Your thumbs are very useful, and you do not need to dedicate two thumbs to the task of spacing. Splitting the space bar into two allows you to have two smaller keys to dedicate to different functions, like spacing and something else like return, shift or escape. By making the keys smaller, you also move less mass per stroke than if you were simply moving a single bar. Even if a split keyboard is impractical to you I firmly believe that most keyboards would benefit from the option of having two space keys instead of one. Even many non-split keyboards have a split space.</p><p>Now you may say to yourself, “great, I’m sold, where can I buy one?” The answer is “not at Best Buy or Micro Center.” The split keyboard has long been the domain of the tech pervert, and despite being the ergonomically superior option, the industry is still slow to offer the option at scale. Brands like Kenesis have been the entry level for a very long time, but their boards do not offer custom mapping or the ability to hot swap your keyboard switches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Kinesis has been holding this down for ages but it's always been a specialty product and you will pay a premium for it.  Credit: Kinesis</figcaption></figure><p>Keychron offers the Q11 at more than $200 dollars, which is well above their normal price point. There’s one called the Royal Cludge RKS70 which is hot swappable and has tenting legs but is not remappable. This may be a fun entry point for a lot of people looking to jump in without rocking the boat too much, but I have no interest in it. The company ZSA has several that are ideal, namely the Moonlander, The Voyager, and the Ergodox EZ. These feature a wonderful ergonomic “thumb cluster” and come ready to use. I know several people who love these, but they are also about $350 as of this writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has really nailed a split keyboard at the entry level, which is what pushes many people, myself included, to go custom. The DIY keyboard scene exploded years ago, and although it seems to have calmed down a bit (you only need so many keyboards before it’s “enough”), the work that the community has done has laid the foundation for increasingly elaborate input devices of increasing perversion and complexity. If there is a keyboard that you can dream of, someone has probably already made it and put the files and firmware on the internet for free.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Moonlander is probably the most viable retail option out there that checks all the boxes and doesn't involve soldering or DIY. Credit: <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZSA</a></figcaption></figure><p>A huge part of this work is firmware. That may sound trivial, but making sure that input devices work correctly and also allowing for custom mapping is a gargantuan task. There are several open source keyboard firmware options. QMK and ZMK are probably the most well known, the former being the established player and the latter being newer and more flexible for people trying to make their own custom keyboards. Many keyboards like those from companies like Drop and Keychron come pre-flashed with QMK, and often with a software called Via, although there is a competing option called Vial that many people prefer. The ZMK alternative is <a href="https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZMK Studio</a>. These allow not only for remapping your keyboard, but also for complex keystrokes, macros, and layering.</p><p><strong>Why remap your keyboard? A world without QWERTY</strong></p><figure><figcaption>QWERTY (1870s), Dvorak(1936), and Colemak (2006) layouts via Wikimedia commons.</figcaption></figure><p>“What’s wrong with my keyboard layout?” you may ask. Nothing, technically, although the standard QWERTY layout is an abomination that has really only persisted because of momentum since its invention in the 1800s despite better layouts existing. The most well-known keyboard layout for a long time was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dvorak</a>, which has been around since the 1930s. QWERTY sucks because it’s not ergonomic and there’s no modern rhyme or reason to where the keys are placed; rarely used keys often take up the prime real estate. Ideally a keyboard should place the most frequently used letters on the “home row,” the center row where the fingers naturally rest. Placing frequently used letters in hard to reach places subtly increases the strain of each keystroke, which contributes to overall wear on the user’s joints. An ergonomic layout does an analysis of letter frequency and attempts to keep those close to home.</p><figure><figcaption>Colemak Mod-DH changes some of these rules a little from Colemak, but there are countless other layouts. Credit: <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemakmods</a>. </figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://colemak.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemak</a> was the true breakthrough of alternative keyboard layouts when it came out in 2006, being both superior to Dvorak and easier to learn for users coming from QWERTY. Since then, many <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W0jhfqJI2ueJ2FNseR4YAFpNfsUM-_FlREHbpNGmC2o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative layouts have sprung up, as have subsequent analysis</a>. These various layouts take into account letter frequency as well as different factors like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KeyboardLayouts/comments/1doxsor/updated_bigram_and_trigram_tables_on_keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bigrams and trigrams</a>. Despite evolutions in layouts analysis, Colemak is probably the most well known alternative, and the more evolved <a href="https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colemak Mod-DH</a> is tried and true and simple to suggest to people. You don’t even need a custom board to do it; there are multiple ways to play around with keyboard layouts on an OS level. There’s plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbTFoMVRWenllUE1qRk5mckxmd2hxVVNwMWtoUXxBQ3Jtc0tuRmR0c3M4dnRMWFgtWVRGTVNTa2dma1Ywa0dDNnNadkUtQm5zWWF5YlJmNUhvYXhFRTk0V2tUc3hxMWhkbUJEU0J4QlY5T2w3YmtFckF4em5zZEJfbUdwV004cGFkeUNNck41YVNnRkFhbmZadWhxcw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keybr.com%2F&amp;v=DKQ4pOoFh5I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free tools online </a>to <a href="https://monkeytype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help you learn</a> those layouts too. I don’t have a dog in this fight as I have attempted to leave QWERTY so many times with different layouts but have never fully committed. That said, I know that switching to a new layout like the updated version of Colemak is an inevitability for me.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="QWERTY Is the Worst - Here's How to STOP Using It" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKQ4pOoFh5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Ben has a really good channel related to this stuff, also other things like how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnRoO6xhWNM">wash your car correctly</a>. </figcaption></figure></div><p>Even if you decide to stay a QWERTY coward, there are other advantages to remapping your keyboard. Here’s a simple one: taking back the precious real estate stolen by the slovenly caps lock button. Caps lock is the most useless button on the keyboard, made redundant by the humble shift key, and it’s sitting pretty on some of the best real estate on your keyboard, easily accessed by the pinky. Most sane layouts come to this conclusion naturally, and for years the Happy Hacking Keyboard was preferred by coders for this very reason. Most OSes will let you switch that input without even changing your keyboard, and in Windows you can do it on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/keyboard-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerToys</a>. It’s one of the first things I did on my MacOS laptop, along with turning the right command and right option to backspace and delete. On top of this there’s also <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Karabiner Elements</a> for MacOS, and <a href="https://github.com/jtroo/kanata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">katana for cross platform</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Another important tool at your disposal that custom keyboard firmware allows for is “layering.” Instead of dedicating space on your keyboard to keys that are out of the way, layering allows you to place different keyboard keys and macros on different layers, often accessed by holding a key of your choice down. Often this is a dedicated layer button on the keyboard, but you can also just make it so that your space bar(s) function as raise and lower layer functions when held down. While this sounds complicated in theory, in practice it is very natural with a tiny bit of practice.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The layers on my keyboard. The buttons on the thumb clusters are tab/space/enter on the left and space/backspace/delete on the right. Holding down the outer keys on both sides allow me to shift to layer 1 (middle) and layer 2 (bottom). Layer 3's purpose is mysterious. </figcaption></figure><p>The two most obvious use cases for layering are numbers and the arrow keys. Arrows are crucial to page navigation, but placing them to the right forces you to move your hand every time you wish to navigate. By placing them on an adjacent layer where the JKLI keys usually are, navigation becomes as simple as holding down your space bar. This should be intuitive to anybody who frequently edits video and uses JKL to scrub back and forth, as well as any gamer who has ever navigated a game world with WASD. I cannot stress how much faster this small change makes basic page navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>Numbers and symbols, which normally require reaching up and holding shift, can be placed on not just one row but several. In my case I have numbers on the bottom row of my keyboard on one layer, symbols on the middle row, and function keys on the top row. In addition to this, I also have a numpad on a separate layer, which should excite any numpad sickos who have worked data entry and know how much faster numpads are. Layering could be an article unto itself, and has allowed me to shave the size of my keyboard down more and more as the years have gone by. If you wanna see how deep this rabbit hole actually goes, look into “<a href="https://www.artofchording.com/introduction/how-steno-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chording</a>” (pressing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/crkbd/comments/us6ucr/chordic_keyboard_layout_for_the_cornecrkbd/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-admin/post-new.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple keys together</a> to represent a single input or syllable), which is how stenography keyboards have traditionally worked, allowing for typing up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nETlhthG22Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">370 words per minute</a>. This behavior is now more accessible than ever thanks to selflessly-made open source hardware and firmware.</p><figure><figcaption>The <a href="https://github.com/kbjunky/Chordie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chordie</a> is an open source chorded keyboard based on the <a href="https://asetniop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASETNIOP layou</a>t.

Bless the Corne. Credit: foostan</figcaption></figure><p>We live in a better world for typing than we did years ago, in part because companies have embraced open source, mappable keyboards as a viable commercial option. But when I started down this long path, DIY was the only game in town I could afford. My first custom keyboard was the <a href="https://josefadamcik.github.io/SofleKeyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sofle</a>, which featured not only a thumb cluster but also rotary encoders for scrolling. The Sofle was a variation on the <a href="https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lily58</a>, which itself owes a lot to the most popular open source keyboard in history: <a href="https://github.com/foostan/crkbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Corne</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Corne is a 40% (no numbers or function keys) split keyboard, and no discussion of this topic would be complete without giving that board and its designer Kosuke Adachi, aka Foostan, their flowers. Originally based off of the ortholinear <a href="https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helix</a>, the Corne features a “staggered” layout, meaning that the keys more aggressively follow the differing lengths of the finger. It’s open source and easy to build, and if you know how to order circuit boards from China there is no shortage of tutorials on how to do this. Because of its open nature, it has allowed countless modifications and variations to be built. God bless the Corne; many of us would not be here today without it.</p><figure><figcaption>Some options from top left clockwise: The Kyria, the GEIST TOTEM, the Dilemma MAX and the ximi v2. Credit SplitKB, KeebSupply, BastardKB, Fingerpunch.</figcaption></figure><p>When I bought my Sofle I had not yet taught myself how to solder, so I relied on the work of a custom keyboard builder I found on reddit to do the job at a fairly reasonable price. These days, the options are varied depending on what you want and what your price is. There are <a href="https://yal-tools.github.io/ergo-keyboards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more split keyboards than you can summarize</a>. You have vendors <a href="https://splitkb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SplitKB</a>, who have sold the beautiful Kyria. Keebsupply is a vendor for the <a href="https://keeb.supply/products/geist-totem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GEIST TOTEM</a>, which is a lovely low-profile staggered board with just enough keys. <a href="https://bastardkb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BastardKB</a> sells several “dactyl” based keyboards – custom u shaped boards meant to fit your hand more aggressively –as well as the Dilemma, a design which features a trackpad. <a href="https://fingerpunch.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fingerpunch </a>is a good vendor with a very inviting Discord. You can also go the Etsy route – tons of keyboard vendors are on there. No matter what you buy, just make sure you know if you’re getting a kit that requires soldering or a whole keyboard, because the latter is always going to be more expensive.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>My entry point: the Sofle.</figcaption></figure><p>But since many of these boards are open source and the designs are on Github, you can do what I have done multiple times: download the files and have a PCB manufacturer like JLCPCB, PCBWay or OSH Park print the PCBS out and mail them to you. The raw parts and PCBs to make a keyboard are dirt cheap. This is unquestionably the most labor intensive way to do this, and you will have to be proficient in soldering and learn how to flash firmware onto your keyboard. But once you’ve built one split keyboard the process is kind of similar for all of them, and the GitHub repositories of most of these boards also include extensive tutorials.</p><p>Getting your own boards made also lets you import art into the open source circuit software KiCAD and doodle on your PCBs, which I have done many times. My current board is called a Nijuni: a modification of a Jorne, itself a spiritual successor to the Corne. I had those printed out, vandalized them to have <em>Pop Team Epic</em> art on it, and have never looked back. I have even experimented with wireless options, which is now far easier than you would expect as you can get microcontrollers with bluetooth on aliexpress for like five bucks these days, which is great even if you decide not to go that route and buy extra in the event of potential duds.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I actually have some other keyboards I need to make on top of this. </figcaption></figure><p><strong>Switches</strong></p><figure><figcaption>The parts of a switch from <a href="https://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/parts-of-a-mechanical-keyboard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Das Keyboard's very good guide on the topic</a>. Das makes very high quality boards if you aren't a split keyboard pervert. Credit: Das Keyboard.</figcaption></figure><p>If you are making a keyboard from scratch or modifying an existing one, you can spend a lot of time on your keycaps and your switches. People obsess over this to an almost unhealthy degree, but I will try to simplify and summarize the key points here quickly. Most mechanical keyboards (i.e.,&nbsp; the good kind that don’t use those cheap rubber dome switches) that are not low profile use Cherry MX style key switches, a weird little cube that turns the stroke from the keycap into an input. These are generally sorted into linear, tactile and clicky switches. Linear just go down with no tactile resistance, tactile have a little bump in them, and clicky switches are loud, satisfying, and will make any coworker, roommate or spouse in audible range want to cave your skull in with an axe handle.&nbsp;</p><p>I generally prefer tactile switches in the style of Cherry MX Browns, although most keyboard snobs now will tell you the original Cherry Brown switches kinda suck. My sweet spot is about 45 to 55 grams of force depending on the switch. There are more switches like this than there are stars in the sky, and the ones in my keyboard were made by a company that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1fwzrym/thekeycompany_closing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">went out of business five months</a> ago. A lot of people seem to like the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-invyr-holy-panda-mechanical-switches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holy Panda </a>switches, and nothing sounds quite like the Gazzew Boba U4T, which I have used and <a href="https://www.rtings.com/keyboard-switch/reviews/best/switches" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which RTings loves</a>. Keyswitches can also be modified, and all of mine have been “spring swapped” using <a href="https://ringerkeys.com/products/gazzew-springs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">55 gram switches from Gazzew</a>. This is done by taking each individual key switch and disassembling it using a key switch opener (these are very cheap) and putting a new spring in. While you are in there, applying a small bit of aftermarket lubrication is a great way to make the switch feel fantastic. <a href="https://divinikey.com/products/205-grade-0-switch-lubricant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I use 205G0</a> on mine.</p><p><strong>Caps</strong></p><figure><figcaption>DES is my current favorite layout. Note how the caps curve. Credit: <a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-alpha-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asymplex.xyz</a></figcaption></figure><p>Keycaps are a deep rabbit hole unto itself, and everyone feels differently about them. There are multiple kinds of plastic you can use, but ABS and PBT are the most common. For years I used a Leopold keyboard, and those use thick, beautiful chalky PBT caps with a specific profile that l had grown accustomed to. When I got my Sofle I went so far as to buy some secondhand Leopold caps that a guy on reddit didn’t need any more. Even outside of keycaps specifically, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechmarket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r/mechmarket</a> remains a great place to buy and sell old keyboards and parts that people don’t use any more. There are many different keyboard “profiles,” different shapes that conform to fit the curve of your fingertips. You can’t go wrong with the standard Cherry profile, although it’s been a minute since I have bought keycaps so I don’t know what the meta is anymore.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-alpha-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a><figcaption>A Corne using the DES layout. I have a mix of these on my board in nylon and Porcelain/Polyurethane Resin thumb cluster caps. Credit: <a href="https://www.asymplex.xyz/product/des-alpha-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asymplex</a> </figcaption></figure><p>The keycap profile I settled on a few years ago is called DES, short for “<a href="https://kbd.news/On-the-DES-keycap-profile-2229.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Distorted Ellipsoidal Saddle</a>,” a beautifully designed ergonomic keycap by designer Pseudoku. Pseudoku makes gorgeous “artisan” caps and sells these in resin, and I have several for the <a href="https://kbd.news/On-the-DES-keycap-profile-2229.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thumb cluster of my keyboard</a>. Pseudoku actually <a href="https://github.com/pseudoku/PseudoMakeMeKeyCapProfiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open sourced much of the design</a>, and so for the main three rows I actually had the keycaps printed in PA12 Nylon, a kind of nylon that you need a very expensive kind of 3D printer to make but which is fairly inexpensive to do in small quantities. Someone sells those on Etsy if memory serves, but if you need a lot of keycaps there’s nothing stopping you from doing it yourself. Pseudoku’s are made out of porcelain and resin and feel tremendously nice. They kind of feel like you’re typing on teeth in a good way. An alternative if you want this pervert lifestyle is the fairly new KLP Lame, a recent addition to the open source keycap world that has both <a href="https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">choc (low profile) and MX (regular)</a> variants.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>KLP Lamé, a brand new profile that shares certain elements of DES. I wanna get a bunch of these printed out in resin. Credit: <a href="https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikita Shirokov </a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>From custom keyboards to Aftermath</strong></p><p>I love my split keyboards and wish that more budget options existed. You should be able to walk into a Micro Center and just buy a pre-assembled Corne, or something like it, for 100 bucks or less. I must also acknowledge that the lack of options from big companies made me hungry, restless, and a more interesting writer. The first real soldering projects I had were about keyboards. It’s the thing that taught me exactly how to order PCBs from China, and led me to realize that many of the parts in my electronics can just be ordered directly from aliexpress.&nbsp;</p><p>Because no keyboard fully satisfied me for so long, I was forced to make my own, and in the process the nature of the keyboard became demystified. It is the wellspring from which all of my DIY electronic interests have emerged, because so many other things follow once you modify or assemble a keyboard: <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-need-an-open-source-mouse-so-i-never-have-to-look-at-razer-synapse-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mice</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-person-saving-the-media-you-love-is-you-vhs-decode-domesday-duplicator-ld-decode-laserdisc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VCRs</a>, LED lighting, custom hitboxes, <a href="https://aftermath.site/diy-speaker-pioneer-dennis-murphy-andrew-jones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaker modifications</a>. The mechanical keyboard boom has subsided, but what remains is a more interesting world of DIY tech and increasingly elaborate split keyboards. If that sounds interesting to you, think about trying or maybe even building one, because it could potentially lead you to places you never imagined.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/4x-game-climate-capitalism-civilization-future"><h3>Give Me A Future Worth Fighting For</h3></a><p>I want to build a better world, not live in the ruins</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gunzilla"><h3>Game Informer Relaunches With Original Staff</h3></a><p>Staff say the site is an independent entity of Gunzilla Games, which is making a game that includes NFTs</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone Season 3 takes players back home with the return of Verdansk, adding new movement adjustments, original game modes, weapons and more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-verdansk-details">Warzone Season 3 Verdansk Details</h2>



<p>With the return of the popular battle royale map, the developers are adopting a back-to-basics approach. The map will now feature 150 players, and the original announcer is returning. Players will be able to shoot during freefall and should expect new infill and exfil cinematics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, with Verdansk, we see the return of the original supply box colours, floating loot, and the original armour satchel. Moreover, the original bus station inventory and the original buy station placement will be returned, too. Furthermore, the Original Armor Box, Deployable Cover, Heartbeat Sensor, Ammunition Box, Recon Drone, and Trophy System will also return.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-movement-adjustments">Warzone Season 3 Movement Adjustments</h2>



<p>Warzone Season 3 makes movement adjustments while keeping omnimovement as the foundation. Originally, the battle royale mode adopted the movement from the multilayer mode; however, the developers have realised that new adjustments are needed to make the gameplay more engaging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With season 3, the player movement speed will be scaled back. These adjustments will help players experience Warzone more in line with its early days. Moreover, the devs are changing omni-sprint speed scaling and slide friction to address the strength of strafe engagements while preserving the feel of sprint-strafe reloading and general movement.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-killstreaks-contracts-and-events">Warzone Season 3 Killstreaks, Contracts and Events</h2>



<p>Keeping the theme of bringing the originals back, Warzone Season 3 will see the return of Original Cluster (Mortar) Strike, Precision Airstrike, and UAV. Moreover, Contracts such as Original Bounty, Most Wanted, and Scavenger Contracts will reappear too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coming to events, players should expect the Original Fire Sale, Jail Break, Loadout Drop, and Restock events along with the Original Capture the Flag Gulag Variant.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-warzone-season-3-returning-maps-and-modes">Warzone Season 3 Returning Maps and Modes</h2>



<p>Along with Verdansk, players will see the return of another fan-favourite resurgence mode, Rebirth Island. Moreover, the following modes are returning for Verdansk: Battle Royale, Plunder Quads, and Call of Duty: Warzone Bootcamp. There are also some new modes to look out for:&nbsp; Battle Royale Ranked Play and Battle Royale Casual. More game modes will be released mid-season.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hunt-showdown/" data-ref-id="5000-283965">Hunt: Showdown</a> takes the title of the game I enjoy the most despite being bad at it. Like most people probably do, at a certain point, I'll drop a game from my life if the losing streaks are piling up too much and it's not feeling fun anymore. I don't win much in the horror-western extraction shooter, but I still play it a lot anyway because I find it alluring in other ways; the audio design is as immersive and instructive as any game I know; the artwork, especially its character design, is diverse and captivating. It's a no-holds-barred PvPvE game that I often play, even when I've come to expect failure.</p><p>As the game kicks off its latest event, <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/garden-of-the-witch-live-now" rel="nofollow ">Garden of the Witch</a>, during its ongoing seventh-anniversary celebration, I recently caught up with a few folks from the Hunt: Showdown team at Crytek. This difficulty ramp was top of mind for me, but we touched on some other subjects too, like that aforementioned audio design being integral to the Hunt experience, and whether we might see Hunt: Showdown in other media, like movies or TV, someday. (Hint: It seems likely.)</p><p>You can find our full chat below, including thoughts on how the team hopes to make Hunt's learning curve a bit more manageable without losing its signature ruthlessness.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: Hunt: Showdown recently celebrated its seventh anniversary. What have been some of the game's biggest milestones or moments through the years?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Dennis Schwarz, Design Director</strong>: Some of the biggest moments for the game have definitely been within the events that we’ve run. One of the first in 2021 was ‘As the Crow Flies.’ This was the first event where the community had to work to unlock Scrapbeak. This event was beloved by both the community and the development team, and we’ve built from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Another moment that stands out is when we broke our [concurrent users] record in 2023 with the release of Rotjaw during ‘Tide of Shadows.’ It was a great moment for us to see that there was so much excitement around a new boss/Wild Target and also to see this in the CCU record being broken was an amazing moment for the team!</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, more recently, we also broke this record once again with the release of Hunt: Showdown 1896. This was easily one of the most pivotal moments for us as we launched CRYENGINE 5.11, the new map Mammon’s Gulch, and a host of other changes. While that release didn’t go without some hiccups, the reception we got around Mammon’s Gulch was unmatched and something we are still very proud of.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hunt's audiovisual experience is clearly a focal point for the team. When I play, it feels like everything is so intentionally placed and important to both the setting and surviving in it, and the audio is so instructive. Can you talk about the process of finding and expanding on Hunt's specific style over the years?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Schwarz</strong>: We defined audio as one of the main pillars for our gameplay early on and started prototyping how sound would help support our core concept of “hunting” through gunfire broadcasting across the entire map and animals being startled in the distance. Our testers quickly started building up these mental maps of what was going on in a match based on the sounds they heard and how this affected their planning on where to go or what to avoid.</p><p dir="ltr">While we have certain supernatural elements in the game, Hunt is generally a grounded game defined by its clunky weapons and limits of the technology of the era. Every move you make produces a sound that risks giving away your position. By embracing this, we managed to focus on a very unique soundscape where creaking wooden boards, shattered glass on the ground or some hanging chains with a bucket could easily spell doom, if you are not careful.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A live-service game often changes based on player feedback. How has the Hunt community helped reshape the game over all these years?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Schwarz</strong>: Definitely--community feedback is a huge driver for us. One of the main ways we do this is via event surveys this can give us real data-driven insight as to what people like or didn’t like, what they want to see more of, etc. We also pay extremely close attention to our key player hubs online like Reddit, Steam, Discord, and so on.</p><p dir="ltr">With this update, we have implemented changes, especially to game balance. We heard from the community that some weapons/ammo types were unbalanced or changed the game in ways with which they were not satisfied, so we have stripped back some of the choices that led to those complaints. We have many more improvements coming to the game throughout the year, such as UI changes, which are at the forefront of the community’s mind.</p><p dir="ltr">Another good example was the crosshair, which we implemented with our 2.0 update. Since the beginning of Hunt, the crosshair was always lowered. Some players really liked this about the game, but others were vocal about it changing. We changed this in the update to give players the option of having a centered one or a lowered one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Are there any aspects of the game the community has been vocal about changing, but Crytek finds them integral and non-negotiable to Hunt's identity? Surely the community for any game isn't </strong><em><strong>always</strong></em><strong> right, yeah?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Schwarz</strong>: There are some things which we have implemented from community feedback but put our own twist on it to make sure gameplay and the community's feedback were balanced.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, we had a lot of requests from the community to put a “Roaming Boss” in the game since Early Access, but this concept never quite worked with the Compound Arena style of boss fights in Hunt. The compromise we came up with was Wild Targets, which spawn outside certain compounds but don’t quite “roam,” and this was seen first with the release of Rotjaw.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Hunt has changed shape a lot, especially in the 1896 update last year. How satisfied are you with the game's onboarding of new players right now? I find the game extremely unforgiving, but I also love it for that. But maybe some are turned away by this. Do you feel the game is very hard, and if so, is that a "bug" or a feature? If you are still addressing that, how might players expect to see it change in the future?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Schwarz</strong>: Onboarding is a very important topic for us. We realize that while many players fall in love with the game exactly for how unforgiving it can be at times, there is a very hard and sometimes frustrating journey ahead for many before they reach that point or quit before.</p><p dir="ltr">Moving forward, we expect to have further improvements here to better ease new players into the game step-by-step. Hunt, in its core, is a hard game. We feel this is what makes it appealing for many and honestly, is expected of us by our community. That doesn’t mean we cannot make becoming a Veteran Hunter a far smoother and more enjoyable experience, however.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>There are a lot more extraction shooters today than there were in 2018 when Hunt began, and live-service games are always competing with other live-service games outside of their own genre, too. How does the team look at the challenge of staying successful well into the future in such a competitive space?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Schwarz</strong>: We are confident in our core gameplay loop and the overall gameplay experience Hunt offers through its unique setting and features. The aesthetic and world of Hunt is unlike anything else on the market--and when you begin to add in our unique approach to sound and music with elements like Port Sulphur Band, our dedicated in-game band, we offer a distinctive package.</p><p dir="ltr">There are a number of really interesting games on the horizon of course, but we are confident about our strengths and what sets us apart and continue to embrace that to move Hunt forward in the right direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, sometimes that also means pausing for a moment, reflecting on the past updates and doing corrections where needed. We are not perfect, but we are lucky to have such a dedicated community that give us tons of excellent feedback on how they envision the game to be and help correct where we might oversteer. After all, this longstanding relationship with our players is what has helped keep us focused year after year.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>The Garden of the Witch event kicks off today and revamps the weekly challenge system. What went into the decision to change those and how will they alter how players approach the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Sam Tunnel, Game Designer</strong>: The rationale behind the decision to revamp the weekly challenge system was to make the games more varied. We got feedback that the same weapons and ammo types were being used every week to complete the challenges and in some weeks there would be half the teams in the match using the same items as they all had the same challenges. By changing this up by giving players different weekly challenges every week it now means that players will have more varied games and teams won’t be incentivized to use the same items.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of how this will affect players’ approach to games, players can still work together to complete challenges, as many of them are open-ended and complimentary (i.e. Player X will have a challenge for “Deal damage with rifles” and Player Y has a challenge for “Deal damage with Frontier 73C”). It’ll require a little more coordination and ensure that players should encounter less instances of the same items in their games.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>This event also adds more to the story that's always underlying every action in Hunt. Live-service storytelling is an interesting, relatively new facet of games. How much weight does the team give to its overarching mythology? Could we see the Hunt storyline come to other media, such as a movie, TV series, or comic book?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Nicollette Kyle Stewart, Lead Narrative Designer</strong>: A live-service game gives us really unique storytelling opportunities, and it’s something we will continue to experiment with. Storytelling is the lifeblood of any fiction world, and a game’s depth, immersion, and believability all live and die by its worldbuilding. Everything we put in the game--whether Hunter, weapon, or location--unwinds another thread of the bigger story. You can read up on a lot of the archival Hunt lore on our website Mythos, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p><p dir="ltr">As for exploring storytelling media outside of the game, we’ve already had great success utilizing our music in this way. Port Sulphur Band--who are both an in-game story element and a real-life band made up of Crytek developers--release a new single for every event, and every song tells another story from the Hunt universe.</p><p dir="ltr">We’re not ready to share details of other upcoming projects, but Hunt’s world and mythos has incredible storytelling potential, and you can be certain there will be more to come.</p>

                <p>System Shock 3 has been in development hell since 2015, but Nightdive Studio is hoping to give fans some news about the game soon.</p><p>At GDC, Nightdive director of business development Larry Kuperman said that the situation surrounding System Shock 3 is complicated and that he didn't have any updates yet. "Not as yet, not as yet. I don’t know when it’s going to clarify, but it could potentially be within a year," he explained (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nightdive-offers-hopeful-update-on-system-shock-3s-future/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>).

While it's unclear what the franchise's future holds after the release of the System Shock 2 remaster, he said that there were other actions the studio could take with both the first and second games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Since its announcement in 2017, we have been patiently waiting for Witchbrook, the next game from Chucklefish. You might recognize them as the developers known for Starbound and Wargroove, but they also published big indie hits like Stardew Valley, giving us plenty of reasons to be excited. Luckily, the latest Nintendo Direct not only gave us a fresh look at the magically collegiate adventure but also gave us a launch window: holiday 2025.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZWDGCwFZMbk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Witchbrook is a cozy life-sim where players embody a student at the titular magical college. As you take classes and learn spells, you'll be able to bring them into other areas of life, like selling magical decorations at a stand in the town square. Players can also explore the town of Mossport to get jobs, make money, and meet up with their friends. It's all showcased through a cute, isometric, pixelated art style.</p>

<p>The trailer featured cozy mechanics galore. In addition to the aforementioned shop mechanic, you can use a telescope to read the stars, deliver mail to townsfolk, and rearrange your living quarters by using levitation spells to move furniture. The game also supports up to 4-player online co-op, which the new video showcases through footage of four people flying across the town on their brooms. At a different point, we see someone also driving a moped, which seems objectively inferior to a flying broom, but I'll leave the magic to the students of Witchbrook.</p>

<p>A moped? Really?</p>

</article><p>While the trailer was specifically for the Switch version, the game is also headed to Xbox and PC. You can take classes, learn spells, and socialize with your fellow students on the platform of your choice when Witchbrook launches this holiday season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-reveals-battle-zones-and-the-z-a-royale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After the Pokémon Presents earlier this year, we got our first real look at Pokémon Legends Z-A, including gameplay, new characters, and the game's selection of starters. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9OqoRxXUjGA">Today's Nintendo Direct</a> gave us just a bit more information, specifically explaining what the deal was with the mysterious teaser at the end of the previous trailers.</p>

<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A is the second of a new style of mainline Pokémon games, with a free third-person camera, an open world, and revamped combat. While Legends Arceus took place in an ancient Sinnoh region, Legends Z-A is a return to the Kalos region from Pokémon X&amp;Y, allowing players to see what happened after that game's campaign. Given that those titles are the only mainline Pokémon games without sequels or DLC, it's been a highly anticipated return.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tezs2FsIxgA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game takes place entirely within Lumiose City, a huge Paris-like metropolis with multiple districts. Wild Pokémon will now appear in Wild Zones, closed-off areas within the city where the creatures are able to live peaceful lives undisturbed. While this feature appeared in the Pokémon Presents trailer, we only saw what the areas were like during the day. Today's Nintendo Direct revealed they're a bit different once the sun goes down.</p>

<p>At night, Battle Zones appear. While Wild Zones have an inviting green entrance, the Battle Zones are an aggressive red-orange and are full of trainers looking for challengers. Collectively, these encounters are known as the Z-A Royale, a competition where a trainer makes their way from Rank Z to Rank A. Rules here are similar to other games – eye contact with a trainer forces you into a battle – but the new action-based battle system allows for alternate approaches too, like the ability to ambush a trainer with an attack before they see you.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="6e7b3bea-04e4-45bc-91f0-8f11d4375674" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Reach Rank A, and you'll "have a wish granted," though it's not entirely clear who grants the wish and how far their powers go. Examples in the trailer include a taxi driver hoping to abolish all public transit except taxis and a woman hoping the city will host a marathon, so don't go into it expecting to solve world hunger or anything.</p>

<p>The inclusion of Battle Zones raises many questions. When you lose, do you drop ranks? How often can we battle in the daylight, outside of Battle Zones? Who's hosting the Z-A Royale to begin with? We'll have answers once Pokémon Legends Z-A drops on Switch in late 2025.</p>

Today’s trailer reveals a new world Samus unexpectedly finds herself in, the first extended look at combat, and a brand-new suite of powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer unfolded on planet Viewros, a planet of lush jungles including a colossal tree at its center, not unlike Pandora from the Avatar films. To learn more about her surroundings, we see Samus use her trusty scanner to glean information on fauna and flora, some of which, believe it or not, are hostile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first-person gunplay looks familiar but polished like never before. In addition to blasting new alien threats and killer plants with her cannon, Beyond sees Samus become augmented by an ancient force granting her new Psychic powers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmwAhBxakw4" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>These powers grant her telekinetic-like abilities, allowing her to manipulate mechanisms with her mind. We see her turning what looks to be a giant clock hand by simply waving her hand, for example. In combat, Samus can now psychically guide her arm cannon’s projectiles to her targets, essentially turning them into homing blasts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer concludes with a tantalizing tease of a new red and black suit for Samus, but we’ll have to wait and see what abilities accompany her new armor. Unfortunately, Nintendo didn’t reveal a release date, but Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is slated to launch for Switch later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/26/everything-announced-at-the-dreamhaven-showcase<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2020/09/23/mike-morhaime-launches-dreamhaven-with-other-blizzard-veterans">Dreamhaven</a>, a publisher founded in 2020 by Blizzard co-founder and former CEO Mike Morhaime, held its first showcase yesterday detailing updates for a handful of titles from its studios. The publisher was formed alongside other Blizzard alumni to “create and publish original games for players around the world." To that end, it established two internal studios, Secret Door and Moonshot Games, which consist of industry veterans hailing from Blizzard and beyond. Today’s showcase sees Dreamhaven roll the carpet out for their upcoming slate of games in a big way, and if you missed the event live, here’s a quick round-up of notable announcements.</p>

<h2>Wildgate Announced by Moonshot Games</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f2jvZzieaBo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Freshly unveiled for the first time, Wildgate is the space-faring debut title by Moonshot Games. Described as a crew-based first-person shooter, players (called Prospectors) work together as a ship crew to explore a mysterious region of space to steal a powerful artifact called, well, the Artifact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each crew pilots a ship, which takes different shapes and sizes and can be customized with various guns and gadgets. Each crew member sports unique tools and skills, and success depends on how well players cooperate to keep the ship running effectively. That includes jobs like piloting the ship, salvaging loot and resources, and engaging in space combat with hostile aliens and rival treasure hunters. The crew that retrieves the Artifact must race to an exit gate to successfully escape with it. Alternatively, you can also opt to annihilate all rival ships to be the last crew standing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wildgate launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC this year. You can sign up now for a community playtest taking place on April 10-14.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Sunderfolk Gets A Release Date&nbsp;</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rre2LkxZjDQ" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>First announced last October, Sunderfolk aims to streamline the tabletop RPG experience. Up to four players assume the roles of heroes to protect a peaceful animal village from encroaching corruption using their phones or tablets as controllers. This ensures everyone can play, and the lack of physical materials (resources like the rulebook are accessed in the Sunderfolk mobile app) aims to get the party adventuring as quickly and painlessly as possible. Additionally, only the host needs to own the game; everyone else can join in for free.</p>

<p>Featuring six classes to choose from – Arcanist, Bard, Berserker, Pyromancer, Ranger, and Rogue – players can outfit themselves with weapons, armor, skills, and items to face enemies in turn-based tactical battles. Players execute commands using a customizable card deck, and battles encourage cooperation and strategy. Between fights, players will upgrade the village of Arden to add new vendors and cultivate relationships with its residents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curious players can try Sunderfolk now via a free demo, though you’ll have to sign up with NVIDIA GeForce Now to access it. Sunderfolk launches on April 23 for $49.99 and will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Lynked: Banner of the Spark Goes 1.0 This May</h2>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozF5rFIR4Ck" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark launched into Steam Early Access last October, and developer FuzzyBot is preparing to bring it to prime time in a couple of months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This action RPG can be played solo or in co-op and combines roguelite progression with cozy city-building. Players hack ‘n’ slash through waves of robotic enemies, harvest their parts, and then use those materials to expand a home base. When you’re not fighting, you can engage in more laid-back activities at the hub like fishing, harvesting crops, collecting animals, and crafting home decor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 1.0 version will introduce five new chapters, bringing the main campaign up to a total of 40 missions. A new biome, The VoidSpyre, will be introduced along with five new bosses. New weapon mods and skins will also become available for crafting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lynked: Banner of the Spark arrives on May 22 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<p>Additionally, Dreamhaven announced a publishing partnership for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/669330/Mechabellum/">Mechabellum</a>, a mech-themed tactics game that launched last September. A premium edition of the game launches today with over 18 exclusive skins, avatars, and emotes. This version runs for $29.99 versus the previous standard edition’s $14.99.</p>

However, with the announcement of soccer legend Cristiano Ronaldo joining its main roster, the upcoming Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves makes a strong case for hosting one of the more unique and unpredictable guest inclusions.</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of the greatest soccer players to ever step foot on the pitch, holding various individual records and titles, Ronaldo joins the main playable roster of Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Representing his native Portugal in international play, Ronaldo has spent large portions of his career playing for Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. He joined Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia in 2023, where he has played since.</p>

<p>In Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, Ronaldo is voiced by Juan Felipe Sierra. In-game, Ronaldo uses techniques he developed during his career as a footballer to punish his opponents, with his fighting style listed as, “Football + Martial Arts.” You can see how this style plays out through the reveal trailer below.</p>

<p>Ronaldo’s inclusion brings the current main roster size to 15, though that number could still grow en route to next month’s launch. Additionally, we know DLC is on the horizon, as SNK announced last year that two other guest characters, Ken and Chun-Li from the Street Fighter series, will join the roster after launch. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves arrives on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, and PC on April 24. If you’d like to familiarize yourself with other playable Fatal Fury characters before then, Mai Shiranui and Terry Bogard joined the Street Fighter 6 roster by way of downloadable content over the course of 2024.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-is-out-next-week-adding-a-new-class-and-tons-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt</a> press presentation, Grinding Gear Games Game Director Jonathan Rogers sat down to answer several questions from the assembled press, both regarding the new expansion and the game as a whole. You can find the full transcript below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dawn of the Hunt will launch simultaneously on April 4th across all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CnACIrCOkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Path of Exile 2 has two radically different gameplay tempos: the slow, methodical campaign and the faster endgame, more similar to the first game. Do you aim to slow down the end game and provide players with more agency to use slow reactive skills like parry, blocks, and combo skills?</strong></p>
<p>The answer to that is that it's not that in the endgame things suddenly change or anything. It's just that there are various meta builds that I would say were overpowered and have led to a situation where, in order to fight in the endgame effectively, people have tended to center around a few broken things. Now, this patch also contains a full rebalance that will improve a lot of the more broken things that have been going on, which means that we don't have as many people feeling like they're forced into some of that stuff, which should balance things out. The other thing is that we're changing the on-ramp to endgame quite a bit, especially with things like being able to die in the endgame. You should be in a scenario where people don't feel the need to use that staff and those builds are not so much available. We do want to make it so that you can still get very powerful as you go through, but it should be more earned than it is currently, where there's just a few broken things. It will take a while for us to get all that stuff fully resolved. It might take a few iterations before every single broken thing is ironed, but it's a constant goal and we'll get there in the end.</p>
<p><strong>Will unique bosses created by wisps drop increased loot?</strong></p>
<p>Yep, absolutely. That's the whole point.</p>
<p><strong>Are we going to face monsters as strong as we've seen in the first Path of Exile if we juice the wisps too hard?</strong></p>
<p>We've obviously got a very different balance overall. One thing we want to try and avoid is having monsters that are just complete damage sponges. That being said, it is important that you have the ability to make mistakes, to go too far with this kind of stuff. If you add a lot of mechanics to maps, you can get to the point where content becomes very, very difficult, but obviously more rewarding as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any information about the development progress of the Druid class?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce right now. The plan is to announce it and release it as soon as we can. Classes do take a long time. There's a lot of work involved in them. One thing we've definitely learned is that it's hard to promise a specific release timeline for a class.</p>
<p><strong>In the last season, there wasn't much of a balancing nerfing the class skills or items. Are you going to make balance changes during the season or continue the way you did in the last season?</strong></p>
<p>When we went into early access with Path of Exile 2, we did believe that we'd be able to do a bunch of nerfing and that kind of stuff during leagues, which we don't normally do. We quickly found out that it's really just like a live game. You can't just nerf stuff mid-league because it breaks people's builds and they get very angry. We pretty much stopped doing that very quickly. This update will do a huge amount of balance and then anything really egregious we'll fix as it comes up, but generally speaking, we try to leave the balance mostly alone during the league. We now effectively bottle up all of those balance changes and then we release them when we're doing a season. As I said, it's a full game rebalance this time. A lot of the things that players are currently complaining about, like Herald Device and this kind of stuff, will definitely get nerfed this season.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and&nbsp;feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do Rogue exiles have preset items, or will it be completely random?</strong></p>
<p>They do have random items, but I believe that different Rogue exiles have different sets. There are lots of different ones that they can have. There's actually 12 Rogue exiles in this version. The idea is to try and make it so that, basically, the big full set of uniques that could drop from regular content can spawn on them. They all have specific AI for those uniques but they have lots of different options. There'll be Rogue exiles that contain most uniques that you would want to find. They're very interesting fights because they know how to use the items. They're pretty cool and feel very PvP-like. They're dodge rolling around and everything.</p>
<p><strong>A lot of changes in the new content touch on player feedback. How do you balance that with Grinding Gear's vision for Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>We always listen to the players to determine what the problems are, but we still have our ideas with regard to how we're going to solve those problems. The players are really the ones bringing things to our attention. Normally, there'll always be some kind of third way. Like, we've got an idea of how it should be, and the players have an idea of how it should be. If we try to combine the concerns of both us and them, we'll come up with a third way. There are a few issues that aren't like that, but generally speaking, we're always going to be able to come up with some kind of thing that both the players can get excited about and we can feel happy about as well. Ideally, that's the best solution.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any plans to enable players to loot items from the ground in case they die immediately after killing a mob?</strong></p>
<p>That's kind of something that I would say is pretty disliked as far as solutions go, because we tend to avoid things that don't make any physical sense thematically. Obviously, if you're dead you can't pick items. I know that's one of those issues that players are unhappy about, but fundamentally, there is just a thing of if you die, you don't get to loot stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Will the least-played Ascendancies, as Acolyte, Chronomancer, Warbringer, and Witch Hunter, get changed in the update?</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't say Chronomancer is not very well played, but for the others, the overall balance is changing very significantly. The reason why certain Ascendancies are played the most is usually because there's something broken going on with them. It isn't necessarily the case that the less played ones need buffing, although in lots of cases, we will do it. Effectively, all your previous assumptions just need to be thrown in the bin because there's enough changes as far as balance is concerned that you just can't expect things to work exactly the same.</p>
<p><strong>Can the Smith of Katava take multiple of the armor modifiers, and does it require committing one Ascendancy point for each of them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can take as many as you like as long as you have Ascendancy points. It's a question of, do you want to be using the other elements of the class or do you want to go all in on those armor modifiers, which can be pretty powerful. There's just quite a lot of choice there in this class.</p>
<p><strong>What additional uses do you have planned for gold in the future?</strong></p>
<p>I'm not going to announce any right now, but it's just useful having that currency around.</p>
<p><strong>It looks like map portals are tied to the number of resurrects and get lower if it gets harder. If we have some maps with fewer portals to go back and forth, does it mean we won't be able to carry as many items, especially for maps with multiple breaches?</strong></p>
<p>That is the case. However, I guess the theory here is that you shouldn't generally need to take more than an inventory or two full of items. It is a concern, though, and we'll have to see how well it works. I would hope there's something that we can do to alleviate that. I'm just thinking right now that maybe after the map is completed, we could allow potentially more, but I'll have to think about that. It's actually something that I should probably um investigate a bit more.</p>
<p><strong>Will Temporalis get removed or overhauled? It broke the game in several ways.</strong></p>
<p>It's not getting removed and it's not getting overhauled either. It might get nerfed a little bit but I should mention that it's not like everyone should be getting a temporalis just on demand. It's supposed to be a very hard unique to get. Just due to the other balance issues, it meant that getting a Temporalis was much easier than it would have otherwise been. Consider what you actually have to do to get one: you have to be able to play through Sanctum without getting hit one time. It shouldn't be something that is easy to get. Sometimes, we balance things by rarity, like, they are supposed to be a broken thing, but if you get them, they are incredibly ridiculous.</p>
<p>This is one of those cases, but because there were builds that allowed things to be very broken, it just meant that there were too many of them in the economy. Something I just want to stress is that it should be possible to become incredibly powerful. It's just that it shouldn't be the case that you get that without a huge amount of effort. For example, it really was a problem that the pinnacle bosses got killed in like 14 seconds the first time that people fought them. It really should be a long, protracted battle the first time, but of course, once you've played it several times, you've had more time to grind other stuff, you get to the top of the end of what is economically possible.</p>
<p>At that point it's fine to be killing pinnacle bosses in 14 seconds. It's just that it shouldn't be like that the first time. It's a question of getting the power scaling right. When you release a new game, there's just tons of stuff that's unintended.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to. It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Are you planning to adjust the drop rates of currency items?</strong></p>
<p>There's always adjustments. Generally speaking, normal currency is mostly fine. We don't really have a particular issue with it. There are certain things, for example omens are not common enough and we made it so that every ritual has an omen in it now. But I wouldn't say overall that currency items needed a buff or anything like that. We're mostly happy with them.</p>
<p><strong>Any hints about the remaining story? Will they be released individually or maybe as a big story </strong><strong>league or expansion?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning on launching them later. We're not going to announce when that's going to be for the time being, but obviously, they all have to get done by the time we get into full release.</p>
<p><strong>You initially talked about wanting the Path of Exile 2 early access phase to last one year. Now we're a little further in, does it still feel like a realistic goal to reach the state you want for 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>I am definitely very keen to get it done this year. I would be very disappointed if we weren't able to.<br>
It's not 100% guaranteed. We might slip. I'm still very much hoping that we're not going to. Looking at the content of this particular expansion, there's a lot of stuff going on here and a lot of it is reactionary to the problems that we saw with the game, but in the background, we've still got artists and people all working on other acts. There is a lot of behind-the-scenes work going on in creating the rest of the content. We might have released more of that stuff if it hadn't been for the fact that we felt like we had to add a lot of in-game features. Can we get it done this year? I think it's possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to change gold so it isn't a drop item but rather an auto-pickup on kill, like expedition artifacts received that QoL in Path of Exile?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely not. I think it's nice that you pick it up. It's got a relatively large pickup radius; you just run over it. I don't have any particular problems with this myself at this point.</p>
<p><strong>What changes to the trading system can players expect during the Path of Exile 2 early access?</strong></p>
<p>I don't have anything to announce about this, but I do have some things I want to try and improve here. Obviously, currency is much easier to trade. There are other things people want to do with trading. There are things that I would potentially change,&nbsp;and we definitely want to make sure we're testing those changes before the end of early access because it's one of those things that can affect the economy pretty significantly.</p>
<p><strong>Will the new update implement more cosmetics people have unlocked in POE1?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is yes. I don't have a list of them, but we're continuing to move through that list and add more things, so yes, more of them will be added.</p>
<p><strong>Will you please clarify if this update is a league on its own or if there will be several leagues before the next major content update?</strong></p>
<p>Every new update we do will contain a new economy. In this particular case, we decided not to put any of the content exclusive to the new economy, but in the future, we may decide to do that before early access is over. But generally speaking, there's probably going to be more content in these Path of Exile 2 updates than what you would have seen in Path of Exile 1 leagues in the past, just because we're finishing the game at the same time. That should result in a lot. In this particular case, our focus was really more on endgame and making sure there were lots of new encounters to find there. While we did add the wisps throughout the game and we've also added a strongbox&nbsp;and things like that, we didn't think it quite rose to the level of being able to make it exclusive to the league and to be able to call it a challenge league in the way that we would have done in the past.</p>
<p>The wisps were the closest thing to a new league mechanic here, but as I said, we decided not to make them exclusive this time. I am keen to do exclusive challenge league content for future expansions before the end of early access just because when we do that, we can also decide whether we want to remove them, change them, or mess around with them. That's our plan, but honestly, we'll see because, ultimately, everything comes down to the degree to which we want to feel like we're addressing the concerns that people have online.</p>
<p><strong>Currently, having plus level link levels to skills feels like a must since it gives such a large power boost for one mod. Is it intentional? Are there any changes coming to it?</strong></p>
<p>It is intentional and it's exactly the same as having increased physical damage on weapons. There are certain mods that are more powerful than others; that's part of the fun of finding them. It's one of those things, just like how you need run speed on boots. There are certain things that you want to be able to find. You need chase mods in order to make the bad mods feel better. It's just part of the design.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans to add a higher difficulty mode for existing acts?</strong></p>
<p>No, because even the fact that we have two difficulties right now is not the final stage. We'll be removing that difficulty the moment we have the rest of the campaign. The higher-difficulty content is the endgame content, which is already done. While it all looks unique, it technically remixes all the act content and reuses the bosses in different ways. It's not like you don't have high-level content to do; it's just that it's done in a way that feels different from the campaign.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'There is actually a chance of not being able to add all classes in time. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will all the remaining classes be added to early access before release, or could some&nbsp;be held back for the full launch of Path of Exile 2?</strong></p>
<p>There is actually a chance of that. I suspect we're probably not going to have all of them for full release, but we'll see. It depends on how things go and where things end. Obviously, I'd like to get them all in, but they do take a long time to make. The most important thing for the full release is that we have the full campaign, and there's all the content that we need. It's not like we've got a shortage of classes. If we didn't have one or two of them for the full release, that wouldn't be the end of the world. We'll try to get them all in, but if we don't, then whatever.</p>
<p><strong>The last time, you mentioned that Path of Exile 1 will continue receiving updates as long as it has players. Are the current player numbers sufficient to justify ongoing development?</strong></p>
<p>So it absolutely is. The issue with Path of Exile 1 development really just comes down to studio bandwidth from the perspective of designers who know how to make Path of Exile. We don't have a huge number of them. Obviously, we have a bunch of people who work on the game, but in terms of game director tier people who are able to lead a project like that, we don't have enough to the point where we can just be, okay, you just go off and you do your thing.</p>
<p>Mark and I have to keep an eye on it. For that reason, it's been a challenge to get the structure in place so that we can actually get both games rolling. Right now, I think we're getting to that point, but it certainly was a bit rough around the launch of Path of Exile 2's early access where POE 1 stuff got quite paged in order to make POE2 happen. We're going to continue to do that stuff.</p>
<p>With regard to your question, our company had both games in the top 20 player concurrency for Steam at one point a few weeks ago. I'd certainly say that both games have their place with<br>
regard to player popularity. It's definitely worth continuing to support Path of Exile 1.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any mana cost changes?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. I don't even know what they are because, as I said, everything's just been rebalanced. Some will go up; some will go down, and some will go sideways. For the specifics, you're going to have to wait for the patch notes to see.</p>
<p><strong>Will Path of Exile 2 and its predecessor alternate new seasons from now on, or will there be another Path of Exile 2 season after Dawn of the Hunt?</strong></p>
<p>There will be another Path of Exile 1 season between Dawn of the Hunt and the next Path of Exile 2 season for sure. As for how it works going forward, we're keen to alternate them, but it's going to come down to the realities of development and what happens. Certainly the eventual goal by the time everything is rolling and working smoothly, it will definitely be the case that they're going to alternate like that, but I can imagine scenarios during early access of POE 2 where POE 1 might end up with a delay here or there.</p>
<p><strong>Any plans for the endgame map to have an option to place bookmarks or better navigation changes?</strong></p>
<p>We actually do have plans for this. Unfortunately, they didn't make it for this update. We have UI designs. I have a feeling you might see them in 0.21. We definitely know that that's an issue, but our UI guys were quite busy. We'll get to it.</p>
<p><strong>With the Atlas tree expanding, are we going to have more points for the Atlas tree?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you are. Actually, I don't remember the number now. Both the corrupted Nexus objective and the unique map objectives get you Atlas points. Both the tree and the points have expanded.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Grinding Gear Games has unveiled Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt, a huge free expansion to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed action RPG title</a> currently in early access. The expansion launches next week on all platforms; don't forget to also check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunt-qa-throw-everything-you-knew-in-the-bin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press roundtable Q&amp;A with Game Director Jonathan Rogers</a>, who revealed even more details about the expansion and the game's future.</p>
<p>Dawn of the Hunt introduces the first new class since the early access of Path of Exile 2: the huntress. She is a spear-wielding warrior born into a society with strict traditions. She was exiled from her homeland after using her powers to defend her. She specializes in both melee and ranged combat, dashing into and out of battle. Spears have extended range and a short dash, but unlike other melee weapons, you can also throw them. In order to make a hybrid ranged/melee character work, the developers had to think about ways to make it fun to both enter and exit the melee range. The first skill players will get as a Huntress is Whirling Slash.</p>
<p>As well as striking in a circle the player, the skill creates a whirlwind that blinds enemies. Leaving the whirlwind will make it explode, and the more Whirling Slash is used, the bigger the explosion gets. Once out of melee, the Huntress can follow up with something ranged. She can whip the spear around to shoot twisters towards foes. These twisters bounce off walls and can hit enemies multiple times. Twisters can also be thrown inside a whirlwind to shoot out extra tornadoes that do way more damage. In her off-hand, the Huntress will hold a buckler which allows her to Parry.</p>
<p>While holding that down, the character will counterattack any incoming attack from nearby monsters, stunning them. Additionally, the monsters will take extra attack damage from your follow-up strike. Some of the specific class skills have been designed to be used after a Parry.</p>
<p>Disengage is a skill that does a quick jump back, damaging enemies in front of you. It can be used to interrupt other actions like dodge roll. If you use it against a parried enemy, it causes an explosion and gives you a frenzy charge. However, the Huntress cannot Parry too much, lest they get stunned and possibly killed.</p>
<p>The Huntress also has a variety of elemental spear throw attacks. Lightning Spear bounces lightning between your foes. Explosive Spears can be thrown into the ground and detonate after a while, incinerating anyone caught in the blast. All spear throws can also be empowered by frenzy charges. For example, Explosive Spears will cause an even larger explosion and leave fire on the ground. These empowered versions can activate even more combos. Using Whirling Slash off a ground fire will suck it into the whirlwind, adding fire to the explosion. Using Twisters inside a fire whirlwind will shoot out fire tornadoes as well, and you can do similar combos with ice and lightning, too.</p>
<p>A key aspect of hunting is exhausting your foes by causing blood loss. Rake dashes towards your target and unleashes a deadly slash opening up wounds on your enemies. You can follow up with Disengage and watch them bleed out as they run towards you. On the monsters health bar, you can see how much blood loss the enemy has experienced. The Huntress has skills to take advantage of this: for example, using Blood Hunt will thrust forward and cause a bloody explosion. the more blood loss, the bigger the explosion. Thunderous Leap will allow you to jump onto and explode any Spears either in the ground or in your enemies.</p>
<p>As well as hunting animals, the Huntress also has the ability to work with them. While fighting any beast, you have the ability to tame it and use it as a companion. You can only have one companion at a time, but it will keep the mods that were on it. Try to find a rare beast with good mods to take full advantage of your ability to tame. There's a huge amount of synergy between ranged and melee options. There are a total of 22 new skills available for the Huntress.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ritualist-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The first Ascension class you could choose is the Ritualist, which has embraced the darker side and harnessed the power of animal sacrifice and plague. The Corrupted Life Force skill causes all enemies around you to grow volatile blood boils on their skin. When those enemies are slain, the boils will burst, spreading corrupted blood to all enemies around them. The Ritualist also excels in taking advantage of magical trinkets. The Unfurled Finger skill allows you to equip an additional ring on a finger. Taking Mystic Attunement increases the bonuses of all the rings and Amulets you have equipped. You can even cut your own hand sacrificing some of your own blood to empower yourself.</p>
<p>The Amazon Ascension is for those looking to hunt more than just beasts. Trained as a guard to the most important Elders, the Amazon will use more traditional fighting techniques mastered to perfection. The Predatory Instinct skill will cause you to reveal weaknesses in the defenses of rare and unique enemies, allowing you to deal more damage. You can see those weak spots represented on their life bars. While using Elemental Infusion, any charges you consume will infuse your weapon with elemental power, causing any projectile attacks to explode on impact. The Critical Strike skill is as simple as it sounds: it takes your accuracy and gives it to you as Critical Strike chance.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also brings three new Ascendancy classes for other classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lich (Witch) -</strong> The Lich tears their own soul apart, becoming a master of undeath and chaos. The Lich is a master of Chaos and Curses who can use her own life to enhance her Energy.</li>
<li><strong>Smith of Kitava (Warrior) -</strong> The Smith of Kitava forges weapons of destruction in fire and suffering. Embrace sheer power and take Smithing skills to greater heights by resonating with the insatiable one - Kitava.</li>
<li><strong>Tactician (Mercenary) -</strong> The mercenary Tactician brings military-grade brutality to the battlefield. As a former trained Blackguard Elite, the Tactician is able to decimate the monsters of Wraeclast while earning a healthy income at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<p>The expansion also adds two new skills:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raise Spectre -</strong> This skill lets you trap and summon the souls of almost any monster in the game. With hundreds of monster variants in Path of Exile 2, expect endless experimentation to find the perfect undead army.</li>
<li><strong>Summon Rhoa Mount -</strong> Call forth a Rhoa to fight by your side or mount it to move at full speed while attacking. But beware, taking too much damage can knock you off, leaving you vulnerable to a brutal fate.</li>
</ul>
<p>This expansion also brings a massive overhaul to character development by adding over 100 new Support Gems to enhance build diversity. Support gems add a variety of interesting effects to your existing skills, modifying them in game-changing ways. For example, Haemocrystals turn bleed effects into explosive Vaal crystals, and Caltrops allow your existing skills to litter the battlefield with slowing hazards.</p>
<p>A big focus of the expansion is to expand on the endgame. There are over a hundred new unique items, ensuring high-level characters have more thrilling bounty to chase. New crafting tools have also been introduced as rewards across many areas of the game:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 20 new runes have been added allowing you to craft new mods onto your gear</li>
<li>Runes now scale with multiple tiers, allowing for stronger mods that remain viable in the endgame.</li>
<li>We're expanding crafting options further by introducing more specialized socketable mods, with the first wave arriving in an upcoming content update.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's more. The so-called Azmeri Spirit has made itself present in Wraeclast. When approached, these wisps will flee, and monsters coming into contact will be infused by it, making them more powerful. Wisps will also find and possess Rare or Unique monsters, granting them powerful new abilities, and powerful new rewards. There are twelve distinct types of wisp, each with their own mechanics and rewards.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt adds eight new Maps to the game, offering fresh challenges and rewards. In each case, players will have interesting new encounters to look forward to, such as&nbsp; being forced to fight mirrored Rare monsters in a shifting, warped reality in The Fractured Lake, or being thrust into the wild Ezomyte Forests of The Phaaryl Megaliths where rune-carved stones surge with energy. Survive the storm-fueled gauntlet of deadly boss waves, and you’ll earn full boss rewards and exclusive Runes.</p>
<p>The update introduces four new Unique Strongboxes, each with deadly mechanics and valuable rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ogham's Legacy features a rune-carved stone and a slain creature that, when activated, revives as a powerful Rare. Each defeat triggers another resurrection with added modifiers making the fight progressively more difficult, but also more rewarding.</li>
<li>Ixchel’s Torment harnesses ancient Vaal thaumaturgy, unleashing Chaos-empowered guardians to protect a powerful artifact. Victors will be rewarded with a unique item featuring a specific Corrupted outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p>Essences also received major upgrades, with four new Corrupted Essences - Hysteria, Delirium, Horror, and Insanity - offering new combat mechanics and powerful new crafting outcomes, such as guaranteed double Enchantments when using a Vaal Orb on belts.</p>
<p>Corruption has continued to spread throughout Wraeclast and has formed into larger and larger zones. In the center of each one lies a Corrupted Nexus, the home of three new terrifying bosses, amalgamations of Corruption itself. Upon defeating these bosses, any remaining areas within the zone of Corruption will become cleansed. Cleansed Maps have additional new monsters, a new boss, and their own set of Modifiers and rewards.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/RogueExilesCinematic-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt also introduces Rogue Exiles - others like you who have been exiled and are openly hostile. They will challenge you in a fight to the death. These NPCs have the ability to Dodge Roll and avoid your abilities with smart pathfinding, smart targeting, and much more action-packed gameplay. Rogue Exiles use the same skills available to players, and even the same items. They aren't just dressed up in those items; they know how to take advantage of the Uniques they are using, which, of course, will be available for players once they have prevailed.</p>
<p>Lastly, there's a significant rebalance of the endgame. The number of towers has been drastically reduced, but they have been made much more powerful. Tablets now affect twice as many areas and running higher tier Maps in Towers increases this number further still. In addition, each Tower will be able to consume up to three Tablets at once. These changes greatly reduce the amount of busy work required in the endgame while improving the player's ability to use them. On top of that, Towers can now spawn with all mechanics, and have their own new Bosses.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt will launch on Friday, April 4.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-the-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick.1147107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-update-011-full-patch-notes" rel="nofollow"><em>Path of Exile 2</em></a>, the long-awaited sequel to a cherished ARPG, is fully underway and players have had the chance to dive head first into its sumptuous content. It <em>is</em> in Early Access, however, so we can expect many updates with new inclusions. That said, Patch 0.2.0, dubbed <em>Dawn of the Hunt</em>, is sure to shake things up with tons of new content.</p>

<p>Along with the brand new Huntress class in <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>, there are also three new ascendancies (and two for the Huntress) that will drastically change up how you play. This is what I want to focus on, because outside of additional endgame changes, players are chomping at the bit for new characters to play.</p>

<p>Introducing the Huntress, a spear-wielding range and melee hybrid class that can tame wild beasts and channel elements and spirits to slay her foes. Her signature spear can be used to fight enemies up close, or you can throw it at enemies as a ranged attack.</p>



<p>One of the Huntress' signature abilities is the Whirling Slash, which sets a whirlwind on the ground that blinds enemies and causes damage. In a press-only preview of this class, we saw her use this ability multiple times to create a larger whirlwind. You can also enhance the whirlwind by using certain elemental attacks, creating fire or lightning-based tornadoes, as an example.</p>

<p>What stuck out to us, however, was the ability to tame beasts. The Huntress can choose a companion from enemy beasts, though we don't quite know the limitations. What we do know is that it allows players to tame rares -- even those with monster-only modifiers -- so you'll want to keep a look out for those with good synergy with your build.</p>

<p>"There is going to be some level of competition for getting the rares," said which have the best mods, because they come with all the powers they had while they were rare, so you're probably going to want to keep an eye out..." said <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>Game Director Johnathan Rogers during a press Q&amp;A TechRaptor attended.</p>



<p>Her two ascendancy classes -- which are essentially specializations to further improve your character -- include Ritualist and Amazon. The former is a "forbidden magic" archetype while the latter is more of your typical spear-wielding warrior focusing on furiously attacking your enemy.</p>

<p>The Witch, Mercenary, and Warrior also get one new ascendancy class each. The Witch can become a Lich, the Mercenary a Tactician, and the Warrior a Smith of Kitava. The Smith of Kitava is a very intriguing take on ascendancy classes -- other than being able to improve your weapons mid-battle, you can also drastically alter your armor.</p>

<p>The Smith of Kitava can allocate ascendancy points to disconnected nodes on their skill tree, which essentially adds modifiers to their armor. This would replace the stats on your armor with whatever node you choose, but it allows you to pick modifiers that are much more powerful or even unobtainable from normal loot drops.</p>

<p>"In terms of fulfilling an interesting part of your build, they're just pretty cool," said Rogers. "Now the other thing as well, if you want, because you can choose how many other of the ascendancy nodes or how much of the armor crafting nodes you want, you can put all of your mods -- like you can put all eight ascendancy points into that, and now you have, that's a pretty damn powerful armor you have at that point."</p>



<h2>What other Changes Are Coming to <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>?</h2>

<p>There are a <em>slew</em> of other changes including a skill gem that gives you a mount to ride on, but to go over each and every change would be a Sisyphean task, so be sure to check Grinding Gear Games' announcement <a href="http://pathofexile.com/dawn-of-the-hunt-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">here</a>. As a quick rundown, players can expect dozens of new skills, new maps, endgame changes, and even rogue exiles.</p>

<p>Rogue exiles are NPCs players can fight that and have the same abilities as other players, including dodge rolling. They are smarter in nature and drop the loot set they're wearing, meaning there's a high risk of engaging them, but the reward is worth it.</p>

<p>With <em>Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt</em>, players can dive back or continue playing with tons of new added content. This particular update launches on April 4th at 3pm EST, so you won't have to wait long to dive into these new additions.</p>

<p>The Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 3 roadmap is live now. It provides new details about the Zombies mode, including the Shattered Veil map and new enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-map-shattered-veil">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 Map: Shattered Veil</h2>



<p>Shattered Veil is the new map for Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 on April 2. It is set in an old mansion called Colton Hall. Players have arrived to meet S.A.M. with the Sentinel Artifact in their possession. They must unlock the mysteries of this artefact with the help of S.A.M.’s synthetic mind; however, things will not be that easy for them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players must enter Colton Hall and confront the new tyrant from the next chapter of the Black Ops 6 Zombies narrative. The map features different areas to explore, including a main hall with a massive fossil exhibit, an outdoor area, and a basement to unearth all kinds of mysteries.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-season-3-brings-new-zombies-enemies">Black Ops 6 Season 3 Brings New Zombies Enemies</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has revealed brand new enemies for the Zombies mode. First up is the Elder Disciple, a strange floating apparition found in the mansion’s estate. These enemies can use dark magic to summon more undead to the battle and even force them to evolve. Low-ranking zombies can transform into a Doppelghast or some other sinister form with the help of the Elder Disciple.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zombies Season 3 also sees the arrival of other entities from the Shattered Veil. Players should keep an eye out for the toxic zombie, as it can leave a damaging pool of acid around it. However, it is easy to spot, with its greenish hue and more skeletal exterior, and it makes shrieking sounds when close.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-zombies-season-3-new-weapons">Black Ops 6 Zombies Season 3 New Weapons</h2>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Season 3 Roadmap has introduced two new wonder weapons for the Zombies mode: the Ray Gun Mark II and the Wunderwaffle DG-2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Ray Gun Mark II allows players to attack multiple Zombies simultaneously through a three-round burst of energy and doubles as a bludgeoning instrument. Players can also test three different variants of the Ray Gun Mark II. The W variant provides similar bullet patterns as a submachine gun, the P variant mimics a shotgun, and the R variant can be compared to a Marksman Rifle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other new weapon is Wunderwaffle DG-2, the best way to electrify hordes of zombies quickly. Players can use this weapon to inflict chain-lighting bolts that can stun crowds and provide terminal damage over time.&nbsp;</p>
