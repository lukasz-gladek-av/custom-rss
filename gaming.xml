                <p dir="ltr">I'm standing in the Skywatch area of the Cosmodrome, Old Russia, in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, with a few other random players, and we're waiting for enemies to spawn. A Hive Tomb ship appears in the sky right over my head and drops off exactly two enemies, and I blast away at them with a machine gun. The other players sprint over, swooping in like hawks, but I manage to snag the two kills before they can, so they jump back onto rooftops and boulders to wait for the next batch of baddies and try again. A lot of long, boring seconds pass before any more enemies spawn and we all repeat the scramble.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm shooting these particular fish in this particular barrel because it's a requirement to unlock the Legend title, a social marker of in-game achievements that appears beneath your name. Another player getting a kill means I don't, so we're all competing against each other to spend the least amount of time here. Developer Bungie added this title to the game in honor of the 10th anniversary of the original Destiny, and the objective I'm working on is a joking nod to the early days of that game. We have to kill a bunch of enemies in the Skywatch and loot "engrams," or weapon/armor drops, from them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366042" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366042"></a><figcaption>Hello Darkness, my old friend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366042-destiny2skywatch.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">See, back when Destiny launched in 2014, the grind to increase your level and reach the requirements for its endgame content--the Vault of Glass raid--was awful. After a certain point, your strength was determined by the stats on your gear, so you were always chasing weapons and armor with higher levels. Gear was dolled out stingily; you could get it from playing Strike missions, but only in unpredictable fits and starts, and from random drops when you killed aliens. But the gear was never guaranteed to be <em>better</em> than what you already had.</p><p dir="ltr">Then players discovered the Loot Cave, a spot in the Cosmodrome's Skywatch where enemies would spawn almost endlessly if you killed them fast enough. So we all stood on a rock in the Skywatch, which was the correct distance from the cave to keep from interfering with the spawn rates, and just shot into the crowd. Engrams would drop randomly, but there were so many enemies that this increased the drop rate from annoyingly rare to stupidly bountiful. This was still incredibly boring, but it was at least more efficient than playing the same few Strikes over and over and getting nothing for your efforts.</p><p dir="ltr">Back in today's Skywatch, I'm standing on a rock and waiting for enemies to appear, which they do in greater or lesser numbers, for about half an hour. In that time, exactly <em>one</em> engram drops. I grab it, hoping I'm done with this uninspired callback to the worst of Destiny, and check my progress: 7%. I need another 13 engrams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366000"></a><figcaption>Standing around for hours to make a number go up slightly is pretty true to the original Destiny experience.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366000-20240909133908_1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><em>Yup</em>, I think. <em>This feels like Destiny.</em></p><p dir="ltr">If you told me this Skywatch objective was a straight-up troll on the Destiny community for the Loot Cave, I'd believe you. Contemplating the roughly three hours I'd have to spend to complete this, I could see it being a brilliant prank, if it seemed like there was a punch line in there somewhere. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-grasp-of-avarice-dungeon-is-hilariously-salty-about-a-7-year-old-exploit/1100-6499082/">Bungie already made this joke in a funnier and more clever way with the Grasp of Avarice dungeon</a> during the studio's 30th Anniversary--an event that felt like a true celebration.</p><p dir="ltr">Much more likely, however, is that the engram drop rate just a stupid oversight that turns something fun into something disappointing--and since <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1833655242820587864" rel="nofollow ">Bungie says it'll tweak enemy density in the Skywatch</a>, it seems that's the case. Something fun turning out to be something disappointing is in keeping with the rest of Destiny's 10-year anniversary, though.</p><p dir="ltr">There's next to nothing on offer to mark Destiny's 10th year, in fact. On September 9, the actual anniversary of Destiny's launch, Bungie added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/destiny-2-cayde-stash-guide-how-to-get-the-destiny-anniversary-armor/2900-5757/">five secret chests you could uncover in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location</a>, all of which are barely hidden, and which give you a set of armor inspired by looks from the original game's concept art. And there's the aforementioned title, which you can unlock by completing a few objectives that recall the original game in some slightly nostalgic ways, but mostly just include wearing the armor and playing some activities--the Skywatch objective is by far the most arduous, and sooner or later, that'll see a fix. Titles are most interesting when they're tough to earn or require you to do novel things to get them, but the Legend title is so easy to nab (again, three hours of boredom notwithstanding) that it's doubtful anyone would ever bother using it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364142" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364142"></a><figcaption>This is about all there is to the Destiny anniversary inside Destiny 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1581/15811374/4364142-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_locations_compressed_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Earning the title does come with a sort of celebratory reward--like with the 30th Anniversary, you get the opportunity to preorder a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-ace-of-spades-hand-cannon-has-been-nerfed-but-not-that-way/1100-6526386/">limited-edition Destiny Nerf gun</a>, which is, admittedly, pretty cool (although <a href="https://x.com/Tofu_Rabbit/status/1833851336607101076" rel="nofollow ">an artist accused Bungie on Twitter/X</a> of stealing their design for a physical version of the in-game weapon, created some nine years ago). Disclosure: I bought the Nerf Gjallarhorn last time this happened, and regret nothing.</p><p dir="ltr">But there's nothing to buy in the in-game Eververse store; there are no in-game events commemorating the moment; and there is very little reason to care, overall.</p><p dir="ltr">That feels incredibly weird. It's true that this is the anniversary of <em>Destiny</em> and not <em>Destiny 2</em>, the game we're playing now, but in the ways that matter most, the distinction really just comes down to the number on the box--overall, the whole thing is, truly, just Destiny.</p><p dir="ltr">What's more, we just saw the culmination of the Light and Darkness Saga, the story that first began on September 9, 2014, with what might have been the best hunk of Destiny content Bungie has made. With <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">The Final Shape</a>, Destiny 2 felt like it was finally achieving what Bungie had always wanted Destiny to be--combining fun shooter fundamentals with a strange and fascinating world easy to get lost in, populated by interesting characters telling emotional stories.</p><p dir="ltr">This should be Bungie's victory lap. Instead, people seem to be wandering out of the stadium and heading to their cars.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366041" data-ratio="0.5605738575983" data-width="1882" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366041"></a><figcaption>Destiny developers delivered exactly what they promised and a lot more with The Final Shape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366041-destiny-2-the-final-shape-bu-2560x1440.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Back when Bungie first announced the game, it did so citing a 10-year journey for players, and at the time, that seemed a bit ludicrous. But here we are, taking the final steps, and the journey has been, in a lot of ways, pretty incredible. You don't have to be a fan or player to acknowledge that, in terms of longevity, popularity, development, and influence, Destiny is in a category occupied by few others. It has invented and reinvented itself again and again, evolving toward what was envisioned from the start over the course of a decade, and repeatedly dodging the accusation of being a "dead game." Its success has had an outsized effect on the larger gaming industry--often for the worse, as happens when corporations chase trends--and continues to show what can be exciting about the concept of a "live game."</p><p dir="ltr">And truly, there just aren't that many instances of a decade-long legacy like what's happened with Destiny. There are other MMOs in this club, certainly, and multiplayer games like Team Fortress 2 or Counter-Strike 2. It doesn't take long before you're talking about series and franchises, though, brand names attached to games and sequels releasing for years. The Destiny 10th anniversary, despite its semantic weirdnesses of including a technical sequel, is still a rare accomplishment.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet despite the studio and the community taking a decade-long journey together, there's almost nothing to commemorate it. I'm standing in the Skywatch, shooting two enemies per minute, trying to unlock a title I'll never use because it feels like it was thrown together at the last second and indicative of nothing about my time spent with this game. Disclosure: I won't be buying the Nerf gun this time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366043" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366043"></a><figcaption>You can also get the Nerf look for your in-game Ace of Spades.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366043-2024_10th_anniversary_press_kit_gear_compressed_004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It doesn't seem much of a stretch to speculate as to why Destiny's 10th anniversary feels slapdash. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/">Bungie cut around 220 people in July</a>, less than two months after releasing The Final Shape. That round of layoffs included a bunch of key talent, ranging from longtime executives to members of the writing staff who had helped to grow Destiny 2 into something that felt like more than just another live game. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/">Bungie had fired around 100 people</a> less than a year before in November as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Really, what's there to celebrate? Player counts are down following The Final Shape, somewhat more than the usual ebb following the high of an expansion, and <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the" rel="nofollow ">The Final Shape reportedly sold less well than Lightfall</a>, the expansion before it. After purchasing Bungie for $3.6 billion in 2022, Sony seems primed to make further changes or cuts to the studio going forward. What seemed like a bright future for the Destiny franchise less than two years ago now is much, much darker, despite Bungie laying out a loose look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/">next year-plus of Destiny 2</a> in a series of blog posts dropped this past Monday alongside the in-game update.</p><p dir="ltr">A lackluster, barely acknowledged anniversary is what happens when you lay off a huge chunk of your team, right at the height of your game franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Every time I talk about the original Destiny, I feel honor-bound to loudly admit that I didn't much like it, and to discuss how much that position changed over time. As Bungie found the stride in Destiny and Destiny 2, ironing out its worst, most grindy instincts, cutting the time-wasting busywork, and leaning into the unique, fun strangeness of what it had created, I liked it more and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366044" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4366044"></a><figcaption>The Final Shape feels like what Destiny was always trying to be.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4366044-2024_final_shape_launch_press_kit_characters_compressed_004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yes, Destiny still often encompasses the many issues of live-service forever games, defined by the need to keep players on an endless treadmill of upward mobility so they'll spend a few bucks on microtransactions, but it also encompasses the best ideas, too. It could tell fascinating stories that took advantage of its sprawling world and deep lore. It was often immersive and fantastical in ways few other games could be. It showered us with inventive challenges of gameplay and teamwork that I haven't seen matched in any other game. Destiny started as something interesting, but it <em>became </em>something notable, and often laudable, in the medium of games.</p><p dir="ltr">There are two more episodes of content coming to Destiny 2 and expansions planned through 2025, so despite the massive chilling effect yet more layoffs have had on the Destiny community and Bungie itself, it's premature to say that there is no future for Destiny. But it's 10 years on, and I'm standing in the Skywatch, waiting for enemies to spawn, wondering if the future of Destiny will look much different from the past.</p>

        <p>Insider testing starts this week.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/11/new-xbox-friends-and-followers-experience/">announced</a> it's bringing friend requests back to Xbox after more than a decade, with its new "friends and followers experience" set to go live for Insiders this week.
</p>
<p>
Xbox hasn't had friend requests since 2013, when - as part of its transition from Xbox 360 to Xbox One - Microsoft introduced a social-media-style system making it possible to follow activity feeds without the need for explicit approval. If the other party reciprocates, a follower becomes a friend, so both can chat, message, and game.
</p>
<p>
Soon, though, Xbox will introduce a more traditional "two-way, invite-approved" friend request system that Microsoft says will give users "more control and flexibility". This'll sit alongside the existing "one-way" follower system, so users can still easily follow player, club, or game feeds.
</p>

<p>
Once the change comes into effect, friend requests can be sent, accepted, or deleted from the Xbox guide's People tab - and all existing friends and followers will update automatically when the system goes live, their status remaining unchanged.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's updated friend system will also be accompanied by new privacy and notification settings, giving players the tools (available both on-machine and online) to set notifications and determine who can send them friend requests or follow their account.
</p>
<p>
All this will initially launch for Alpha Skip-Ahead users on Xbox consoles, plus PC Gaming preview members on Windows PCs and handheld devices, "beginning this week". It'll then be rolled out to everyone once testing is complete. "We want to thank all the Xbox Insiders for the feedback you share with us," Microsoft adds. "Your feedback is a key part of our process."

            <p>Post-apocalyptic roguelike Neo Scavenger is one of my favourite games, but its spacefaring followup <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ostranauts">Ostranauts</a>, currently in Early Access, is currently too fiddly and complicated for me. Here's some good news, then: Kitfox, masters of making impenetrable roguelikes more welcoming, have joined the project as publisher ahead of a planned 1.0 release in 2025.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ostranauts is a "hardcore noir space-sim", in which you scavenge shipwrecks in order to expand and customise your own ship. Every system onboard your vessel can be interacted with via its own panel of buttons and displays, and it's all but inevitable that you will die due to your own incompetence or carelessness. The only hope is that the death is interesting.
</p>
<p>I badly want to create a captain, hire a crew, build a ship, and go die in space, but as soon as I see a UI with 18 buttons on it, and have no immediate idea what they do, I'm out. Even if, beyond those quality-of-life issues, Nate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ostranauts-is-a-very-ambitious-space-game-but-i-think-its-going-to-work">had plenty of kind words for Ostranauts around its initial launch</a>.
</p>
<p>Hopefully Kitfox can help. They're the publisher behind the recent Steam release of Dwarf Fortress, who helped take that game from ASCII art and obtuse keyboard controls to something much friendlier, without compromising the spirit or depth of the simulation. They're also currently working on the 1.0 release of Caves Of Qud, due later this year, which is a similarly inscrutable roguelike that has been in development for fifteen years.
</p>
<p>Or maybe this is just wishful thinking on my part. Ostranauts is already more visual and legible than both Dwarf Fortress and Caves Of Qud, and there's no specific mention of work to make the game graspable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1022980/view/4584188879515294936">in the announcement of the partnership with Kitfox</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, I'm looking forward to giving Ostranauts another go with its full release. Neo Scavenger is truly brilliant: a roguelike set in a handcrafted world where you're as likely to die from eating the wrong mushrooms as from a hard-scrabble fist fight with an alien. It <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-combat-2014-neo-scavenger">has the best combat of any game released in 2014</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve loved it since the days of its alpha tests and I still love it now, in the form of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Sometimes it’s been hard to love , whether that’s due to stumbles in its live-service offerings or its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196">reckless ownership</a></span> that resulted in years of creative turbulence and constant overhaul. Perhaps, in the wake of mass layoffs earlier this year and these massive changes, the celebration of this tremendous milestone has been somewhat muted, but that hasn’t stopped me from getting in my bag about it all.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

My Warlock, who has stood with me since September 9, 2014, is currently donning a look that has felt annoyingly out of reach for ten years—he looks like I pictured him as a bright-eyed teenager.</p><p>Additionally, Bungie has added a new title to be earned in the game to complement the occasion. Players who finish a few perfectly reasonable tasks (and one bothersome one) can equip the Legend moniker. I’m not a Title hunter, having only earned a single one in the past, but considering the ease of it and my love for <em>Destiny</em>, I’ve begun to chip away at it. By the weekend, I should already have it. I’ll have fulfilled the first game’s tagline all these years later: “Become legend.”<br></p><p>The tasks that need to be completed to earn the Legend title are, predictably, nostalgic. For one of them, you have to fight enemies and grind for loot engrams in the Skywatch area of the Cosmodrome, the first ever destination in <em>Destiny</em>. It’s a place I know like the back of my hand after grinding away in my youth, and it’s a place I rarely visit in <em>Destiny 2</em>, which is filled to the brim with more exciting locales with ongoing stories. By comparison, the Cosmodrome feels like a snapshot frozen in time. When I jump in there, I’m suddenly back in my high school uniform and running home after last period to get back to the game that would go on to consume my life for a decade. It’s nice being back.<br></p><p>As I queued up the weekly Nightfall strike (a mission designed to be enjoyed with a full fireteam that is otherwise made harder with modifiers) the location read “Cosmodrome,” and I began racking my brain to determine which level it could possibly be. Eventually, a soft pang hit me as the realization dawned on me that I’d be revisiting the Devil’s Lair, <em>Destiny</em>’s first strike, in a move that would be a hell of a coincidence if it wasn’t definitely purposeful. Completing the Devil’s Lair back in TK was the moment where <em>Destiny </em>clicked for me— we’ve been inseparable since. I know every last beat of that mission to the point where I coast through it on autopilot, and as I ran it for the first time this week, all the while still in my <em>D1</em>-inspired anniversary armor, I felt the magnitude of my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">decade-long history and relationship with the game</a></span> crash over my body. I didn’t sob, but I did tear up. It’s been such a long ride and I can’t believe we’re still here, ten years later, running the Devil’s Lair ad nauseam.<br></p><p>It all takes me back to a time when it felt like <em>Destiny </em>had a million things to prove, and I believed in its ability to do so. I had nothing to go on but Bungie’s pedigree at the time, and as a kid, I ate that shit up. That feels significantly harder to do given the increasingly precarious position Bungie finds itself in these days and the tide having turned against live-service games like <em>Destiny 2</em>. I keep hoping against hope that it can weather the storm, if only because despite everything, <em>Destiny </em>still means the world to me. I don’t know that I’d be lost without it, but I also can’t quite picture my life or career without it.<br></p><p>As <em>Destiny 2 </em>stares down the barrel of another few <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-content-packs-no-expansions-bungie-layoffs-1851611360">uncertain years</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-codename-frontiers-loot-expansions-free-1851643541">reinvents itself and its formula once again</a></span>, I’m just glad to have been here at all, to have fallen for the first game’s mystique, to have plumbed the depths of the moon’s hellmouth. to have defeated countless Hive royalty and gods, avenged characters who have transcended their simplistic caricatures, befriended once enemies, explored and wielded the darkness, and made countless memories with cherished friends along the way. And to have played a small part in this wild, inscrutable, and highly inconsistent ride. This journey began ten years ago in this little pocket of Old Russia, and look where we’ve gone since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One of the cool features introduced with the Hero Talent tree is for hunters, which introduces the Dark Ranger Hero Talent tree that lets us live out our wildest Sylvannas Windrunner fantasy.</p><figure id="" data-id="1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-recommend-id="image://1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-recommend-id="image://1e52780d8a2f924e6e4d102f846c04bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alternative Hero Talent trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The number of Hero Talent specs to choose from will depend on what class you play. For example, Demon Hunters will only be able to choose from Aldrachi Reaver and Fel-Scarred, while Druids will have Druid of the Claw, Elune’s Chosen, Keeper of the Grove, and Wildstalker to choose from.<br></p><p>With that said, most of the classes have two trees to choose from as they would for their main specialization. It is also worth noting that each of these Hero talent trees are only available for certain specs. Let’s take the Druid as an example once again: Feral and Restoration Druids have the Wildstalker Hero Talent tree as an option, while Balance and Guardian Druids have access to the Elune’s Chosen tree. This is all dependent on your current main specialization, so you will not have access to all four Hero trees as a Restoration Druid.</p><figure id="" data-id="2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-recommend-id="image://2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-recommend-id="image://2790315babda8465bf09d80b06e283ff" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The main ability in Hero Talents." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each Hero Talent tree builds on abilities you currently have in your toolkit, but will also start with a new Keystone talent that can be either a new ability or based on an ability you already have. The bottom of this new tree is known as the Capstone talent, which adds power to the Keystone talent at the top, or blends all of the themes in the tree to create a cohesive build.<br></p><p>Each of these new talents build on another, and one key difference between this tree and your main talent tree is that all of them unlock once you hit level 80, so no need to pick and choose what you feel is more important along the way.</p><hr><p>So get in there, start spending points in your Hero Talent trees, to make the most of new skills available in <em>World of Warcraft The War Within. </em><br></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Kyoto's Nintendo Museum is getting a special Pokémon-themed manhole cover featuring Pikachu. The manhole cover's design features the electrified rodent leaping out of a GameBoy, with pixels shooting outward in his wake.</p><p>Nintendo showed off the surprising new choice in street decor <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/08152616-4fb5-4338-8dc4-55b34debb6d5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via an official blog post</a>, giving prospective museum-goers a closer look at the design. Pikachu isn't the only character from the franchise to get a special themed manhole cover, however--a whole collection of them have been popping up in various Japanese cities, featuring other Pokémon, like Golem and Vulpix. Nintendo has even released <a href="https://local.pokemon.jp/en/manhole/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a map showing the location of each manhole cover</a>--referring to them as "Poké Lids"--along with a bit of an explanation for why they exist to begin with.</p><p>"Poké Lids, artistic covers for utility holes, have recently started to be spotted in some cities," reads the Poké Lid site's description. "Who knows if they are of Pokémonopolistic nature? It seems that not all utility holes are man-made; rumor has it that Diglett may be responsible for digging large enough holes to be mistaken for utility holes, and some artists took it upon themselves to “mark” the covers to differentiate them from ordinary ones. Where will the next 'mark' be?"</p><p>The Poké Lids are likely meant to function as quirky promotional advertising for the Nintendo Museum, which officially opens on October 2 in Kyoto, Japan. The museum sits on a property once known as <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Ogura Plant</a>, where Nintendo previously manufactured trading cards, along with offering repair services for consoles. </p><p>Nintendo fans got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-museum-will-complete-construction-in-march-2024/1100-6517725/">their first good look at the museum</a> during a September 2023 Nintendo Direct, during which it was stated that the museum would feature a "wide variety of products from Nintendo's history"--manholes included, apparently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/chinese-fountain-pen-hongdian-jinhao-asvine-delike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is no experience quite like writing with a good fountain pen. Holding one in your hand makes you want to write huge amounts of&nbsp; big flowery script.&nbsp; Fountain pens are refillable, allow you to use an array of gorgeous ink, can often be customized, and will last longer than you will if properly maintained. But like many niche hobbies, pens can be a sinkhole people compulsively dump money into, particularly on the high end. And like many niche hobbies, that ecosystem has been upended by new, competitive companies from China, often (but not always) creating stylistic clones of existing pens. The clones have gotten progressively better over the years to the point where they sometimes match or even improve on the pen they are duping for a fraction of the price.&nbsp;</p><p>Before diving into Chinese pens, it should first be acknowledged that you do not need to spend a ton of money on a good fountain pen. Vendors like <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jet Pens</a> and <a href="https://www.gouletpens.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goulet Pens</a> have pens at every price point you could want. German pens like the <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Perkeo-Fountain-Pens/ct/4319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaweco Perkeo</a> or <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/Kaweco-Sport-Fountain-Pens/ct/3402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sport</a> and <a href="https://www.jetpens.com/LAMY-Safari-Fountain-Pens/ct/1185" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LAMY Safari</a> are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Br_0vpp6ev8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reliable</a> and affordable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1QAGbfMPoM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beginner</a> fountain pens. Muji makes a fantastic metal fountain pen. The Kaweco Sport in particular is a perfect pen to throw in your bag without worrying about it breaking, and I’m quite fond of the sturdy brass and aluminum variants. Patronizing a local pen and stationary store can be a rewarding experience, allowing you to try out many models and inks to find one that truly speaks to you. Unfortunately, with some exceptions like Jinhao, many Chinese pens just were not available to me through a local pen store. Many of the new vendors' pens can only be purchased in the West on Amazon, Etsy, Ebay and Aliexpress (or Taobao and Alibaba if you do a little leg work).</p><figure><figcaption>If you just want a tested, reliable, affordable fountain pen, the LAMY Safari rocks!

Brands like Jinhao, Hongdian, Delike, WingSung, Asvine, and PenBBs all have great offerings at an affordable price point.&nbsp; Sometimes those pens are an original design, but often they are thinly veiled duplicates or copies or remixes of popular, existing pens. Many of the copies are not exact, and some of the pens being copied are decades old. Not all affordable Chinese pens have perfect quality control, but this is also largely true for expensive pens from legacy brands. Some people are conflicted on this either ethically or from the perspective of simple manners, but the fact of the matter is these pens are shockingly good, and they’re here to stay.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Should Pilot Be Scared - New Majohn A1 Retractable Nib Fountain Pen" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDgkIhKcTwA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Doodlebud is one of the best YouTubers reviewing these pens as well as many others.</figcaption></figure></div><p>You can spend an entire article just going over Chinese pens and the pens they bear a striking similarity to. r/fountainpens on reddit maintains not just a list of solid<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/eh1zmv/chinese_fountain_pen_guide_2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Chinese fountain pens</a>, but also a<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/oo9kqo/chinese_fountain_pen_guide_2021_part_1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two part</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/oo9llo/chinese_fountain_pens_2021_part_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide to them</a>. I spent weeks digging through YouTube to see side by sides of countless models. There’s the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BGUGQe9RC0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn X1 vs. Montblanc Boheme</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psX10uaBwfk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wingsung 699 vs. the Pilot Custom 823</a>, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mUGzXevUSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jinhao Centennial vs. the Parker Duofold Centennial</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzdsCCf9hW0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Jinhao X159 vs. the Montblanc 149</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j4TYP3fUqfI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn A1/A2/A3 vs. the Pilot Vanishing Point</a>. It should be pointed out that not all Chinese pens are clones, and almost none of the clones are pretending to be the original but merely aping the style – a minor but meaningful distinction. Furthermore, stylistically cloning a pen is not uncommon or new; one needs only compare the <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/139576-montblanc-146-vs-sailor-1911-full-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sailor 1911 to the Montblanc 146</a>. That said, some of the clones are so close, parts can be used interchangeably from the originals.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="2022 Jinhao x159 Unboxing and Review vs Montblanc 149" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NzdsCCf9hW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A Jinhao vs Montblanc comparison.</figcaption></figure></div><h4>Diving in&nbsp;</h4><p>When I started looking into the deep rabbit hole of Chinese pens, I wanted to start with something familiar. My favorite ballpoint/mechanical pencil is the german-made <a href="https://www.rotring.com/pens-pencils/ballpoint-pens/rotring-600-ballpoint-pen/SAP_2114261.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rOtring 600</a>, a sturdy metal design with a grippy, aggressive knurling that resembles an X-ACTO knife more than a writing implement. Eventually I stumbled upon the Hongdian 1861, often called the “Black Forest” or “Dark Blue Forest” depending on the color. The 1861 “Forest” series is loved by a lot of people: a sleek industrial design that bears a resemblance to the Otto Hutt Design 04. Hongdian was relatively unknown as a brand until a few years ago, but the Black Forest is also one of the top selling pens on Amazon, with more than 26,000 largely positive reviews as of this writing. Reddit reactions are glowing, although some people have complained that the finish on the pen wears a little over time. It retails somewhat on the higher end for Chinese pens, roughly $17 (although it apparently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stNZSpyx43M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">used to be far less expensive</a>) and comes in a dizzying array of colors, including a garish iridescent color that looks like a gravity knife you’d buy at a rural gas station. I bought the Dark Blue Forest with a matching blue nib.</p><figure><figcaption>The Hongdian "Forest" line comes in many colors. Pictured, the Black Forest and Dark Blue Forest.</figcaption></figure><p>The pen’s popularity is justified. The 1861 is sturdy but not overly heavy, writes beautifully, and does not feel like it is going to spill ink over the inside of my bag. The knurling is actually quite smooth, only slightly grippy. The cap slides off instead of twists off&nbsp; and makes a satisfying pop when removed from the far end of the pen. It’s unobtrusive and thin enough to slip in the rings of a spiral notebook. It’s a pen that punches well above its weight, as does the Hongdian M2. There are better pens out there, but you could buy a Black Forest and not buy another pen for a very long time.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was now hooked, and had a thinly-veiled justification of writing this article.</p><figure><figcaption>The gang's all here. From left to right: the Majohn Wancai Mini V2, 2 Jinhao Sharks, The Hongdian Dark Blue Forest, The Majohn A2, The Asvine V200 and the Jinhao 82. Half have been given away to friends.</figcaption></figure><p>After the Blue Forest, I went on a pen shopping spree on Aliexpress. There was the titanium <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_4NKKc967c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asvine V200</a>, a weighty “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demonstrator_pen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demonstrator</a>” pen that a friend said “looked like it came out of <em>Resident Evil.</em>” There was the inexpensive <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKw_G1H0zDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn Wancai Mini V2</a>, one of the smallest pens I have ever seen. There was also the <a href="https://youtu.be/0q3W74S7btQ?si=-0JETEyKlb3Y4NMi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jinhao 82</a>, which bore a striking resemblance to the Sailor Pro Gear Slim as well as the <a href="https://youtu.be/ejkgcegEzzE?si=L3SnT-9VUBcD3TeU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Majohn A2</a> (about $16-$17), which looked very similar to the iconic Pilot Vanishing Point ($168) – a pen that clicks like a ballpoint. There was also the Majohn/<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7bA45ybCpY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delike Hunyuan</a>, a clean, weighty and industrial metal pen that comes in either smooth brass or black knurling. I got the black variant, have filled it with red ink, and refer to it as my “evil” pen. I bought a couple of Jinhao Sharks, very inexpensive pens that I have given away to friends already. And lastly, I purchased a <a href="https://youtu.be/6TV7WF_GlYQ?si=TBg2KtRZ1T70hHSZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hongdian M2</a> – one of the most beautiful pens I have ever used.</p><figure><figcaption>This is my "Evil" pen, the Majohn/Delike Hunyuan. It needs a clip desperately because it rolls around a lot.</figcaption></figure><p>What strangers on the internet had said was true: All the pens performed beautifully and were worth more than what I paid for them. Everyone who gets these pens seems to love them, but who makes them? Where do they come from?</p><h4>Untangling the world of Chinese Pens</h4><p>Chinese fountain pen brands are much harder to nail down than other companies. A few appear to be based in Shanghai, with the Shanghai Hero Pen Company being one of the oldest and most storied. Hero even apparently attempted a collaboration with the storied <a href="https://frankunderwater.com/2017/02/20/remaking-parker-45-a-cooperation-between-hero-parker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American brand Parker back in the late 70s</a>. Jinhao has also been around for a while, and they make a lot of pens that run the gamut in cost, quality and complexity. The aforementioned Jinhao Shark is a beloved pen within the pen community because it is cheap, plastic, writes fairly well, and looks like a shark (the injection point for the cap looks like a belly button). You can hand them out to a stranger as a gift and think nothing of it. It won’t win any awards for reliability, but it’s roughly 2 to 4 dollars so you can buy them in bulk if you want to test out a bunch of inks or easily gift them to someone to potentially spark a love of fountain pens. Jinhao also has a similar model shaped like a swan where the bird's bill adorably forms a little clip.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Everyone loves the Jinhao Shark, and its lesser known friend the Jinhao Swan. Credit: Jinhao.</figcaption></figure><p>I tried contacting every Chinese pen brand I could within reason. The company that owns the Jinhao brand, Shanghai Qiangu Stationery Co., was easy to contact, and they provided me with a catalog of their offerings (both the Jinhao brand, as well as a sub-brand Baoer). Further investigations into other Chinese brands got murky, as it became unclear which company produces what brand and who is simply reselling pens made from different companies. To some degree this is understandable, as a newer Chinese brand might simply not have a Western-facing presence on the internet. But there are strange overlaps in what brands sell what, and who sells who, and even people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/124mcy9/seeking_information_on_shanghai_jingdian_fountain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pen forums </a>seem to only have <a href="https://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/375932-asvine-and-hongdian/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incomplete information</a>. Many of the brands have stores on Taobao. In the West, PenBBS operates <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/PENBBSOfficialStore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly on Etsy</a> and shares a name with a popular <a href="http://penbbs.com/forum.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese pen forum of the same name</a>. Hongdian appears to be the brand of the Lishui Lantian Pen Company, but the email associated with the company did not respond to any inquiries and I was unable to confirm this from them directly.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The German Kaweco Sport is iconic for a reason. Credit: Kaweco.</figcaption></figure><p>What originally had sparked my curiosity about these brands was a years old r/hobbydrama thread about a territorial dispute involving the German brand <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/q3wd9v/fountain_pens_kaweco_v_moonman_or_how_to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaweco and the Chinese brand Moonnman</a> (now Majohn). According to the thread, the owner of the brand Kaweco, cosmetics company Gutberlet<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesellschaft_mit_beschr%C3%A4nkter_Haftung" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> GmbH</a>, filed a trademark for the brand <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/W01556939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Moonman in the EU</a>. The thread goes on to state that Kaweco cited similarities between the Majohn T1 and the Kaweco Sport (a pen that was invented in 1911).&nbsp; Say what you will about Chinese copies, of which there are many blatant examples, but you would never mistake the two pens for each other save for some minor similarities in the cap (<a href="https://tokyoinklings.com/episodes/037/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other people in the pen world noted this at the time as well</a>). In the end, Kaweco kinda ended up looking like the dick bullying the new guy. The Shanghai Shanyin Trading Company, which claims to be the producer of the Majohn brand, confirmed this information, although I am still not certain that they are the main producers of the brand based on <a href="https://frankunderwater.com/2017/09/01/the-moonman-m1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conflicting information I have found online</a>. Kaweco did not respond to multiple inquiries I sent them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Moonman T1 Fountain Pen Review - great piston filler" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pK1Zpe3zU8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The Moonman (Majohn) T1, a a very different pen from the Kaweco Sport.</figcaption></figure></div><p>I have a deep love of finding out where the objects I use are made, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23539460/importyeti-shipping-manifests-american-companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to the point where it’s become a bit of a game</a> for me. Kaweco loves touting out their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzu6ZC-6uIs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beautiful, elegant production process</a>, their logo proudly states “Germany, since 1883,” despite the brand’s relatively new ownership. But many of these pens are their equal and deserve an opportunity to earn a legacy of their own.</p><h4><strong>Inking Up</strong></h4><figure><figcaption>My new go-to, the Hongdian M2. I would love it in other colors.</figcaption></figure><p>After I spent some time with my Chinese pens, I made sure to visit <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yoseka Stationery</a> in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. If you’ve never been, it’s a gorgeous store, bustling with pen nerds excited to try out different pens on the weekend. It’s overflowing with beautiful notebooks and countless bottles of ink. Though I already had a bottle of blue <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/pilot-iroshizuku-ink-kon-peki-50-ml-bottle-ink?_pos=3&amp;_sid=f092c412a&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pilot Iroshizuku</a>, I wanted to expand my selection, so I bought a beautiful <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/sailor-shikiori-sakura-mori-ink-20ml-bottle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emerald from Sailor</a> and a beautiful red that Yoseka makes called <a href="https://yosekastationery.com/products/yoseka-ceramics-ink-series-qing-shan-hu-red?_pos=3&amp;_sid=98466ef3f&amp;_ss=r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Qing Shan Hu</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting in line to buy the ink, I told some people that I was writing an article on Chinese pens. I showed my bounty of weird Aliexpress pens. One woman I talked to mentioned she was aware of Jinhao, particularly everyone’s favorite Shark, but was taken aback at how well the Dark Blue Forest performed. I had expected a bit of apprehension on the topic of clones and copies, but pen enthusiasts are fairly easygoing and love an excuse to try a new pen out, particularly when it’s well made. They all agreed – these were good pens.</p><p>I have spent far too much time over the last month thinking about pens, and have more questions than I do strong convictions. To what degree does originality in design matter relative to craftsmanship? Is imitation an unforgivable crime, or a natural progression that most companies go through as they develop their own style? And how much does any of this matter if it gets a new person to step in the door of a stationary store and reignite a love of writing by hand? Isn’t an affordable pen that gets someone into the hobby, like the Jinhao Shark, ultimately a good thing for the fountain pen world?</p><p>Of the pens that I have bought, I think the most about the Hongdian M2. Though the M2 has a vaguely similar form factor to the Kaweco Sport, its shape is different –&nbsp; round instead of faceted. The M2 is a beautiful pen: pocketable and sturdy with a solid nib, in muted iphone-like aluminum tones for about 20 bucks. I get the sense that I could carry it with me forever, and there’s a nonzero chance I will. Maybe one day I’ll lose it on the train, or maybe I’ll give it to a friend as a gift. At the current price, there’s little harm in giving it away.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The Hongdian M2 comes in several muted colors, and at least one bright one. Credit: Hongdian.</figcaption></figure><p>The M2 feels a step above a clone or a slight revision; it feels like something new. I gravitated towards it as well as the Dark Blue Forest and the evil-looking Delike Hunyuan for that reason. I am certain these new brands are good enough to stand on their own, to be exhibited in a beautiful and bustling stationary store instead of being relegated to countless nameless sellers on Aliexpress, Amazon and eBay. I want to see what new designs they come up with, instead of simply recreating pens from 100 years ago. The world has gotten bigger, the winds are changing, and the world of pens is no different.&nbsp;</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-netflix-series-is-officially-canceled<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> have gotten some disappointing news. The official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series, which was announced in 2019, has been quietly canceled. This news didn't come from an official press release but from one of the series' own voice actors.</p>

<p>The news of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series cancelation came from an interview <a href="https://collider.com/magic-the-gathering-netflix-series-cancelled/">by Collider</a> at this year's Toronto Independent Film Festival.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=8GYv-Ips 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandon-routh-scott-pilgrim-screenshot.jpg?itok=XaVYoEnC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Collider's own Steve Weintraub was interviewing Brandon Routh (<em>Superman Returns</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-releases-first-look-at-tomb-raider-and-devil-may-cry-animated-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em></a>) for his upcoming horror comedy movie, <em>Ick</em>. Weintraub asked Routh about the status of the series since it was slated for a 2022 release. Routh's response was the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I'm not sure. I did do a voice for it. As far as I understand, nobody's put out a press release about it, but apparently it's not happening. That's kind of old news. I'm not sure why it's surfacing again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Routh was set to voice the planeswalker Gideon Jura in the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series. The series has gone through multiple producers, editors and creatives, including the Russo Brothers (<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>), Jose Melina (<em>Firefly</em>) and Bryan Cogman (<em>Game of Thrones</em>).</p>
<p>Despite being fully written and having voices fully recorded, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Netflix series was shelved alongside other animated Netflix projects. These included animated adaptations of the fantasy comic <em>Bone</em> and an animated <em>Gorillaz</em> movie directed by Jamie Hewlett.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=IBaK6gVr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blue-eye-samurai-mizu-artwork.jpg?itok=6fuDYS7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In retrospect, Netflix's shelving of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series is short-sighted. Recently, one of their original animated shows, the stylized historical action revenge series <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>, <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/blue-eye-samurai">won several Emmys</a> for Outstanding Individual Achievement, Sound Editing and for Outstanding Animated Program.</p>
<p>Given the scope of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, it is a ripe setting for stories. Larger-than-life stories of heroes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-eldritch-moon-spoilers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">monsters</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/duskmourn-house-of-horror-revealed-at-magiccon-amsterdamhttps://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ghosts</a>, eldritch horrors, angels, demons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/march-of-machine-battles-and-more-cards-revealed" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interdimensional threats</a> are all present and plentiful.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there has been no official statement from Netflix regarding the status of the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> animated series.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow will see the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a>'s Realms Rebuilt update, which hopes to revive the ailing Early Access gaslamp survival craft 'em up. It's aiming to do that with a new handcrafted campaign, which now sits alongside the procedural worlds already present, along with new weapons, spells, boss battles, dungeons and much more, as the developers outlined yesterday in a new blog post.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The core questline of Nightingale has been completely recreated thanks to the incredible feedback we’ve received from the community," starts <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4585315413747208446">the post</a>. "Realmwalkers now embark on a more immersive and substantive quest, as Puck guides players across gravity-torn deserts, corrupted forests, and beyond, on a journey to reignite the ancient Crossway portals. Each of the new Storied Realms has been handcrafted; packed with challenging enemies, ancient discoveries, and all-new puzzles and dungeons."
</p>
<p>The update will lift some of Nightingale's build limits, allowing for the creation of "bigger and more elaborate" constructions. It also includes a new tileset for building with. 
</p>
<p>Players can also now adopt up to 20 pets, an increase on the original release, with several new pets now included. That includes cats, as per the bonnet-wearing chap in the screenshot above.
</p>
<p>There's also claims of an overhauled progression system, clothing customisation, simplified crafting, and UI improvements, according to the post.
</p>
<p>These changes do seem to take aim at many of the elements Ed criticised in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-early-access-review">Nightingale review</a> back in March. He criticised it as "an awkward marriage of survival game and live service loot grind", calling it both confusing and tedious. 
</p>
<p>I'm glad that the developers are attempting to address those issues, although I'm skeptical that it will do much to attract players back to the game. Speaking for RPS, we won't be re-reviewing it before any potential 1.0 release, because there are simply too many games for us to write about them all - and I imagine many players feel similarly about their own precious time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24242123/amd-variable-graphics-memory-afmf-2-strix-point-ai-300<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Many laptops and gaming handhelds share a single pool of memory between the CPU and GPU — and sometimes, you might want that RAM boosting your graphics instead. Now, AMD won’t make you dive into a BIOS to reroute that power. The company’s new Variable Graphics Memory lets you turn up to 75 percent of your system memory into dedicated video RAM, just by tapping a button in AMD’s desktop Adrenalin app.</p><p>It’s only currently available for AMD AI 300 “Strix Point” laptops, and how much RAM you’ll be able to divert depends on your system’s total — <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/maximizing-gaming-performance-on-amd-ryzen-ai-300-series-with/ba-p/704594#:~:text=the%20best%20experience.-,Variable%20Graphics%20Memory,-is%20a%20newly">AMD explains</a> that the “medium” setting will turn a 32GB laptop that came with 512MB of video memory into a 24GB one with 8GB of dedicated VRAM. </p><p>You might be wondering: does that extra video memory actually make a difference? Well, it depends on the game. Some games, like <em>Alan Wake II, </em>require as many as 6GB of VRAM and will throw errors at launch if you’re short — Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, and Lenovo Legion Go buyers have been tweaking their VRAM settings for some time to take games to the threshold of playability.</p><p>But in early testing with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24215430/zenbook-s-16-2024-review-amd-ryzen-ai-laptop">the Asus Zenbook S 16</a>, a Strix Point laptop that’s already shipped with this feature, my colleague Joanna Nelius saw that turning it on isn’t a silver bullet for every game. With 8GB of VRAM, the laptop played <em>Control</em> notably faster (65fps vs. 54fps), but some titles had smaller boosts, no boost, or even slight frame rate decreases.</p><p>Your mileage will vary — but I’m eager to find out if it’s a big boost in particular games!</p><div><p>AMD’s also bringing its Fluid Motion Frames 2 to Strix Point laptops in technical preview today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/24/24139440/the-asus-rog-ally-is-getting-amds-fluid-motion-frames-tomorrow">after previously opening it up to desktop GPUs and last-gen notebook GPUs</a>. It increases frame rate by imagining new frames, now with less jitter and lag. </p></div><p>There, AMD says you can get substantial boosts combined with VGM, assuming you’ve got at least 50fps to work with before you apply the frame-generating technique — though AMD doesn’t say whether you’re getting any more frames with AFMF 2 than you did with the original version of the tech. </p><p>The company does claim, though, that if your laptop can already manage 39fps in, say, <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, you can now play it at a (theoretically) smooth 66fps on a 2880 x 1800 laptop screen if you combine AFMF2, VGM, and AMD’s FSR upscaling tech.</p><p>In other AMD laptop gaming news, the company’s just announced <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/laptops/radeon/7000-series/amd-radeon-rx-7800m.html">the RX 7800M</a>, a new up-to-180W chip that comes with 12GB of dedicated video memory. <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/amd-silently-launches-rx-7800m-gpu-mobile-navi-32-with-12gb-of-vram"><em>Tom’s Hardware</em> calls it</a> “essentially a stripped-down RX 7800 XT,” comparing it to the desktop GPU, but it’s also filling a huge hole in AMD’s lineup between the flagship RX 7900M and the RX 7600M XT, as you can see below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It's been ten long years since Dragon Age: Inquisition, which means the next game in the series - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> - likely has some modern design trends to catch up on. Here's one: The Veilguard will be the first game in the series to include a photo mode when it arrives in October.
</p>

<p>IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-dragon-age-the-veilguards-photo-mode-mass-effects-15-exclusive-screenshots">has the first details on the photo mode</a>, including a spread of new screenshots.

<p>The photo mode sounds like it's got a large if typical suite of camera features, including: free-roaming camera, focal length, depth of field, auto-focus, F-stop, controls for saturation, brightness and contrast, and the ability to hide the player, party members, enemies or NPCs.
</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is due for release October 31st.
</p>
<p>Optimism seems to be growing around The Veilguard, as I see more and more fans of the series getting excited based on the trailers and streams BioWare have released so far. Edwin saw the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in the summer</a> and came away intrigued by its characters and action, even if it's not the full party-based RPG offered by some of the previous games.
</p>
<p>I've never played a Dragon Age, but I have spent several hours messing around in photo modes, trying to bring out my inner <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/dead-end-thrills">Dead End Thrills</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, they are doing something a bit different with their next game. <em>Byte Breakers </em>is a 4o-player battle-royale spin on platformer fighters. Or to put it another way: It’s like<em> Fortnite x Smash Bros</em>. And this time, Odyssey Interactive wants people to play the game very early so they can decide if this prototype is worth making and supporting. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/jMz0jxxT2Xw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/jMz0jxxT2Xw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On September 11</a></span>, Odyssey Interactive developers Lunchboy and Maple announced that for the last eight months, the team had been working on various prototypes for their potential next game. And the first one they are going to let the community play around with is <em>Byte Breakers. </em></p><p>“With <em>Omega Strikers</em> we learned firsthand the risks of keeping things under wraps for too long and we felt the pain of having to move on from something that we poured three years of our passion into,” explained the devs. “For all of our next projects, we want to hear what you think much earlier.”</p><p>Odyssey Interactive says that in the next “few days” they’ll be holding a playtest on Steam where a “few thousand” people will be able to hop in and play a very, very early build of <em>Byte Breakers</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2503080/Byte_Breakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can sign up to play on the game’s newly launched Steam page</a></span>. </p><p>“[The playtest will be] fully public so feel free to talk about it with your friends, make videos about it, or even stream it. We want to hear what you honestly think,” said the devs. </p><p>But don’t assume that <em>Byte Breakers</em> is guaranteed to be finished and released. Odyssey Interactive is very clear that it might not end up making <em>Byte Breakers</em> or other games based on player feedback during these early tests. </p><div><p>“We may not end up actually making this prototype,” said the studio. “We may not end up making the next prototype we show you either. But we think that this type of public testing is the best way of figuring out if our ideas have juice. We trust you and we trust your feedback. So get in there and let us know what you think.”</p><p>It’s an interesting strategy that feels reminiscent of how Valve is building its next game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-deadlock-early-access-beta-steamdb-pc-1851620354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-next-game-deadlock-early-access-beta-steamdb-pc-1851620354"><em>Deadlock</em></a></span>.

It also will hopefully help teams avoid spending three years or more on an online game that nobody wants.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-obs-settings-for-streaming.978429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-obs-settings-for-streaming/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ready to kick off your streaming career? To do that, though, you want to make sure you have the best streaming settings for OBS ready to go. Without good settings, your stream will look laggy and grainy. No one wants that! Here are the best OBS settings for streaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-streaming-settings-for-obs">Best Streaming Settings For OBS</h2>



<p>Having the best streaming settings for OBS does depend a bit on your PC specs. Those with a little bit lower-end PC might not have the bitrate turned up as high as streamers who have an expensive high-end PC will have. If your PC does not run the settings listed in this article well, then you will obviously have to do some readjusting.</p>



<p>Here are the best streaming settings for OBS.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-streaming-dimensions">Streaming Dimensions</h3>



<p>You first want to set up your dimensions in OBS. It is recommended that streamers use <strong>1920×1080 resolution</strong>, also known as 1080p. Some PCs, though, might struggle to handle these dimensions. If that is the case, then going down to <strong>1280×720</strong> <strong>resolution</strong> is okay.</p>



<p>You will want to make sure your base settings in OBS are set to this resolution, plus your output settings, which you can change in the normal OBS Settings tab.</p>



<h3 id="h-fps">FPS</h3>



<p>After your streaming dimensions are set, you will want to adjust your FPS. We recommend utilizing <strong>60 FPS</strong>. If your PC cannot handle this high of an FPS, though, then switch to <strong>30 FPS</strong>. If your computer cannot handle 30 FPS, then it may be time for a new PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-at-1080p-and-60-fps">Best OBS Settings For Streaming At 1080p And 60 FPS</h2>



<p>Once you have your stream set to 1080p and 60 FPS, you will be ready to adjust additional settings. </p>



<h3 id="h-bitrate">Bitrate</h3>



<p>One of the most important settings to adjust first is the <strong>bitrate</strong>. Bitrate is the number of bits of information that can be transmitted per unit of time. Higher-end PCs can obviously have a higher bitrate, but no one needs too high of a bitrate. It is recommended you set your bitrate between <strong>3,000 and 4,000 Kbps</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-cpu-usage">CPU Usage</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>When trying to get the best streaming settings in OBS, you will need to adjust your CPU Usage. Remember, though, if you are streaming and gaming on the same PC, utilizing too much CPU when streaming will make your game incredibly laggy.</p>



<p>When adjusting your CPU Usage, it is best to allow your CPU to use only 60% of its potential. Having your setting set to a faster setting will allow it to work better. Just don’t set the speed too high, or else the stream will look grainy. </p>



<p>We recommend your CPU Usage be set to <strong>Fast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-on-a-bad-pc">Best OBS Settings For Streaming On A Bad PC</h2>



<p>Your best bet when adjusting your OBS settings for streaming on a bad PC is to take all the settings listed above and lower them. Sure, the quality of your stream will go down, but at least it is not laggy and destroying your computer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-settings-for-streaming-with-bad-internet">Best OBS Settings For Streaming With Bad Internet</h2>



<p>Have bad internet and still want to stream? If you are not able to upgrade your internet, then here are a few solutions to making your streaming experience a bit more enjoyable.</p>



<p>First off, make sure your PC is plugged into an ethernet. Being plugged in directly to your router will always allow for your stream to run more smoothly.</p>



<p>Secondly, lower your bitrate. Yes, this will make your stream a bit more grainy, but it will also relieve some of the stress being put on your internet.</p>



<p>Hopefully, all of this advice helps. Happy streaming!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-starting-location-satisfactory/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-starting-location-in-satisfactory-isn%E2%80%99t-grass-fields.978426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-starting-location-satisfactory/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When you first boot up Satisfactory, whether it’s your first time playing or a returning player checking out the recent 1.0 launch, you’ll have a few options. When starting a new game, you have four maps to select: Grass Fields, Rocky Desert, Northern Forest, and Dune Desert. The first map, Grass Fields, is the recommended starting point for new pioneers. The second recommended location is the Rocky Desert. I don’t recommend either of those, though. Instead, here’s the best starting location in Satisfactory, as recommended by someone who has played the game since its earliest days in Early Access!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-start-in-satisfactory">Where to Start in Satisfactory</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Instead of choosing one of the usual starting locations—Grass Fields or Rocky Desert—I recommend you take a chance and start your journey in the Dune Desert. Sure, it’s a more challenging environment, specifically regarding power production, as the game tells you, but it also offers the most usable space for a large factory. Furthermore, within walking distance of the starting spawn, you’ll find a number of valuable resources necessary to push into the mid- and late-game.</p>



<p>That said, alongside power generation, you’ll find it’s tough to find specific late-game resources, including oil and uranium. You can find them, of course, but you’ll travel a bit further. But the same can be said about any of the game’s starting locations. They all have pros and cons in each column to consider. </p>



<p>At the end of the day, the starting location you choose in Satisfactory depends on your comfort level. If you don’t mind a challenge, I’ll recommend the Dune Desert all day. But if you want to take things slow, learning the game’s mechanics at a casual pace, then the Grass Fields are the go-to for many new players.</p>







<h2 id="h-satisfactory-starting-tips-and-tricks">Satisfactory Starting Tips and Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Take your time! There’s no rush in Satisfactory, as you can build the factory of your dreams slowly, expanding across the planet and progressing to the next tech level at your pace.</li>



<li>Unless they altered any values recently, the biomass burner on the hub isn’t as efficient as the one you can build, so consider using your resources wisely.</li>



<li>You need power for everything in Satisfactory, and the starting materials—leaves and wood—won’t suffice. You must automate biomass and use that to burn for energy.</li>



<li>You can deconstruct any structure and receive a full refund, so don’t worry about where you place everything now. You can beautify and focus on efficiency down the line.</li>
</ul>

Image source: Xbox</figcaption></figure></output><p>If you're feeling confused about how all of this works, you're not the only one. In the current system, adding another user to your list makes them a follower until they also add you to their friends list. With no notifications, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of friends on Xbox's platforms.</p><p>The system, which was first introduced more than a decade ago with the Xbox One, has never been especially popular. There have been periodic calls to bring back friend requests, which were a simple and relatively straightforward way to connect with players you met online during the Xbox 360 era.</p><p>"I understand why they phased out the requests. They wanted to make it so you can follow your favorite streamer and whatnot without them needing to approve the "friendship", but why get rid of any sort of sustained notification whatsoever," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/9e8eu7/bring_back_friend_requests_please/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one user grumbled back in 2018</a>. "As far as I can tell, if you're not online to receive the pop up notification the instant someone friends you, you're SoL for knowing they did. Earlier I was playing Sea of Thieves and someone from my crew friended me. I was currently busy at the time, so I couldn't reciprocate."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/11/2-xbox-console-friend-request-e94747f063fa197619f7-1726081420002.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Friend requests are available through the People tab. Image source: Xbox.</figcaption></figure></output><p>According to Xbox's post, existing friends and followers will update automatically with this change. If someone isn't currently a Friend, you'll be able to send them a request through the People tab. Xbox says it will also add new privacy and notification settings to manage friend requests. Xbox did not indicate when the feature would become widely available to current users.</p><p>In the meantime, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-series-x-games">best Xbox Series X|S games to play right now</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Unfortunately, the order in which the special bot performs dances is random, so this will require some trial and error as you learn which moves are which. If you fail, you can run back and grab another bushel of bananas to try again.</p><p>Once you complete the dances in the correct order, you’ll unlock the final special bot in <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, netting you the “No escape!” trophy in the process.
