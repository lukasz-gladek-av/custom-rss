            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that it plans to spin out Coffee Stain into its own entity by the end of the year, and that the group itself will also be undergoing a name change by that time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on the official Embracer website, Coffee Stain Group will be spun off "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers" by the end of the 2025 calendar year.</p>

<p>By that same time, Embracer Group will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment, completing the company's plan to spin itself off into three separate companies, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=L6LnZdIB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=JBm-3Fs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain will soon become its own entity.</figcaption></figure><p>Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh says the move to become its own entity will give the company "the clarity and control" to navigate a "competitive" industry landscape. He goes on to say the goal is still "supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain".</p>

<p>For his part, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says Westbergh's "strategy and leadership" will help Coffee Stain in "attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents".</p>

<p>As for Embracer itself, despite its new name, Fellowship Entertainment won't just be stewarding the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>IP (although that'll certainly be a major part of its mission statement).</p>

<p>The company will take with it other IPs like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>, for which a new game is currently in the works from developer 4A.</p>

<p>Embracer isn't technically going away, however; CEO Lars Wingefors will establish a new privately-owned company by the name of Embracer AB, which will hold shares in the three entities spun off from the former Embracer Group (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Asmodee</a>, Coffee Stain, and Fellowship).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Embracer's business strategy means for the studios under its wing, but for now, it looks like nothing in the immediate term will be changing. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game consultants like <a href="https://laurakbuzz.com/">Laura Kate Dale</a> came into 2023 with a lot of hope. Since 2020, accessibility in games had become a mainstream discussion, bolstered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4">high-profile releases like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a>, and it appeared things could only get better. Yet, as the year drew on, she says, “there started to be signs that, behind the scenes, accessibility advancement was slowing down.”</p><p>Now, that momentum has come to a relative standstill. Consultants speaking to <em>The Verge</em> paint a picture of repetitive conversations, fighting to maintain basics that should already be established, and a sense that the broader industry has taken its foot off the gas after the early months of the incipient covid-19 pandemic provided a real sense of hope that accessibility was here to stay.</p><p>“The gaming culture of that time is a reflection of catering to the disabled experience, because accessibility was sorely needed by <em>everyone</em>,” says Kaemsi, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaemsi">an online broadcaster</a>. “The rise of accessibility back in 2020 was almost a promise that, when we started recovering from the lockdowns, the world would start considering everyone in all facets of living, and all we needed to do was give people a chance to recover from having to deal with such an unprecedented time.”</p><p>But as that recovery set in, the world instead brute-forced a return to 2019 norms. Following lockdown successes such as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, the bubble burst. As industry-wide downscaling started partway through 2023, dedicated accessibility roles were among the first culled to save cash, according to Dale. “Gigs started to be cancelled without clear explanation,” she adds, while those accessibility champions that remained were told “their budgets were shrinking, or they were expected to fight harder to justify any new or more experimental investment in accessibility.”</p><p>Things are yet to improve. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">Layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619293/warner-bros-games-wonder-woman-canceled-studios-shut-down">studio closures</a> continue, while consultants who led the charge in 2020 are still fighting the same battles years later to maintain basics. “It can feel a little defeating to focus energy on fighting for standardizing things already proven to work and proven to win positive headlines from the games media,” Dale says.</p><p>Despite the media’s value as a way to start, and maintain, accessibility conversations, those positive headlines are also disappearing in a media landscape reckoning with its own calamity (most recently evidenced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/660635/polygon-valnet-vox-media-new-owner-interview"><em>Polygon</em>’s sale to Valnet</a>). As <a href="http://stevesaylor.net/">consultant and content creator</a> Steve Saylor suggests, outside tired cyclical discourse such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139208/another-crabs-treasure-review-xbox-switch-ps5">difficulty in Souls-likes</a> and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yellow-paint-game-design-debate">yellow paint</a>, accessibility topics have mostly fallen out of public consciousness. “There’s no nuance to that conversation,” he says. “People understand accessibility is important, but they’re not willing to learn more beyond that.” </p><div><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough.”</p></div><p>But that coverage is also critical for moving accessibility forward, providing publishers with a marketing incentive for accessibility features. “The less publishers are imagining their big stab at getting similar press coverage, the less they seem willing to take a chance on a feature nobody’s tried to offer before,” Dale says. She points to the extensive coverage <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>received for its accessibility prior to release as a major motivator for others to follow suit in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>Now, she adds, accessibility consultants are increasingly employed in scaling back accessibility, with the least backlash, to help mitigate the industry’s lockdown-era overspend. This creates an environment that isn’t conducive to change and improvement, and saps energy from an already frequently exhausted community. Professional opportunities have dried up to the point that many advocates are looking elsewhere for work, where only a few years before there was hope accessibility could become a full-time pursuit.</p><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough,” says Saylor, before adding that he’s barely had consultancy work over the past year. “I don’t know when it’s going to pick back up again. It’s been getting worse since 2023.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Even when the call does come, often those offers will end up being rescinded. “I’ve had at least three major AAA studios offer me accessibility consulting work in the past 18 months,” Dale says, “only for them to cancel the planned consulting work because the budget for that work was withdrawn by management.”</p><p>“People in the accessibility community are tired,” Kaemsi says, summing up how many speaking to <em>The Verge </em>feel. Nor does it look to be improving in 2025. As relations fray between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">Donald Trump’s government</a> and other nations, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/22/nx-s1-5336792/european-countries-canada-travel-warnings-us">with many countries issuing travel advisories to the US</a>, “it’s getting harder and harder to even potentially cross the border,” Saylor, who lives in Canada, says. “90 percent of my work was in the US and if that’s gone, I don’t know what that means for me going forward.”</p><p>Similarly, with so much of the gaming industry tied to the US, federal-level attacks on anything resembling inclusion in the name of pushing back against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656653/brendan-carr-fcc-anti-consumer-harassment-dei-trump">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies</a> (DEI) are making it dangerous for many advocates to continue fighting for inclusivity.</p><div><p>There is still some cause for hope</p></div><p>A side effect of so many consultants leaving the industry is that they’re also taking much of their knowledge with them. While many studios are maintaining features implemented in previous games, Dale says “knowledge of <em>why </em>those features are implemented, and why they’re handled in a specific way, is being lost.” </p><p>Per multiple sources, this has only worsened as the industry embraces contractors instead of full-time work, in which consultants are employed for a single project and then let go, often without leaving a record of their knowledge and practices behind, making communication even harder. </p><p>Dale cites multiple occasions where she was brought in to consult on separate projects for a studio only to find information wasn’t being disseminated across teams. “The end result is me being brought in to teach the same lesson more than once, a sign that somewhere along the line that knowledge isn’t making it from one project to the next,” she says.</p><div><p>Yet there is still some cause for hope. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games">Games like <em>South of Midnight</em></a>, which includes among its impressive accessibility suite the ability to skip boss fights, prove that accessibility remains a concern for many studios. In announcing the Switch 2, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessibility%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo has signaled its first stuttering steps</a> toward a more holistic approach to accessibility after years of stubborn resistance. Elsewhere, major publishers, including Nintendo of America, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633405/esa-accessible-games-initiative-nintendo-google-microsoft-ea-ubisoft">have agreed to share clearer and consistent information about accessibility on storefronts</a>.</p></div><p>These are small wins in spite of a broader industry slowdown around accessibility. If repetition is one signal of how profound that rut has become, it’s also perhaps an important tool for arresting this decline.</p><p>“Being repetitive, asking for features nobody is delivering, and asking for teams to try features until it’s embarrassing not to offer them,” Dale says. “That’s the only way things are going to change.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Fortnite is currently being dominated by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-star-wars-galactic-battle-includes-force-abilities-starfighters-and-fan-favorite-characters/1100-6531254/" data-ref-id="1100-6531254">Star Wars: Galactic Battle </a>event, including an interactive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-now-lets-you-speak-to-darth-vader-with-the-ai-generated-voice-of-james-earl-jones/1100-6531599/" data-ref-id="1100-6531599">Darth Vader with an AI voice</a> and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-darth-jar-jar-skin-takes-a-ridiculous-amount-of-xp-to-unlock/1100-6531655/" data-ref-id="1100-6531655">Darth Jar Jar</a>. But outside of Star Wars, Fortnite is introducing a new character, Iridia Vayne, and the game is giving players a chance to win her skin for free. But you'll have to move quickly to catch this giveaway.</p><p>Starting on May 23, Fortnite players are invited to put a team together for Celestial Strike Quest, a new Party Up that will be releasing new quests daily until May 31. To unlock Iridia Vayne, teams will have to complete nine quests that alternate between earning XP in creator-made experiences and experiences that were created by Epic Games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1MD74TYHRg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V1MD74TYHRg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once the complete lineup of Celestial Strike Quest has been released, players will only have until June 7 at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET to complete the event and get the Iridia Vayne skin. There are also other items that can be earned along the way, as detailed below.</p><ul><li>Complete 1 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quest: “Alien Boy” Jam Track by Oliver Tree</li><li>Complete 2 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Victory Plume Spray</li><li>Complete 3 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Slashers Pickaxe</li><li>Complete 4 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Confident Iridia Spray</li><li>Complete 5 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Peacock's Dream Wrap</li><li>Complete 6 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Opaline Scabbard Back Bling</li><li>Complete 7 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: High Five! Emoticon</li><li>Complete 8 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Origami Battalion Emote</li><li>Complete 9 Party Up - Celestial Strike Quests: Iridia Vayne Outfit</li></ul><p>Given Fortnite's history of bringing free skins back as paid items down the line, it's likely that Iridia Vayne's skin will also become available in the Fortnite shop in the near future. If you don't mind spending money on it, you can always wait. Or you can play with a few friends and make it your mission to unlock every reward being offered in this quest.</p><p>In other Fortnite news, the AI Darth Vader <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-voice-draws-union-complaint/1100-6531662/" data-ref-id="1100-6531662">drew an unfair-labor-practice complaint</a> from SAG-AFTRA, the guild that represents actors in Hollywood.

            <p>After a few playful teases earlier in the week, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> team has officially announced its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>"A demon begins his HUNT," reads the blurb on Capcom's collaboration trailer, which you can check out for yourself below. Cap-come and have a go if you think you're hard enough (or something like that).</p>

<p>So, what exactly does this Capcom collab - which is slated to arrive in Monster Hunter Wilds on 28th May - include? Well, players will soon be able to get their hands on the free Akuma hunter layered armour, which comes with some special fist-focused actions, as well as a Blanka-chan Palico layered armour which doesn't look at all strange, no sir-y.</p>
<p>To get hold of these Street Fighter inspired goodies, players will need to complete a new side mission known as Ultimate Strength. This is only available for those at Hunter Rank 21 or higher. Don't fret if you aren't quite there yet, though. Once the collaboration arrives later this month, it'll be a permanent addition to the game.</p>
<p>In order to get the ball rolling with this new mission, players will need to have a chat with Quinn at the Oilwell Basin Base Camp.</p>

</figure>
<p>Along with these freebies, the studio is also releasing separate cosmetic collaboration DLC, but these will need to be purchased. "Please note: these paid DLC items are sold separately and are not available as a pack," Capcom emphasised.</p>
<p>This DLC will include a Chun-Li outfit and a Cammy outfit for Alma, as well as a Blanka-Chan Doll pendant, new gestures and more.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, we got <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> from Circana (formerly NPD) that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered performed very well in the United States last month, managing to outperform the original's 15-month sales in a single month.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo</a> has doubled down on the praise with its own global report on engagement and revenue in April. Oblivion Remastered was second only to Fortnite thanks to an 'outstanding' performance, according to Newzoo, and the analysts called it a benchmark for a successful remaster. Minecraft benefited from the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking movie</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runescape: Dragonwilds</a> both had successful debuts.</p>
<p>Here's the full overview for the month of April 2025 across PC and console games, per Newzoo:</p>
<h2><em><strong>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong> (#2, new) delivered outstanding revenue performance following its surprise launch on April 22, despite the absence of any formal pre-release marketing. The game’s success underscores the enduring power of the IP, the quality of the remaster, and the appeal of its $50 price point, making it a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II / III / Warzone / Black Ops 6&nbsp;</strong>(#3, +7) saw strong momentum with the launch of Season 3 on April 2, which introduced new maps, content, cosmetics, and a new Battle Pass. A key highlight is the reintroduction of a revamped version of Verdansk; the original Battle Royale map in Warzone, tapping into the nostalgia trend which recently enjoys great popularity.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#5, +7) continued its upward trajectory, drawing significant attention and gaining over 4.5 million new players during April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Counter-Strike 2 &amp; GO</strong>&nbsp;(#6, +7) surged following Valve’s release of three new weapon collections (cosmetic skins) on April 1, driving renewed engagement and spend.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft</strong> (#8, +6) climbed in the rankings despite offering movie-themed DLCs and add-ons for free on the Minecraft Marketplace, showcasing the franchise’s exceptional engagement and monetization strength. It’s also worth highlighting that Premium Revenue in April saw a very significant increase, marking this month one of the strongest ever for Minecraft full-game sales.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Forza Horizon 5 (</strong>#9, +69) experienced a substantial boost as the former Xbox/PC exclusive launched on PlayStation at the end of April, expanding its reach to a new audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +8) saw an increase in revenue despite a slight decline in MAU rank. The launch of Season 2 on April 4 introduced new monetization drivers, including a Battle Pass and cosmetic content, which encouraged player spending.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>&nbsp;(#13, new) exceeded sales expectations, surpassing 2 million units sold within just 12 days of launch. The title has resonated strongly with both players and critics, reflecting the impact of a clear creative vision and the dedication of its development team.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</strong>&nbsp;(#16, new) launched in Early Access on April 15 and attracted nearly one million monthly active users in just the second half of the month. Its early success underscores the enduring appeal of the RuneScape IP and the compelling execution of its survival gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>
<h2><em><strong>Engagement Highlights</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft&nbsp;</strong>(#3, null) no movement on the ladder, but Minecraft achieved a record high in monthly active users (MAU) in April, thanks to the success of "A Minecraft Movie." The game attracted both old and new players, selling over 700K copies in April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +16) received its first Early Access content update on April 10 and continues to build momentum, maintaining an impressive 98% positive rating on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>R.E.P.O.&nbsp;</strong>(#13, -1) remains a strong performer in Early Access, sustaining player engagement and earning an overwhelmingly positive review score of 96% on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</strong>(#14) highlights the enduring power of the franchise, entering the top 20 for both MAU and revenue despite launching without pre-release marketing. Notably, most of its MAUs stem from Xbox, following its day-one inclusion in Game Pass.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (#18, -7) is gradually transitioning from a broader appeal to a more dedicated core audience. As expected, PlayStation users are demonstrating the highest retention, driven by the platform’s strong presence in Japan, Monster Hunter's key market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Overwatch 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</strong>(#19, -1) slipped one position, even as the percentage of recent positive Steam reviews more than doubled (48%) compared to its lifetime average (23%). Season 16, which<a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduced a new game mode – Stadium-</a> appears to be a step in the right direction, but fierce competition and a month-over-month decline in console MAU continue to present challenges.</em></li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - One Man Army]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army.1196160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think anyone had a turn-based tactics game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em>s</a> universe on their bingo card, but here we are. Perhaps an even more unlikely combination is that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is developed by Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>Strange Scaffold is a developer known for robust zaniness and unconventional concepts, so their spin on&nbsp;the half-shell heroes is just that: Unexpected. Known for working as a team, the turtles are a force to be reckoned with, but Strange Scaffold turns the concept on its head and asks, "What if the Turtles split up?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=2xCY4qZs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=JcsGcQJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta get a move it. It's just you, after all.</figcaption></figure><h2>Lone Wolves -- or Rather -- Lone Turtles</h2>

<p>Indeed, rather than taking control of all four Turtles at once, this tactics title asks players to control one character per level. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo are all doing their own thing in a post-Shredder, post-Splinter world, and that's led them down different paths.</p>

<p>In <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, levels feature grid-based tiles a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/fire-emblem" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>. Levels are dynamic and throw new obstacles at you as you're told to rush forward to an objective or slay a certain number of enemies. All the while, you have Foot Clan goons ready to pounce on your Turtle. You are, essentially, a lone wolf blazing a path forward against uneven odds.</p>

<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>'s greatest strength is the solo aspect of gameplay; it's also the game's greatest weakness. Like I said, each level has a designated character, so you're forced into the role of a specific Turtle. This gives each character an even amount of playtime to explore their diverse set of abilities.</p>

Sure, we've seen the whole gang fight together numerous times, but that's what makes <em>Ninja Turtles</em> what it is. Level design is somewhat toned down to be minimalistic to balance around controlling one unit per level.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very safe and doesn't try anything daring. Would we had all four turtles together fighting against hordes of Foot Clan, I can just imagine the great synergy and chaos that could ensue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=p6YtRcsI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=TjG6YMCW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy more abilities in the store!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Turtles' Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>But for all my gripes, Strange Scaffold does an admirable job of making every Turtle feel distinguished and powerful on their own. The Turtles' abilities reflect that of their personalities: Leonardo is a brutal force to be reckoned with and easily the most powerful of the four. Donatello uses gadgets to maneuver around the map and shock his enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michelangelo skates around on his board with high mobility, flipping around enemies. Raphael, probably my least favorite of the bunch to play, is still a powerhouse, especially with his Berserker ability, which leeches health from KO'd enemies.</p>

<p>Combat generally revolves around careful consideration of spending your limited amount of action points. Wise usage of these points and positioning your unit well is crucial for survival, especially being one character. You can get surrounded by the Foot Clan pretty easily if you're not careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=kPdGvvAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=hWzoNx0L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get Radical.</figcaption></figure><p>One crucial component of the Turtles' attacks is buffs and debuffs. Like in Leonardo's case, getting a KO with his Rad Slash attack grants a stack of Radical, which increases the damage of his next attack. In a similar fashion, on KO, Leonardo's Feint Cut adds a stack of Evasion, allowing him to completely dodge an attack.</p>

<p>It's all about the manipulation of these buffs rather than just trying to defeat as many Foot Clan ninjas as you can. Of course, debuffs play a huge part in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> as well. Donatello, for instance, can use Stun Kunai to cause the Stuck debuff, keeping enemies in place for a round.</p>

<p>Playing with debuffs, especially Stuck,<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> appeals to the tactical gamer in me. Throwing down Donatello's shock traps, applying Stuck, and watching multiple enemies get KO'd in a single round is cathartic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=wSBwB9sa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=mSlfLWmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No one's gettin' to me with this impenetrable wall of shock traps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Goin' on a Rampage in<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em></h2>

<p>Once you get the hang of how each turtle plays,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> isn't all that challenging. The first few levels are a little tricky, just because you're not familiar with their skills. After a few rounds, you'll start going through Foot Clan baddies like nothin'.</p>

<p>Leonardo is <em>especially</em> powerful, and for most of his levels, he is nearly invincible if you use your abilities competently. It's great to fulfill that power fantasy, but victory feels like it comes too easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=S08iu2eb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=ntUkd4Vl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The odds are stacked against them.</figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, enemy variety is lacking. There are only a handful of enemies, and most of them are simply standard goons with three health. Those can be taken out in a hit or two. The more powerful ones are just slower and tankier, and a few other enemies thrown into the mix, like ninjas that spawn with their own stack of Evasion, hardly pose a challenge.</p>

<p>It <em>is </em>fun to faceroll these enemies and plow through levels. A lot of the Turtles' abilities allow for you to push enemies. Pushing enemies off the edge of the map for a cheap kill is always satisfying. So, while I do enjoy the combat and variety each of the group brings,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is lacking in terms of difficulty and enemy variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=gqBiErXO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=ljMT0LRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Donatello, always the brains of the operation.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Blasé Adventure for the Gang</h2>

<p>My understanding of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> lore is, admittedly, surface level. I dressed up as Leonardo as a kid for dinner every night, enjoyed the occasional episode of the show, and I still play the games that come out. Still, I'm not an expert with the story by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>With that in mind, one of Strange Scaffolds' strengths is writing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I just don't see that strength on display here. The idea that Shredder and Splinter are dead and the group is out on their own is a concept that opens the door to multiple intriguing narratives. Most of the dialogue just isn't compelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninja Turtles comprise such strong personalities, and while the tech-geek side of Donatello or the rapscallion nature of Michelangelo shines through in some instances,&nbsp; nothing about it really captivated me. It's a breezy game, too, so there's little time for the narrative to get rolling when it can be completed in five or so hours.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=tepbRM_S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-ost-unlock.jpg?itok=vrh4sEF5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can unlock songs to listen to at your leisure. The OST in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is quite excellent!</figcaption></figure>

<p>The art style is something I'm conflicted on. I'm a fan of the classic look of the Turtles, and the figurine-like models of the characters and enemies can be endearing. The UI, with its punk, grafiti-like aesthetic oozes with that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em> charm. The rest of it, well, it's a bit bland.</p>

<p>Levels take place in four areas: The streets of New York, the sewer, the subway, and the rooftops. Spend a moment on the subway as Leonardo, and you've pretty much seen how the rest of his levels will look. The sewers, yeah, they're the same throughout Donatello's handful of levels, too.</p>

<p>Despite some gripes,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>is a charming and competently made tactical game. It feels a bit subdued, especially with the focus on controlling one single Ninja Turtle per level. Despite this, the Turtles themselves feel distinct enough, and there's just the right amount of strategy for it to be a good-but-not-radical time.</p>

            <p>A new video from Youtuber Destin Legarie includes a number of allegations about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> developers Bungie from anonymous former employees. Amongst other things, we hear that Bungie staff once proposed a Destiny subscription model, but were "vehemently shut down" by leaders. There are also lots of claims about toxic, unaccountable management, and some throwaway insights about how the company's culture has changed in the course of being acquired by Sony. </p><!--more-->
<p>I confess, the part that catches my eye is a smaller detail: there was apparently concern that a particular Destiny 2 armour set would be so compelling for players, it might stop them hoovering up new gear in the Eververse cosmetics store. I find this intriguing because it speaks to the tricky line I imagine most artists have to walk when calibrating the appeal of outfits in loot-driven games with microtransactions. You don't want any of your work to look ugly, but there needs to be an obvious distinction between the included drops and the bits you're selling separately. It seems like it should be fun, in the absence of tyrannous executives, to haggle over that distinction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">Destin Legarie's video</a> is a mixture of paraphrase and quotation. He doesn't share much background on his sources, or indicate how many he's spoken to, so it's not clear how representative all this is of the current mood at Bungie. </p>
<p>Sources in the video accuse the company's leadership of being arbitrary, high-handed and overpaid, often shutting down suggestions from creatives in meetings. No names are given, but Legarie's interviewees do comment positively about certain former Bungie higher-ups - former chief technology officer Luis Villegas, former community manager Eric Osborne, and former game director Joe Blackburn. </p>
<p>The video's sources also reserve some vitriol for Bungie's human resources team, who are characterised as covering up for the missteps and bad behaviour of leaders. One particular HR person, who has now apparently left, is described as being more concerned about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-buying-destiny-devs-bungie-for-36-billion">securing the company's acquisition by Sony in 2022</a>, as part of which they were supposedly due to receive a $5 million payout. Sources also describe having their social media feeds monitored and being warned against promoting themselves as Bungie employees.</p>
<p>According to the video, some or all of those leaders who were difficult to work with have now been shifted to the Marathon reboot, leaving people with much less gamedev experience in charge of Destiny. All this has, according to one source, caused "structural issues that severely undermined the studio's culture, decision-making, and the final product". There's also talk of the studio's "internal language" growing more corporate, with a distinct shift from talk of "games" and "players" to talk of "companies", "products" and "customers" during the Sony acquisition.</p>
<p>Among the examples of this corpo thinking is an alleged disagreement over one Destiny set, the Trials Of Osiris PvP armour, which has fixtures that light up when you win consecutive matches and gain reputation. Management were said to be so worried about its enduring appeal that they "almost [blocked] Expanded Trials Accessory glows to protect Eververse sales". In the abstract, it's a fun one to consider inasmuch as the Osiris gear is obviously designed with permanence in mind - it's a wearable ranking system - but that cuts against the logic of a free-to-play shooter that needs you to keep topping up your DLC wardrobe to make money.</p>
<p>Assuming all of this is legitimate reporting, it continues a chaotic month in which Bungie have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">caught using an artist's work without permission in Marathon</a>, a project other anonymous former developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">described as evidence of "good old boy" thinking among Bungie leadership</a>, who have allegedly ignored staff concerns about its shortage of PvE functionality.</p>
<p>I'll ask Bungie and Sony for comment. All this follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs last year amid stagnating returns for Destiny</a>. As part of that restructuring, some former Bungie developers have now formed a new studio at PlayStation who appear to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">working on a game about frogs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>DICE has published a <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1925204954978861553" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing some of its thoughts about the class system for the upcoming Battlefield game, and it includes bringing back a controversial feature from Battlefield 2042.</p><p>Older titles, like the much-loved Battlefield 4, had class-locked weapons, but Battlefield 2042 introduced the ability for players in any class to choose whatever weapon they wanted. Some portion of the audience didn't enjoy this, while others embraced this expanded freedom, and DICE is sticking with it for the next Battlefield game.</p><p>In Battlefield 6, or whatever the new game is called, DICE said it will allow for "fully customizable weapon loadouts" that give players the "freedom to play the way [they] want."</p><p>Each class will have signature weapons, however, and using them provides certain benefits. For example, DICE said if you choose the Recon class, a weapon from the sniper rifle category will afford increased breath-holding duration. If a player who chose the Assault class uses a sniper rifle, they don't get this benefit.</p><p>DICE said it wanted to offer players the option of customizing their loadouts irrespective of class because doing so may allow them to "meet the needs of your squad" to have success on the battlefield.</p><p>Battlefield 2042 launched with "Specialist" characters as opposed to the traditional class system. People generally did not like this, and DICE brought back the four traditional classes in a later update.</p><p>The developer also confirmed that each class in Battlefield 6 will have a signature trait that provides passive bonuses; a Recon player will be able to spot enemies while aiming down sights, for example. Classes have signature gadgets, too, and they are unique to each class with the aim of giving players what they need to "fulfill the role of that class."</p><p>"We envision the future of Battlefield classes to be a series of interconnected systems and fundamentals that shape your role on the field, while granting you the freedom to customize how you execute that role," DICE said. "Through Battlefield Labs play sessions, feedback, and data gathering, we aim to strike a balance between defined roles and player choice."</p><p>While this is DICE's plan for now, the studio said it might make changes throughout the Battlefield Labs testing process. DICE encouraged people to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> for a chance to try the game out in a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>. As for when it may launch, it's due for release by the end of March 2026, but now that GTA 6 has been delayed, some are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">theorizing it may come out this fall.</a></p>

			<p>Over the years, Rockstar Games and Take-Two have filed multiple patents that highlight how Grand Theft Auto VI will revolutionize open-world games forever.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 Alerts recently posted on <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X</a> a recap of ten patents owned by Rockstar Games that highlight how the game will push video game boundaries forward to offer an experience like few others. The patents include<a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140270578450830" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> tech for the creation of lifelike characters</a>, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140273917108735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulation of fluid flow on 3D surfaces</a>, seamless NPC movement powered by a <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140277536825480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">road network graph</a> for smooth virtual navigation, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140281114566866" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced graphics rendering</a> with sharper details, better lighting and smoother performance, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140285455696244" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continuous level of detail</a> for models which will make buildings, cars and NPCs look great no matter their position relative to the camera, <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140289750598054" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduced load times in online sessions</a> that will allow users to join others seamlessly, use of motion capture in conjunction with AI to predict <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140293563228503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">body pose</a>, a system that manages <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140297015218414" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-game transactions</a>, use of <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140306066550898" target="_blank" rel="noopener">data-driven blocks for animations</a>, allowing characters to adapt to any situation without requiring rigid coding, and enhanced anti-cheat measures with <a href="https://x.com/GTA6Alerts/status/1924140309447164001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hidden game variables</a>. Each individual patent can be checked out in full by searching for the patent number in <a href="https://patents.google.com/">Google Patents.</a></p>
<p>Little has been shown so far of Grand Theft Auto VI, but given Rockstar Games' history, there's no doubt that it will be among the most impressive open-world games ever released, even if it ends up using only a portion of the tech showcased in the patents above. Sadly, fans of the series will have to wait longer than anticipated to return to Vice City, as the game won't launch this year as originally announced, and will debut on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S only in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 2026</a>. At least, the bad news of the delay was accompanied by <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/">a new trailer</a>, which provided a second, great look at the game.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26th on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

He is the central figure, one whom an entire universe revolves around. But, it would be a shame if you watched years of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> films and didn’t realize that it’s truly the cast of characters around Hunt that make him who he is, and thusly, made this franchise what it has become.</p><p>Hunt would’ve been dead years ago if Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) weren’t opening prison doors for him, or monitoring the security systems inside the world’s most secure buildings. Beyond their operational importance, villains like Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and August Walker (Henry Cavill) give powerhouse performances while also pushing Hunt to the edge of his limits. Some of the best lines are uttered by people other than Hunt. And the emotional stakes of each film typically are from these side characters.</p><p>In honor of the unsung heroes, here are the most irreplaceable supporting characters in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aaron Paul was in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>? Yes, I’ve seen every movie multiple times and still have that reaction sometimes. A weaselly slacker-looking version of him briefly appears as the brother of Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan) at her engagement party to Hunt. His main contributions are to appear slovenly next to Hunt and unintentionally aid in her kidnapping. The energy that would make him famous as <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Jesse Pinkman is tightly bottled up and kept under wraps for his few lines of dialogue. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the biggest missed opportunities of the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise is abandoning Ethan Hunt’s most charismatic teammate ever in Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). In the underrated <em>Mission: Impossible III, </em>he avoided gunfire and the blades of gigantic wind turbines while piloting a rescue helicopter with the same cool he displays while charming angry drivers in a traffic stop he’s created as a diversion with the smoothest Italian you’ll ever hear in this franchise. Was he memorable? Yes. But, since Ethan and his team went on to thwart bigger threats without him, he wasn’t what you’d call an essential part of the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A virtuoso acting talent such as Sir Anthony Hopkins being near the bottom of any movie list has nothing to do with his performance and everything do with his character’s utility. Appearing briefly in <em>Mission: Impossible II </em>as the sly and wise Mission Commander Swanbeck, Hopkins’s standout scene with Cruise is one of the coolest mission briefings in the history of the franchise. You can feel the confidence Swanbeck exhibits when he tells Hunt, a man who previously broke into Langley, “This is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt. It’s Mission: Impossible.” Alas, Hopkins’ talents were wasted on a character so replaceable he was only used for one scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ditching <em>MI3</em>'s JV squad of expendables, <em>Ghost Protocol</em> put Paula Patton in the shoes of operative Jane Carter, a woman who’s out for revenge against the hitwoman who killed her partner. The movie doesn’t give her a lot to work with but she matches Cruise’s energy with a physical performance that sees her go toe-to-toe with assassin Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux) assassin on the 130th floor of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and seduce  feisty telecoms billionaire Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor). She completed the mission with full marks but failed to leave much of a memorable impression on the series beyond that. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve always felt that any globe-hopping espionage movie that lacks a grizzled Frenchman is missing something, that certain je ne sais quoi. Maybe that’s because I first fell in love with spy movies in the ’90s thanks to the one-two punch of 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and 1998’s <em>Ronin</em>. As <em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s Franz Krieger, although we’re initially meant to think he’s a basically good member of Ethan Hunt’s new crackerjack team, he feels like bad news from the beginning and only confirms our suspicions before the end. Reno skillfully gives off just enough of a sleazy vibe to set off our alarm bells, and his presence makes us wary of possible threats to Ethan not just from outside the team, but from within it as well. Most importantly, though, with Reno’s presence in the mix, it gives the film that authentic espionage movie flavor, the stuff of cigarette-smoke-filled safehouses, narrow European streets, and potential treachery lurking around every corner. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In order to clear his name and identify the real mole in the original <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, Ethan must track down an enigmatic figure known only as Max with whom the mole had dealings. Given that Max is a shadowy and powerful arms dealer, we might be expecting a Keyser Söze type—a menacing, larger-than-life underworld kingpin who you feel would just as soon put a bullet in your head as let you walk away from a meeting alive. So it’s a wonderful surprise when the hood is pulled from Ethan’s head at his first meeting with Max and we instead see the great Vanessa Redgrave, who plays Max as enigmatic, yes, but also effervescent—a woman who can both fix Ethan with a cold intellectual stare as she asks him probing questions and gush about how much she adores his brazen confidence. </p><p>Redgrave gives Max tremendous depth; she’s fiercely intelligent, deeply private (“I don’t have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession; it’s like a warm blanket.”), and not without warmth herself. She establishes in that very first film that this franchise’s take on the world of international intrigue won’t just trot out the usual stereotypes for its villains but will offer something smarter and more surprising—figures whose power comes not from their skills with firearms or the ruthless deployment of violence but from their intellect and ability to negotiate with others to secure what they want. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can usually see a double cross coming a mile away in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>. Not when John Musgrave is silently mouthing instructions only a restrained Hunt can understand, and before he slips him a knife to set himself free. With Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s overwhelmingly dastardly performance as Owen Davian distracting us, and Laurence Fishburne’s ambiguously snarly depiction of IMF director Theodore Brassel misdirecting us, Crudup’s slick performance slipped his nefarious intentions through our detection like a snake in the grass. Without Crudup, <em>Mission: Impossible III </em>is predictably one-dimensional, and the outstanding torture scene fake-out with a captured Hunt and his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) has less of a punch. Musgrave is the logic behind the madness, and also an essential part of the film. He just isn’t as integral to the franchise as the 12 characters ahead of him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mission: Impossible II</em> doesn’t work without Thandie Newton being seductive while maintaining her agency, and being cunning without being unrealistically fearless. As Nyah Nordoff-Hall, she’s a professional thief who carries the emotional weight of a pretty emotionless action flick featuring more gunfire than kisses. Nyah held her own whether she was feigning attraction to a psychopathic capitalist looking to profit off killing people with the Chimera virus, or  she was dangerously flirting with Ethan Hunt by racing cars with him along a cliff. Few characters not named Ethan Hunt mean as much to any <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movie working as Nyah Nordoff-Hall.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-recommend-id="image://64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1404" data-height="790" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-recommend-id="image://64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1404" data-height="790" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solomon Lane is probably the smartest <em>Mission: Impossible </em>villain ever. The rogue MI6 agent disillusioned with the global power structure was always one step ahead of Ethan Hunt, an agent so capable, he’d previously infiltrated both Langley and the Vatican without being detected. From the moment he appeared onscreen as the man who’s infiltrated Hunt’s mission delivery system and trapped him, we knew we were witnessing a rare villain. He framed the IMF, manipulated CIA double-agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), and formed the shadowy Syndicate of former agents. Beyond <em>being</em> evil, he <em>sounded </em>evil, with a gravelly whisper that made every threat feel like a dark premonition. He was so good at being bad that he was the villain for two separate <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies, making him one of the most invaluable baddies in the franchise’s history.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be honest, IMF director Theodore Brassel would’ve made this list simply for uttering the two coldest sentences I’ve ever heard in a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie. With Ethan Hunt strapped to a gurney after being suspected of going rogue and getting IMF agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) killed, Brassel can see the disdain shooting out of Hunt’s eyes and doesn’t blink in the face of it. Instead he tells him, “You can look at me with those judgmental, incriminating eyes all you want. But, I bullshit you not: I will bleed on the flag to make sure the flag stays red.” Even as a one-off in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise, Fishburne’s incredible performance as Brassel made him a character you could never forget. Without him, <em>Mission Impossible 3</em> wouldn’t be what it was.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can’t possibly think you can replace the only woman to ever make globe-trotting, death-defying secret agent Ethan Hunt settle down for even a second. Julia’s irresistible appeal had a man known for jumping off motorcycles and escaping car explosions helping with a dinner party like a suburban dad with a license to kill. Depending on how you view Ilsa Faust, Julia is arguably the most important woman in Hunt’s life, and thus the most important woman in this male-dominated action film franchise. She’s Hunt’s emotional weak point, one that Owen Davian presses on to bring him out of hiding in <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the only person Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) goes out of his way to train to be a spy, and one of the main reasons the water supply of a third of the world’s population wasn’t poisoned in <em>Fallout. </em>Beyond that, Michelle Monaghan plays her with a grounded realism that makes her the most relatable character in a movie franchise full of people meant to be extraordinary in the best and worst ways. Without Monaghan’s performance as Julia Meade-Hunt, Ethan Hunt would be nothing more than a means to an end for the audience. With her, he’s a fully formed man with stakes beyond the mission he chose to accept.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The screenplay for 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> was co-written by David Koepp and <em>Chinatown </em>scribe Robert Towne, and while I have no way of knowing exactly which elements of the script each was responsible for, I’ve always suspected that it was Towne who made the character of Kittridge so memorable. If any character in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> speaks with the kind of hard-boiled language that made 1974's <em>Chinatown</em> a neo-noir classic, it’s Eugene Kittridge. Kittridge is a higher-up at the IMF who believes Ethan is a mole and a traitor, and he will seemingly do just about anything, including making life much more difficult for Hunt’s family, to get him to surrender. At one point, he coldly tells Ethan that “dying slowly in America can be a very expensive proposition” and later, he pragmatically informs a subordinate that “everybody has pressure points. You find something that’s personally important to him, and you squeeze.” </p><p>But it’s more than the great dialogue he gets to spout that makes Kittridge so compelling; it’s the performance by Henry Czerny, who plays Eugene as a tense, tightly coiled bureaucrat whose ruthless dedication to following the letter of institutional procedure has blinded him to Ethan’s innocence and humanity. After his knockout appearance in the first film, Kittridge disappeared for decades, finally resurfacing in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, though he didn’t have any moments that reminded us the crackling tension he and Hunt generated when they butted heads way back in 1996. Here’s hoping <em>Final Reckoning </em>rectifies that. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Out of everyone who’s been on Ethan Hunt’s team, there have only been two who I felt could match his tactical skills: Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and William Brandt, played by Jeremy Renner. His spy skills are so embedded into the core of who he is that when he was pretending to be an analyst, he instinctively ripped a gun out of Hunt’s hand and pointed it at him quicker than you could sneeze. Without him, Hunt would’ve been captured by the CIA when he was on the run in <em>Rogue Nation </em>and the entire fake meeting to intercept a nuclear launch control codebook would’ve failed in <em>Ghost Protocol</em>. Outside of Hunt, he’s the only person who can both play the bureaucracy game, explaining to the government why the IMF is essential when the need arises, and get his hands dirty by beating up terrorists. To put it plainly, William Brandt isn’t someone you can replace easily.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The man jumped out of a plane and got knocked unconscious by a bolt of lightning, all to keep his double agent cover intact. How the hell do you replace someone like that? On the right day, August Walker is the second most villainous character in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history for his mixture of unflinching stoicism and charismatic yet radicalized ideological thinking. First off, he’s probably the only villain in the entire series that physically pushed Hunt to the limit in a fight across multiple rooftops. Secondly, he fools multiple government officials and agents whose entire jobs are to be intelligent. Lastly, he might be the single most handsome person to ever step foot on a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> set, which makes his dastardly double cross so jarring to some.

This let the film subvert the expectations of viewers in 1996, who wouldn’t have anticipated that the noble Phelps would be revealed as the double-crossing villain behind the deaths of nearly every member of Ethan’s team. Jon Voight plays both sides of the coin to perfection, believably projecting the seasoned, fatherly veteran in the opening scenes before everything goes sideways, and then making us understand how Phelps could have fallen so far and grown so disillusioned with the institutions to which he’s given so much of his life after Ethan puts the pieces together. Though it’s been nearly 30 years since that fateful betrayal, it remains the most memorable and emotionally affecting plot twist reveal in the entire series. One gets the sense that it haunts Ethan still, that perhaps part of what spurs him on to be such an extraordinary agent is having witnessed firsthand, in the fall of Jim Phelps, what he might become if he were to stop prioritizing other people’s lives over his own. —Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No one has provided a better foil for Hunt, or a better match for the gravity well around Cruise’s onscreen presence, than Rebecca Ferguson. Her double-crossing femme fatale Ilsa Faust consistently keeps everyone off balance, bringing an undercurrent of chaos and intrigue to every scene she’s a part of. Ferguson also managed to go three movies without ever fading into the background as simply another prop to assist in Cruise’s one-man action star show. She’s the cold, unbending edge the series sometimes lacks, and the only person who managed to consistently keep up with Cruise and often outpace him. It’s a crime she won’t be back for <em>Final Reckoning</em>. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-recommend-id="image://e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="701" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-recommend-id="image://e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="701" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s get this out of the way: Owen Davian is the greatest villain in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history, and <em>Mission: Impossible III</em> is criminally underrated. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a maniac with an air of inevitability. He rarely gets flustered, and always speaks with the calm, self-assured tone of a doctor that already knows that all of your options for survival are in their hands. The opening scene alone, in which he threatens to shoot Ethan’s wife in front of him and isn’t the least bit persuaded by Hunt’s trained trickery, is the most intense scene in all of <em>Mission: Impossible. </em>He made you believe he was going to find Hunt’s wife and make her bleed. He made you believe he was going to escape seemingly impenetrable law enforcement custody. He made you believe he was real. That is the highest honor any actor can receive. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman turned <em>Mission: Impossible III </em>into an acting masterclass.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-recommend-id="image://20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-recommend-id="image://20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pegg’s Benji Dunn and his nervous wit feel so integral to the DNA of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> now that it’s hard to believe the character wasn’t even introduced until <em>MI3</em>. From the lab to the field, Pegg’s perfect comedic timing and effortless guilelessness give every increasingly bonkers scheme and highwire stunt the all-important “oh my god I can’t believe we’re doing this!” sidekick energy. He’s the innocent, wide-eyed Kombucha face to Ving Rhames’ exhausted eye-roll and Tom Cruise’s winning smile. From <em>MI5</em>'s “A minute ago you were dead!” to casually telling Hunt to jump off a cliff in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, Pegg can turn from traumatic shock to deadpan Brit on a dime. No matter how bad the writing gets, it always works when it’s coming out of Pegg’s mouth. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-recommend-id="image://82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-format="jpg" data-width="1242" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-recommend-id="image://82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-format="jpg" data-width="1242" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283">Luther Stickell</a></span> is the rock-solid and dependable foundation of the <em>Mission Impossibl</em>e franchise, showing up in every film.

            <p>Hot off the heels of his turn as Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison in A Minecraft Movie, Jason Momoa is reportedly in talks to star in another video game adaptation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/street-fighter-movie-eyes-jason-momoa-noah-centineo-more-1236407261/">Deadline</a> sources, Momoa is currently in talks for a role in Legendary’s live-action Street Fighter movie, based on Capcom's fighting series. As for who Momoa may be playing should these talks prove successful, that for now remains unknown.</p>
<p>As well as Momoa, Andrew Koji (Bullet Train), Noah Centineo (Warfare) and WWE wrestler Roman Reigns (Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw) are all said to be in talks for the Street Fighter adaptation.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-gets-new-director-still-set-for-2026">Kitao Sakurai would direct the upcoming Street Fighter film</a>, with Capcom "deeply involved" in the adaptation as well.</p>
<p>The film is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/live-action-street-fighter-movie-gets-2026-release-date">set for a release next year</a>, on 20th March, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-film-and-tv-rights-bought-by-legendary-entertainment">first been announced back in 2023</a>. Further details for now remain thin on the ground, but it sounds like production could soon be ramping up, so stay tuned for more. Personally, I would love to see cameos from Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue (but I am not holding my breath).</p>
<p>As for Momoa, well, he is probably riding high on the success of A Minecraft Movie right now. The live-action adaptation, which also starred Jack Black, became a meme-filled hit on its release in April. The film generated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m worldwide on its first weekend</a>, and has been such a success that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">there are already talks about a sequel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-nintendo-switch-2-ports-are-reportedly-in-the-works-and-will-be-revealed-soon.1196079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-ports-nintendo-switch-2-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ports of Xbox games for Nintendo Switch 2 are currently in the works, and their reveal should be imminent, according to a new online report.</p>
<p>The Verge's Tom Warren confirmed in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610793/hellblade-2-ps5-release-date-xbox-ninja-theory">recent report</a> focused on the announcement of Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Enhanced, which is launching on PlayStation 5 this Summer, that Microsoft is also working on some Xbox ports for Nintendo Switch 2, which he expects will be revealed soon. Reliable leaker NateTheHate also said the same on X, so we should probably expect to see the announcement of the first few ports in the coming weeks during the "non-E3" season.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Next up: Xbox games coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925234110588473837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Microsoft already having released ports of Xbox games on the original Nintendo Switch, such as Sea of Thieves and Grounded, it's not surprising to learn that more games will be coming to the next-generation system, which promises to be extremely successful at launch. As for which Xbox games could hit the Nintendo Switch 2, no one can say at the moment, but it's been previously rumored that <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Microsoft Flight Simulator</a> will launch on the system. Seeing the latter run on Nintendo Switch 2 would be quite interesting from a technical standpoint, as the game can be quite demanding, although if Asobo Studio managed to get the game running on Xbox Series S, it will definitely be possible to scale the game to the Switch 2 hardware capabilities, which may be better than anticipated, judging from how <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Cyberpunk 2077 runs on the system.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sedap-a-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour.1196076/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sedap-culinary-adventure-review-sweet-and-sour<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there’s one thing that video games need more of, it’s cooking-related games. I don’t mean the mini-games where you throw a bunch of ingredients and use them to buff your main character’s stamina or whatever, I mean games that focus entirely on the food. There’s something so comforting and satisfying about being able to virtually plate up a bowl of food. Perhaps it’s the fact that I don’t have to clean up afterwards or worry about storing the leftovers.</p>

<p>Of course, the bulk of cooking games revolve around serving burgers, pizzas, and salads. While I do love those foods, as a south asian, I do have to ask, “Where’s the rice?” <em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em> answers that question with much cheer. A name that means ‘delicious’ in Malay, Sedap! is an action-adventure co-op cooking game much along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/overcooked-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, but with some extra toppings.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=L7VMn5rr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250514232339_1.jpg?itok=b7i83I5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What's Cooking?</h2>

<p><em>Sedap!</em> follows Som and Gon, aspiring restaurateurs who are looking to expand their culinary horizons. They come across the Makanomicon, a recipe book filled with new recipes. Filled with excitement and curiosity, the duo decides to start a food truck and set out for Khaya Island, an abandoned archipelago brimming with ingredients, monsters, and mysteries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, I had to put my relationship with my partner to the test, so while I played as Som, whose strength lies in cooking, my partner played as Gon, the skilled hunter. While both characters are capable of cooking and combat, we quickly learned that we would have to capitalize on each character’s strengths and optimize accordingly. After a few levels, we built a good rhythm where one would venture out and focus on getting ingredients while the other stayed back in the kitchen and served up dishes.</p>

<p>Each level adds a new recipe for you to learn from the Makanomicon, so naturally, the game gets progressively harder. The cooking process is mostly a series of button-mashing, with the final preparation of the dish being a QTE. If you fail it more than three times, you have to make the dish all over again. While on their own, they’re a breeze to get through, the pressure of delivering the dish on time is what will get to you. To my chagrin, I ended up fumbling a few times due to the sheer amount of orders piling up.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=_i5F-r63 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250520141753_1.jpg?itok=l1v27TOH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To fetch your ingredients, you’ll have to weed your way through enemies and obstacles. <em>Sedap!</em> features simple hack-and-slash combat. You can buy new weapons and charms to alter your stats, and some weapons even unleash a special ability when you charge the attack. You have a health bar, of course, so when you’re knocked out, you need to be revived by your teammate or you have to wait for a few seconds.</p>

<p>At the end of the level, you’ll be rated based on how many dishes you successfully delivered in time, and you’re even granted a bonus based on the freshness of the food as well as how fast you were. You also get to see customer reviews, which, I gotta say, they’re pretty realistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game slowly reveals more and more mechanics for you to keep in mind, some being hindrances, like a gate that can be only opened when someone stands on the switch, while others assist, like teletotems that allow you to transport items from one part of the area to another.</p>

<h2>Charm with a Side of Bugs</h2>

<p>In solo mode, you end up playing as both Som and Gon, and the game helps you out in switching between the two when it’s convenient. However, some of <em>Sedap’s</em> mechanics don’t really translate that well into the solo-player version. Your choice of weapon or charm that you choose to equip doesn’t really make all that much of a difference, since you get automatically swapped between the protagonists. Teletotems get rendered useless as you can still transport the item, but you still have to make the trek back to the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250515001701_1.jpg?itok=OUzqwF-n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250515001701_1.jpg?itok=3ePCboh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game does adjust your health and the time you get to prepare a dish, but there isn’t anything unique to the solo mode, which makes it feel like an afterthought. Oddly enough, you can’t have separate save files, so if you do want to play solo, you have no choice but to start from the very beginning. In fact, even if you want to play local co-op, you start afresh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tested out both local co-op as well as online co-op while playing <em>Sedap!</em>&nbsp;My partner and I tried playing online, and although we were in the house using the same internet, we both experienced frequent disconnects. We decided to switch to local co-op, and though the connection was much more stable, we still encountered our fair share of bugs and controller disconnects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sometimes the controls would get swapped around, and the X button would become the A button. Other times, the environment would just lock a character into a certain area, leaving us with no choice but to restart the level. Even the UI would sometimes be unresponsive to my controller, and I’d have to switch to keyboard and mouse just to change something in the settings.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250520134525_1.jpg?itok=PMTh5Nfd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250520134525_1.jpg?itok=_q8K8Aj_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Bugs aside, <em>Sedap!</em> is a real charmer when it comes to visuals and sound. From the protagonists to the monsters, the designs are stinking adorable. As you’d expect from a cooking-based game, each dish looks like something I’d want to eat. The colours are warm and inviting, much like an actual kitchen. The clatter and clinking of woks and pots are a treat for the ears, especially paired with the game’s culturally infused soundtrack.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts - Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</h2>

<p>In the shallow pool of cooking games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2650730/SEDAP_A_Culinary_Adventure/" rel="nofollow"><em>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</em></a> stands proud with its Southeast Asian roots. It’s a genuinely fun game when you’re not faced with frequent disconnects and glitches. It still feels like a dish-in-progress, but if you’re willing to overlook a few hiccups, <em>Sedap!</em> is absolutely worth a try.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Sedap! A Culinary Adventure</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <p>
I can’t be the only person here who’s ever had a fistfight with their washing-up. I have this big metal spatula that has a malicious habit of bouncing out of the drying rack. Again and again, it sneaks under my elbow to spring and sproing over the lino, gathering as much stray onion peel as it can on the way to the door. The fourth time this happened I bent it in two. Then I thought my sieve was giving me stinkeye, so I threw it down and stamped on it, gangland-style. Look, it was kind of a bad day. But one thing I will swear to you, probably-concerned reader: I would <em>never</em> behave this way towards my leftovers.

Any food I don’t finish is placed in fresh Tupperware, carefully dated in black marker, and slotted into the fridge like a holy relic. Sometimes, I open the fridge just to behold my works. In this regard, I am unlike the burned-out white collar protagonist of Leftovers KO!, who opens his fridge one evening to find a hamburger that has gotten so mad at being mouldy it wants to beat his face in.
</p>
<p>
The hamburger is just the start of your troubles. There’s a positively Satanic slice of stale pizza in the living room, a manky, musclebound… artichoke? I think? in the pantry, and a rabid stick of celery in the bedroom. In the absence of a compost bin, all these putrid hand-drawn foodstuffs must be pummelled into submission, using a combat system inspired by Nintendo Entertainment System classic Punch-Out.</p>
<p>You will dodge, block, punch and haymaker while trying not to run out of stamina. I found the demo quite tricky: you’ll need to KO each oozing comestible several times, and they’ll come back harder every time they clamber to their feet. Along the way, you’ll learn new moves to master in the training room. There's support for keyboard or controller inputs and I'm equally terrible with both.
</p>
<p>
It’s all the work of Mountain Man Animation, with Feardemic publishing. Find the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3169060/Leftovers_KO/">Steam</a>. The full game launches on 25th May which, coincidentally, is when I’m doing my next grocery run. Again, though, I must protest that I would never assault my own cooking, though many would consider my cooking an assault.

                <p>Elgato is introducing Stream Deck modules, the MK.2 Stream Deck, and new Virtual Stream Deck software. The Elgato Stream Deck, as the name suggests, was initially aimed at streamers as a way to quickly do things like manipulate on-screen stream elements without having to interrupt your stream by going to a separate app. Instead, a number of programmable buttons on the interface can be bound to certain apps, keybinds, and commands to achieve quick results, such as changing stream scenes or sending your audience to another creator's stream in a raid. It turns out, though, that there are lots of uses for such an idea.</p><p>Elgato's developer-friendly platform has long supported letting anyone do just about anything with a Stream Deck, but now it is looking to blow out that experience in a big way with its newest showings at Computex, the annual computing convention held in Taipei, Taiwan.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3563" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module" data-collection="" title="6531726 - Elgato Stream Deck Module">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Elgato Stream Deck Module</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch\/dp\/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Elgato-Stream-Deck-Scissor-Switch/dp/B0DVZCB7JD?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Stream Deck Module is a case of a company listening to its users and responding. Hobbyists have been ripping apart Stream Decks to use the buttons and front panel as parts of bigger projects, and the Module is for exactly those users. Available in 6-, 15-, and 32-key variants and housed in an aluminum casing, these unbranded panels are intended to be integrated into those projects. The Module will be available for $49.99 for the six-key variant, $129.99 for the 15-key model, and $199.99 for 32-keys. </p>                      </div><p>Alongside the Modules, a $79.99 Stream Deck network dock will allow you to plug a Stream Deck in anywhere you have a network port, further opening the possibilities for use in things like smart home setups and other projects.</p><p>The MK.2 Stream Deck, available for $149.99, pushes things forward in a different way. If you've ever owned a Stream Deck--I use my six-key Stream Deck to control Spotify and switch audio devices--you know the keys can be kind of mushy. Since they're not meant to be used for typing, that's not so bad, but it can be hard to tell if you've actuated one of those keys.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvUcQNxSOGQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/lvUcQNxSOGQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The MK.2 swaps out the membrane beneath the current Stream Deck keys with scissor switches, which can be commonly found on laptop and other similarly low-profile keyboards. Elgato says this will provide "enhanced speed and precision," and "lends itself to typing-style interactions" that could pave the way for new Stream Deck use cases. Remember the <a href="https://www.artlebedev.com/optimus/popularis/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Optimus Keyboard</a>, that striking keyboard that featured a screen on every key? It's not hard to imagine scissor switches allowing Elgato to move in the direction of making a full keyboard.</p><p>Finally, Elgato is bringing a software-only Stream Deck app to market for desktop systems. It's similar to the existing Stream Deck mobile app, which allows you to turn your phone or tablet into a soft Stream Deck. The software will be available at first to anyone with a physical Stream Deck, and will be bundled with the Corsair Scimitar Elite Wireless SE mouse and Corsair Xenon Edge touchscreen--the Stream Deck 7.0 beta requires that you connect one of those devices for the VSD feature to be available. Notably, though, unlike its mobile equivalent, things like custom layouts and virtual faceplates won't be locked behind a paid subscription. Elgato says that the VSD software will be available with a greater range of hardware over time. We're also quite sure that no one is going to figure out a way to simulate owning a Stream Deck to make the software usable by anyone. No way at all.</p>

            <p>Bungie once considered a subscription model for its online shooter Destiny, but the idea was "vehemently shut down" by management.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> went free-to-play in 2019, but players need to pay for the most recent DLC expansions. There's also a store for paid cosmetics.</p>
<p>Other MMOs, such as World of Warcraft or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>, run on a subscription model, where players pay a monthly fee for access. According to a new report, Bungie considered this but management decided against it.</p>

<p>The news comes as part of a report into the current state of Bungie, following word last week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-morale-reportedly-in-free-fall-as-it-grapples-with-stolen-marathon-assets-fallout">Bungie morale is in "free fall"</a> following the fallout of stolen assets used in its next game, Marathon.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">YouTuber and journalist Destin Legarie</a> has spoken to former employees this week. Bungie management were described as "toxic and shut down creatives on a core level", with one former employee stating: "If [management] didn't think of it, it wasn't worth doing."</p>
<p>In this context, when one employee brought up the possibility of a subscription model, it was reportedly "vehemently shut down".</p>
<p>In another example, management was concerned the glowing Trials of Osiris PvP armour was too attractive, which would impact sales of armours in the Eververse store. Decisions by management "prioritised monetisation over player experience", a former Bungie employee said. Another added: "Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed."</p>
<p>One former employee surmised: "Bungie's problems stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Bungie for comment.</p>
<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-criticised-for-spending-millions-on-classic-cars-as-calls-for-leadership-changes-escalate">Bungie CEO Peter Parsons was criticised for spending millions of dollars on classic cars</a>. This news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">a round of layoffs where 220 staff</a>, roughly 17 percent of the company's workforce, lost their jobs.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">Bungie admitted to including designs in Marathon without the artist's consent</a>. And this wasn't the first time Bungie had made this mistake.</p>
<p>The company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">showed off Marathon back in April</a>. It's a PvP extraction shooter set to release on 23rd September this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Embracer - the Swedish conglomerate which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">bought up and then proceeded to lay off countless studios and employees</a> - still plans to release "76 different games during FY 2025/26".</p>
<p>These games will be a mix of "new IPs, sequels, and remasters", according to the <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2025-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1077-million/">company's latest financial report</a>.</p>
<p>Upcoming releases from Embracer studios include Metal Eden, Gothic 1 Remake, Reanimal, Fellowship, Wreckreation, the next SpongeBob SquarePants game, Norse: Oath of Blood and Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core. Embracer also has a number of games it is yet to announce.</p>

<p>The company stated its AAA game releases "continue to be key financial drivers across specific years and quarters". It highlighted upcoming releases <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/killing-floor">Killing Floor</a> 3 and Amy Hennig's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>, the latter of which is being developed by Skydance Games and published by Plaion. </p>
<p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra was once tapped for launch some time around Christmas this year, but was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amy-hennigs-marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-into-next-year">recently delayed into 2026 in order to "add more polish"</a> and ensure players get "the best possible experience" on release.</p>
<p>"We are expecting Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra to drive notable revenues but to have lower margins due to shared economics with several other partners," Embracer wrote.</p>
<p>Embracer also alluded to a third AAA release on its docket, which the company previously expected to debut in FY 25/26 but will "likely need a few more quarters to polish". Therefore, this game will likely release the following fiscal year (I wonder if this is Tomb Raider).</p>
<p>"We expect this specific game to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-nears-2m-sold-as-troubled-publisher-embracer-celebrates-success">financial dynamics more similar to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>," Embracer said.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition to releasing those 76 games in the coming year, Embracer will also spin off Coffee Stain Group into a standalone company by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-announces-plan-to-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-enterprises-and-friends">Embracer announced its split into three companies</a>: Coffee Stain and Friends, Middle-earth Enterprises, and Asmodee Group. Now Coffee Stain, known for the likes of first-person open-world factory building game Satisfactory, will separate.</p>
<p>"This strategic move will allow Coffee Stain Group to focus on its core strengths as passionate game developers and publishers, focused on delivering high quality experiences," Embracer said.</p>
<p>Middle-earth Enterprises will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment as a result, and will unite "top creators and intellectual properties" to "build unforgettable experiences for the fans".</p>
<p>Said Embracer: "The strategy is to transform into one powerhouse group with game development and publishing at its core, complemented with transmedia capabilities within IP licensing, comics, merchandise, film and distribution."</p>
<p>After a huge acquisition spree several years ago, Embracer subsequently shed thousands of staff and shuttered studios such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition Games</a>, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">major $2bn investment fell through</a>.</p>
<p>More recently in March, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Embracer-owned Eidos-Montréal announced it was laying off "up to" 75 members of staff</a>, saying it didn't "have the capacity to entirely reallocate them to our other ongoing projects and services".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
