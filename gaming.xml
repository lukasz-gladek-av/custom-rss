		<p>Nintendo has revealed the two lead actors for the upcoming live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, with the film scheduled for release in just under two years on 7th May 2027.</p>
<p>Shigeru Miyamoto grabbed the social media logins to make the reveal:</p>


<p>“This is Miyamoto. I am pleased to announce that for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda, Zelda will be played by Bo Bragason-san, and Link by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san. I am very much looking forward to seeing both of them on the big screen.”</p>

<p>Yeah, I can see those faces as Zelda and Link, definitely.</p>

<p>Ainsworth already has a number of major credits to his name at the age of 16. He was Pinocchio in the live action remake of that in 2021, was Miles Wingrave in The Haunting of Bly Manor on Netflix, and played William Spiver in the Disney+ film Flora &amp; Ulysses.</p>
<p>Bo Bragason, meanwhile, has been in the BBC productions Three Girls in 2017 and The Jetty in 2024, as well as the Disney+ series Renegade Nell.</p>
<p>The movie is a collaboration between legendary game creator Shigeru Miyamoto and renowned film producer Avi Arad – he led Marvel back from bankruptcy in the mid 90’s pushing licensing deals for film and television, prior to the company’s sale to Disney, and has continued to have producer credits on Sony’s extended Spider-Man universe of films, while Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and The Maze Runner trilogy’s Wes Ball is on board as director.</p>
<p>At this stage we know nothing about the story that this film adaptation will tell, though things are clearly falling into place with the casting of the two leads. We’d obviously expect them to lean on the established tropes of Link being a mythical, destined hero that has to save Hyrule from Ganon and/or Ganondorf, but the games go back and forth on whether Zelda herself is a princess that needs rescuing, or a hero in her own right. It’s entirely plausible that the film looks to latch onto the story told through Breath of the Wild, Tears of the Kingdom and the two Hyrule Warriors spin-offs, it could retell the epic Ocarina of Time, or weave its own story around familiar themes. We’ll have to wait and see.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-studios-dead-take-release-date-cast</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-dead-take-gets-late-july-release-date-critical-role-stars-join-cast.1244964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Surgent Studios and publisher Pocketpair have revealed the release date for upcoming psychological horror game&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, and some pretty big names have joined the cast list as well.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the game, which was first revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgent-pocketpair-dead-take" rel="nofollow">back in early June</a>, will be launching on PC via Steam and Epic on July 31st, which is just a couple of weeks away at time of writing. There's no word on console versions yet, however.</p>

<p>As well as the release date, Surgent also revealed some new members of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast, and a couple of them will be familiar if you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>actual-play series&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=EkbKtvjf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-take-release-date-cast-reveal-matt-mercer.jpg?itok=uxSuBbn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast members will be familiar to you if you've seen&nbsp;<em>Critical Role</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The first two big names to join&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s list are Jane Perry and Alanah Pearce. You may recognize the former from her roles as&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>'s Diana Burnwood,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s Rogue, or&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s Mystra, but she's done plenty of other work as well.</p>

<p>Pearce's name may be familiar if you've played&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>as well; she voiced a character bearing her likeness in that game. She's also written for Sony Santa Monica Studio and created content for the likes of Rooster Teeth.</p>

<p>Also joining&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s cast in cameo roles are&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>mainstays Matt Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Travis Willingham. Surgent head Abubakar Salim has appeared on&nbsp;<em>Critical Role&nbsp;</em>before, so it's perhaps not a surprise to see these names appearing in&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>'s credits.</p>

<p>The names mentioned above will join main&nbsp;<em>Dead Take&nbsp;</em>stars <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-take-neil-newbon-ben-starr" rel="nofollow">Neil Newbon and Ben Starr</a>, who will play the game's main character Chase Lowry and missing actor Vinny Monroe, respectively.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Take</em>, it's a narrative-focused psychological horror game in which you'll explore a Hollywood Hills mansion in order to piece together what happened after a typically decadent, star-studded party.</p>

<p>The game will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-developer-to-publish-horror-game-by-tales-of-kenzera-zau-devs" rel="nofollow">serve as the debut title</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair's publishing wing, and it'll launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the Epic Games Store on July 31st. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA["At Least Three" Caves of Qud Expansions Planned, Developers Say]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/caves-of-qud-expansions-three-planned</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/at-least-three-caves-of-qud-expansions-planned-developers-say.1244961/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Freehold Games and publisher Kitfox Games have announced that "at least three"&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>expansions are planned "over the next few years", and that major updates will accompany each expansion as it arrives.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/805697599227036255" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Freehold says that the "success" of the game's 1.0 release, which came in December last year, has allowed it to consider "adding new layers of game to the already 17-year layer cake".</p>

<p>The developer says it will be focusing its efforts on "a few big expansion packs" that will come out over the next few years, with the first one due sometime next year. Not only that, but "a big update" will arrive alongside each expansion, and that update will be free for all players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=-6rQh4ss 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/caves-of-qud-expansions-base-game.jpg?itok=PDNv0hEB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is getting expansions over the next few years.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to what will be included in free updates and what will be added to DLC, Freehold says it will make that decision "based on what makes sense"; if a feature is "core to the game", it will be part of an update, but if it's "part of a new set of non-vanilla features", you'll probably find it in an expansion.</p>

<p>Pricing is still to be determined, but Freehold says the DLC packs will almost certainly cost more than&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3252660/Caves_of_Qud__Pets_of_Harvest_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pets of Harvest Dawn&nbsp;</em>pet pack</a>, which you can currently get for $4.99. That's because they "take a lot of development time and energy to make", the developer says.</p>

<p>When it comes to pet packs, Freehold says it's planning to add more pets to&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, but that the plan is now to simply add more pets to the aforementioned pack rather than to continuously create new pet packs. The price "may" increase as a result, but that hasn't been decided yet, according to Freehold.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud</em>, it's described by its developers as a "science fantasy roguelike epic steeped in retrofuturism, deep simulation, and swathes of sentient plants".</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dwarf-fortress" rel="nofollow">Dwarf Fortress</a>&nbsp;</em>before it,&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>is built around simulated systems; relationships and situations are generated prior to each playthrough, and the world of the game can progress in different ways depending on that initial generation.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Caves of Qud&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I hesitate to call <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a> "the best organ trading sim of 2021", because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cruelty-squad">Cruelty Squad</a> also came out in 2021 and I worry about starting a localised flame war. But it means Strange Scaffold's sci-fi stockbroker sim was, at the very least, 2021's <em>second</em> best organ trading sim. Nice to see it's getting a sequel then, called... oh no. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-baby-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</a>.</p>
<p>"We aren't monsters. You aren't going to be trading babies," says head of studio, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You're going to be trading stocks based on babies, which means you can short a baby." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game was announced as part of an online showcase held by Strange Scaffold. They also showed off upcoming co-op cook 'em up, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> which looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo">staffed by drunk medieval monks</a>. A third game, Truck-kun Is Supporting Me From Another World, was also announced, although it's only about a week into development, says Nelson. It is "a chaotic anime-inspired vehicular action game about driving into objects at high speed to rescue the corporate ladder climber you accidentally isekai'd into a dangerous medieval fantasy world." Of course.</p>
<p>As for the spleen brokering sequel, there wasn't much to see yet (it's also still early in developement, says Nelson). But we're told it will be a continuation of the grimy space tycoon's desperate search for high profit margins in the realm of interstellar commodities. In a galaxy where shareswappers can literally tell the future to a high degree of accuracy, speculating has become harder and harder. The last refuge of the Wall Street scoundrel lies in extraterrestrial baby trading.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>There is no confirmation yet that Chad Shakespeare will return.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"In the future, technology has been established that lets people observe macro trends, see whether a war will break out as a result of current conflicts and so on and so forth. This makes a lot of speculative markets flatline because speculative markets are basically just gambling. And the last thing that remains for an up-and-coming investment broker to get into for true speculative trading action... uh... is babies. </p>
<p>"You will be buying alien baby stocks, selling them, shorting them, and in general trying to make as large of a profit as possible," he goes on, calling the sim "the next major effort in us exploring this series around what happens when you apply capitalism to space." </p>
<p>Strange Scaffold has released seven games in the last two years, Nelson reminded press at the start of the showcase, which is, yes, quite a high rate of fire. Although it's maybe only achievable thanks to the studio's rotating squad of part-timers, each of whom brings their own interests and quirks to the table.</p>
<p>"The studio has been part-time people since its founding because it added different dynamics to who we could hire and how we could hire them," said Nelson. "So I will say that the studio is and has been a part-time location for folks, but there has also been a deep tension that's been introduced by the fact that a lot of folks are increasingly not having day jobs to return to. And we're trying to support people as best as we can through it while not having resources to bring anyone on full-time or take up that load that the wider industry should have."</p>
<p>Both Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator and Truck-kun will be coming out "within the next year". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-short-a-baby-in-the-sequel-to-space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Put down that cursed bag of frozen curly fries and come here. I've spotted a game you might like. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a> is essentially the four-player hangout horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/repo">R.E.P.O</a> but instead of ghost hunting you are collecting ingredients to feed a big monster its favourite dish. </p>
<p>"This isn't a place of honour," says studio head of Strange Scaffold, Xalavier Nelson Jr. "You aren't going to be making fancy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>-style dishes. You will be beating a giant rat or a minotaur with a rolling pin, taking an object from their corpse, throwing it onto a grill on a beach, and then firing it into a kaiju's jaws with a catapult or a manganel." Checks out.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Strange Scaffold are the studio who made adrenal shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> and freaky hotel horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clickolding">Clickolding</a> (among many others). They were showing off the ravenous kaiju as part of a showcase that would kick off the "Summer of Strange". Which is sort of like when Nintendo announced the "Year of Luigi". Everyone laughed back then, but what followed was many consecutive years of Luigi. These are the dark methods of manifesting reality through marketing. </p>
<p>Anyhow, the studio showed off the game with a short playthrough. You play as a cohort of monks who have to cook a meal for a Kaiju while exploring a dungeon for the best ingredients. There are rats who can steal cloves of garlic and tools out of your hands. You can cook a fruit pie using the same flaming torch you use to light your way. At one point in the demo we watched Nelson discover a "spice fall", a kind of interdimensional portal raining spices from the ceiling. It'll season anything in your inventory if you stand beneath it, flavours sure to delight (or infuriate) the kaiju. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Does he look edible to you? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Strange Scaffold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> and the like, there's a lot of panicked running around and comical miscommunication. People bleed, flammable puddles are set alight, traps threaten to sever the body parts of the players. If a player dies, their heart pops out. When a team mate brings that heart back to the surface, they can be revived. </p>
<p>Eventually, Nelson gathers a loaf of bread, toasts it, and the gang finally catapult it at the giant monster. Nelson also gets in the medieval catapult (or mangonel) and dies in the sea. "We've tried to find the right terminology for the type of catapult thing we've got and we've learned that that's just a failing endeavor even with a historian on board." This would also be why the game's list of features makes certain notes about food availability. "No tomatoes," it reads, "since they were only introduced to Europe in the 16th century."</p>
<p>As with a lot of co-op streamer bait, there's proximity voice chat baked into the game, and you're not meant to hear everyone all the time. But without radios the studio needed another way for players to talk as they roam from cobwebbed pantry to cobwebbed pantry. So there are "speaking tubes" you have to talk into to chat over distances. A tinny reverb adds a ghostly feeling to the sound of voices flowing through them.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>You get a list of all the monster's favourite foods and dislikes. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Strange Scaffold</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's all openly reminiscent of the ever-popular and streamer-friendly co-op horror games already mentioned. Last week some bozo in the bowels of the internet derisively called this subgenre of games "friendslop" - a judgy yet admittedly catchy phrase that sneers at the relatively low development costs and roughhewn nature of such games. Developers and fans on social media subsequently had a shit-fit defending this type of game, as if the term itself threatened the millions of sales <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> has already achieved. By contrast, Nelson doesn't really care about the drama around the word, and is more buoyed by the idea that a genre has simply been born.</p>
<p>"I think it is an interesting way of talking about this set of highly consumable, highly digestible, low-cost, low-commitment multiplayer experiences. I'm not offended by it. I'm not particularly excited by it either. I just think that it's interesting that this is enough of a subcategorization of things that players and press and content creators have found a word for it."</p>
<p>I'm not sure we'll see "friendslop" become neutral in the same way that "walking simulator" has become. (It too began as a jeering insult, about games deemed to lack enough action and player verbs, yet is now basically divorced from that negativity.) Whether "friendslop" sticks around or dissolves into obscurity, it's reassuring to see that at least one developer isn't fazed by the name-calling. </p>
<p>"I hope to make a game, as with all of our games, that is more than the cheap joke," says Nelson, "but also very silly and a little janky and lives up to being just another cool thing we made."</p>
<p>Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking is out July 29th and Strange Scaffold promise "a minimum of two months of post-launch support, expanding and updating the game". </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-co-op-horror-is-like-if-the-chefs-of-overcooked-got-together-for-a-night-of-repo]]></content:encoded>

<p>I'm always in two minds about this stuff. Obviously, if you think something's valuable, just pay people to do it. Mods can add years to a game's lifespan and while there's no way to guarantee a modder with that sort of talent is going to grace your game over others, offering a big wad seems like a surefire way to increase the odds. I am by no means saying this is what 11 Bit are doing here, but I will say that disguising requests for free labour as fun opportunities with fabulous prizes <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/beyond-good-and-evil-2/hit-record">does have a precedent</a> in games. I think it's fair to say that the vast majority of entrants are going to make the game's modding scene a lot more vibrant suddenly and not win anything.</p>
<p>Still, modders getting rewarded is always great, the prize pool is likely funded at least in part by <a href="http://mod.io/">mod.io</a> themselves, and if you're someone who's just beavering away making free mods anyway, then why not.</p>
<p>There are separate categories to enter, with prizes for the best mods in politics, the city, frostlands, and graphics. Here's 11 Bit from a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498325386812199405?l=english">blog post</a> on the competition:</p>
<blockquote><p>"What is the jury looking for? Creativity, playability, and most importantly, fun! After all, you are the strategy genre experts, and we would like to see what you will come up with to make the Frostpunk 2 experience even more interesting. New stories and mechanics? Insane mode? Replace snow with sand? Add dinosaurs? Introduce a swamp with ogres? The Steward would rejoice!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ogres, you say? To enter, you'll need upload your work to  mod.io, with a #fp2modcontest tag. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2248517364">Big Butt Skinner Balloon</a>, please. Do it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/put-big-butt-skinner-in-frostpunk-2-win-10000-maybe]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194/slides/16&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194/slides/16">April’s big Switch 2 Direct</a></span>, where the console was revealed in all its glory for the very first time, Nintendo showed off an in-house game that supported the new console’s Joy-Con-as-mice feature. <em>Drag x Drive</em>, a wheelchair basketball game, was a complete surprise, and things have been pretty quiet since. But it’s now been announced that this August, subscribers to Nintendo Switch Online will get access to a limited-time demo.</p><p>I remember  feeling pretty emotional during the livestream that Nintendo had chosen to use a disability-forward concept to highlight one of the Switch 2's very few new features. Then, at the same time, concerned that this game might not be more than a gimmick, an in-house experiment to see if the company could sell the Joy-Con 2's mouse-like abilities to itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Wheelchair basketball makes so much sense as a gaming concept, given how much easier it is to offer tangible controls for wheels rather than feet. Even putting aside the mouse controls, <em>Drag x Drive</em> looked like something akin to <em>Rocket League</em>, with those tech-future vibes in a <em>Battle Bots</em>-like arena, and that seemed really promising. It’s odd that it’s when factoring those controls back in that the concerns this might be a game to support a feature, rather than the other way around, kick in.</p><p>Come August 9 and 10, we’ll definitely have a much better idea of what’s on offer—well, if we have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription we will. The multiplayer game is going to have a “Global Jam demo event,” which will offer a “sneak peak” of what will be on offer. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-switch-2-wheelchair-basketball-game-will-soon-be-playable-in-a-limited-time-demo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span> reports that the demos will be available in sessions, running 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. ET on Saturday, while Sunday has two slots, 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. and 8 p.m. to midnight. That crazy early start on Saturday is likely to make things a little more amenable to UK players, where it falls from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.</p><p>The three-a-side competitive game plays as a simplified version of wheelchair basketball, with hoops thrown by a Joy Con gesture, although pretty much nothing else is known at this point about the specifics, game modes, tournaments, and so on. The full game is out August 14, so just a few days after the free demo event. It’s set to be priced at $20, and will only be available as a download from the Switch 2's eStore. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-drag-x-drive-basketball-free-demo-1851786377]]></content:encoded>

And while MGM has been very protective of Bond, there was only one specific request made by the studio during production of the game.</p><p>IO Interactive franchise director Jonathan Lacaille recently told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/how-much-hitman-dna-is-in-007-first-light-io-interactive-talks-james-bond/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a> that aside from a request, "Don't make him a killing machine,'" the studio has been very open to IO Interactive's new take on Bond.</p><p>"They've considered every idea we've had," recalled Lacaille. "There weren't many massive nos or anything like that. It was always more like, 'Yeah, but, we could do it this way, or…' So it's always been very collaborative, and a lot of good feedback, because they've been working with the franchise for so long as well, so it was great to have them so involved in the project, right? I'm sure it was a fun ride for them as well.'</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has previously hinted that 007 First Light may incorporate a live-service element from the Hitman games by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-may-have-hitman-like-live-service-missions/1100-6532678/" data-ref-id="1100-6532678">dropping new missions for Bond</a> during the game's post-launch period.</p><p>Hitman: World of Assassination recently had an example of what that may look like when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-villain-coming-to-hitman-today-as-elusive-target/1100-6532213/" data-ref-id="1100-6532213">Mads Mikkelsen reprised his role as LeChiffre</a> from the first Daniel Craig James Bond movie, Casino Royale. In that Elusive Target mission, Hitman's Agent 47 gets to decide how he wants to eliminate LeChiffre while still managing to escape with his life.</p><p>007 First Light isn't connected to any previous take on Bond and it features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/007-first-light-trailer-reveals-the-first-ever-james-bond-origin-story/1100-6532111/" data-ref-id="1100-6532111">the title character during his origin adventure</a>. IO Interactive will release 007 First Light on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC in 2026.</p>

                <p>The Analogue 3D has been delayed once again, and it will now be shipping out in late August. Analogue says that recent tariff changes in the US are to blame, but the company is prepared to cover these extra costs and will not pass them on to consumers who preordered the $250 retro-game console.</p><p>"Following last week’s sudden tariff changes, Analogue 3D will now begin shipping next month. We're absorbing the costs--your preorder price stays the same. No additional charges," <a href="https://www.analogue.co/announcements/analogue-3d-shipping-next-month" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Analogue said</a> in a statement on its website.</p><p>Several East-Asian countries are facing steep tariffs following US President Donald Trump's announcement on July 7. These range from 25% to 40%, with these import taxes being charged on goods as they enter the US and paid for by American consumers and businesses.</p><p>The Analogue 3D was announced last year, and preorders for it sold out extremely quickly. Analogue originally aimed for a Q1 2025 release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analogues-4k-nintendo-64-delayed-to-july-8bitdo-64-controllers-still-available/1100-6527188/" data-ref-id="1100-6527188">but it was later delayed to July</a>. The console is an FPGA device designed to provide an authentic N64 gameplay experience, but with the added benefit of a 4K resolution on modern displays. What also makes it appealing for retro-game enthusiasts is that it supports all of the original N64 accessories, but you can use modern peripherals like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller</a> on it.</p><p>You can also cycle through various display modes made to reproduce the look of an old-school television set on the Analogue 3D, with faithfully reproduced scanlines and shadow mask effects that can recreate the CRT TV experience. Analogue said that it spent over four years developing a perfect way to experience N64 in FPGA for absolute accuracy, and ideally, this should be a massive step up when compared to an N64 emulator.</p>

                <p>HBO's The Last of Us recently lost Neil Druckmann as a director and co-showrunner, but a top boss at the company is not worried about his departure from the popular series. HBO content chairman Casey Bloys commented on Druckmann's departure and revealed a 2027 window for Season 3 in a new interview.</p><p>He told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/hbo-casey-bloys-the-penguin-season-2-the-last-of-us-future-1236461127/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that it was "great to have Neil involved in the beginning." Druckmann helped provide a "blueprint" for where the TV series is headed. That, combined with how the show's other top boss, Craig Mazin, is staying on, helps Bloys have faith the show will be fine.</p><p>"So I think we'll be in excellent shape. I'm not worried at all," he said.</p><p>Bloys also said it's important to remember that Druckmann was working on The Last of Us TV show at the same time as managing his full-time responsibilities at Naughty Dog.</p><p>"It's a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that," Bloys said.</p><p>Druckmann <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">announced his departure from the TV series earlier this month</a>, saying he was stepping back to focus on writing and directing Naughty Dog's new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann is Studio Head and Head of Creative at Naughty Dog and is spending more time focused on those roles now that he's left the TV series.</p><h2>Season 3 is "Definitely planned for 2027"</h2><p>Also in the interview, Bloys revealed that The Last of Us Season 3 is "definitely planned for 2027." He also clarified that Mazin is still working out how to end The Last of Us.</p><p>"Craig is still working it out whether it will be two more seasons or one more long season. It hasn't been decided yet, and I'm following Craig's lead on that," Bloys said.</p><p>Previously, Mazin had said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/last-of-us-boss-says-a-fourth-season-is-essential/1100-6531653/" data-ref-id="1100-6531653">a fourth season would be essential to closing things out properly.</a> "There's no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we'll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth," Mazin said.</p><p>Finally, Bloys addressed the fact that Pedro Pascal's character, Joel, has been killed off, and that the next episodes are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-3-is-all-about-abby/1100-6531704/" data-ref-id="1100-6531704">expected to focus on Kaitlyn Dever's Abby</a> as opposed to Bella Ramsey's Ellie. Does that present a challenge in marketing and promoting the series? Bloys doesn't think so.</p><p>"I think the title is obviously helped by the video game, and now the first two seasons is pretty well established. I kind of appreciate shows that take things and do a show from a different point of view," he said.</p><p>The Last of Us <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-reacts-to-the-last-of-us-picking-up-16-emmy-nominations/1100-6533179/" data-ref-id="1100-6533179">picked up 16 Emmy nominations this week</a>, including a nod for Best Drama. The first season received 24 nominations, bringing the show's total to 40 across its first two seasons.</p>

            <p>Cast your minds back to a few months ago, and you might recall the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">Minecraft memes of Chicken Jokey and Lava Chicken</a>. Yes, we were all a-flutter for the cuboid world's poultry thanks to the release of A Minecraft Movie.</p>
<p>The Jack Black and Jason Momoa-fronted film became a resounding success on its debut in April, generating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-opens-with-biggest-us-domestic-opening-weekend-ever-for-a-video-game-adaptation">$301m USD worldwide on its first weekend</a>.</p>
<p>And, as he did with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-blacks-super-mario-bros-movie-song-rising-up-us-charts">Peaches for The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a> last year, Black once again lent his vocal stylings for a catchy ditty in A Minecraft Movie known as Lava Chicken. It's a song about what happens when you add lava to a chicken in Minecraft (it cooks). Soon after the film's release, Lava Chicken entered the UK's official music chart, becoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">the shortest ever entry in the official UK Top 40</a>.</p>

<p>But, what has all this got to do with Minecraft now, Victoria? Well, basically, there 's no escape, and developer Mojang recently announced an update for Minecraft (the game), which adds Lava Chicken as a music disc. As spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/minecraft/minecraft-1-21-94-update-finally-adds-lava-chicken-song-3226469/">Dexerto</a>, thanks to Minecraft's <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/37810171798029-Minecraft-1-21-93-94-Bedrock">1.21.94 update</a>, players can get access to a remixed version of the song Black sings in the film. This version is by Hyper Potions. And, how do you get it? Of course by defeating a baby zombie riding a chicken... Yes, that's a ruddy chicken jockey.</p>
<p>A Minecraft Movie's Chicken Jockey trend (which saw some viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral and launching their popcorn into the air during a scene where Black's character Steve shouts "chicken jockey" as Jason Momoa confronts a baby zombie riding a chicken) was disruptive to say the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-now-shows-warning-following-disruptive-chicken-jockey-trend">Cinemas and Black himself asked viewers to refrain from such behaviour</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-is-leaning-into-the-memes-with-sing-along-screenings">introducing sing-along 'Block Party Edition' screenings in a bid to calm things down a notch</a>. Not that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess was too fussed</a> by the chaos caused. In fact, the filmmaker said he found the chaotic scenes "way too funny" and had been "laughing [his] brains out" with each new video sent his way.</p>

<p>"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-sequel-discussions-are-already-happening">sequel to A Minecraft Movie is already in discussion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/good-news-minecraft-is-getting-the-lava-chicken-song-bad-news-minecraft-is-getting-the-lava-chicken-song]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced who's going to be playing the two main roles of Link and Zelda in the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>&nbsp;movie, which is currently set for release in 2027.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1945433161124688335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media post</a> by none other than Nintendo legend Shigeru Miyamoto, the role of Link will be played by actor Benjamin Evan-Ainsworth, whose previous roles include Miles in Netflix's <i>The Haunting of Bly Manor&nbsp;</i>and Pinnochio in the live-action Disney remake of the same name.</p>

<p>He'll be acting opposite Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda. You might recognize Bragason's name from shows like&nbsp;<em>The Jetty&nbsp;</em>or the Disney+ show&nbsp;<em>Renegade Nell</em>, and she also served as the model for the young Lunafreya in the animated movie&nbsp;<em>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV</em>.</p>

<p>The movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-announces-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-distributed-and-co-financed-by" rel="nofollow">announced back in late 2023</a>, will be co-produced by Miyamoto and Avi Arad, whose previous producer credits include the critically-acclaimed&nbsp;<em>Spider-Verse&nbsp;</em>animated films, as well as many other blockbusters.</p>

<p>Directing duties will be handled by&nbsp;<em>The Maze Runner&nbsp;</em>head Wes Ball. We don't yet know who's going to be writing the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie, nor do we know whether it will adapt a specific game or tell a story of its own.</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>is, however, just one of several video game franchises getting its own movie in the coming months and years. Others include ghost-hunting phenomenon&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-movie-blumhouse" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, smash hit open-world action RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, and co-op platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>, among others.</p>

Movie</em>, which <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/84343-highest-grossing-live-action-videogame-to-film-transfer-single-film" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">currently stands</a> as the highest-grossing video game movie adaptation of all time.</p>

<p>Whether it manages to achieve that feat or not remains to be seen, but in any case, the movie is set to be released in theaters around the world on May 7th, 2027. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza-turns-destruction-into-joy.1244886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>My first thought upon starting up <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> was, “Why yes, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/are-you-tired-of-being-nice">I actually <em>would</em> like to go ape shit</a>.” The game starts by having Donkey Kong smash through a wall to reveal a glittering gem waiting to be liberated from the rock. But instead of punching the bright yellow gem into bite-size pieces, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642699/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-preview-switch-2">I kept punching through the walls and floors, digging tunnels into the landscape</a>.</p></div><p>With the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 finally out in consumers’ hands</a> for more than a month now and the luster of the console’s newness fading, we’re left asking, “What’s this thing actually capable of?” The first big exclusive, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, was a nice aperitif, giving players a bit of the new — processing power and graphics — firmly enmeshed in the old familiarity of <em>Mario Kart</em>.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, now the console’s second major exclusive, represents the Switch 2’s first real course, and it’s a fantastic feast.</p><p>In <em>Bananza</em>, Donkey Kong has given up the lush comfort of his island to become a working monkey (or ape, as it were). He’s added a pair of overalls and a hard hat to his look and has ventured to Ingot Isle to dig up banadium gems — precious stones in the shape of banana bunches — with religious zeal. However, a gang of ruthless capitalists comes along and steals all the banana gems, forcing DK and his new friend Pauline to venture to the planet’s core to stop them.</p><p>There’s one rule to keep in mind playing <em>Bananza</em>: ABP. Always Be Punching. There’s an enemy ahead? Punch it. An obstacle? Punch through it. A friendly rock offering you some health-restoring apple juice? Ah, what the hell, punch him too. The punch action is extremely satisfying, enhanced by all the sounds of the different materials. Sand has a powdery quality to its sound as it crunches under DK’s feet. So does gravel, but the sound it makes is perceptibly different in the same way real sand is different from real gravel.</p><p>The variety of punchable materials definitely makes the case for<em> Bananza</em> being a Switch 2 game. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Bananza</em>’s developers told me that</a> this was originally meant to be an original Switch title before the prospect of the Switch 2’s enhanced graphical and processing power changed the calculus of development. I can see what all that extra power was for when I spot detail in the environment at a distance. When DK punches through snow, snowflakes sprinkle around. Speaking of sprinkles, I love that the frozen layer is actually a huge dessert factory and that what I thought was mud was actually textured chocolate sprinkles. I hate that DK can eat apples for health but not the chocolate dirt.</p><p>It’s not perfect. There are rare moments when there’s a lot of graphical noise that the game chugs a bit. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-will-have-some-framerate-drops-director-admits-but-hes-fine-with-that-we-prioritized-fun-and-playability/">Nintendo says it is aware of the issue</a>, though I only encountered slowdown once and during the exceedingly badass end boss fight.</p><p>With <em>Bananza</em>, I could tell that the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> duology still has a chokehold over Nintendo’s designers. Not only does <em>Bananza</em> present <em>BOTW</em>-style openness emphasizing exploration, but every level starts with a slow, cinematic reveal as DK free-falls from the sky. Despite the fact that there are 17 distinct levels, dropping in from the air <em>BOTW</em>-style never got old. Each level was crafted with a creativity that was fun to peel apart — in some cases literally.</p><p>One of the later levels, deep within the mantle, was a beach resort strewn with colossal fruits that were fun to tunnel through. The fleshy fruits weren’t exactly rendered true to life, but I still had a moment of discomfort imagining DK and Pauline getting all sticky tunneling through a giant strawberry. I could also see the DNA of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> in the general cadence of gameplay. There are bananas (like moons) to uncover either in the world itself or contained within special challenges.</p><p>The damage DK does to the environment persists, permanently altering the landscape, and I can see those changes reflected in the game’s map for all time. (Unless I want to revert everything back to the way it was, which is a menu option.) There’s also a vastness that’s made approachable by exploration. More often than not, if I see a distant area on the map or from a high-up vantage point, I can go there, and, even better, there’s probably something hidden for me to find. The prospect of discovery through destruction, more than finishing the story, was what propelled me forward.</p><p>Not that the story itself <em>isn’t</em> fun. Nintendo has inadvertently made a game for the current political moment. A gross and scrungly (my words) president (game’s words) who has more bananas than he could ever need has decided to steal even more while destroying the world with the byproducts of his manufacturing company. He can do almost nothing by himself, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/09/politics/fema-texas-flood-noem">relying on the intelligence of a pretty but evil woman</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618233/dan-bongino-fbi-deputy-director-conservative-podcaster">the enforcement of a big, mean muscle dude</a>. Coincidence? Definitely. But it’s still fun to punch them and imagine you’re working out your feelings.</p><p>Then there’s DK himself: a big, simple guy who has decided to use his massive power to stop the bad guys while helping a cute little girl find her confidence. I love Pauline as a sidekick, and I typically hate mouthy audience surrogates. Pauline hangs off DK’s back but rarely chirps about where to go next. In fact, she’s quiet for most of the game, only talking at length whenever the pair checks into a hideaway for a rest. Then, as you drift off to health-restoring sleep, she’ll remark on your adventures or share her own thoughts. It’s a cute, natural way to see her character develop while not being an intrusive Navi type.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> also does a thing I love where its narrative is reinforced in the game’s mechanics. Pauline is a girl who loves to sing but is afraid of performing in front of big crowds. She works that out over the course of the game because it’s her voice that powers up DK’s transformations, known as Bananzas. There’s a zebra form that lets him run fast over disintegrating blocks, an ostrich that lets him fly, and more. (The game very cleverly shuts down the “but ostriches can’t fly” pedants by essentially saying, “Yes, we know. It’s a video game, don’t think too hard.”) With every new Bananza performance, DK gets more powerful and Pauline gets more confident.</p><p><em>Bananza</em> is a dad game the same way <em>The Last of Us</em> is a dad game. Same world-trekking adventure with a big strong dude protecting a powerful little girl. But where <em>TLOU</em> makes you have big sad feelings about all the people the game forces you to kill, <em>Bananza</em> presents you with a slight alternative — what if you could use your powers to fuck shit up and <em>not</em> be a dick about it? DK smiles often. People are happy to see him. That friendly rock I mentioned earlier? When you punch him or any NPC, it turns into a high five. All that destruction is welcome because it’s helping restore the world.</p><p><sub>Donkey Kong Bananza<em> launches on July 17th on the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></sub></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We clearly don't get enough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/yakuza">Like a Dragon/Yakuza</a> series spin-offs. Forget about the fact RGG unleashed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/review-like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review">Goro Majima pirate adventure</a> a matter of months ago, I need Tojo Clan tales 24/7 and 365 days a year. Enter Roblox, which is very much the terrifying user-generated everything platform's terrifying user-generated everything platform.</p>
<p>The company that oversees it, Roblox Corp, have just announced a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/roblox-launches-new-licensing-platform-for-experiences">new "Roblox License Manager"</a> that'll allow fellow corps to let Roblox players submit to build games based on stuff like Squid Game, Saw, and Twilight, then split the Robux revenue these games generate between the two parties. Sega have signed up and are offering the Like A Dragon series, but not to just anybody.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Getting down to brass tacks, in order to build what would be an officially licenced but fan-created Like A Dragon Roblox game, with the permission to use characters like Kazuma Kiryu and locations like Kamurocho that entails, there are a few hoops you'd have to jump through.
</p>
<p>Rather than just making it open season and giving their blessing to what'd essentially be a Roblox mod-verse of Kiryu and co getting up to all sorts of hijinks that might make corporate lawyers flip their lids, Sega appear to be looking to let a select number of established Roblox creators add more official Like A Dragon bits to the platform. I assume as accoutrements to the <a href="https://geek-out.io/en/topics/like-a-dragon-announcement-en/">official Like A Dragon Roblox experience</a> that's already been in development for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Sega say they'll only lend the licence to creators who've already made an unofficial Like a Dragon Roblox game that's attracted over 1,000 daily active users, and are pretty insistent that any of these games stick to the series' established canon. The publishers say (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sega-netflix-and-others-will-let-roblox-creators-monetize-their-major-franchises">Game Developer</a>) these fan-created Like A Dragons should "primarily reference the story, characters, and settings as depicted in the official Like A Dragon mainline video game series. This includes plotlines, character arcs, and locations established within these titles."</p>
<p>"While we encourage creative expression, please make sure your works stay true to the world and lore as portrayed in these canonical entries," they added, just to be crystal clear that you can't go too off the beaten path with this series that recently let a present-day Japanese gangster fight frigates with laser cannons and play instruments to summon spectral sharks in a proper spin-off game.</p>
<p>Sega are offering creators who meet those criteria a 50/50 revenue split on the Robux their Like A Dragon game generates, after platform fees are taken into account. It's worth noting that Netflix is only offering game-makers a 15% revenue share on the likes of Squid Game via this licencing initiative, though they also aren't gating access behind a daily user number requirement.</p>
<p>All of this comes within the context of Roblox's notoriously problematic ecosystem, with the company behind it having regularly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-studio-head-you-can-say-okay-we-are-exploiting-child-labour">faced accusations</a> of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/09/the-trouble-with-roblox-the-video-game-empire-built-on-child-labour">exploiting creators</a> who're often just kids or teenagers, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXlauRB1EQ">giving them a raw deal</a> when it comes to the money they make from their games.</p>
<p>All of that makes for sobering reading, and while Roblox has made some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roblox-is-limiting-access-to-social-hangouts-and-unrated-games-for-children-aged-under-13">positive changes</a> over the years, it's hard not to feel icky about big corporations seemingly looking to earn cash from games that may well be made by young people on terms thoroughly dictated by the former.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/officially-licenced-like-a-dragon-spin-offs-made-by-roblox-creators-may-be-coming-and-will-have-to-stick-to-the-karaoke-lad-lore]]></content:encoded>

Now, CD Projekt Red is bringing the game to Mac almost five years after it was released on PC and consoles.</p><p>Starting on July 17, Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition will be available on Macs with Apple silicon via the Mac App Store, Steam, Epic Games Store, and GOG.com. According to Apple, this port will take advantage of "the advanced technologies of Metal" for a "smooth performance," as well as "sharp visuals, amazing battery life, and seamless gameplay."</p><p>The game will also have support for spatial audio and head-tracked spatial audio on Mac, which can be utilized with AirPods. Cyberpunk 2077 can be run on Apple silicon Mac configurations with 16GB or more of unified memory.

			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> is a smashing good time. With Pauline clutching onto the fur on his back as the pair race to the centre of the world, you’ll be rampaging across the landscape of each level, slapping rock-encased enemies around, and dig-punching yourself in a gluttonous frenzy of screen-filling button mashing as you search for the moreish bananas that DK goes ga-ga for.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review –&nbsp;Oooh! Banana!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA7cS_bLuLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s been an awfully long time since the last Donkey Kong 3D platformer –&nbsp;he literally only had Rare’s Donkey Kong 64 collectathon to his name –&nbsp;and gaming tech has moved on such that this is a completely different feeling game. Having experimented lightly with voxel deformation in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/super-mario-odyssey-review/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, Nintendo EPD Tokyo has now made this a core part of Donkey Kong Bananza, changing everything from how the world appears visually, to how DK can get around, and how you can transform the levels just by smashing stuff.</p>


<p>It’s utterly rambunctious stuff, letting you punch and smash through the world and enemies alike. You’ll feel a bit naughty as you do so. Should I really just be cutting a straight line to the banana-shaped sonar pulse? Isn’t there a hardworking level designer in Japan who’s shedding a tear because I’m ignoring the carefully designed, visually signposted path through to the next story beat? Am I not “breaking” the game by clipping the camera through the world and then filling the screen with shards of rock, gold, and glass as I hammer the punch and jump buttons?</p>


<p>In truth, this must be exactly what Nintendo intends. Arguably, just as with the chaotic messiness of Mario Kart World’s larger world and races, there’s some key areas here where Nintendo is giving in and accepting that this is just going to be a messier style of platformer. They’ve designed around that, ramping up the dopamine hits with more regular collectable Banandium Gems to find, more upgrades and costumes to unlock, more opportunities to branch off for another punch-filled frenzy, another challenge level, before returning to the main path and getting distracted again two seconds later. As intentional as this is, you can easily get lost in the underground button-mashing, the camera flipping back and forth between obscuring the world outside with a foggy haze and revealing it with a no clip-like view, and the tunnelling becoming overwhelming until you stop, take a breath and try to figure out how to get back outside.</p>
<p>As indulgent as the digging and deformation can be, DK still plays with all the natural, effortless control that you’d expect from a Nintendo platformer, it’s just that instead of that coming in the form of triple jumps, hat twirls and dives, DK’s movement is more about lumbering in a chosen direction, no matter what’s in the way. He can just clamber up vertical surfaces with ease, getting up and over in fast and fluid fashion, even if he’s holding a big chunk of rock in his hands, unless there’s spiked vines, lava or something slippery that he can’t grip onto. Add to that forward tumbles, unlockable skills like double jumping off a rock, and there’s a good deal of core 3D platforming to master.</p>

<p>And then there’s the Bananza transformations. Learned from the towering Elders that lead each underground animal tribe, Bananza transformations give DK big and bold new abilities. It starts with Kong Bananza, who’s basically just a bigger and smashier version of DK, but you quickly get Zebra Bananza for speedy running across soft surfaces other forms fall through, Ostrich Bananza who can glide and drop egg bombs, and goes on from there. Kong Bananza is the go-to form for much of the game, almost universally appropriate in combat, for souped up digging and when you need to get a bit meaner. The other forms are often better suited to areas and challenges designed specifically for them, and I rarely used them outside of that. Yes, the Zebra’s faster, but since I’ll need to recharge the Bananza meter once I’ve used this form for a bit, I might as well just rock surf or take a few extra moments to get where I’m going.</p>
<p>And where we’re going is deep down to the planet’s core in a race against the Void Crew. A trio of devious Kongs, they crash DK’s own mining operation down to a sublevel of the world, inadvertently pairing him up with what turns out to be a younger version of Pauline, whose powerful singing is what transforms DK each time. She’s the only English-speaking character in the tale, though her Bananza songs are gibberish and sound like a cross between Splatoon and Patapon’s Fever song. She’s a great addition, though, and there’s great camaraderie between her and DK. Sure, her motivations are still pretty basic, but she adds a lot of heart to the tale when DK’s head is just filled with dreams about bananas.</p>

<p>She’s also there to provide the co-op mode, handing her shouting and control over transformations to a second person, whether locally using pointing or mouse mode, a second switch with GameShare, or online via GameChat. We’ve only tried out the same-console co-op. Her shouting manifests itself as rocks, but can also absorb other materials, and this works really nicely to support the main player. It’s an experience that lands somewhere between the co-op modes of Super Mario Galaxy and Odyssey. Joy-Con 2 mouse controls also get a workout in the sculpting DK Artist mode available from the main menu, sculpting and painting.</p>
<p>As the pair journey on, heading to the planet’s core to have their dreams made true, they find that the Void Crew has cursed each level with some kind of plight, leaving impediments and enemies to get in your way. Combat brings us back to that almost mindless bludgeoning. Most enemies have got an outer shell made of one of the world materials, and this really highlights some of their interactions.</p>

<p>DK can easily clobber his way through soft sand to get to a golden enemy skeleton inside, but it will take a bit more hitting to get through stone –&nbsp;which means you need to watch for attack timing. But if it’s concrete, nasty spiky vines, or even lava, you need a different approach, ripping up chunks of harder materials out of the ground, throwing rocks or even explosive materials at them to bust through their armour. While that changes how you approach them, Donkey Kong Bananza does lean pretty heavily on these material variants of half a dozen basic enemy types. It does get a bit repetitive in that regard.</p>
<p>You also feel that with the boss battles. Some are just straight up punchathons that can last moments in a flurry of Kong Bananza’s fists, while others have a more traditional three-part structure, or are best tackled with a particular Bananza form. But you’ll face most of them two or three times as you work down the world’s levels, and I think that’s part of why a portion of the game’s final third felt a bit stretched out to me, in addition to the kind of obliged need to make more use of certain Bananza powers. That said, it builds up to a fantastically enjoyable finale.</p>

<p>On the whole, the game’s pacing and variety is great. For the more traditional stages, you start off at a round 100th level, reach a village or meet an Elder, and then branch off to tackle objectives that can take you one or two sublevels below, changing the tone, adding more challenge and variety as you go. But that’s not true of every layer, and there’s some great change of pace moments and environments that are wholly unexpected, beyond the variety of mini challenges that you find around each world. And did you say cameos? Yeah, there’s a few of those too.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-absolutely-smashing-but-can-it-beat-mario-odyssey.1244856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>Even though it confirmed my suspicions, the reveal that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> was coming to us from the team behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> couldn't help but strike a <em>little</em> bit of fear into my heart. We know that the group within Nintendo EPD is a talented bunch, but how was I ever going to be able to fully throw myself into another 3D adventure, with the all-timer 'Jump Up Superstar' sequence lurking at the back of my brain?</p>
<p>This was my overwhelming thought as I made my way through Bananza's opening layer. It was all fantastic, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd seen these slick moves and shiny object hunts before, albeit with a touch more punching this time around.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 1 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157290/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And then it happened. Rather than following the suggested approach, I ripped up a chunk of earth, solved a puzzle in a way that I never expected to work, and laughed as DK goofily ooh'ed and ahh'ed at the reward. On the surface, Donkey Kong Bananza has more than a little Odyssey in its DNA, and the comparisons are on display right from the jump; but once I dug beneath, I realised this is the devs swinging for something more chaotic, more destructive and — dare I say it — at times, more entertaining. Simply put, it's the most fun I've had with a platformer in years.</p>
<p>DK storylines generally go as deep as 'Big monkey loses big banana hoard', and Bananza doesn't stray a million miles from that format. While mining for Banandium Gems (Are they rocks? Are they fruit? I'm still not sure) on Ingot Isle, ol' DK has his collection ripped from him before being plunged underground by the Void Company, a mining operation bent on reaching the planet's core to have their deepest desire granted.</p>
<p>It doesn't make too much sense, but nor did a sentient cap with eyes, so stay with me here. Keen to catch up with the terrible trio and get his bananas back in the process, DK stumbles across Pauline — the artist formerly known as OddRock — who assumes the position of back companion and quickly learns that she can assist the titular tie-wearer through the magic of... song.</p>
<p>The pair dive through a series of underground worlds, or Layers, in pursuit of Void Co., collecting straggling Banandium Gems, helping out the locals, and picking up shape-shifting Bananza Transformations from huge underground Elders on the way, all in the hope of reaching the core first.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 2 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157283/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a simple, if somewhat ridiculous, set-up that only really comes into its own in the game's later stages, but it provides a strong enough backbone for the gameplay, and <em>that's</em> the important part.</p>
<p>Much like Odyssey's cap-throwing, Bananza has a big new mechanic to get to grips with in the shape of DK's fists. Equipped with nothing more than his primate palms, DK can punch, dig, and throw just about anything that he can see through the magic of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dk-bananza-devs-needed-to-know-more-about-donkey-kong-so-they-went-to-miyamoto">voxel tech experimentation</a> — which you might remember from the cheese digging in Odyssey's Luncheon Kingdom. Bananza wastes no time introducing you to this newfound strength, with the opening tunnels of Ingot Isle serving as little more than a demonstration of just how much you can smash. And boy, did I put it to good use.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 3 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157289/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To my own detriment, my first hours were spent doing just this. I <em>couldn't</em> bring myself to follow the mission marker because what if there was something under my feet? Nintendo's promise of everything being destructible holds true (mostly), and there's a certain dopamine hit to be had in levelling a cliff face just for the sake of it, but it quickly loses its impact if that's <em>all</em> you're doing.</p>
<p>And I think Nintendo knows this. I eased up on the 'Punch' button, put DK's smoking fists back in their holsters, and started to see Bananza differently. Because yes, everything <em>can</em> be broken, but that doesn't mean everything <em>should</em> be. Each layer is set up not to be destroyed, but to be explored, and I soon learned that while the odd Fossil or Treasure Chest may be waiting underground, the real attraction lies in the creativity on top.</p>
<p>When you put the digging to one side, DKB <em>is</em> all about the platforming. DK has a silky smooth moveset, consisting of three directional punches, a jump, a roll, and a hand slap. Oh, he can also climb just about any vertical surface in front of him. If that sounds pretty pared back, it is, but there's sweetness in that simplicity.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 4 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157280/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You can roll, jump, and roll again to clear more ground, rip up a chunk of earth and surf on it, then throw said chunk into the ground to double-jump all without pausing for thought. Bananza has a fast travel system, but I found it much more enjoyable to take the scenic route on foot.</p>
<p>That's not to say that digging and punching don't have their place — they are absolutely the headline mechanic — but if, like me, you feared Bananza would be nothing more than a smashathon, you can rest easy knowing that it's quite the opposite.</p>
<p>You see, each layer brings a new idea about <em>how</em> DK should use his surroundings. Whether it's surfing over slime in the mud-filled Hilltop Layer, growing paths in the Forest Layer, or pulling up chunks of floating Liftoff Ore in the Resort Layer, each level of DK's early descent demonstrates another way to get around, with none sticking about for long enough to become frustrating.</p>

<p>All of these introductions serve their purpose, too. The second act feels like Nintendo firing on all cylinders to up the inventiveness, and it uses your base understanding of the game's ruleset to showcase even wackier ideas. Part of the joy is finding out how these all work yourself, but rest assured that by the end, the uncanny Bananza Transformations will feel like old news compared to some of the originality on display.</p>
<p>Would you look at that, I made it 1,000 words in before touching on the abomination that is DK's Bananza forms! In truth, I never warmed to the sight of Donkey Kong melded with an ostrich or a zebra, but the devs needed to work in Mario's Power-Up prowess, and the time limit given to each transformation meant I didn't have to look them in the eye for long.</p>
<p>Kong Bananza is your Hulk-like big hitter and can crush just about any material with ease. Zebra Bananza is all about speed, and Ostrich Bananza can momentarily fly through the air when you inevitably see something shiny glimmering in the distance.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 6 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157282/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>At first, each form felt a little too overpowered, particularly in the early boss fights, which are proper blink-and-you'll-miss-'em affairs if you have the right power-up equipped. Fortunately, things calm down in the later game and into the post-credits content (of which there's <em>a lot</em>), where the transformations feel like more of an integral piece of the puzzle than an OTT superpower for a quick insta-win. Heck, the difficulty of some of the later challenges, particularly the boss fights, had me wishing for that earlier sense of ease.</p>
<p>What's more, they feel strangely at home in Bananza's world. Walking the same path as Odyssey, each layer down to the planet's core presents a different flavour of off-the-wall weirdness. There are ice cream-loving zebras who all talk like frat boys, googly-eyed 'Fractone' rocks that look like they've been swept off the Rare cutting room floor, underground eels that will spit you between layers like a slimy Tube train. And DK reacts to it all with such a wonderful range of expression. He'll shiver in cold areas, sweat in hot ones, and you'll want to pay particular attention to how his interactions with Pauline shift as their relationship changes. No, <em>you're</em> crying at an idle animation.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 7 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157286/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this means that each layer is a pleasure to explore, which is a relief, because they are packed, and I mean <em>packed</em>, with things to do. Odyssey's Power Moons are succeeded by Banandium Gems picked up in main story missions or by exploring the surroundings. Battle and Challenge Ruins crop up on every corner, too, shuffling a certain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> Shrine-esque pit stop into the proceedings, and occasionally calling out specific DK touchstones like Mine Cart Madness or Bramble Blast to brilliant effect.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, Bananza's score is wonderful — stay with me for this quick musical sidebar. The atmospheric environmental tunes are one thing, but Pauline's Bananza songs are some of the catchiest damn bops I've heard from a game for a long time, which is a relief, because you'll hear them every time you want to transform (you can turn it off in settings if that's not your jam, don't worry). I dare you to listen to Kong Bananza <em>without</em> throwing in a little shoulder shimmy whenever you hear the main riff. And yes, much like those aforementioned Challenge Courses, there are musical cameos aplenty, so make sure you've brushed up on your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">Country</a> music — and we don't mean Dolly Parton — before diving in.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 8 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157296/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, back to those bananas. The Gems serve their in-game purpose well enough — collect five to unlock a Skill Point, which can be used to level up DK's stats, Bananza Transformations, or grant some bonus abilities — but we all know they're <em>really</em> there to encourage exploration. Nintendo has crafted gorgeously detailed worlds, and it would feel like a waste if all I did with them was dig. Instead, the collectibles encouraged me to scour every corner and speak to every NPC, all while keeping things completely optional for those who'd prefer to storm ahead with the main quest. There's no 'Collect XX Bananas to power up the Odyssey' to see here.</p>
<p>I picked up around 600 gems throughout my roughly 35-hour playthrough (it would be <em>much</em> shorter, had I not been such a fiend for shiny collectibles), and I know that even more are still waiting. That's not to mention the Fossils, Smashin' Stats, and Outfits, all of which are calling me back for that sweet 100% completion.</p>
<p><em>And then</em> there's the entirely optional sculpting DK Artist mode, which gobbled up more of my time than I was expecting in my crude attempt to build DK a Waluigi hat. The tools are deeper than I had imagined, and it's nice to see Mouse Mode in action, though it doesn't add much to the overall experience other than the worrying thought of what people will do with that poor banana model. Still, it's a nice little addition.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 9 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157281/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I spent the majority of my time playing solo, but you can bring a pal along for the ride to make the collectathon that bit more manageable. The co-op is more Mario Odyssey than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">3D World</a>. Player two stays tethered to DK as Pauline, and is on hand to dish out attacks and pick up collectibles.</p>
<p>It's a perfectly pleasant time playing with two adults — even if the option to have <em>both</em> players control the camera feels like a mistake — but it really feels designed for a parent-child paring, where a less-experienced player can still be part of the adventure without having to worry about all the pesky platforming and punching. You can even try this out between Switch 2 and Switch 1 systems via the magic of GameShare, though I wasn't able to test this during the review period. Elsewhere, an Assist Mode accessed from the menu at any time can make DK's health last a little longer and point you in the right direction. There are also tools for button remapping, language options for Pauline's dialogue (though the text language is set at a system level), and subtitle toggles.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 10 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157295/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For the most part, Donkey Kong Bananza is a prime example of the Switch 2's beefed-up performance, running at a smooth 60fps for <em>most</em> of the time, with some genuinely stunning vistas and a nice touch of that swanky 3D audio thrown in for good measure — you'll hear the gramophone of a safe Getaway and know exactly which direction to head. The destruction left in DK's wake is permanent (until you leave the layer or opt to reset the terrain, that is), and while the environments don't obey the real-world laws of physics to the letter — you can punch through the base of a tree and the rest of the trunk will remain standing — some sections see hundreds of objects, each with their own physics, realised on screen at once, lifting the lid on a new console generation in style.</p>
<p>It's truly impressive stuff, but there are some hiccups along the way. More intense digging sequences see the camera get a little squiffy as it tries to realise DK <em>without</em> showing the underground areas around him. Distant textures lose their detail, and speeding towards them reveals pop-in aplenty. And, when you really put the game through its paces in the later layers, where new paths are being created, destroyed and moved all at the same time, the frame rate takes a noticeable dive before springing back.</p>
<p>All that said, it didn't come close to ruining my experience. This is an ambitious game where you can head in any direction at any time, make or break new routes to your will, and tear up the terrain knowing full well that the damage will still be there next time you come back.</p>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Review - Screenshot 11 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157297/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So, can I say that Donkey Kong Bananza is <em>better</em> than Super Mario Odyssey? No, I can't. And honestly, what is? But if you loved Jumpman's planet-hopping adventure, you'll have no shortage of smiles on this underground descent.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza is an almighty re-introduction to the world of 3D platforming for DK, and arguably the Switch 2's first absolute must-play. The punching and crashing is a passing novelty that, once you get your fill, quickly becomes just another way of exploring the wonderfully varied and beautifully presented layers.</p>
<p>Whether it's smashing through the scenery with a Bananza Transformation or carefully planning a route to a hidden Banandium Gem, you'll have trouble finding more originality and, crucially, more enjoyment from a platformer in recent years. As the DK Rap so wisely said, "Donkey Kong is here." Now let's just hope he stays.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neverness-to-everness-second-closed-beta-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-gacha-anomaly.1244853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Judging from its current immense popularity, the gacha RPG genre isn’t going anywhere. If anything, it's going to become even bigger, as games like HoYoVerse's Genshin Impact have proven how there's a rather big audience for ambitious and immersive open-world RPGs powered by gacha mechanics. Back in 2021, Chinese studio Hotta Studio tried getting into the trend with Tower of Fantasy, which provided a competent open-world experience featuring a solid visual design and gameplay, but failed to become a worldwide phenomenon due to issues that inevitably impacted the good the game has to offer, such as a confusing user interface, average balancing which renders some characters useless after a certain point in the adventure and some technical issues. Still, Tower of Fantasy proved Hotta Studio already had what it takes to create a compelling open-world gacha RPG back in 2021, and the experience made developing the game is going to serve Neverness to Everness well, judging from the second closed beta test.</p>



<p>Doing away with the fantasy setting with sci-fi elements of Tower of Fantasy, Neverness to Everness is set in the futuristic metropolis of Hethereau, where the amnesiac main character finds themselves after a Level VII anomaly disaster strikes New Helios. Possessing special abilities that allow them to deal with the strange occurrences known as Anomalies, the main character agrees after spending time in prison for observation, to participate in Code Zero containment operations, joining the Anomaly Hunter team at Eibon Antique Shop. Just from this premise, it's clear how the game has been heavily inspired by the latest entries in the Persona series, as the episodic, almost short anime show narrative arc, nature of the story, the character interactions and the Anomalies being not too dissimilar from the Shadows are clearly based on the ATLUS series. Though the second closed beta test only features a small part of the story, the episodic format works great to develop the overarching story while providing some self-contained, anime-styled fun, although the comedic situations and banter between characters sometimes diminish the unique, almost horror, feel that the vast majority of investigations possess. Thankfully, this isn't a major issue, at least for now, as the characters, although a little bit on the tropey side, are charming and personable, thanks to great design and animation works, and a decent spread between male and female characters, which tends to be a little unbalanced towards the female side in a good portion of the most popular games around.</p>



<p>As a gacha RPG lives and dies by how charming characters are, Neverness to Everness already seems to have everything needed to become a success, but I expect the setting and the open-world mechanics to become the defining feature of the game. When the game was revealed, it was often described as anime Grand Theft Auto, and this definition is not too far from the truth, although the opportunities to be a criminal are limited compared to the Rockstar Games series. Still, the police will start looking for you if you start stealing cars left and right, and in the game's current state, don't expect to be able to get away from officers too easily, as they put up quite a fight. Aside from committing crimes, Hetherau offers a lot of different side activities already, which include purchasing and managing businesses, car races, Spacetime Projector missions, where players need to rewind recordings of incidents to pinpoint the exact moment an Anomaly has appeared, hunting hidden items, and so on. Considering this is only the beginning for the game, the open-world mechanics and activities show a lot of promise.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Besides spending a lot of time roaming around Hetherau, players will spend quite a bit of time fighting Anomalies in Neverness to Everness using a big cast of characters. In this regard, the game looks promising as well, with a functional yet simple combat system which incorporates elements from character action games like perfect dodges and parries without feeling overwhelming, although the system would benefit from some additional depth, as the moveset of many of the characters available in the closed beta featured some interesting fighting styles that could have incorporated more than a special skill, an Ultimate and a basic single-button combo string. The room to grow and expand the combat, however, is definitely there, so hopefully the developer will provide a slightly deeper experience down the line. Character customization also feels to have potential with the Arcs system, which grants passive skills to characters, and a unique "artifacts" system that has the player slotting Tetris-like pieces to further enhance a character.</p>



<p>As for every similar game, however, it's the fairness of the gacha mechanics that can make or break the experience, and in this regard Neverness to Everness definitely has what it takes to be successful, as unlocking characters and leveling them up to use them in current content without any trouble promises to be less painful than in other games. Sure, there are still rolls and multiple currencies to keep track of, but players are guaranteed to get an A-Class item within 10 rolls, and an S-Class character within 90. Better yet, if multiple S-Class characters are available as part of one of the virtual tabletop boards, which represent the traditional banners seen in similar games, the player can choose which character they want, which is a great option that will likely make Neverness to Everness an extremely player-friendly gacha.</p>



<p>Neverness to Everness might not revolutionize gacha RPGs, but it shows how much more engaging and polished these games are becoming. The urban open world has a lot of potential with satisfying traversal and varied side activities,, and the overall presentation feels closer to what you'd expect to find in full-priced title. While there's still work to be done regarding performance, balancing, and speed of traversal on foot. Neverness to Everness definitely has the chance to become one of the best gacha games of the past few years.</p>

						<h5>Donkey Kong Bananza</h5><p><span>July 17, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Despite being the franchise that started it all for Nintendo, Donkey Kong has never been as meticulously managed as, say, Mario or Zelda. For decades, DK was largely entrusted to teams outside Nintendo’s core Japanese development structure, with the likes of Rare, Retro Studios, and the occasional third party offering their own varying spins on the franchise. That said, between a major role in the recent Super Mario Bros. movie and new Universal Studios attractions, it seems clear Nintendo is interested in returning Donkey Kong to true top-tier franchise status. As part of this, Nintendo is rolling out <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, a new Switch 2 3D platformer from the EPD Tokyo team behind the likes of Super Mario Odyssey.</p>



<p>Does Donkey Kong Bananza see Nintendo’s ape swing to new heights? Or does this one go Donkey Wrong? Time to dig into DK’s latest…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems DK has become more of a go-getter since his last original platformer, as Donkey Kong Bananza opens with him leading a mining operation, as he uses his fists to dig up “Banandium Gems” (this game’s equivalent of Mario Odyssey’s Power Moons) and scads of sparkly “Banandium Gold.” Unfortunately, a villainous crew of apes, known as VoidCo, crashes a meteor into DK’s mine, sinking all its precious treasure (and DK himself) further underground.</p>



<p>DK initially teams up with a funny little creature named Odd Rock, although it’s soon revealed the stony sidekick is actually Pauline (that’s not a spoiler, as Nintendo has heavily promoted her in trailers and PR materials). In previous games, Pauline has played the role of Donkey Kong’s unfortunate kidnapping victim and, later, the stylish Mayor of New Donk City, but here, she’s a somewhat naïve 13-year old who dreams of becoming a singer. DK and Pauline soon learn that getting back to the surface actually requires them to go deeper, down to the “Banandium Root,” which is said to grant wishes. And so, a journey to the center of the planet, through many colorful and strange locales, begins.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>I was quite surprised, pleasantly so, by how much attention Donkey Kong Bananza paid to its characters and story. The new DK and Pauline models are bursting with skillfully-animated energy and the two make a charming pair, both in big cutscenes, and during more low-key moments. DK Bananza has a system of “getaways” where you can rest and recharge your heart meter, and each time you go down for a nap you get to overhear fun, sometimes poignant, snippets of conversation between Pauline and her simian companion (DK sticks to grunts, but Pauline is fully voice acted). Pauline even has a nice little character arc, starting out unsure of her singing abilities then gaining confidence as the game progresses.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>And yes, while I’ll provide no spoilers here, if you’re perplexed about some of the mysteries Nintendo have presented, like, say, why Pauline is a precocious tween now, I can confirm some actual answers are offered. Nintendo has a history of simply shrugging at continuity, and while I’m sure there are things that still don’t fit, Bananza ties into other games, and the greater Donkey Kong lineage, in ways I think will satisfy, and perhaps surprise, fans. Donkey Kong Bananza is a fulsome celebration of the franchise’s long and storied history.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As for how Donkey Kong Bananza plays, our hairy hero doesn’t just use his fists to smash baddies anymore, he can now use them to plow into the terrain with a large portion of most environments being destructible. DK can punch forward, downward, and up, as well as slam down from above after a jump. Additionally, he can grab chunks of rock and dirt to throw, swing, or use as a handy surfboard, and can clamber up pretty much any vertical surface. It's a versatile set of tools for traversing and shaping the world, which makes Donkey Kong Bananza almost feel like a mixture of Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>



<p>Granted, it may take some players a while to get used to the feel of DK Bananza’s minute-to-minute gameplay. Bananza’s actual platforming is rather rudimentary, particularly in the early stages of the game. DK only has a single, relatively limited jump, and many of Mario's more advanced tricks like wall jumping aren’t present here. Really, the game is often more of a <em>climber</em> than a traditional platformer, with much of the game’s traversal revolving around your near-unlimited ability to scale most surfaces (although you will encounter a few smooth or slick surfaces you can’t get up). This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but again, it's something you may have to adapt to. This isn't just Mario with a gorilla skin.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another thing that sets DK Bananza apart are its destruction mechanics, which allow you to smash most of what you see (down to an underlying hard base layer underneath most stages) and yes, it’s quite satisfying. You can tunnel your way into hills and rock formations, creating your own tunnel systems or, alternatively, rip up pieces of soft dirt and stick them together to make new bridges and other structures. Of course, everywhere you dig is positively chock full of all manner of goodies, including Banandium Gems, Banandium Chips, collectible fossils, treasure chests, and lots and lots of gold.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Admittedly, sometimes this freedom to smash whatever you want can make the game feel a bit messy. Often I’d find myself digging into the ground when I just wanted to attack an enemy, and the camera can sometimes be a bit unruly once burrowed in there. There’s also an odd visual issue I encountered fairly often where most of the environment would disappear into a purple-ish void for a second. I think this is related to the digging mechanic – most of the background is <em>supposed </em>to disappear when you’re fully immersed underground so as to eliminate visual clutter, and it seems like there are moments where the game detects you as being underground for a moment when you’re really not. It isn’t a huge deal, but it is a rather distracting issue in what’s otherwise a very visually-polished game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to DK’s core moves, you’ll also gradually unlock various Bananza forms, which allow you to transform into a muscled-up version of DK, a fast-dashing zebra, a flying (yes, flying) ostrich, and other animals. These transformations are on a timer, after which, you need to collect more gold to reactivate them. As such, Bananza forms aren’t as deeply integrated into level designs as, say, Mario Odyssey’s Cappy transformations. Most of the time, you can get by just playing as vanilla DK, with only certain obstacles – a fragile bridge you need to run over as Zebra DK here, an air-vent you can glide on as Ostrich DK there – requiring a transformation.</p>



<p>Most of the Bananza forms are fairly fun to play as, although that doesn’t mean they’re all created equal (I definitely have my favorites). DK Bananza also takes a surprisingly long time to introduce challenges that require switching between multiple forms – most of the game’s main stages are based around a single Bananza form. In addition to the various transformations, DK Bananza also introduces some light RPG elements, including a skill tree that allows you to upgrade your capabilities and an array of unlockable outfits that confer upgradable buffs.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This version of DK is certainly a resourceful guy with a lot of different abilities to keep track of, but, of course, all the skills in the world don’t matter if a game doesn’t have good levels to put them to the test. Thankfully, Donkey Kong Bananza delivers on that front. DK Bananza is divided up into multiple descending layers, with DK diving between them in a similar fashion to how Link plunges into the Depths in Tears of the Kingdom. Most layers are further divided into multiple sublayers, with players sometimes having to travel up and down in order to access certain locations. A number of these individual sublayers are as large and complex (maybe even larger in some cases) as the biggest Kingdoms in Mario Odyssey. It all adds up to a world that feels more interconnected, and notably more complex, than Mario Odyssey's.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Individual layers run the gamut from more typical jungle, icy, and grassy plains settings, to more original themes, like one based around a full race track and even more out-there examples I can’t discuss at the moment. Even the more predictable level themes usually have some quirky twist that set them apart (like the fact that the artic layer is inhabited by desert-loving, parka wearing zebras for some reason).</p>



<p>Graphically, DK Bananza is a hearty feast for the eyes, with nearly every layer standing out as visually unique, impressive in scope, and packed with fun details, big and small. There are some layers that are arguably a bit over-busy, with efforts to create something original resulting in some clashing visual elements (think the Luncheon Kingdom from Mario Odyssey taken to another level) but these stages are the exception. By and large, DK Bananza is an impressive-looking game that usually runs well on the Switch 2 hardware, with only occasional performance issues during particularly frantic boss battles.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, DK Bananza’s stages aren’t just varied and nice to look at, they’re also plenty of fun to play. That feeling of there being a secret or unique challenge around every corner you got in Mario Odyssey returns and is taken to a new level. Almost every layer of the game offers some sort of unique gameplay mechanic, some of which are truly wild and wonderful, like the glowing rocks you pluck in the Resort Layer that send you hurtling into the sky or the seeds from the Forest Layer that produce creeping vine bridges.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It should also be said, unlike Mario Odyssey, which took a relatively laid-back approach to progression, DK Bananza offers a more structured core campaign replete with a continuous series of missions, big cutscenes, and lots of boss fights. While there's certainly still plenty of room for aimless exploration, those looking for a game with more of a core driving force will find it here. Almost all the main campaign missions are fun, balancing unique challenges, epic moments, and a nicely-balanced level of difficulty. If there's one somewhat weak aspect of this core campaign, it may be the bosses, with many early ones being trivially easy and later ones becoming more challenging in a sometimes-frustrating way. That said, there are still some good boss fights in the game, they're just not as consistent as they could be.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza’s core campaign is certainly substantial – even with a fairly lean and focused playthrough, it took me around 16 or 17 hours to roll credits. Of course, like Mario Odyssey, there’s a seemingly-infinite amount of extra stuff to collect and some specific incentives for doing so. You're going to be tallying everything Bananza has to offer for some time.<strong></strong></p>

					<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza</h2>

						<section>
				<p>Donkey Kong Bananza doesn’t monkey around, as it’s inarguably the biggest, most ambitious 3D platformer Nintendo has ever produced. Taking the formula established by Super Mario Odyssey as a starting point, Nintendo goes deeper, wilder, weirder, and punchier. Donkey Kong Bananza is perhaps a bit less refined than the near-immaculate Odyssey, but if you can overlook a few minor brown spots, this banana is very much worth peeling.</p>

            <p>Publishers Krafton have told workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds they would still get a promised bonus if they ship enough of the game by the end of 2026. In other words, they've been given an extension to hit their targets. The bonus money was in question after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">the surprise firing of senior staff</a> a couple of weeks ago, and the enforced delay of the survival game by Krafton. After worker concerns and fan outrage, now the corp says "don't worry, we'll pay!" Although it's not the huge $250 million they were originally supposed to.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A report by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?">Bloomberg</a> says the sweetener would include a $25 million payout to be shared (unequally) among roughly 40 specific developers at the studio. All other workers would meanwhile get a bonus paid this year, an advance on the "projected 2026 profit-sharing bonus pool". Although the amounts involved for those employees isn't specified.</p>
<p>It's a big wad of cash. It is also just one-tenth of the $250 million Krafton were due to pay out to the studio if it achieved certain sales figures by the end of 2025. So a relative bargain for the South Korean corporation. The reasons for all this are muddy. So let's go mudlarking.</p>
<p>In 2021 the studio were bought by Krafton for $500 million, with a further $250 million "earnout" promised if the studio hit a certain level of revenue by the end of 2025. The bulk of that earnout would be claimed by the leadership at the studio, who've since said they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lwsxco/lawsuit_a_community_update_from_charlie/">planned to share some of that money</a> with other employees. Meanwhile $25 million of the earnout was ringfenced for the 40 employees mentioned above, with each getting a different sum, "most in the six or seven figures" according to paperwork seen by Bloomberg.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Krafton</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With all that cash at stake, things went wrong. Subnautica 2 was due to come out this year. Studio co-founder Charlie Cleveland <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">believed the game was "ready for early access"</a>. Krafton disagreed. They wanted more work done on it. Naturally, whoever lost this argument would potentially lose quite a bit of dough. Presumably at an impasse, Krafton pulled out an axe and decapitated the studio heads Charlie Cleveland, Ted Gill, and Max MacGuire, and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">claim that they abandoned their duties</a>. The publisher installed Steve Papoutsis, a producer from Striking Distance (another Krafton studio) as new CEO, then publically delayed the game until 2026.</p>
<p>This left remaining workers concerned they too wouldn't see their promised bonuses. But Krafton have now extended their deadline by a year, until the end of 2026, says Bloomberg. Seems promising for those who'll benefit, although we haven't seen what Krafton consider as "ready" for release, nor know if it's achievable in that year.</p>
<p>Basically, it looks like Krafton understand that they have created a legal and financial headache for themselves - the three ousted devs are now suing the publisher, for one thing. They now look to be throwing some money at the problem. If one were inclined to think like a spreadsheet-brained corporate entity, one would surmise that as long as said throwin' money soothes current staff and does not exceed the $250 million they have been avoiding so far, it will all work out in the green. </p>
<p>It's a dirty mess soaked in cash, and it will likely get dirtier in court. Earlier this week, a document was "leaked" on Reddit that purpotedly showed how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-leak-is-authentic-say-publishers-who-benefit-the-most-from-that-leak">Subnautica 2's scope was reduced in the last two years</a>. Krafton still haven't responded to our question asking if they themselves were the source of this leak.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised]]></content:encoded>
