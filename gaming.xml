            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vampires, survival crafting, and an intriguing storyline, what more could a gal ask for out of a game? I had enjoyed the demo of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampires-bloodlord-rising" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8af11eac-aecd-4098-b7f3-667907201d64" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em></a> when it first dropped, so I knew I wanted to dive in when it launched in Early Access. The title offers castle building, castle defense, crafting, and servant management woven into the first chapter of a compelling narrative. Learn all about the game in this <em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em> preview.</p><h2><em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising </em>Preview | Intriguing Narrative Meets Castle Building</h2><p>The adventure begins with a sacrifice. Vorago, the master of the land, gives himself up to end an Inquisition raid on his castle and save his children. You awaken as Dragos, one of those children, after an unspecified amount of time. Though Vorago is gone, his whispers remain. That’s not all, his power, in the form of a crystal core, can be nourished with blood to repel the Silver Veil, a mist covering the land that actively harms vampires.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The main gameplay revolves around this narrative. You <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/vampires-bloodlord-rising-building-guide-castle-upgrades" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fca62218-ab9a-4879-ad8d-9cc9c5a31393" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">build up your castle</a>, empower the core, and travel to the three other lands in the area. You can start with any land, but you’ll need all three unlocked and their respective strongholds under your control to progress the story.&nbsp;</p><p>This area of <em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em> is pretty much an RPG. Each land has a three part questline ending with you obtaining an overseer for your stronghold. You’ll also expand your knowledge of events that occurred while you slumbered. Most of this revolves around the Pale Soarer, a flying monster attacking humans that comes from inside the veil.&nbsp;</p><p>While I really like the narrative, this is where I take the most issue with the game. The quests are simply too short. When you factor in how fast you can run around, how close many of the objectives are, and how easy quest goals are to complete, it really devalues the story. The RPG segment, which I was looking forward to the most, was extremely underwhelming due to this.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, it is Early Access, and this is only the first chapter in the story of<em> Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em>. Going through the quests is only one part of the gameplay. However, I made it through all the quests to the end of the available narrative in 11 hours. That's along with building my castle, exploring the lands, and getting lost more than a few times.<picture>

  </picture></p><p>There are a number of places where additional steps and narrative depth could have been added to the existing missions. The world is rich with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/vampires-bloodlord-rising-resources-guide-crafting-materials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02def268-10e4-45f0-8277-170efa3abb38" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">bizarre plants</a>, there are caverns and mines you can explore, and ruined houses litter the landscape. Most of these spaces, however, are empty. No animals aside from deer and rabbits to feast on, no strange animals to match the strange plants. No letters in homes where people died or ancient writings on ruins in the marshes. Adding in more depth would’ve allowed quests to be expanded and more playtime for people to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p>Eleven hours is nothing to sneeze at. It’s great for those with limited play time. I just expected, and wanted, more. Thankfully, the full release promises the rest of the story.</p><p>The other half of <em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em> gameplay revolves around building your castle, and managing it, along with your strongholds. Building your castle is straightforward and similar to other titles. You unlock more buildables as you expand your base, discover new materials, and reach building milestones. Managing and defending the castle and strongholds is left to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/vampires-bloodlord-rising-vampire-guide-managing-workers" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2e5f1dcb-08ae-4358-9abf-8e2654b725e1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">servants</a> you turn from the villages.&nbsp;</p><p>I found this aspect rather unique, in that you gather rumors to see who would make the best servant for a task. When you’ve found someone who fits what you’re looking for, you convert them and put them to work. This can be anything from cleaning up debris, building planned pieces, forging armor, and even defending your stronghold. You won’t have to forage for resources, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/vampires-bloodlord-rising-crafting" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="772814c9-db94-4123-a4bb-8b02f093e6d1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">craft items</a>, or continuously return to your castle for upkeep with enough servants in place.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>What’s odd about this is that you can’t actually build anything in your strongholds. Coffins have to be placed at your castle. This means servants are left to run to and from each region daily. It doesn’t really make the most sense, but it could be a feature planned down the line.&nbsp;</p><p>In regards to <em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em> and how it runs, the game does take some time to get going the first time you begin. After that, it generally runs pretty well. I only ran into a single issue where I was able to build an item while I was in it, getting myself stuck. I was able to teleport to Castle Hill and continue my adventure without issue.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>When it comes to mechanics, climbing was the only problem I had. Either Dragos wouldn’t grab on to a ledge he previously did or once he was up there he’d immediately fall back down. Though annoying, it really only became an issue when trying to escape the Silver Veil.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, <em>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</em> is a promising base builder and RPG. Even though it’s a bit shallow content wise at the launch of Early Access that just means there is a lot of room for growth while the developers continue working on the title. The story itself is intriguing enough that I will continue to pay attention to the game as it moves to full launch.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Vampires: Bloodlord Rising</strong> was previewed on PC over the course of 11 hours with a code provided by the publisher.

            <title><![CDATA[Iron Lung’s path to theaters was unique, even if the movie isn’t]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874500/iron-lung-theater-box-office-markiplier</link>
            <guid>1427518</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As a movie, <em>Iron Lung</em> is occasionally thrilling but mostly forgettable. It’s a small-budget horror flick that has some cool ideas and pulls them off in an extremely efficient way, creating a sense of tension that unfortunately never turns into outright scares. But the most important thing about it is what it represents. At a time when movie theaters are dominated by only the biggest blockbusters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/862676/pijama-streaming-movies">and smaller films are trying to forge their own paths,</a> <em>Iron Lung </em>managed to make more than $20 million at the box office without the backing of a major studio. All it took was a lot of help from YouTube.</p><p>The circumstances around <em>Iron Lung</em> aren’t exactly easy to replicate. It’s an adaptation of an 2022 indie horror game developed by solo creator David Szymanski, and it’s written, directed, and executive produced by Mark Fischbach, better known as the YouTube star Markiplier. Markiplier is best known for his let’s play videos of indie horror games in particular, and he’s built up a surprisingly huge audience through that, with close to 40 million subscribers on YouTube. Three years ago, Markiplier posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiCSsW-2as">a playthrough of the game</a> that was viewed more than 14 million times. In 2022 <a href="https://x.com/DUSKdev/status/1626023240479956994">Szymanski joked about Markiplier starring in an <em>Iron Lung</em> movie</a>, <a href="https://x.com/markiplier/status/1713328222312837316">a trailer dropped a year later</a>, and now the final product is in theaters as Markiplier’s first feature film. In addition to being the creative lead behind the movie, Markiplier is also the star, which is a notable feat for a movie that mostly features one single person on camera.</p><p>The film’s premise is pretty out there: In a bleak future, a convict (Markiplier) is welded inside of an experimental submarine as punishment for his crimes. He’s tasked with exploring a moon’s ocean in search of… something. Oh, and that ocean also consists entirely of blood. Survive and he gets his freedom. The convict can’t see outside of the sub except by using an underwater camera that takes low-res images of the deep (blood) sea. So the experience of watching <em>Iron Lung</em> is mostly watching Markiplier swear, mumble, and hit switches, while steadily going insane from being trapped in such a hellscape. The movie manages to wring a surprising amount of tension from that format early on, but it really starts to drag and feel repetitive as the story progresses. One of the most pivotal moments is a drawn-out sequence of him drawing a map.</p><p><em>Iron Lung</em> is very clearly based on a video game. It uses so many of the same conceits: a guide character who is mostly just a voice over a speaker; diegetic storytelling elements like instruction manuals and big displays that reveal how deep the sub is and how much oxygen is left; audio logs that reveal important plot details; and a gear upgrade midway through. Its cast even includes Troy Baker, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/07/arts/troy-baker-indiana-jones-great-circle.html">the voice actor behind seemingly every video game of the last decade</a>. All of these elements can work really great in the context of an interactive video game, but they feel much more clunky in a live-action film. That said, as a first feature film effort, <em>Iron Lung</em> shows a lot of promise, even if it never fully comes together in the end.</p><p>Despite this, <em>Iron Lung</em> is an unqualified success. It reportedly had a budget of just $3 million, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/box-office-iron-lung-send-help-melania-shelter-1236703378/">according to <em>Deadline</em></a> it finished second in the US box office over the weekend, raking in north of $18 million, a number that has since surpassed $20 million worldwide. That put it just behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/868182/sam-raimi-send-help-review">Sam Raimi’s <em>Send Help</em></a>, a 20th Century Studios production, and well ahead of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/870713/melania-amazon-documentary-bribe-accusations">Amazon’s very expensive documentary about Melania Trump</a>.</p><p>YouTubers successfully transitioning into other creative realms isn’t a new phenomenon, not even in Hollywood. Brothers Danny and Michael Philippou made the jump from YouTube to release two excellent horror movies in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578425/talk-to-me-review-sundance-2023"><em>Talk to Me</em></a> and <em>Bring Her Back</em>, both of which raked in tens of millions. But those movies also had the studio might (and money) of the A24 name behind them, whereas <em>Iron Lung</em> is a much more grassroots affair. Markiplier utilized his fervent fan base to reach out to theaters directly, ultimately leading to the film being featured on more than 3,000 screens, despite not having a distributor. He was able to turn one kind of popularity into a breakout hit in a completely different medium.</p><p>“There were just so many people that asked [the theater chains to screen it],” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/markiplier-iron-lung-box-office-youtube-interview-1236493943/">he told <em>The</em> <em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a><em>.</em> “There were enough people that asked that people thought it was bots. At that scale, it’s hard for other people to imagine that so many people are asking.” In that same interview, he said that there’s a “still is a stigma against YouTube,” and he wanted <em>Iron Lung</em> to be successful in part to help break that barrier.</p><p>While that might help other big-name creators who want to get into film, it’s not a formula that will be easy for either filmmakers or studios to replicate. Budding horror directors can’t just amass a YouTube audience of millions first as a way of helping their projects break through, and there is an enormous difference between running a channel and making a blockbuster.</p><p>But the <em>Iron Lung</em> story does show the power of having an existing audience, and how the scale of online success has now reached a point that it can disrupt even the most established institutions, like Hollywood, and directly compete with the likes of Disney and Amazon. And with more hits like <em>Iron Lung</em>, that stigma will only continue to fade — and theaters might not look the same.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/874500/iron-lung-theater-box-office-markiplier]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I am very much of the opinion that for the most part, video games do not have a very good relationship with food. There are plenty of games where you can eat food and get some delicious HP back for it, but rarely is food the focal point narratively. So, ever since its announcement I've been quite excited about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dosa-divas">Dosa Divas</a>, a turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you play as two sisters piloting a cute robot whose goal is to take down an "evil fast food empire." And I'm more excited now, as it has a release date!
</p>
<p>
Unlike that one meal you ordered at that one restaurant all the big TikTokers said was really good, actually, you won't have to wait long either, as it's set to release April 14th, less than two months away. Not only that, it has a new demo for you to have a fiddle with, which I did. It's neat! But also very much the beginning of an RPG, where your movesets are limited, so you don't get a real feel for its full potential.
</p>
<p>
There is a dedicated cooking mechanic too, where you mix and match different ingredients for various kinds of dosa. The quality of the final result differs depending on how well you do sort of quick-time events, which admittedly isn't the most engaging thing in the world, but is better than just going through a menu and the game pretending you've made something to eat.
</p>
<p>
Where it pulls me in is its story, as there is clearly an emphasis on the act of making food that understands what a personal thing it is to do. I'm curious to see where it ultimately ends up in this hyperbolised world where everyone is forced into eating ready-made meals, though I can already feel that at least one of the lessons learned will be of the joys of cooking.
</p>
<p>
While you wait for developer Outerloop Games to add the final bits of seasoning, you can wishlist the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950710/Dosa_Divas/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-jetpack-cat-tether-bob-dva-ultimate-flight-2000666163</link>
            <guid>1427512</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I do not fear many things in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a><span>, but I am beginning to fear Jetpack Cat. The flying feline hero is exactly what she sounds like, a cat that has endless flight and zooms around the map healing allies and pestering foes. However, she also has the ability to tether her teammates to her craft and fly them around the battlefield. The strategies and combos players have already found in just a brief early access period are incredibly chaotic.</span></p> <p><span>I played a little bit of Jetpack Cat myself when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>tried my hand at all five of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new heroes last month</span></a><span>, and while I don’t think she will be joining my support hero rotation anytime soon, I’m already anticipating the ridiculous plays teams will pull off with her if they’re coordinating. The cat’s tether requires a teammate to opt in, meaning you don’t have to worry about any </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-hero-lifeweaver-season-4-patch-change-ptr-1850302565"><span>Lifeweaver-style trolling</span></a><span> or accidentally latching onto her and being taken for a ride.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re tethered, Jetpack Cat can fly you anywhere, as long as you don’t get shot down by the enemy team. But her tether isn’t limited to just teammates, it can also pick up things like Ashe’s Omnic ultimate B.O.B. as he fires down on the unsuspecting foes below, or D.Va’s mech suit after she’s set it to self destruct. This way you have a brief window to fix a bad play or placement. Meanwhile, Jetpack Cat’s ultimate lets her tether onto an enemy and drag them off the map or out of a fortified area, so you’re not just restricted to picking up friendlies. There’s a lot of potential and not a ton of limitations. Some early players have used dueling Jetpack Cats to pit two of their respective teammates against each other in an airborne battle.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">another funny clip from the frogger stream <a href="https://t.co/O9V4D28o24">https://t.co/O9V4D28o24</a> <a href="https://t.co/vbSkuGZ7Yd">pic.twitter.com/vbSkuGZ7Yd</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019174652342595621?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FROGGER HOW COULD YOU DO THAT TO THE CAT <a href="https://t.co/dfRVcY7chp">pic.twitter.com/dfRVcY7chp</a></p> <p>— VizFint (@VFlince) <a href="https://twitter.com/VFlince/status/2019142721617998175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">신캐로 암살 야무지게 하시는데; <a href="https://t.co/3QOyiCnRgy">pic.twitter.com/3QOyiCnRgy</a></p> <p>— 진 (@nojamgirl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nojamgirl_/status/2019190825696240049?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">■新サポート<br>「ジェットパックキャット」</p> <p>無制限に浮游＆味方を引っ張れる模様👀</p> <p>🎬:SEjFiNN <a href="https://t.co/rliVJC8Ukj">pic.twitter.com/rliVJC8Ukj</a></p> <p>— Overwatch2ニュース@おばにゅー (@Overwatch2_NEWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/Overwatch2_NEWS/status/2019122454837563574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">never in my life did i expect to see a mauga and bastion duking it out in the skybox of illios lighthouse LMAOO <a href="https://twitter.com/zbra_ow?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@zbra_ow</a> <a href="https://t.co/4i8zposR3c">pic.twitter.com/4i8zposR3c</a></p> <p>— lightt (@ow_lightt) <a href="https://twitter.com/ow_lightt/status/2019180084297650584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Jetpack Cat is joining the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>roster on February 10 as the game undergoes a bit of a revamp, restructuring its seasonal rollout to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>incorporate lore</span></a><span> and releasing a total of 10 heroes across the next year.</span></p>

Aiming to help game makers develop their business acumen and beef up their pitching skills, Game Developer sat down with longtime funding advisor and GDC Pitch host Jason Della Rocca for a chat on exactly what devs need to know to successfully get their game in front of investors.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Headed to GDC?

They’re programmers and artists, designers and musicians, writers and all of these kinds of amazing creative roles. But rarely do they have the business acumen to really understand funding, pitching, marketing, and all of these things.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-probablymonsters-lays-off-devs-while-unveiling-nazi-hunting-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Report: ProbablyMonsters lays off devs while unveiling Nazi hunting game</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“But you were not birthed into the world with a comprehension of C++ and a keyboard in your hand. These are all learned skills. The good news is that the business and marketing stuff like pitching are all learned skills. You can learn this and get good at it.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="First steps for developing your pitch">First steps for developing your pitch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You have to really understand what you [are] actually trying to achieve,” says Della Rocca. “When I’m working with startup studios, there is some sense that they’re building a business and trying to make a career of it and generate some revenue.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Publishers, investors, platforms… They’re not there to fund your hobby. They’re in business and they want to make money too,” says Della Rocca. “If [your answer is] ‘I’m building a game that I think has a chance to be successful’ or ‘I’m trying to build a studio and generate revenue’, then you need to find partners to make that a reality.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After you know who you are and what your definition of success is, the first area you’ll want to focus on is product design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“A lot of developers think that making a pitch deck is the goal, but there’s a whole bunch of stuff that happens before that, namely around the product and product strategy. What game are you building? Is it viable?”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“The whole thing around product design is actually, in many ways, the most important business decision you’ll make,” says Della Rocca. He offers an example through a hypothetical new studio that sets out to make a game in a genre that’s oversaturated like ‘puzzle platformers’.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/us-based-tariffs-impact-38-of-business-leaders" target="_self" data-discover="true">38 percent of game industry leaders are feeling the impact of U.S. tariffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“There’s one that does well every five years or so, but it’s not a healthy genre. So if I’m saying my definition of success is to pay my team, be profitable, and stay alive as a business, you’ve made the initial wrong business decision. You’ll be playing on super hard mode because your chance of achieving your definition of success with puzzle platformers is almost nil.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Four tips for a successful pitch">Four tips for a successful pitch</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Do Your Homework">Do Your Homework</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Analysis and research are some of the most important things you can do to set yourself up for a successful pitch. Knowing what project to pitch relies on market analysis and competitive analysis, which helps to identify what types of games are viable and which aren’t. Della Rocca stresses that this research is critical to the entire pitching process: “Why am I going to give you money to make something everyone knows is not going to sell?”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“If you’re going to turn to people and say ‘give me money’, they’re expecting to make money in return. So if you chose a genre and didn’t do the market research, it’s a [non-starter]. No matter how slick your slides in your pitch deck are, the answer will always be no.”</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ghost-of-yotei-outperforms-ghost-of-tsushima-to-bolster-sony-financials" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ghost of Yotei outperforms Ghost of Tsushima to bolster Sony financials</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you’re starting to book meetings, doing your homework becomes making sure that you have everything you need on hand and ready for that pitch. Have you cleaned up the social media pages for you, your game, and your studio? Do you have a second person coming to the meeting with you as a dedicated note taker? If you’re meeting in-person, do you have the files for your build, trailer, and pitch saved on a local device?&nbsp;</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Nurture &amp; show evidence of player interest">Nurture &amp; show evidence of player interest</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“More and more, the people with money want two things: They want to be able to play something and they want to see some evidence of player interest,” stresses Della Rocca. “Your build could be a proof of concept, a prototype, a vertical slice, a demo, or anything. The important part is that investors are able to play it and see [what makes your game stand out].”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You have to ask yourself ‘is my build playable?' Enough where I can hand it over to someone and they understand what the gameplay loop is, what the hook is, and that kind of stuff? Do I have a solid build and do I have some signal from the marketplace saying that players want it?'”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That second bit of information more and more investors are requesting, player interest, is your way of proving there’s an audience for your game that’s already somewhat engaged. That proof could come in the form of trailer views, Discord members, newsletter subscriptions, wishlists, viral tiktok posts, likes, comments, shares, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“If you walk in and you’re like 'here’s the build, we’re already at 50,000 wishlists, and we’re running a playtest', then all of a sudden the people with money perk up and the opportunity is much more real," says Della Rocca. If you’re a developer and it’s time to pitch, you have to ask yourself if your build is playable and cool enough to be played.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Don’t just present your game">Don’t just present your game</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Della Rocca stresses that pitching your game is more than just ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>pitching your game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’. You can land the pitch meeting of your dreams and spend the entire time talking about the game—its gameplay, the systems, the mechanics, its art, the pipeline, the characters—but when all is said and done, the publishers thank you and run to their next meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This approach makes two key mistakes: it focuses on the game content over the game’s business case, and it uses the entire meeting time to present the game materials.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“You want to include some of the business and production elements,” says Della Rocca. “So here's the game, this is the timeline, this is the budget. Here's the team that's making it, here's the market analysis and sales projections.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“The other mistake is taking up the whole time. Let’s say you have a 30 minute pitch meeting. The actual pitch itself should be like five or six minutes. The rest of the time is small talk; you’re getting to know each other, you’re asking them questions.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says that it’s critical to not leave that 30 minute appointment without deciding on the next step and action items from your pitch meeting. Those can range from sending a build after the meeting to setting up a follow-up call, but regardless “you should not leave that pitch meeting without having a clear sense of what happens next.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Participate in GDC Pitch!">Participate in GDC Pitch!</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Find and take advantage of the resources out in the wild that can help you sharpen your pitching skills. For those headed to the GDC Festival of Gaming, participating in programs like GDC Pitch can provide an invaluable opportunity to get feedback on your project and entire pitching approach without the added stress of your studio’s financial future hanging in the balance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GDC Pitch is a pitching competition held live at GDC that gives developers a chance to pitch to a panel of judges from the investing and publishing world and get pre-pitch coaching as well as immediate feedback on how they can sharpen their presentation and materials. This year’s panel includes judges from Innersloth, Raw Fury, Kowloon Nights, Hooded Horse, Finji, MIX, and Humble.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Della Rocca, himself the longtime host of GDC Pitch, says that the coaching participants receive plus the added practice go a long way to make developers feel more confident and prepared for the real deal. He goes on to say that, even beyond the coaching and judging process, just getting your game pitch in front of a panel of investors—plus the 300-odd developers, publishers, and investors watching from the audience—can prove a worthwhile experience within itself. Della Rocca goes as far as to say that it’s not entirely unheard of for conversations to start right after leaving the GDC Pitch stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">GDC Pitch is held on March 19 and March 20 at the GDC Festival of Gaming in San Francisco, CA.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-graphics-cards-are-basically-a-rounding-error-for-nvidia-and-its-acting-like-it-2000666077</link>
            <guid>1427494</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nvidia is becoming that old friend who refuses to break it off but has clearly moved on. <em>Nioh 3</em>‘s devs don’t believe in adding an easy mode. And I’m not shocked but I am still disappointed that <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> isn’t even getting a game key card for its Switch 2 release. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. I’m closely and cautiously monitoring the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/monolith-soft-development-and-speculation-st.51/page-59#post-2168268"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles 4</em> gossip</a> in hopes it might secretly end up being one of Nintendo’s big fall games for this year. That feels slightly ahead of schedule but a boy can dream.</p> <h2>Nvidia isn’t denying reports that its GeForce graphics card plans have slowed</h2> <p><em><a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-delay-new-gaming-chip-due-memory-chip-shortage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">The Information</a> </em>reports that the tech company at the epicenter of AI market shockwaves is scaling back producing of its 50-series graphics cards and delaying a mid-gen refresh of its Blackwell designs. <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/2008900087469257149?s=20">Hardware leaker Kopite7kimi</a> is claiming that a new 6090 batch of cards won’t appear until late 2027. And Nvidia isn’t pumping the brakes on all of this speculative doom and gloom.</p>

 <p>“Demand for GeForce RTX GPUs is strong, and memory supply is constrained,” it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5080-super-is-probably-dead-thanks-to-ai">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a new statement. “We continue to ship all GeForce SKUs and are working closely with our suppliers to maximize memory availability.” I feel better already! Don’t you?</p> <p>But honestly, pulling back on PC gaming is exactly what every market signal is telling Nvidia to do at the moment. It’s quarterly revenue in 2014 was $1.23 billion. That set a record at the time. Last quarter it earned $4.3 billion from PC gaming alone, but gaming revenue was a much smaller proportion of the company’s business overall. Total revenue was over $50 billion, setting an all new record in which PC gaming accounted for just 8 percent.</p>

 <p>In the meantime, Nvidia just agreed to dump $20 billion into OpenAI after originally promising up to $100 billion. That might seem like it’s hedging its bets, but $20 billion is still more than all the money the company will earn from its PC gaming business in the next year.</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft devs grill management on the publisher’s missteps</h2> <p>A townhall Q&amp;A with CEO Yves Guillemot and others to re-instill confidence in the rank-and-file did anything but, according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/"><em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. The leadership team remained adamantly opposed to altering the company’s controversial new RTO policy and defended it by pointing to similar policies at competitors like Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, and Rockstar Games. What about more mass layoffs? In response to a question about cuts of over 2,000 employees, CFO Frederik Duguet was less than reassuring. “First of all, we must state very clearly that we have never shared such numbers externally, and as I’ve just said, we won’t share any more decisions today,” he reportedly told the group.</p> <h2>Square Enix has big <em>FF7</em> plans for 2026</h2> <p>“This year, we plan to share more updates on the <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake </em>Project than ever before,” director Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://twitter.com/nhamaguc/status/2019428998875590885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019428998875590885%7Ctwgr%5Ea5650f6b73caef1736c385f75f5a3900b90de88a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fsquare-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director">shared on Thursday</a> after it was confirmed that <em>Rebirth</em> is coming to both Switch 2 and Xbox on June 3. Does that mean we’ll finally get the third part of the trilogy before the end of 2026? Or is this just the marketing machine ramping up for an early 2027 launch? It probably depends on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, as every other release date will this year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s newest content arrives later this month</h2> <p><em>Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon</em> will go live on February 26, Gearbox Entertainment confirmed on Thursday. It will be “bite-sized-yet-flavorful narrative content” alongside free updates like the addition of Pearlescent gear. The next batch of main story missions, meanwhile, is called <em>Mad Ellie and the Vault of the</em> <em>Damned</em> and they’re coming in March along with a new vault hunter, the ex-casino bot C4SH.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima is back in the video editing bay</h2> <p>“Editing for the first time in…8 months?” he <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2019389612716966356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2019389612716966356%7Ctwgr%5Eb7be707bf7388a8828069325edeb08d9957ec2a4%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Faction%2Fhideo-kojima-is-teasing-something-ahead-of-the-rumored-state-of-play-and-almost-everyones-thinking-the-same-thing-pc-trailer-for-death-stranding-2%2F">tweeted</a> with a sad face. Could this be for the rumored PlayStation State of Play taking place later this month? Current guesses are a PC port of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> or a big DLC for it. Surely it’s too early for anything else?</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> will not be giving casual players a break anytime soon</h2> <p>“We’ve never considered adding difficulty settings to the <em>Nioh</em> series,” director Masaki Fujita <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/difficulty-settings-nioh-team-ninja-game-director-interview">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a>. “The value of clearing the game is something that is unifying, and since <em>Nioh 3</em> has even more variations on strategies to clear the game compared to previous games in the series, our approach is not to change the difficulty setting when you can’t clear it.”</p>

 <h2>Bethesda finds something Switch 2 players hate more than game key cards</h2> <p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> will come to Nintendo’s portable console as a cartridge with the full game on it. <em>Fallout 4</em> and<em> Oblivion Remastered</em>, however, will not. They won’t even be game key cards. <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/17ZQE6BiOoEfIFRJJTtfz2/bethesda-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">They’ll just be download codes in boxes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Are male ski jumpers injecting a specific kind of acid into their penises in order to gain a small advantage over their competitors? Maybe. But if so, don’t worry, Winter Olympics officials are on it.</p> <p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czej70jyg4eo">As reported by the BBC</a>, there’s been a strange rumor floating around men’s ski jumping, and it all started after <a href="https://www.bild.de/sport/mehr-sport/skispringen-skisprung-verband-reagiert-auf-penis-wirbel-695cb73efb77630dac278cdd">German newspaper <em>Bild</em></a> reported in January that some athletes were injecting hyaluronic acid into their penises before being measured by officials for their tight-fitting suits. Why? Apparently, the acid, which is not banned, causes the injected penis to grow in circumference by about one to two centimeters, or a little less than an inch. In theory, this would increase the surface area of the ski suit during jumps, which could possibly increase how far a skier flies and help them eke out a win.</p> <p>“Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5 percent bigger surface area, you fly further,” ski jumping men’s race director Sandro Pertile told the BBC. Before the start of a season, ski jumpers are 3D scanned and measured to create skin-tight suits. Part of the measuring process includes the amount of fabric around the crotch. So a bit more girth could provide a little more fabric, and that could equal a slightly longer jump.</p>  <p>There’s just one problem with this wild theory: There is no evidence that it’s happening at the Winter Olympics.</p> <p>International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS) communications director Bruno Sassi told the BBC that there has “never been any indication” nor “evidence” that a male skier has injected hyaluronic acid into their penis to gain an unfair advantage. Though it is also possible that this is happening, and nobody has been caught yet.</p> <p>“I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance,” World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) director Olivier Niggli said when asked about the penis injection claims during a recent Winter Olympics press conference. “If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping-related. We don’t address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.”</p> <p>WADA’s Polish president Witold Banka added: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.”</p> <p>The Winter Olympics start on Friday in Italy. Men’s ski jumping begins on Monday.</p>

<p>Arisen for a new console</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The <strong>Tales of</strong> series is on a bit of a roll at the moment, and Switch 2 owners have something to celebrate, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tales-of-arise-beyond-the-dawn-edition">Tales of Arise - Beyond the Dawn Edition</a> is coming to the console on <strong>22nd May 2026</strong>. it's getting both a physical and digital release.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise">Tales of Arise</a> is the most-recent entry in Bandai Namco's action RPG series; it came out on other platforms back in 2021, with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tales_of_arise_beyond_the_dawn">Beyond the Dawn</a> expansion following in 2023. The Switch 2 release will include the expansion as-standard.</p>
<p>Interestingly, this is the first Tales of game to get a native Switch 2 version — even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_berseria_remastered">Tales of Berseria Remastered</a>, which comes out at the end of the month, is only on Switch 1. But Tales of Arise also isn't part of the recent slate of remasters, making this a straight port of the critically-acclaimed game.</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are some more details on the game courtesy of Bandai Namco:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> immerses players into a conflict between two worlds. For 300 years, <strong>Rena</strong> has ruled over <strong>Dahna</strong>, pillaging the planet’s resources and stripping its people of dignity and freedom.</p>
<p>The story begins with two individuals, born in different worlds, each looking to change their fate and create a new future. Featuring a diverse cast of characters, an intuitive and rewarding combat system, and a captivating story set in a lush world, <strong>Tales of ARISE</strong> delivers a first-class <strong>JRPG</strong> experience.</p>
<p>Players will follow <strong>Alphen</strong>, a masked amnesic man who can’t feel pain as he encounters <strong>Shionne</strong>, the cursed woman that inflicts agony upon everything she touches. They will both get to know each other and meet a varied cast of allies to take on the Renan Lords, powerful foes, in order to free <strong>Dahna</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We've had four Tales games on Switch 1 and Switch 2 between the start of 2025 and 2026, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_graces_f_remastered">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a>, and the aforementioned Tales of Berseria Remastered and Tales of Arise. Where will the series take us next on Nintendo's hybrid console? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> character design has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>gotten a bit homogeneous</span></a><span> over the years, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-heroes-characters-hotter-young-skins-collab-2000665796"><span>fans have taken notice of it</span></a><span>. Specifically, the women of Blizzard’s hero shooter have suffered from a bit of “same face syndrome” for years, with characters like Widowmaker, Ashe, and Freja being nearly identical in some skins. However, it’s gotten especially bad for the game’s East Asian heroes since Kiriko came onto the scene in 2022. Now Anran, one of the new heroes joining the game next week, is the latest victim of this phenomenon.</span></p>  <p><span>Anran is a fire-wielding hero and the sister of the game’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>water-bending support hero Wuyang</span></a><span>. As such, she appeared in animated trailers, comics, and other lore before she was implemented into the game itself. Before her in-game appearance, she was depicted with a longer nose and sharper features, and overall had a distinct face compared to other characters on the roster. Now that we’ve seen her in the game itself, however, fans have pointed out that her face is much more round and her nose has been shrunken down to the same button nose Kiriko and Juno have.&nbsp;</span></p>

The team with the most players within the Control Zone earns points—the first team to reach 100 points wins the match. The variables in zone location and individual player tactics mean no match ever plays out the same.</p><p><strong>Persistent Cash <a title="Platforms > Meta [165 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta">Meta</a>game</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

From reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective. We don’t just encourage teamplay; we reward it. It’s the player’s choice how they want to play, earn and spend their profits.</p><p>Cash persists from match to match, so spending big on better gear, equipment, or a vehicle at the right time has the potential to turn the tide of battle and could yield massive returns.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1024429"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play Your Way</strong></p><p>You choose how you want to play and profit.</p><p>There’s no one way to play, earn and progress. Instead, <em>WARDOGS</em> gives players the freedom to take on the Control Zone in any number of ways. Whether you’re a lone wolf helping out your team or part of a dedicated squad, how you approach the battlefield is entirely up to you.</p><p>You could chase the “Hot Zone” to earn double the cash, purchase a ghillie suit and snipe from a distance, or ferry supplies to teammates by helicopter. Additionally, you could choose to fortify a strategic chokepoint by building your own forward operating base, or if you’re feeling destructive… man an artillery tank and rain down destruction on the enemy.</p><p>There are no set rules of engagement. It’s ultimately your choice how you want to approach the battlefield.</p><p><strong>Destruction and Base Building</strong></p><p>Bring the chaos to tactical warfare.</p><p>Destroy apartment blocks with rocket launchers or tear your way through towns in heavily armored tanks.

Conversely, strategize with your teammates to build upon and fortify key locations within the map for a tactical advantage.</p><p><strong>100 Percent Player-Driven Sandbox</strong></p><p>Every Moment in <em>WARDOGS</em> is 100 percent player driven and tied together with local voice chat to either talk tactics with teammates or troll enemy players. This is not another “<a title="Genres > Battle Royale [54 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/battle-royale">battle royale</a>.” This is not another “extraction shooter.” <em>WARDOGS</em> is a new Tactical take on the all-out warfare first-person shooter genre that rewards decision making, communication and teamwork—and allows you to play how you want within a modern militaristic setting.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>Just in time for the World Cup</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Konami had a pretty presence during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase. But Bomberman wasn't the only franchise making its appearance on Switch 2, as Konami announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/efootball-kick-off">eFootball: Kick-Off!</a>, which will be exclusive to Nintendo' newest console when it launches <strong>this summer</strong>.</p>
<p>Amazingly, this is the first time <strong>eFootball</strong> has appeared on a Nintendo console since it started in 2021, but the series has a much-bigger history. It's actually an evolution of Konami's iconic footy franchise, <strong>Pro Evolution Soccer,</strong> known as Winning Eleven in Japan.</p>
<p>And while this isn't the free-to-play mainline game, eFootball: Kick-Off! promises plenty of content, with a World Tour mode that allows you to create your own club and team, an International Cup mode (which is coming a DLC), Beginner-friendly modes, and local and online play.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game from Konami:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Game Modes &amp; Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>World Tour:</strong> Establish your own club team and compete in tournaments across the globe. Win matches to acquire players from defeated opponents or use currency earned through play to sign legendary footballers. Build your original team and aim to conquer the world.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>International Cup:</strong> The world’s most prestigious international competition returns once every four years. Take charge of your national team and compete on football’s grandest stage, where history is written and global supremacy is decided.<br>
<em>*The ‘International Cup’ mode is scheduled for release as additional downloadable content.</em></p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Beginner-Friendly Modes:</strong> Jump into fun and accessible experiences such as 6-on-6 football, designed to create fast-paced action and plenty of goal-scoring opportunities. The Rank system evaluates performance and allows players to naturally progress as they improve.</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Local &amp; Online Play:</strong> Enjoy matches anytime, anywhere, playing solo, challenge friends via local wireless, or test your skills against players worldwide in online competitions.</p>
<p>Built specifically for Nintendo Switch™ 2, eFootball™ Kick-Off! features responsive controls and pick-up-and-play gameplay that welcomes newcomers while still rewarding smart tactics and competitive mastery.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>As the eyes of the football world turn to North America this summer, Nintendo players can find their own path to victory. Big goals, dramatic moments, and pure football fun define this new chapter.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“It Can Be Now, It Can Be Later, But We’re Not Done With It”: MachineGames Will Make Wolfenstein 3, Eventually]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/it-can-be-now-it-can-be-later-but-were-not-done-with-it-machinegames-will-make-wolfenstein-3-eventually/</link>
            <guid>1427452</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Right now, there's a big air of mystery around <strong>MachineGames</strong>, and what its next project will be. The developer is mostly known for its take on the <strong>Wolfenstein</strong> series; its last game, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a></strong>, meant it took several years off from the Wolfenstein franchise to make a different kind of excellent Nazi-punching adventure.</p>



<p>But now that its treasure-hunting adventure is out, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-order-of-giants-dlc-is-a-bit-of-a-disappointment/">with its own DLC</a>, and will soon be <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-trio-of-bethesda-ports-are-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2026-fallout-4-indiana-jones-and-oblivion-remastered/">available on the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a>, the question once again becomes: what's next for MachineGames? Presumably, what's next is <strong>Wolfenstein 3</strong>, and in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/machinegames-on-being-part-of-microsoft-going-back-to-the-office-and-wolfenstein-3">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, MachineGames studio director, <strong>Jerk Gustafsson</strong>, reiterated that, yes, MachineGames will make Wolfenstein 3 one day, even if it's not the studio's next immediate project.</p>



<p>"<em>Our intention has always been to go back to Wolfenstein,</em>" Gustafsson says. "<em>We wanted to finish the trilogy. And when we do that, that is something that I don't want to comment on. <strong>It can be now, it can be later, but we're not done with it. That's what I can say</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>It's a similar sentiment Gustafsson has shared before. Last September, as part of a NoClip documentary digging into the making of Wolfenstein, Gustafsson confirmed that the studio has <a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-plans-for-third-wolfenstein-bj-blazkowicz-game-trilogy/">"<em>always seen this [Wolfenstein] as a trilogy</em>," adding that the studio has "<em>a story to tell</em>" for BJ Blazkowicz</a>.</p>



<p>And last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/machine-games-reportedly-has-wolfenstein-3-r6-siege-like-multiplayer-game-on-the-cards/">reports from Windows Central and Kotaku pointed to <strong>Wolfenstein 3 already being in development</strong></a>, though it's unclear what stage of development the game is in. Gustafsson's comments in this interview with GI.Biz are further evidence that the studio isn't done with Wolfenstein, but it does introduce the potential that the next game we see from MachineGames won't be the third entry in its mainline Wolfenstein series.</p>



<p>That said, it's still likely a game within the Wolfenstein franchise, especially if <strong>Microsoft</strong> and MachineGames want to try and line it up with the development of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein TV show currently in the works at <strong>Amazon MGM Studios</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Two years ago, a rumour appeared pointing to the studio making something that<a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-unannounced-game/"> was neither Indiana Jones nor the next entry in BJ Blazkowicz's story.</a> Its next project could be that rumoured game, if that game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/machinegames-might-have-canceled-an-unannounced-project/">wasn't the same one that was reportedly cancelled last year</a></strong>. </p>



<p>Hopefully, it's not too much longer before we learn what the studio is working on, even though it currently doesn't seem like the studio will have something ready for 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-schedule-halo-summer-kiln-april-new-controller/">if the rumours around what Xbox has planned for the year are true</a>.</p>

            <p>
Ah, live service games. You put out a new feature, everybody complains about one thing or another, you say something like "we've heard your feedback" and change it the next time around. This, almost word for word, is exactly what's happened with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' and its impending second Expedition, the details of which have been outlined in a handy blog post from developer Embark.
</p>
<p>
Expeditions, for the uninitiated, is essentially the extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> take on prestiging, essentially resetting yourself back to the beginning, with a few bonuses to make that reset less of a full-on one. That feedback that Embark have heard is related to how much it costs to set off on an Expedition. Those that chose to go through with the first Expedition needed five million coins from their stash value in order to do it, but now all you'll need is three million, and you'll still get five skill points as your reward.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, those that couldn't scrounge up the moolah to Expedition the first time around, there'll be a skill point catch up system allowing you to reclaim any you missed. "The catch up Skill Points will be heavily discounted, making the total Coins needed to reach max Skill Points less for each Expedition," the aforementioned <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">blog post</a> explains. "Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your Skill Points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time."
</p>
<p>
Those going on their first Expedition will also get the Patchwork outfit, while those on their second will get an evolved version of it with four additional toggles and colour options. Your stash spaces will also increase up to 24, and you can get up to five skill points. All of that is permanent, while some of the consecutive buffs include a 10% XP boost, a 12% scrappy materials boost, and a 70% repair value increase. Whether any of this is worth it or not still, that's up to you, but at least it's a bit cheaper now! Oh, and you'll be able to sign up to this expedition from February 25th, and will kick off March 1st. Happy Arc Raiding!

But when promoting two of the biggest third-party games coming to Switch, Nintendo has thrown that idea out the window, presumably to avoid sullying its family-friendly image with gory violence.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>During Thursday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999"><span>Nintendo Partner Direct</span></a><span>, Nintendo showed off </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</span></i><span>, two games headed to its new portable console in the next few months. What stood out most about these segments wasn’t the visual quality of the two blockbusters running on less powerful hardware, however, but how terrible whoever was capturing the footage was at playing the games.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666131"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666131">Bethesda</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The Direct’s trailers for both games were full of missed shots and poorly-timed attacks, as pointed out by former </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> EIC </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnrns2l"><span>Stephen Totilo</span></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j"><span>and others</span></a><span>. One shot from the </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer showed Leon Kennedy picking up a zombie’s chainsaw to fight off enemies only to miss and hit the railing on a bed, causing sparks to fly. Another shot from the </span><i><span>Great Circle </span></i><span>trailer showed Indiana Jones missing a boat full of Nazis and hitting the water below them instead.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The </span><i><span>Requiem </span></i><span>trailer is especially funny to watch—the narrator raves about Leon’s “physical prowess” and how “he can fire from a distance using handguns and rifles” over clips of him missing shots by literal feet. Compared to </span><a href="https://youtu.be/T54OWinnymM?si=L4rujiQUA9nYDYd2"><span>a recent Capcom trailer for <em>Requiem</em></span></a><span>, which has no problem showing some pretty graphic stuff, it seems clear Nintendo went out of its way to hide the violence in its latest showcase.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000666132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666132"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666132">Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Nintendo hasn’t been very keen on showing violence in previous Directs, either. When it announced a Switch port of </span><i><span>The Witcher 3 </span></i><span>during its </span><a href="https://youtu.be/Zr9eAtwcYlo?si=zAk1fiwKEOnXWZTo"><span>Direct at E3 2019</span></a><span>, it edited out a clip of the game’s notorious hanging tree that </span><a href="https://youtu.be/BAC-jqZTCv8?si=b_IcTCmAfUTeP4lj"><span>was shown in online uploads of the trailer in some regions</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other trailers for more violent games that have been ported onto Nintendo systems, like </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijqVBkgZ79Y&amp;pp=ygUaY3liZXJwdW5rIHN3aXRjaCAyIHRyYWlsZXI%3D"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span>, have received more atmospheric trailers that avoid showing gameplay. Some trailers haven’t been shown at all. The </span><a href="https://youtu.be/ztMGTTAjsAQ?si=PSgtM6Au08YQdbM1"><span>2017 Direct announcement</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Wolfenstein 2</span></i><span>, a shooter about murdering tons of Nazis, lacked a trailer entirely and was revealed only with a still image of key art. And, during the same Direct, gameplay for </span><i><span>Doom </span></i><span>featured more apparently intentionally bad gameplay, clips in which the player fires off to the side of enemies without landing any hits alongside one shot where the player is about to be attacked and…does nothing at all.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666133" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666133"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666133">CD Projekt Red</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Contrast that with how the developers themselves sometimes show their games being played on Nintendo’s consoles. </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN7VJ1zec0g"><span>Here’s a CD Projekt Red trailer</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2: Ultimate Edition</span></i><span> showing off Joy-Con motion controls. It shows a woman mimicking the real-life hand gesture to throw a grenade whose explosion proceeds to decapitate the enemy on screen. Later she frantically slashes the air to slice through enemies with a katana. No one in the video misses a single kill and they’re all smiling while they do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Putting smiles on players’ faces is Nintendo’s corporate mission, but not with bullets and blood, apparently, at least when the Nintendo Direct cameras are rolling. We don’t have confirmation from Nintendo that it’s an intentional policy, but it’s certainly a recurring theme. However, it’s clear that Nintendo at least has a complicated relationship with the trailers for M-rated games, more of which are getting ported to Switch 2 every day.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While today was certainly an embarrassing day for poor Leon Kennedy, as a big gamer who could definitely be a </span><i><span>better </span></i><span>gamer myself, I at least felt a little represented by the horrible gameplay shown off.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>For over a year, buying booster packs of <em>Pokémon</em> cards on the official Pokémon Center website has required either the most extraordinary luck, or a bot. When new stock is added to the site, it very quickly collapses under the weight of incoming traffic, leading to error messages or queues that never resolve. Any who do manage to get in before the site goes down are limited by strict purchase restrictions, except of course for those running the bots that are able to scoop up the stock in milliseconds. So was today’s peculiar decision to bundle the enormously popular Surging Sparks booster boxes with the never-wanted and very bulky Pokémon Academy boxes a deliberate troll of the scalpers by The Pokémon Company?</p> <p>Surging Sparks is the set that’s generally considered to be the beginning of the current frenzy that’s seen <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-magic-the-gathering-scalpers-cards-2000632017">Pokémon cards become almost impossible to buy</a> for the last 15 months, where rocketing resale prices have led to scalping ruining the hobby for so many, and indeed <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666">strings</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233">robberies</a> at <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652">many specialist retailers</a> around the world. Its <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/BUNDLE1157/scarlet-and-violet-surging-sparks-booster-display-box-and-battle-academy-bundle">restock today on the U.S. Pokémon Center website</a> was therefore something of a surprise—occurring without promotion and of course inevitably selling out before most were aware it was even happening. Except, rather than these 36-pack containers appearing for the usual price of around $160, today’s booster boxes were all bundled with the latest edition of the Battle Academy, a hefty $20 box that’s designed to introduce new players to the table-top card game, and all for the undiscounted price of $180.</p>

 <p>If you’re already familiar with the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, you’ve likely already snorted a laugh at this. For everyone else, it’s important to know that the Battle Academy is to <em>Pokémon</em> cards what the Fisher Price telephone is to the iPhone. It contains a chunky playing board, push-out cardboard counters, and three 60-card decks with special, numbered cards that don’t feature the standard <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>card back designs, nor even a single holo among them. Even better, the Battle Academy hasn’t been updated in so many years that they still sport the late 2010’s Pokémon V cards. They are, in the scheme of collecting, worthless.</p> <p>This has to be a troll, right? While it won’t have cost any more in shipping (the Pokémon Center is unreasonably good on this, waiving shipping costs for purchases over $20), it’s going to be such an epic pain in the ass for the scalpers, as their every shipment arrives with this enormous extra box of stuff they don’t want or need, and most of all, cannot resell. It’s an extra $20 too, which is just enjoyably inconvenient.</p>

 <p>You could argue that this is also screwing over legitimate customers, and that’s sadly true. However, for independent card stores being repeatedly let down by The Pokémon Company’s official retail suppliers (according to multiple store owners I’ve spoken to in the UK since stock shortages began, the company is allegedly prioritizing larger retail chains over them) it’s a fantastic deal, given they can also sell the Battle Academy boxes to their younger customers.</p>

 <p>It’d be far better to see the Pokémon Center website actually spending the money to build an infrastructure that can cope when it stocks new TCG cards, but in the meantime, if this really was a way to just irritate scalpers, it’s hard not to give over a little kudos.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new island just came to Fortnite that features a digital reimagining of Qatar’s capital city, Doha, as well as Hamad International Airport and a Qatar Airways aircraft. Called QVerse Island, it’s meant to give travelers an immersive way to experience the sights of the city and its airport. There are lots of minigames, a glimpse at some of the city’s unique architecture, and a hidden golden ticket that you can find for a chance to win a free Qatar Airways flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can reach QVerse Island within Fortnite by searching for “QVerse” or using code 6020-0265-6735. When you arrive on the island, you’ll pull up to Hamad International Airport and get a look at the skyline of Doha with re-creations of its real-life skyscrapers. You’ll be greeted by Sama, Qatar Airways’ digital cabin crew member, who will give you five quests to complete.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-5-1765238045451.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After you’ve talked to her, you’re free to explore the city and do things in whatever order you choose. Right off the bat, you’ll see floating coins that give you 10 gold each. You can spend that gold at the airport vending machines for things like faster running speed, a jetpack that lets you double jump, or consumable items. You can also look for a hidden door that takes you inside the Business Class cabin of a Qatar Airways aircraft, where you’ll join other Fortnite characters as passengers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you exit the airport and make your way to the street, you’ll see you can summon a car with one button press, making traversal of the city quick and easy. Your HUD will have icons for the island’s biggest attractions, which is also where you can complete the quests Sama gave you. These are some of real-life Qatar’s most recognizable landmarks, like the National Museum of Qatar, West Bay, Katara Towers, and The Pearl Island. And QVerse Island has a persistent day/night cycle, so you can watch the sunset around these locations and see the whole city light up at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-4-1765238079743.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Each location has a minigame associated with it. At the National Museum of Qatar, you’re given a scavenger hunt to find five lost artifacts that lie scattered around the city. At West Bay, you can use your summoned car to complete a time trial race. At Katara Towers, you’ll need to cross between the towers, high in the air, while a rotating bar tries to knock you off. And at The Pearl Island, you can take on a parkour obstacle course that runs across the rooftops of the city.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you’re exploring, you’ll notice a timer counting down to the next departure. Once the countdown finishes, you’ll be transported to a multiplayer minigame with other people currently on the island. There are four minigames in all: Wild Wheels Safari, Neon City Drop, Jumpus Maximus, and Home Run Rush. For all four, the last person standing wins.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/qverse-island-2-1765238121119.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Wild Wheels Safari, you drive cars around a desert arena while floor tiles gradually fall away. If you fall into a hole, you’re eliminated. Neon City Drop is a similar concept, but you’re on foot and the floor is made up of brightly colored panels that fall away over time. Jumpus Maximus puts you on a giant spinning wheel in the air while rotating bars of different heights try to knock you off. And Home Run Rush gives everyone a superpowered baseball bat that can launch other players out of the stadium.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In between all the fun and games, you can explore QVerse Island to find the golden ticket. You’ll get an on-screen alert letting you know in what area of the map it just spawned, and then it’s up to you to find it. It only stays in one place for a few minutes, so you need to hurry before it moves again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you find it, take a screenshot of your in-game character with it. Then post that photo to Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter with the hashtag #FlyWithQR, follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/qatarairways/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Qatar Airways on Instagram</a>, and you’ll be entered in a drawing. A winning entry will be randomly selected, and that person will win a Qatar Airways flight ticket. There will be a new drawing each week and the contest will run for 10 weeks. If you don’t win one week, you can try again the next.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/12398-fortnite-add-logos-to-images14-1769625524256.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">QVerse Island is available to explore now, and between February 7–20, gaming content creators around the world will join in on the fun, too. So be sure to check that out. Who knows who you’ll get to face off against in all those minigames? To keep up with the latest news and updates from Qatar Airways, you can follow them on Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-fortnite-island-created-by-qatar-airways-gives-you-a-chance-to-win-weekly-flight-tickets]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1427428</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Odds are, if Mouse: P.I. for Hire caught your eye, it's because of its unique, hand-drawn, black-and-white 1930s-era "rubber hose" animation style. But it's aiming to be a lot more than just a pretty face. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mouse-pi-for-hire-might-fill-the-animated-void-cuphead-left-behind">We played Mouse last year</a> – and we'll be doing so again as part of this month's exclusive IGN First coverage – but today we're taking a deeper dive into its wild cartoon arsenal and its boomer shooter-inspired combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers at Fumi Games told us, "The core combat gameplay revolves around an 'Always Be Moving' approach, encouraging players to stay constantly on the move to survive." Complicating that will be environmental hazards, like freeze, turpentine, fire, and explosive barrels that can either be used against you or used by you. But ammo and health are scattered about, encouraging further exploration of the environment. And you won't be a tank; just a few hits can put hero Jack Pepper in a serious world of hurt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, an assortment of core abilities and unlockable ones will help you Always Be Moving, such as a slide, dash, double jump, pipe crawl, kick, wall run, and wall climb – along with your multipurpose tail that, over the course of the campaign, can be used for lockpicking, helicoptering, and as a grappling hook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Power-ups, too, will spice up the moment-to-moment gameplay, like Spinach (think: Popeye), Coffee (activates Cuphead-like finger guns that shoot rapidly), Chili Peppers (damage bonus + rate of fire bonus + fire damage), and Cheese (health powerup that can be activated anytime you want).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire - Weapon Gifs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let's get to the stars of the combat show: the weapons (See a bunch of them in the gif gallery above). There are a whopping eleven of them, starting with your fists if you run out of ammo – but you'll probably never use them if given any other choice. Moving up from there, the Micer pistol is what you'd expect, though it does have a burst-shot alt-fire. Your Boomstick, meanwhile, packs a short-range punch – with a hold charge/pump fire as an alt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get more interesting and unique with the Devarnisher, which melts the skin off your foes, Roger Rabbit-style, courtesy of the balls of turpentine it fires. Its alt-fire is a larger blob that explodes to affect more enemies. The James Gun is a Tommy gun that stops enemies from attacking and has a spray fire for an alt. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Kiss Kiss is a double-barrelled shotgun that adds fire damage thanks to its exploding shells. The alt fire on this one is a larger, area-of-effect explosion. The Loose Cannon, meanwhile, really leans into Mouse's cartoon framework; it's a literal cannon like you'd find on a pirate ship that has knockback effects as well as doing big damage. In alt-fire mode it launches a charged-up burst shot. The Jar Head, on the other hand, fires waves of psionic power that stun and eventually kill enemies – and it carries an AoE. Its beam-attack alt is particularly potent if you aim at the opponent's head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last of the arsenal starts with the Portable Freezer, firing a cold beam that slows and eventually freezes foes in their tracks, allowing you to shatter them. The alt-fire spits speedy snowballs. I'm eager to try the Hellrazor, a chainsaw that pummels enemies with fire damage if they get hit with the wave. Its alt-fire is a traditional chainsaw that you do not want to be caught on the business end of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, the D-namite can take out certain walls and floors in addition to blasting the bad guys to bits.  All told, I'm eager to try out all of these toys. Circle March 19 on your calendar, as that's when Mouse: P.I. for Hire will be released on PC, PlayStation platforms, Xbox platforms, and Nintendo Switch platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Closed beta end of February.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony has finally announced Guerrilla’s Horizon live service multiplayer game, Horizon Hunters Gathering. It’s due out for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A “small-scale” closed playtest is due at the end of February, which you can sign up for via the PlayStation Beta Program. Expect crossplay and cross-progression. There's no release date yet, nor is there word on whether it's free-to-play or a premium game. The debut trailer, which includes gameplay, is below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can see from the trailer and screenshots, Horizon Hunters Gathering has a cartooney art style, which is in contrast to the photrealistic visuals of the mainline Horizon series. Clearly, Sony and Guerrilla are trying to create a more lighthearted experience with Hunters Gathering, with the Zero Dawn and Forbidden West more serious offerings. There are strong Monster Hunter vibes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>, game director Arjan Bak said that in Horizon Hunters Gathering, you fight deadly machines in tactical three-player co-op action and adapt your Hunter for intense missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play," Bak said. "The foundation of Horizon Hunters Gathering centers around challenging and replayable hunts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bak confirmed two game modes: Machine Incursion, which is described as "a high-intensity mission" where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a "formidable boss"; and Cauldron Descent, a longer, multi-stage trial in which "ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them." Both modes wil be available in the upcoming closed playtest.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a roster of Hunters to play as, each with distinct melee or ranged playstyles and weapons. Bak said there's also a rogue-lite perk system to craft the build you want. Story wise, there's a narrative campaign "which will introduce new mysteries, characters, and threats, but we’re keeping it under wraps for now," Bak said. "What we can say is that Hunters Gathering is fully canon and its story doesn’t stop at launch!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The social hub is the name of the game: Hunters Gathering. It's "a vibrant social hub where players can connect, prepare, and celebrate victories together. Here, you can customize your Hunters, visit vendors, upgrade gear, and team up for your next adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horizon Hunters Gathering isn't the only multiplayer game set in the Horizon universe. Bizarrely, NCSoft and Sony are working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-steel-frontiers-interview-with-ncsoft-is-aloy-in-the-game-how-will-it-work-on-pc-and-what-about-those-stylized-characters">Horizon Steel Frontiers</a>, a massively multiplayer online role-playing game designed for mobile devices, but also playable on PC. NCSoft is said to be working closely with Guerrilla to craft the world, but this is very much an NCSoft-developed game. Horizon 3, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">was in late 2024 described as being "a ways off."</a> Sony is said to be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-action-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-has-a-working-script-sonys-release-plans-revealed-in-new-court-document">aiming to start filming its live-action Horizon Zero Dawn movie this year</a>, with a release at some point in 2027.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>It's a free upgrade for Switch 1 owners</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Gameloft's smash hit Disney life sim, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/disney_dreamlight_valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, is getting a native <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disney-dreamlight-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> on 25th March 2026.</p>
<p>The game briefly popped up during today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase as part of the sizzle reel, confirming the tease that the developer dropped <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-disney-dreamlight-valley-is-getting-a-switch-2-version">last summer</a> along with a date.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/NintendoSwitchUpdate2026">blog post</a>, Gameloft shared some Switch 2 gameplay footage, featuring a character walking through the Valley and doing a bit of decorating.</p>
<p>In the post, the developer detailed that the game will feel "smoother and easier to enjoy" on the newer console. Improvements come in the form of better frame rates, higher resolution, faster load times, and a much higher item limit of 6,000.</p>
<p>Plus, if you already own the game on Switch, the upgrade will be completely free. That's pretty handy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-new-live-service-game-is-coming-at-just-the-worst-possible-time-2000666078</link>
            <guid>1427368</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Earlier today, PlayStation and Guerrilla revealed </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">Horizon Hunters Gathering</a>,</em> the next entry in the popular post-apocalyptic franchise. But this spin-off is a multiplayer-focused online co-op action game that looks a lot like<em> Monster Hunter</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>. It will receive updates post-launch, and oh, wait, this is a live-service game. Oh no, this was a bad time to announce <em>Hunters Gathering</em>.</p> <p>I’m not sure a colorful, cartoonish online-only spin-off of the photorealistic solo single-player open-world series <em>Horizon</em> would have been a smash hit with terminally online fans at any point. But right now, of all times, feels one of the worst possible moments to reveal <em>Hunters Gathering</em> to a world wide web primed to make a Kombucha Girl face at everything it’s doing. The last two years have been littered with the corpses of failed, cancelled, or still-dying live-service games. A lot of players are, understandably, tired of these things and unsure of whether they should even invest any time into caring, as so many seem to flop or shut down.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The hunt is on.</p> <p>Step into the world of Horizon Hunters Gathering, a new co-op action game from Guerrilla coming to PS5 and PC: <a href="https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q">https://t.co/TNWH4oRX2Q</a> <a href="https://t.co/BCjSquv30R">pic.twitter.com/BCjSquv30R</a></p> <p>— PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/2019425896008974566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was just last month that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> launched and <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">was then immediately trashed</a> by a large portion of players. The live-service PvP shooter debuted at the Game Awards, launched with over 90k active players on Steam, and now, less than two weeks after launch, is struggling to reach 5,000 players and is nowhere to be seen on any of my social feeds. Before that, <em>Concord</em>, a previous attempt by Sony to make a live-service game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">infamously crashed and burned in less than two weeks</a>. <em>Marathon</em>, the next game from PlayStation-owned Bungie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">has had a very rocky rollout</a> ever since it confirmed it was an online-only live-service experience, making me nervous about its future even as sentiment online seems to be slowly rebounding in its favor.</p> <p>There are so many more live-service games that seem to be struggling to exist in an era when most people are just playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352"><em>Roblox, Fortnite, GTA Online, </em>or <em>DOTA 2</em> forever</a>. As reported by <em>TheGamer,</em> <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/2025-live-service-games-player-analysis/">many of the live-service games launched in 2025 have lost most of their players</a>, according to SteamDB. And while there are a few recent exceptions, like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it is really, really hard to break into the market and stay around. Even brief bright spots, like last year’s mini-breakout MOBA <em>Supervine</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/moba/another-moba-gives-up-supervive-developed-by-former-riot-devs-is-closing-in-february-just-7-months-after-it-launched/">eventually lose steam</a>.</p>

 <p>All of these attempts to carve out a sustainable multiplayer niche over the last two years have whittled down players’ patience. At this point, every live-service multiplayer thing gets dunked on relentlessly the moment it’s announced. Sure, some of that negativity is just assholes drafting off the “hate everything” digital ecosystems on TikTok and YouTube. But a lot of it is also just people tired of more games that ask a ton of their players without first earning it, only to eventually pay it back with a shutdown notice screenshot on social media.</p>

 <p>This is the environment that Sony has announced <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> into, and it shouldn’t shock anyone that a lot of the reactions to the game are people saying they have zero interest or actively calling it bad. Can you blame them? The last two years have shown that live-service games are prone to failure, likely to collapse shortly after launch, and not worth checking out if you already play one or two of them, like <em>Fortnite</em>. Maybe that’s why they slipped it out in a PlayStation Blog post instead of a proper State of Play showcase.</p> <p>So, while I think <em>Hunters Gathering</em> looks neat and could be fun, I’m well aware that one day I’ll likely be writing a story about how it’s no longer getting updates and is shutting off the in-game microtransaction shop. You’ll read that headline on X or Reddit, go “Oh right, that game…” and then just keep scrolling by. It’s hard to get too excited about a new game, even from a PlayStation studio, when that fate already feels sealed. Maybe especially from a PlayStation studio.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo’s Trailers Of Violent Games Are Full Of (Purposefully?) Missed Shots]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/</link>
            <guid>1427365</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>There was a Nintendo Partner Direct this morning, full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Switch ports and Bethesda games</u></a> and starting with an intensely soothing preroll of puzzle pieces slotting into grooves that I could have watched for hours. There were also trailers for some fairly violent games, <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, that looked a lot less violent in the hands of whoever was controlling them for their Switch trailers.&nbsp;</p><p>Viewers on social media were swift to point out that in the gameplay for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7DTMmld4Wzs&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Requiem</u></em></a>, protagonist Leon Kennedy misses all of his gunshots against the game’s enemies, even though the enemies are close enough to be basically impossible to miss. In a scene where Leon wields a sniper rifle, even accounting for enemy movement, his shot isn’t remotely close. (As someone who is shit at sniper rifles in games, I have sympathy here, but come on.) In potentially gory moments of close combat, Leon swings a chainsaw basically into thin air; in others, the trailer cuts away before an axe can connect with an enemy’s head.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/app.bsky.feed.post/3me4ntqnrns2l" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigmitjj4vpp32xqn5gvaxhwd6ir6c7q7p2qtrxtw3nmk7aky2iwpy"><p lang="en">Usually, video game trailers that show gameplay show successful gameplay, because presumably that's what sells

But, I guess to tamp down on depictions of gory violence, the Resident Evil Requiem footage in today's Nintendo Direct showed some missed attacks. 

Frankly, it made it feel more authentic</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Stephen Totilo (@stephentotilo.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3me4ntqnrns2l?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-05T15:01:43.867Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Similarly, in an <em>Indiana Jones</em> trailer, Indy notably fires a gun nowhere near some other boats as he races by them:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BV3H__rdMw4?start=45&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 2.5.2026"></iframe></figure><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1qwkonv/comment/o3qa7lb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><u>Some</u></a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/apzonerunner.com/post/3me4mfg3mak2j?ref=aftermath.site"><u>viewers</u></a> suggest this is due to Nintendo trying to avoid too much violence in its Directs, with Game File’s Stephen Totilo highlighting <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3me4ntqnwk22l?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a different version of the Resident Evil trailer</u></a> that shows Leon having a much better go of things. We’ve reached out to Nintendo for more information and will update this piece if we receive a reply.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a funny thing, something I didn’t notice until it was pointed out, and it’s led me down a rabbithole about whether other Switch trailers are like this. There are plenty of regular Switch trailers, not part of presentations, that don’t seem to have this issue. For instance, a Switch 2 trailer for the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8kPSGj7dqY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>Squirrel With A Gun</em> </u></a>very much features a squirrel shooting a human with a gun, and there is a predictably gory<em> Doom </em>trailer for Switch in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lRpoGucGA0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2018</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But other <em>Doom</em> trailers go differently: In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpKEWIRwoxM&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bethesda’s 2021 trailer </u></a>for <em>Doom Eternal: The Ancient Gods Part One </em>on Switch, there’s a moment early on where Doomguy shoots an enemy:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p>But in the same trailer for Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ggPNp1vbnY&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>2021 E3</u></a> presentation, he misses:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>Likewise, there's a later violent moment in the Bethesda trailer--</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Bethesda version</span></figcaption></figure><p> --which is replaced with non-violent navigation and a much tamer fight in the Nintendo version:</p><figure><figcaption><span>The Nintendo version</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don’t think I’ve uncovered some huge revelation here, just something I’ve never noticed about trailers in Nintendo presentations. These tweaks certainly makes sense for <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-super-nintendo-keza-macdonald/" rel="noreferrer">Nintendo’s image</a>, especially in a presentation with multiple games that would invite a broad age range of audiences. Still, it feels a little bit like Nintendo trying to have its cake and eat it too. If you’re putting a violent game on the Switch, there’s not really any getting around that it’s violent, and dealing with it by just having someone be really bad at shooting feels like a half-measure.</p><p>In the case of today’s <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, the whole thing was so laughably obvious that it drew attention to the ostensible strategy, which is now going to gnaw at me in every subsequent Direct. If you are the person <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker/" rel="noreferrer">tasked</a> with missing all your shots in Nintendo trailers, please get in touch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Players Can Prepare for the Second Expedition With a New Catch-Up Mechanic and Lowered Stash Value Requirements]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-players-can-prepare-for-the-second-expedition-with-a-new-catch-up-mechanic-and-lowered-stash-value-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1427359</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>One mechanic that <strong>Embark Studios</strong> uses to keep players engaged in <strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is the game's <strong>Expeditions</strong>, which are essentially a big reset for your Raider. Things like your Workshop, player level, skill points, blueprints, coins, quests, and stash upgrade progress all get reset, letting you start again with new rewards and buffs to make your next round of Topside visits all the more intriguing.</p>



<p>What makes Expeditions interesting to complete (<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">and what helps keep players logging onto ARC Raiders each day</a>) is that you have a limited amount of time to prepare for them, with Expeditions running on a tight, 60-day schedule, as you prepare the necessary resources to embark on one. Players will be able to head out on the game's first Expedition since it launched on <strong>March 1, 2026,</strong> with the deadline to sign up for it being <strong>February 25, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Ahead of that, and ahead of the game's second Expedition, Embark has introduced a couple of changes to get players better prepared for the endeavour. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ARCRaiders_Expeditions-Infographic.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Embark Studios</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first major change comes directly from player feedback. After hearing from players that the required Stash value for the maximum amount of rewards was too high, Embark has decided to lower it. The required value for maximum rewards is now <strong>3 million coins</strong> <strong>(600K per skill point)</strong>. Players will still get five skill points for reaching the 3 million Stash value mark.</p>



<p>The second major change is the introduction of a new <strong>catch-up mechanic</strong> meant specifically for Raiders who were not able to obtain enough coins during the first Expedition period. This mechanic lets Raiders reclaim the skill points they missed, with catch-up skill points being heavily discounted. "<em>Amass the entire Stash value and enjoy your skill points before everyone else, fail to do so and the catch-up system will allow you to close the gap over time</em>," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">a blog post on the game's official website reads</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>For this Expedition, you will need to gather 300K Stash value per skill point missing from the first Expedition. When departing, coins will contribute to the skill points of the second Expedition, before contributing to missing skill points from the first one</em>."</p>



<p>If you're participating in the Expedition for the first time with the start of the second Expedition next month, then you'll also be able to get the rewards from the first Expedition. The rewards for the second Expediton are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Evolved Patchwork outfit (permanent)</li>



<li>Scrappy cosmetics (permanent)</li>



<li>Expedition Indicator Icon (permanent)</li>



<li>24 Stash Spaces (permanent) </li>



<li>+0-5 skill points (permanent) </li>



<li>5-10% XP boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>6-12% Scrappy materials boost (consecutive)</li>



<li>60-70% repair value increase (consecutive)</li>
</ul>

Both of them look like cheap wedding cake toppers. Amiibos typically feature more stylized characters like most of Nintendo’s heroes, so they don’t often have to be very detailed. </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>, however, is a photorealistic game that would lend itself to a more detailed statue. These figures’ faces are so generic-looking that if it weren’t for Leon’s distinctive swooping hair, I probably would have a hard time identifying him. And trust me, I’ve looked at his face extensively for decades. Where is his old man scruff?</span></p>

 <p><span>“Reading the comments I feel like I’m taking crazy pills, but I must admit I’m not familiar with Amiibo and their usual quality,” Nexxtic wrote on </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qwmppb/nintendo_just_revealed_amiibo_for_both_grace_and/"><span>Reddit</span></a><span>. “Are they always this… rough? I think these look pretty bad, especially Leon. Like one of those bad Switch ports.”</span></p> <p><span>“Grace seems nice, Leon a little less so,” wrote AdResponsible5888.</span></p> <p><span>If nothing else, the existence of a Leon amiibo—a goofy looking one at that—means we get good jokes. Even if a lot of them have the same punchline.</span></p>   <p><span>Hopefully these aren’t the expensive $40+ amiibo, and are in the $15-20 range. They’re both coming out after </span><i><span>Requiem</span></i><span>’s launch, with the game itself arriving later this month on February 27 and both figures launching in the summer.</span></p>
