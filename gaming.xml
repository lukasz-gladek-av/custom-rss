<figure><a title="Weaponlord - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/889e99b0841d6/weaponlord-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Welcome back to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Brawl</a>, my friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-weaponlord-snes">Last week</a>, North America and Europe duked it out over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/weaponlord">Weaponlord</a> on the Super NES, with NA giving their EU PALs a good wholloping and taking home 85% of the vote.</p>
<p>Today, we're looking back at Rare's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/blast_corps">Blast Corps</a>, a delightful piece of nonsense from Twycross' 64-bit masters which saw you destroying everything in the path of a trundling warhead to prevent a catastrophic explosion. What can we say? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Bananza</a>'s got us in the mood for smashing stuff to smithereens.</p>
<p>It's a duel this week, as the European version was just the NA version with the customary black border. After checking out the options, drop your vote in the poll at the bottom of the page and we'll see whether East or West is best when it comes to the ol' smashy-smashy.</p>
<p>Let's get blasting.</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Blast Corps - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/053855f056548/blast-corps-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Western variant. shows J-Bomb standing atop Backlash with the bike (Ballista) in the bottom right corner, behind which the big red bomb-laden carrier is seen approaching.</p>
<p>The puddle at the bottom, the flying bricks, and the fiery billows from the collapsing building offer some visual interest and help distract from the blocky nature of the render. The logo in the top right feels a bit generic and the red stencilled 'BLAST' gets a bit lost on top of the radiation symbol, but despite being a bit disparate, we can't help up like this.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure><a title="Blastdozer - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/25f46a6a47771/blastdozer-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Microsoft / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Whether you prefer the Japanese or North American cover, we can all agree that <strong>Blastdozer</strong> is just a better name, if only because there's zero confusion over the pronunciation and you're unlikely to provoke laughs in the playground when you tell your pals that Blast 'Corpse' looks amazing, instigating months of merciless ribbing.</p>
<p>Ahem. Looking at the cover, there's a lot to love. Cool mechs and big vehicles? Check. Explosions? Natch. Big red slogan slapped right over the centre? Boom. In honesty, 'BLAST 'EM ALL!' isn't the most riveting line, but we admire the bombast of putting it right in the centre of the blast, exactly where a less confident game would slap the logo.</p>
<p>And that logo at the bottom is a winner, too, boldly mixing the blue-tinged steel plating with the yellow and black warning barrier behind. We're not quite sure that that red, ticker-tape thing around the border is supposed to be, but we think we like it.</p>
<hr>

<p><em>Thanks for voting! Remember that this one is part of the Switch Online Expansion Pack library, so if you missed it back in *checks notes*...1997...*has a moment*, you can easily catch up with this winner.</em></p>
<p><em>Otherwise, we'll see you next time for another Box Art Brawl.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-new-gameplay-s-party-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This week, Chinese developer S-GAME hosted S-PARTY 2025, a two-day event in Beijing during which fans could get hands-on with the highly anticipated Phantom Blade Zero. IGN India has posted a 22-minute gameplay video from this new demo that shows some hidden boss fights, secret item discoveries, and new weapons. We've embedded it below.</p>



<p>Phantom Blade Zero is undoubtedly one of the most eagerly awaited games in the action RPG/Soulslike genre, although as you might recall, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stressed</a> that it is not to be considered a pure Soulslike game.</p>



<p>Last month, S-GAME CEO Soulframe <a href="https://x.com/pbzero_official/status/1937262120418312391" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clarified</a> exactly what he thinks the game is:</p>



<p><em>Phantom Blade Zero is neither a Soulslike game nor a traditional action game. I've always admired the creators who defined these genres. I spent years immersed in their work, drawing inspiration and learning from their brilliance. But in the process of making this game, we stumbled onto a path we never expected:<br>At first, we just wanted to make a game that brought 'hack and slash' Into a multi layered map. But once the animations and environmental assets came together, everything was "stitched together" by a strong cultural aesthetic — creating something that felt deeply familiar to us, yet is rarely seen or experienced in games.</em></p>



<p><em>Broadly speaking, it falls under the category of ARPGs. But more specifically, maybe it could create a new identity that is Wuxia Action Games? Because here you'll get to experience:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Leaping across rooftops under a rain of arrows; </em></li>



<li><em>Fighting off pursuers atop a speeding carriage;</em></li>



<li><em>Uncovering the truth behind an incident that shocked the world years ago; </em></li>



<li><em>And even more iconic cinema moments.</em></li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>Soulframe also added that Phantom Blade Zero will feature three difficulty settings (Wayfarer, Gamechanger, and Hellwalker, although the latter is only unlocked for a second playthrough with New Game+), unlike traditional Soulslike titles.</p>



<p>The game still has no release window, but we might learn more at Gamescom, where S-GAME is set to bring a large presence with a massive 500 m² booth in Hall 6 (B-050G) featuring over 60 demo stations. The demo is said to be the most comprehensive shared publicly to date, a full 1-hour playable experience featuring all-new boss battles, striking level design, immersive storytelling, and visceral blade-to-blade combat.</p>



<p>We'll be at Gamescom and look forward to checking out the new demo after <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-brutally-engaging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting on last year's Phantom Blade Zero hands-on</a>.</p>

<p>It’s time for the Edge of Eternities pre-release and with having gotten a chance to try out some limited play of the set in the MTG Arena creator event I can share some insights that might just help you win your&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em>&nbsp;pre-release... or know a bit more about the set, which we've been learning more about ever since the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/mtg-edge-of-eternities-preview-cards-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" MTG Edge of Eternities Preview Cards Revealed"><em>Edge of Eternities&nbsp;</em>preview </a>only a few weeks ago</p>

<p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/151/pain-for-all" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pain for All"><strong>Pain for All</strong></a></p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pain-for-all1.jpg?itok=LB0zz8Vs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pain-for-all1.jpg?itok=KEWUdFIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is a premium removal spell, and it plays really well in practice as well. On the surface, it is a relatively rare red ‘bite’ spell dealing damage equal to the power of your creature to an opponents, but there’s a lot more to this one. First of all, unlike other bite spells, Pain for All can also burn your opponent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bigger and second of all, it also gives a ‘<a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/875/stuffy-doll" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stuffy Doll">Stuffy Doll</a>’ effect to the creature, meaning that when it’s dealt damage it deals damage to your opponents. With limited often involving a lot of fights, and the set has a higher number of high toughness creatures (16 commons, and 19 uncommons with more toughness than power) provoking ground stalls you can exploit with Pain for All.</p>

Being able to warp this on turn 2 helps ensure that you have a land drop in the future, and holding onto it a little can trigger Void abilities that you have. While a 3/2 Flying for 5 is a bit undersized, when it comes with having fetched a pair of cards it becomes quite good. The Shepherd gets even better if you have a strong 1 drop that it can fetch as well, with the best option in the set being <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/eoe/159/rust-harvester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Rust Harvester">Rust Harvester</a>.</p>

But, Edge of Eternities is not most sets, and there are even more enters abilties then normal with Warp, as those creatures come in doing something then more often than not, and there are 62 creatures with ‘enters’ abilities.&nbsp;</p>

With the format being slower and more defensive, it feels like there is time for spacecrafts to be stationed, meaning the 3/2 flying lifelink body here can be quite useful.</p>

Without flying, Mm’menon would be still quite playable given the density of artifacts, with it, it can become a menace, to the degree it made my top 10 of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/Ranking%20All%20The%20MTG%20Edge%20of%20Eternities%20Commanders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-new-commanders-in-mtg-edge-of-eternities">best commanders in&nbsp;<em>Edge of Eternities</em></a>.</p>

The price is enough that I don’t think you can quite cut land over it, but in green with a couple of lander creators, you can splash a color quite easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the lander makers, Seedship Agrarian is one of the best, as while its 4 mana, it makes a lander each time it’s tapped – making it perfect for stationing spacecrafts. Additionally, it grows whenever a land enters, something you’ll be doing a lot with this scientist working for you.</p>

The air in <em>Edge of Eternities </em>come the late game can come to be occupied by some bigger creatures when certain spacecrafts get fully operational, but Skystinger for his humble 3 mana is able to take on almost all comers in the air.</p>

Annul is one of the most efficient pieces of artifact removal because it can do it for 1 mana as long as you keep the mana up – something players should be aware of also when facing blue decks. It’s worth running at least one or two pieces of artifact hate in your deck if you get it, though most of it is in red and green.</p>

		<p>“The story of killing Nazis is evergreen,” is the somewhat eyebrow-raising tag line for Amazon MGM’s next video game adaptation, Wolfenstein. Patrick Somerville, writer of the excellent The Leftovers, will be rather busy as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner.&nbsp; Wolfenstein developer MachineGames will also be on hand as Executive Producers. although that title is rather honorific and does not necessarily mean they will have input.</p>
<p>This is not the first time someone has tried to adapt the franchise, in 2012, movie producer&nbsp;Samuel Hadida announced a film based on the games&nbsp;with&nbsp;Roger Avary, writer of Pulp Fiction, attached to write and direct.</p>


<p>No other details of the Wolfenstein TV show have been revealed but most games have featured William “B.J.” Blazkowicz, an American soldier who encounters Nazi’s dabbling in the occult. The first game was released… prepare to feel very old… forty-five years ago, in 1981.&nbsp; Since then, there have been thirteen games, with the most recent, 2019’s Wolfenstein: Cyberpilot, being a spin-off set a week before the previous game, Wolfenstein:&nbsp; Youngblood.</p>
<p>Sadly that game did not live up to expectations and we gave <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/29/wolfenstein-youngblood-review/">it 6/10 in our review</a>, which was summed up with “Go home Wolfenstein, you’re drunk.”</p>

            <p>Former DreadXP and Critical Reflex alum Ted Hentschke has teamed up with Jakub Bałuszek-Sobolewski to form Black Lantern Collective, a new publisher dedicated to horror games.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Amazon MGM Studios has selected yet another video game series for a TV show adaptation - and this time it's Wolfenstein.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/">Variety</a>, the exact plot details have yet to be disclosed, but the show's official tagline reminds us that "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen".</p>

<p>Jonah Nolan (aka Jonathan Nolan) and Lisa Joy - names you would've seen on the credits of Fallout - are already on board as executive producers, along with Athena Wickham, James Altman, and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson. Patrick Somerville will serve as creator, writer, executive producer, and showrunner under his production company, chaoticgood.tv.</p>
<p>Variety reports Somerville - who created the shows Maniac and Station Eleven - has reportedly been a fan of the Wolfenstein games "since he was a child".</p>
<p>Amazon is clearly looking to replicate the success of its hugely successful game-to-TV adaptation, Fallout, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-renews-fallout-for-third-season-six-months-before-second-arrives">has already been renewed for a third season on Amazon Prime</a>, even though the show's second season's December 2025 debut is still months away.</p>
<p>More than 100 million people have watched Fallout's first season to date, Amazon has revealed, making it one of the streamer's top three launches ever. Amazon is now moving quickly to make more of the show, and begin teasing its second batch of episodes with another longing look at the Las Vegas skyline at the end of the below trailer.</p>
<p>Other in-progress TV adaptations at Amazon include a series based on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written">God of War</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/henry-cavill-reportedly-set-to-star-in-a-warhammer-40k-series-at-amazon">Warhammer 40,000</a>. In fact, Amazon is so confident of its God of War adaptation, it has ordered a second season before the first has even been aired.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/wolfenstein-is-the-next-game-series-to-get-an-adaptation-for-tv]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Arnold Schwarzenegger's Dutch is back in the world of Predator via an extended version of animated movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-killer-of-killers">Killer of Killers</a> — and it’s sent fans of the long-running sci-fi franchise down a lore rabbit hole that calls into question the endings of the original movies and what was thought to be a canon Predator video game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week at San Diego Comic-Con 2025, current Predator custodian Dan Trachtenberg announced a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/extended-ending-of-predator-killer-of-killers-featuring-arnold-schwarzenegger-as-dutch-and-danny-glover-as-mike-harrigan-to-broadcast-tonight-sdcc-2025">surprise extended version of Killer of Killers that shows Dutch from the original Predator and Danny Glover's Mike Harrigan from Predator 2 captured and frozen by the Yautja</a>. Trachtenberg said during a panel at Comic-Con that Schwarzenegger had given his blessing to use Dutch in future stories, leaving the door open to a Killer of Killers follow-up that would see Dutch and co revived and pitted against a Predator once again.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">BRAND NEW PREDATOR KILLER OF KILLERS EXTENDED ENDING FEATURING DUTCH AND MIKE HARRIGAN <a href="https://t.co/xoDYwLmLFP" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xoDYwLmLFP</a></p>— MOVIEDEATHS (@MOVIEDEATHBLOWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MOVIEDEATHBLOWS/status/1948936697678352506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The extended version of Killer of Killers is out now, so fans are already analyzing it to within an inch of its life. Reaction appears to be mixed. While some are excited about the iconic characters' return, some are disappointed with the idea that the Yautja kidnap victorious humans in the first place. Let’s remember the iconic scene at the end of Predator 2 where an elder Yautja rewards Harrigan with an antique flintlock pistol as a trophy. The suggestion now is Harrigan was later kidnapped and put in stasis, which some believe devalues the human victories seen in previous Predator movies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It just feels like shit knowing your favorite human survivors are just going to be kidnapped and probably killed in an arena by another human or by the Warlord,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/predator/comments/1m9iekb/is_this_the_new_epilogue_of_killer_or_killers/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Vector_Mortis</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Why would the Yautja congratulate Harrigan, give him the pistol, and leave just to come back, take the pistol, and kidnap him?” wondered Slow_Obligation2286.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm not a fan of this at all,” added Hanesman12. “Harrigan and Dutch had good endings. Zero reason this needed to be done. Purely nostalgia bait.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This removes everything we previously knew about Dutch and Harrigan’s timelines after the movies,” said Originalname888. “This removes the honor code. This removes everything.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now latching onto a potential explanation for what is going on here: that the whole kidnap human survivors thing is the work of the Yautja tribe we see in Killer of Killers, which does not represent the Yautja as a whole. Perhaps this particular tribe has gone rogue and will eventually be put in its place. On that we’ll have to wait and see, but what is irrefutable is that it is now canon that Dutch and Harrigan were kidnapped soon after the events of their movies and remain in stasis at this undetermined point in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s an additional tricky Predator lore question that revolves around Dutch. 2020’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/predator-hunting-grounds">Predator: Hunting Grounds</a>, developed by IllFonic, features Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as Dutch. In the run up to the game’s release, the developers talked about working with people at previous rights holder Fox (this is before Disney bought the company and its franchises) to cement Hunting Grounds’ place within the official Predator lore.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was exciting for fans as it meant Hunting Grounds officially revealed what happened to Dutch after the events of the first Predator movie — and there was no mention of being kidnapped by Yautja. Indeed, Hunting Grounds shows an older Dutch in the year 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, is Hunting Grounds no longer canon? Is Trachtenberg ignoring it? Is there another explanation? These are just some of the questions fans are trying to answer in the wake of Dutch’s return in Killer of Killers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever Trachtenberg’s master plan, there remains huge interest in the upcoming Predator: Badlands, the first 15 minutes of which were shown at Comic-Con. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-predator-badlands-trailer-sparks-theories-for-how-a-xenomorph-may-make-a-surprise-appearance-to-turn-it-into-a-secret-avp-movie">The Alien franchise links are clear</a>, but will there be an AVP movie afterwards?

		<p>EA’s big reveal of the Battlefield 6 has been scuppered with videos of the multiplayer portion of the game popping up all over the internet.&nbsp; By far the longest is this 38 minute video showing the game running on a PC with RTX 5090 Ultra settings.</p>
<p>The video includes action on foot, in a tank, and in a jeep, but none from aircraft, although they can be clearly seen whizzing around in the sky and crashing spectacularly. The video has been up for a while so it doesn’t seem like EA are that bothered.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Multiplayer Gameplay | RTX 5090 Ultra Settings" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhUkNWI4vfs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The official Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal will take place on 31st July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p>Witness the vicious path of destruction carved by Pax Armata, the world’s leading private military company. PAX pursues the destruction of NATO and its allies, stopping at nothing to uphold their motto: “Our Protection, Your Peace.”</p>
<p>Lock &amp; load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Little is known about who Pax Armata is, but from pre-announcement teasers, they seem to be backed by a growing coalition of other nations. Careful not to step on certain countries’ toes, this isn’t being labelled as a particular nation at this time, and is instead the “Pax Armata Mercenaries”.<br>

<p>Following this we get a look at a broad spectrum of Battlefield-like scenarios. There’s cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s clearly an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>

<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e7f9feee95eb2/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ever since Nintendo introduced motion control with its Wii console, we've had to contend with bolt-on plastic accessories getting in the way of perfectly good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/mario_kart_wii">Mario Kart</a> multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p>The iconic Wii Wheel, while a novelty, was widely regarded by seasoned players as the worst way to control the game – and while I fear I may be upsetting some people with this statement, the same was generally true of the original Switch Joy-Con wheel, which launched alongside the console and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> back in 2017.</p>
<p>As predictably as night follows day, Nintendo has released an updated set of wheels for Switch 2, and if you're expecting me to suddenly completely revise my opinion of these largely superfluous chunks of plastic, you might be sorely disappointed. Does that mean they're not worth a look? Well, the answer to that is somewhat more complex.</p>

<p>Before we dive into that, though, let's talk a little about what's new and different with this pair of wheels. As you can imagine, the design has changed in order to accommodate the larger Joy-Con 2, and I have to admit I do like the way these look. The coloured band which runs around each wheel offers welcome grip, and Nintendo has done a good job of making the wheel look as neat and tidy as possible – you won't spy any screws, for example.</p>
<p>I'm also pretty pleased with how the Joy-Con 2 clicks into place using magnets; once slotted into the wheel, the controller automatically tries to pair with your console thanks to this magnet connection – just like when you bolt it onto your Switch 2. On the back of the wheel are two good-sized buttons which correspond to the shoulder triggers on top of the controllers; the Joy-Con 2's other inputs are all open to the elements and can be accessed normally.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c028917824f6e/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-5.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The appeal of this accessory — and those which came before it — lies in the fact that you can 'turn' it like a real steering wheel, delivering a sense of immersion which is not entirely unwelcome during intense <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> sessions.</p>
<p>The obvious shortcoming is that, with the wheel 'floating' in mid-air and not attached to a steering column, it's a frustratingly imprecise control method. There's a tendency to 'twist' the wheel during turns, and it's hard to gauge what the limits of your turn actually are, making tight changes of direction more difficult than they are when using the analogue stick. With prolonged play, you can coach yourself into holding the wheel in the right way, but it's never as accurate as using a Joy-Con or Pro Controller.</p>
<p>All of which means the wheel won't find any favour with serious Mario Karters – but then, that's not the sector of the market this product is aimed at.</p>
<figure><a title="Review: Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 Wheel 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5158b56ff6ba/review-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-6.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead, these wheels are intended to be used by more casual (and perhaps younger) players who are concerned with having as good a time as possible and not setting the best possible lap times. Sure, playing with a mix of wheels and Joy-Cons is only going to result in the wheel-based players losing out, but if you're <em>all</em> using a wheel and therefore on a level playing field, things become a lot more enjoyable.</p>
<p>The best thing is that these accessories are <em>fairly</em> cheap; a pair costs £16.99 / $25, so you can indulge in a four-player session for relatively little cash.</p>
<p>It's business as usual, then; the Joy-Con 2 wheel isn't going to change your mind on motion controls, but it can be the source of much entertainment and hilarity regardless – if you approach it with the right frame of mind, of course.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/712020/the-drifter-review-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-drifter-is-a-good-old-fashioned-thriller.1254102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Point-and-click adventure games often tell silly, lighthearted stories. For me, the mishaps of the pirate Guybrush Threepwood in the <em>Monkey Island</em> series come to mind. The nature of the genre — wandering around, talking to people, and trying to solve puzzles — lends itself well to humor, as every interaction with a person or object offers an opportunity for a joke. <em>The Drifter</em>, a new point-and-click game from Powerhoof, cleverly uses the format to instead tell a dark, twist-filled thriller, and it sucked me in like a gripping novel.</p><p>In <em>The Drifter</em>, you play as Mick Carter, who you meet shortly after he hops aboard a train as a stowaway. Within moments you’ll witness a brutal, unexplained murder and be forced to go on the run, and the story quickly becomes a complex web of characters, pursuers, and mysteries to poke at.</p><p>Mick serves as the game’s narrator, often describing what he’s doing in a grim, first-person tone with full voice acting by Adrian Vaughan. Mick’s tone sometimes feels a bit heavy-handed and overdramatic, but I enjoyed Vaughan’s performance anyway — it really sets a pulpy tone that’s fun to sink into. The game’s gorgeous pixel art helps, too, and locations have dramatic lighting and moody shadows.</p><p>This being a point-and-click adventure, the primary way to move the story forward is by solving puzzles, often by using the right object at the right place at the right time. The game is usually pretty good at suggesting where you need to go through conversations or through a list of broader story threads you’re investigating.</p><p>Actually doing the investigating is straightforward. I played <em>The Drifter</em> on Steam Deck, and it has a smart control scheme seemingly inspired by twin-stick shooters that shaves off a lot of the clunkiness of old-school LucasArts adventure games. You move Mick around with the left control stick, but when you move the right control stick, a little circle pops up around him with squares that indicate things nearby that you can interact with. You can select things you want to look at with a press of a trigger button. (You can, of course, use a more traditional mouse to play the game, too.)</p><p>More than once, though, I got completely stuck, and I often just brute-forced every item in my inventory with every person I could talk to until I found a way to move forward. I also occasionally leaned on online guides to figure out where to go next or if I missed something while investigating. When I hit walls, I really wished there was some kind of direct in-game hint system to give me a push in the right direction — this is an old-school issue with the genre, but a lot of modern games have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23360869/return-to-monkey-island-review-nintendo-switch-pc">figured</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile">it out</a>.</p><p>Pushing through those more obtuse head-scratchers was worth it, though: in the later parts of my eight-hour run of <em>The Drifter</em>, the narrative threads all started to come together in some truly mind-bending ways. More than once, I stayed up way past my bedtime as I raced to figure out what would happen next.</p><p>I’m glad this story for Mick is over, but part of me hopes he runs into trouble again so I can cozy up with another point-and-click thriller.</p><p><sup>The Drifter</sup><em><sup> is available now on PC.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/712020/the-drifter-review-pc]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's been discovered the title '<strong>SpongeBob SquarePants: Titans of the Tide'</strong> was rated in <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1930695174461554999">South Korea and Germany recently</a>. Adding to this, <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/bob-leponge-est-de-retour-un-nouveau-jeu-video-prevu-pour-cet-automne-60284">Dealabs and Billbil-Kun report</a> it's coming to multiple current-generation platforms including the Switch 2, and it's expected to surface this November.</p>
<p>This new game will apparently retail for $39.99 USD (<em>or the regional equivalent</em>) and a physical version is also believed to be on the way to the Switch 2. Right now, there's "no trace" of a Switch version.</p>
<p>This next title would follow SpongeBob games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_the_cosmic_shake">The Cosmic Shake</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spongebob_squarepants_battle_for_bikini_bottom_-_rehydrated">Battle for Bikini Bottom - Rehydrated</a>. Notably, THQ Nordic is hosting a <a href="https://showcase.thqnordic.com/">digital showcase</a> at the beginning of next month, which follows a <a href="https://youtu.be/BYcXWK2jJZc">teaser of a new SpongeBob game last October</a>.</p>
<p>This latest SpongeBob development follows the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/rumoured-plants-vs-zombies-remaster-potentially-releasing-on-switch-this-year">same source sharing an update</a> about the rumoured <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/plants_vs_zombies_battle_for_neighborville_complete_edition">Plants vs. Zombies</a> remaster.</p>
<p>Sega also recently revealed SpongeBob would be appearing in the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> game later this year. And earlier this week, Nickelodeon's new multiplayer game (featuring SpongeBob) locked in a release date for Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When new employees start at Weta Workshop, they’re herded into a meeting room with a long, unassuming conference table. On the walls, behind panes of glass and in between statues, swords, and masks, are five Oscars. Four of them were awarded to the studio for its efforts on Peter Jackson’s <em>The Lord of the Rings </em>films. New hires are offered a chance to hold one of those Oscars, but there’s a catch: handling the golden statuette marks you with a curse, preventing you from ever winning one yourself. Rarely do inductees take Weta up on the offer.</p><p>Weta Workshop’s fledgling Game Studio hasn’t achieved the same level of prestige as its film and special effects teams. There’s been no success to build superstition, no room for myths. And yet, the studio’s first major console release, <em>Tales of the Shire</em>, seems to have inherited its own curse.</p><p>According to more than a dozen current and former employees, the game’s development has been hobbled by ineffective management, plagued with poor decision-making and communication, sidetracked by circumstance, and, ultimately, spoiled by the company’s inexperience in building high-profile video games. One former employee said, “It’s a miracle this game is coming out at all.” Another said making it has been “hell.”</p><p>The studio lurched from deadline to deadline to get the game out the door, and a culture of distrust and crunch left staff feeling burnt out, they said. All those who spoke with <em>The Verge</em> requested anonymity, fearing retaliation for breaches of confidentiality.</p><p>In October 2024, the studio announced to staff that it would be restructuring, laying off nine staff and disestablishing the positions of lead producer and lead game designer. The changes came as a shock, eroding morale and driving a wedge between Weta’s leadership team and its developers, according to our sources. Four more staff members resigned in the succeeding weeks, dropping the studio’s headcount to approximately 30.</p><p>While redundancies have become a familiar story in games, particularly in the last two years, the tale of Weta’s Game Studio isn’t quite that story. It’s the story of a studio attempting to make a big leap into console gaming, one that shows what Weta could do with a <em>Lord of the Rings</em> game. Ultimately, it’s a story about inexperience, exhaustion, the difficulty of developing video games, misunderstandings, and mismanagement.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, it’s a story about perseverance — the tiny marvel of making a video game when the odds are stacked against you.</p><div><p id="in-the-beginning"><h2>In the beginning</h2></p></div><p>Weta Workshop’s Game Studio was established in 2012. It came into being during a partnership with buzzy US tech startup <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21274638/magic-leap-app-store-partnerships-update">Magic Leap</a>, tasked with building gaming experiences for its augmented reality headset. The studio’s staff numbers swelled, and it produced several titles to muted fanfare, including <em>Dr. Grordbort’s Invaders </em>and <em>Dr. Grordbort’s Boosters. </em>When Magic Leap <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21274638/magic-leap-app-store-partnerships-update">discontinued development of its headset in 2020</a>, a significant but undisclosed number of employees at the Game Studio <a href="https://www.renews.co.nz/weta-lays-off-game-division-due-to-covid-19-economic-fallout/">were made redundant</a>.</p><p>Out of the ashes, remaining staff planted the first seeds for <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. In 2020, “cozy” games were exploding in popularity, buoyed by COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and the runaway success of <em>Animal Crossing. </em>The rolling green hills of the Shire provided an ideal backdrop, and Weta Workshop had delivered huge wins with the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> franchise.</p><p>The pitch for <em>Tales of the Shire</em> piqued the interest of Private Division, which was an independent label of US-based gaming giant Take-Two Interactive at the time. Private Division provided funding to build a prototype, and by 2022, it had seen enough to partner with Weta and help the studio bring the game to life.</p><p>Weta Workshop had never made a video game like <em>Tales of the Shire </em>before. Employees familiar with development suggested the experience that staff had gained working on Magic Leap titles didn’t easily translate to commercial “double A” titles.</p><p>From early on, there appeared to be signs of trouble. The game felt more like a handful of disparate quests and minigames, with a lack of focus on gameplay loops, several staff said. This isn’t wholly unusual — game development can be patchwork, a slow and iterative process pulling varying elements together. But the lack of direction put the studio on the backfoot.</p><p>According to several developers, Weta’s senior leadership did not view making video games as all that different from its work in film. And because of this, employees and former staff suggested the studio didn’t adequately invest in senior talent or resource the project appropriately. Departments such as design and programming were either understaffed or inexperienced from the beginning, they said, and Weta was aware of the issue but didn’t act to resolve it.</p><p>There were also communication issues between departments. One incident, multiple sources told us, was related to the addition of an in-game economic system revolving around collecting buttons. The idea was that, each night after a feast, fat hobbits’ waistcoats would burst open, leaving buttons around the village. The player could pick them up and trade them for items. The feature was greenlit by production and then had to be dropped — there simply wasn’t enough time to add it in against impending deadlines. When the lead designer decided to implement it anyway, staff said it caused significant tension and set the team back a few days.</p><p>“We were always chasing after the next milestone and the next milestone, and the timelines we were given were near impossible,” said one Weta employee who worked on <em>Tales of the Shire </em>for multiple years.</p><p>The team prioritized hitting milestones, which meant several suggested features and ideas never made it into the game. But the team was hitting deadlines without tackling underlying problems in the code base, which one employee referred to as “a pile of dogshit.” Sometimes, they said, this meant taking shortcuts. Often, it meant they missed crucial time for refactoring, the process of trimming down the code to make it easier to work with. Instead of hiring senior programmers, they said they were kicking the can down the road, incurring a significant tech debt and creating a backlog of work to deal with.</p><div><p id="changes-at-the-top"><h2>Changes at the top</h2></p></div><p>About 18 months into the project, <em>Tales of the Shire </em>had to contend with a shift in leadership, one that employees said tanked morale.</p><p>After studio director Amie Wolken quit Weta in November 2023 to take a position as CEO at Dinosaur Polo Club, a New Zealand indie studio, Weta needed a replacement. It took six months to find Tony Lawrence, who arrived at Weta in April 2024. Lawrence had a long career in Australia at multiple studios, including as head of 2K Australia. During his seven-year tenure there, the studio delivered two successful <em>BioShock </em>games and a <em>Borderlands </em>title. After leaving 2K, Lawrence worked at developer Mighty Kingdom, where he served as executive director and chief operating officer when the studio listed on Australia’s stock exchange in April 2021. Mighty Kingdom <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/features/australias-biggest-independent-game-studio-is-teetering-on-the-edge-of-ruin/">was once considered a shining light of the Australian games industry</a>, but during Lawrence’s reign, it released just one console game — <em>Conan Chop Chop</em> — that launched to disappointing sales, and the company’s share price crashed 98 percent.</p><p>After his hiring at Weta, there was an “instantaneous” shift in the studio’s vibe, according to one employee. “It was like the air stilled, you could feel it, and morale slowly started to crumble from there on,” they said. Those familiar with Lawrence’s hiring said the process felt rushed and noted that Lawrence did not meet with those inside the studio who would be reporting to him. This, one senior team member noted, was “very weird.”</p><div><p>“It was like the air stilled.”</p></div><p>Lawrence did not respond to a request for comment. Weta did not respond to specific questions around his employment either. In January 2025, as <em>The Verge </em>was investigating this story, Lawrence led an all-staff meeting to discuss breaches of confidentiality. In that meeting, he told staff that “it’s not cool to talk to journalists,” discouraging them from speaking about their experiences. Wolken also did not respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Alongside internal issues, <em>Tales of the Shire </em>had to contend with a major external one: uncertainty over the fate of its publisher, Private Division. In May 2024, <em>IGN</em> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division">reported</a> Take-Two was “quietly killing” the label, slashing staff numbers and closing two of its studios. By November, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/take-two-has-sold-private-division-to-an-undisclosed-buyer">Private Division had been sold to an unknown buyer</a>. The upheaval occurred toward the final stages of development on <em>Tales of the Shire</em> and left Weta in limbo for several months. According to multiple sources, Weta also waited on milestone payments. (Private Division did not respond to a request for comment.)</p><p>It was unclear to Weta employees exactly when, or if, Private Division would continue. Several staff noted the situation with Private Division was demoralizing, igniting concerns the game may even be canceled.</p><p>In January, <em>Bloomberg</em> revealed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338274/annapurna-interactive-new-company-take-two-private-division">former staff of publishing house Annapurna Interactive had purchased Private Division’s games and franchises</a> from Take-Two, including<em> Tales of the Shire</em>, with the backing of Haveli Investments, a private equity firm based in Austin, Texas. The new publisher, revealed during this year’s Summer Games Fest, is named Fictions. Weta received its milestone payments, but there has still been confusion for staff, internally, about the state of publishing and which company is overseeing it. Former copresident of Annapurna, Deborah Mars, is listed as cofounder and cohead of Fictions on LinkedIn. She did not respond to a request for comment in March. Fictions did not respond to a subsequent request for comment in June. The press email listed on Private Division’s website bounces.</p><p>In an emailed statement, Jessica Wallace, chief marketing officer at Weta Workshop, said, “Neither the departure of Amie nor the challenges [Private Division] has had through the year has impacted directly on the team’s work building a great game.”</p><div><p id="crunch-and-overtime"><h2>Crunch and overtime</h2></p></div><p>One of the most pernicious issues in game development is “crunch,” a practice variously defined as “extended periods of drastic overtime” or “a sudden spike in work hours.” The <a href="https://www.takethis.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/CrunchHurts-TakeThis.pdf">effect of crunch</a> has been well-studied, with the exploit leaving <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1350508415572509">lasting effects on physical and mental health</a>.</p><p>Many current and former Weta staff said they worked long hours, especially as deadlines approached. “It was a systemic problem,” one experienced developer said. “It was a resourcing problem and general mismanagement of the project.”</p><p>Three staff members who spoke to <em>The Verge </em>said they felt pressure to work overtime coming from management and senior leadership. In August 2024, as a crucial deadline approached, a company-wide meeting was called. According to those who attended, Weta’s leadership suggested that if the team did not meet this major milestone, then there was real concern over the studio’s long-term sustainability. One staff member told <em>The Verge </em>it felt like the team was “strongly encouraged to crunch” in that meeting.</p><p>Another former staff member said that leadership had previously told the studio there was no crunch because such a practice involved working 70 hours or more per week for several months. “I felt a little bit gaslit, given the amount of work that I was doing,” they said.</p><p>However, there are employees who shied away from dubbing the extra hours as “crunch,” but noted there were broader issues related to overwork and burnout in parts of the development team. One employee stated, “I do not see our studio as a crunch studio,” suggesting the problem was specific to certain developers who chose to work extra hours and consistently accrued overtime. The studio works on a “swings and roundabouts” model, which is meant to provide employees with the flexibility to bank hours worked and take time off later. In practice, this caused havoc. One staff member mentioned time off was not tracked well, so it was difficult to adequately resource or finance as needs shifted. Often, they said, staff would work extra hours, but they didn’t receive that time back in kind — there was simply no opportunity to take time off with deadlines baring down.</p><p>Wallace responded to this by stating, “There was no ‘crunch’ during the development of <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. We extended deadlines to prioritize the well-being of our team, and all staff worked under New Zealand employment agreements, which ensure fair and adequate compensation for all hours worked.”</p><p>There is nothing indicating Weta Workshop acted illegally, but staff that spoke to <em>The Verge</em> said there were definitely crunch periods during development of <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. One staff member said they could not remember a time when they were not working beyond 50 hours a week. Another responded to Weta’s statement saying there was no crunch by simply texting back “lol.”</p><div><p id="layoffs-and-confusion"><h2>Layoffs and confusion</h2></p></div><p>On October 4th, 2024, in an all staff meeting, Weta’s executive team announced there would be a round of redundancies. It was an incredibly disruptive event that shook the team. “That really came out of the blue for us,” said one senior developer.</p><p>Leadership explained the need to cut staff was to provide the studio with long-term sustainability. Other parts of Weta’s business were feeling the effects of the pandemic slump in tourism and film, and the studio had yet to sign another contract to fund future projects. Every staff member who spoke with <em>The Verge </em>expressed disappointment. “It was handled terribly,” said a former member of the team.</p><p>After the announcement, one staff member said it felt like the “Hunger Games trials to keep your jobs.” They said those whose roles were being “disestablished” would need to reapply for their jobs or other jobs within the studio. One developer said that, post-announcement, coming into work “felt like coming to a funeral.”</p><p>According to documentation seen by <em>The Verge, </em>the core development team on <em>Tales of the Shire </em>was predominantly male. Only four senior leadership positions on the project were held by women, while 18 were held by men in early 2024. The redundancies in October 2024 saw the departure of four non-male employees on the team. Today, the studio has five non-male employees on its roster of 26 development staff, sources said. Those ratios are not uncommon in modern, mid-sized studios, but sources noted that this had left diverse voices out of key meetings.</p><p>After a final version of the game was completed in November 2024, about half of the studio began working on DLC, although no contract for that work had been signed with a publisher. Other studio heads that <em>The Verge </em>spoke to suggested this is normal as a game approaches release — and for Weta, it helped keep some members of the studio employed — but it is risky given the difficulties already encountered during development, particularly amid <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">the current state of the games industry</a>. Meanwhile, the other half was tasked with building out the studio’s next prototype. <em>The Verge</em> has learned this prototype is codenamed “Groundhog” and is again based on <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. It is a roguelike, drawing inspiration from the likes of <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and <em>Diablo</em>.</p><p>In an effort to ready the prototype for the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, this past March, where Weta could pitch it to prospective publishers, some employees suggested the crunch culture and overtime hours persisted. “There’s definitely been crunch, and there’s definitely still people doing crunch,” one developer told <em>The Verge</em> in January.</p><p>In February, Weta announced <em>Tales of the Shire’s</em> release would be delayed until July 29th, 2025 (a scheduled mobile version for Netflix was also canceled last year). <em>The Verge </em>understands this is to ensure quality assurance has been performed on all platforms, with the Switch port being particularly tricky to get running smoothly.</p><p>In addition, <em>The Verge </em>has learned that work on <em>Tales of the Shire</em> DLC was paused in February with no certainty the game will receive content updates at all. In a February 21st memo to staff, Kelly Tyson, the general manager of product at Weta Workshop wrote that Private Division (at the time, codenamed Vero) would deliver a part payment recognizing the studio’s DLC efforts, but “all post-launch content decisions have been delayed until the games in market performance is determined.”</p><p>Tyson also stated there was a “funding gap” and the studio would attempt to reduce costs by moving all staff to a four-day workweek, with a 20 percent pay cut for a period of three months. The February 21st email called this a “temporary change,” adding that the goal is to “keep as many people employed as possible.” The change was reversed in mid-May, ahead of schedule, as the studio worked to polish its Groundhog prototype in the hopes of signing a publisher. Those familiar with development have said it feels like a last ditch, all-in effort to keep the studio going, and <em>The Verge </em>understands there are multiple publishers interested in the game.</p><div><p id="the-next-phase"><h2>The next phase</h2></p></div><p>With <em>Tales of the Shire </em>ready for release, Weta’s Game Studio now must fight for survival in an industry trying to find its feet after two tumultuous years. Investment is much harder to come by, redundancies and closures have become commonplace. So what’s next?</p><p>Lawrence is charged with setting the studio’s direction going forward, but there are concerns, internally and externally, about his plans. An executive vision for the game studio, revealed to <em>The Verge </em>in a leaked PowerPoint presentation, is that Weta will become a ”work for hire creative services business.” The presentation, delivered in late 2024, suggests the company will “seek to have worked on five games” over the next five years. It hopes to release at least three, including <em>Tales of the Shire</em>. One staff member said the feeling in the studio was that this presentation was not aimed at staff but seemed to be designed to appease Weta’s executives.</p><p>According to a senior figure in the Australian games industry with knowledge of the strategy, this is a recipe for continued overtime and poor working conditions. “I, and the wider industry, would love to know how Weta plans to release five games in five years at AAA quality with an A budget, without implementing crunch or exploiting their staff,” they said. We asked Weta to explain this strategy, but it did not respond.</p><p>Despite the challenging environment and burnout, <em>Tales of the Shire </em>is still scheduled to release in July. When I asked current and former staff their enduring memories of making the game, there was a common theme: they truly care about the world they’ve built. Several reiterated how dedicated the development team was, striving to live up to the franchise’s lofty expectations. “I could genuinely spend hours playing my own video game, which is probably kind of rare for a developer to say,” one developer said.</p><div><p>“It should be a time of celebration.”</p></div><p>In between it all, they’ve had to contend with periods of crunch and circumstances beyond their control. “It is in spite of Weta Workshop’s leadership that there’s a video game made,” said a senior member of the development team. “It should be a time of celebration, but there’s so many people who won’t get to celebrate their wins because of this fight against the odds.”</p><p>Many staff said working at Weta was a lifelong dream — a career highlight. There was excitement about joining a project like <em>Tales of the Shire</em>, especially for those who grew up as fans of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. But some of those feelings have eroded. “The personal pride I have felt about this company is just completely tarnished,” said one former employee.</p><p>Without significant changes, current and former staff believe the problems experienced developing <em>Tales of the Shire</em> are destined to repeat. “I don’t have a lot of faith in what work we will have after [<em>Tales of the Shire</em>],” one staff member said. Another mentioned ongoing communication and management issues have been flagged with senior Weta members multiple times, but they feel as if the complaints have largely been ignored or dismissed.</p><p>In the meantime, the uncertainty around the future of Weta Workshop’s Game Studio and its next project has left some looking for an exit. But staff believe there is a way to break the curse and buck the trends of the past two years: invest in, and trust, people. To quote one experienced developer: “I genuinely think that if Weta Workshop nurtured the brilliance in the studio, they could just sit back and profit.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjIxMDkw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jackson Ryan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/709797/tales-of-the-shire-lotr-development-weta-workshop]]></content:encoded>
