                <p>Pokemon Go is now owned by Scopely, which itself is owned by Saudi Arabia-owned Savvy Games. What's the day-to-day impact on Pokemon Go based on its new ownership? Not much, according to Pokemon Go's game director.</p><p>Michael Steranka told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-go-director-talks-new-ownership-says-saudi-backing-wont-see-demands-such-as-cristiano-ronaldo-added-to-the-game-yeah-thats-a-little-bit-not-our-vibe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that he understands why people are skeptical. After all, there are countless examples of a new owner coming in and making major changes.</p><p>"I think people who are skeptical will remain skeptical," Steranka said. "The biggest thing that we can do is just prove over time that this actually is a great direction for the game to go. But I do think that... I've definitely seen people have a little bit more optimism for the future. It's healthy skepticism, but optimistic, regardless."</p><p>Niantic sold its games division to Scopely for $3.5 billion, and this was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4718">No. 8 most-expensive video game acquisition in history.</a></p><p>Steranka also clarified that the Pokemon Go development team will "pretty much never" engage directly with the bosses at Savvy. He said it's his understanding that Savvy allows Scopely to "operate the way they want to operate."</p><p>The director went on to say he's excited by the fact that Scopely is 100% a video game company, whereas Niantic had projects in the works across multiple content categories. "That's where I feel like we did struggle a little bit over on the Niantic side," he said. "It's just when it comes to overall company priorities, and where do we want to invest, and what sort of company initiatives we're pushing forward at Scopely, it'll be very much focused on what's best for this game. And I think that'll be a nice breath of fresh air for everybody."</p><p>In terms of what fans can expect from Pokemon Go in the future under its new ownership, Steranka said the team plans to pull back from AR initiatives for the game. He said it's no secret that players "have not been super excited about some of the AR systems" in the game. In the future, Steranka said fans can only expect new AR features if it's something the team believes in fully and could be something "exciting."</p><p>"Scopely hasn't come in and said, 'Hey, don't do that.' They've very much come in and been very supportive of all the things that we had already been planning on the roadmap," he said. "We've got a couple other amazing features and updates coming down the line later this year that players will be equally thrilled to see."</p><p>Scopely is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-partners-with-pokemon-go-owner-for-a-new-game-based-on-its-ip/1100-6530370/" data-ref-id="1100-6530370">working with The Witcher studio CD Projekt on a new game.</a></p>

The writer behind<em> Final Fantasy XVI</em> decided to push forward with bringing back <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> after replaying it 2018 on a livestream for the first time since it released in 1997. </p><p>A lack of rigorous documentation procedures at the time made it hard, however. Back in the PS1 days, games were made quickly and once they shipped the company moved on. The Japanese version might be completely overwritten in English for the international release. As a result, the current Square Enix team had to cobble together the new enhanced <em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>version through “sheer force.”</p><p>“We analyzed a number of existing versions of the game and reconstructed the programming of the original, but there were also times where we played the original game and worked it out by feel alone,” Maehiro said. The entire process was the result of cumulative hard work—on the one hand working to implement new features, while behind the scenes our work was similar to porting an old arcade game to the NES.”</p><p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles </em>includes updated graphics (read: HD smoothing), voice acting, a re-edited script, and quality-of-life features like fast-forward and save anywhere. The original version of the game is also playable. But this isn’t the first time Square Enix has ported <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. The <em>War of the Lions</em> version was released for PlayStation Portable in 2007, alongside a Shakespeare-ified script, some additional cutscenes, new job classes, and a wireless multiplayer mode. Surprisingly, none of that new content will be in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>. </p><p>“We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in War of the Lions<em>,” </em>Maehiro said. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p><p>The director notes that the<em> War of the Lions</em> port was handled by a different team than the original game, and he suggests that having gotten some of the original game’s veterans back together—including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-yasumi-matsuno-political-1851783744">original writer and director Yasumi Matsuno</a></span>—the team wanted to stay as close to the original as possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In an interview with Famitsu</a></span>, there’s also a mention of how poorly optimized the PSP version was, with audio bugs and frame rate crashes. While I can respect that, it also feels like a huge missed opportunity to expand on one of the best tactical RPG sandboxes in the genre. </p><p>That could have meant adding new jobs for players to explore or new modes. Online multiplayer, a roguelite mode, or some other end-game content feels like an obvious addition to one of the best games ever made. Fortunately, it does sound like three new difficulty options in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> will rebalance some of the gameplay. Once you’ve mastered <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ job system, it can make even its toughest battles feel trivially easy. A new tactical mode will add a new level of challenge, while some abilities that were useless in the original, like archer charging attacks, have been fixed in the standard difficulty. Another neat addition? Players will encounter the <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> sidequest to recruit Cloud much <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">earlier this time around</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Preorders just dropped on Amazon, which are conveniently found below because I'm an absolute legend like that. Speaking of Switch 2, I've included a solid deal on the best-selling TomToc slim carrying case to protect that hefty chunk of change.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN Store only has a stunning Master Sword replica in stock too, complete with its scabbard and a sleek display stand. Unfortunately, you won't be able to destroy anything with it as it's not a real sword, but it's a cracking collectible to have above the fireplace or on your back consistently. Moving onto today's tech deals, I've found a banging deal on one of the best gaming monitors at the moment, Samsung 57"Odyssey Neo G9 and a bag full of Apple Mac and iPad discounts. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild.

A cinematic cut of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is set to debut at a film festival next month.</p><p>The Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Cinematic Cut will get its premiere screening on July 9 during the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech Republic. The announcement (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-cinematic-cut-kviff-premiere-1236291931/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>) doesn't say how long the cinematic cut will be, but it will follow the narrative of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who sets out to avenge his family and protect Sir Hans Capon during a diplomatic mission gone wrong.</p><p>Daniel Vávra and Petr Pekař are both credited as the director of the cinematic cut. Vávra wrote and directed both Kingdom Come games, while Pekar is Warhorse's cinematic director and led the team of animators who created five hours of cutscenes for the sequel. It's unclear if Warhorse Studios intends to screen the cinematic cut outside of the film festival, but CEO Martin Frývadlský expressed his eagerness to see the game's story get its due.</p><p>"I have wished to see Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on the big screen for a long time," said Frývadlský in a statement. "I believe that the civil story of a blacksmith’s son will also appeal to film audiences and stand up to the competition of international movie productions. Together with my colleagues in the studio, we are proud that we have the opportunity to present the story we have been working on for many years in a world premiere at the Karlovy Vary Film Festival."</p><p>PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers recently received the opportunity to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-gets-trial-experience-on-ps-plus-premium/1100-6531873/" data-ref-id="1100-6531873">play through the first few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> as a trial experience. CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski also praised the game and noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-talks-kingdom-come-and-baldurs-gates-influence-on-the-witcher-4/1100-6532120/" data-ref-id="1100-6532120">that it influenced The Witcher 4</a>, which is currently in development.</p>

For those Lego fans who have asked for a Lego Fortnite mode that recalls the many different story-based Lego adventure games, like Lego Star Wars, Expeditions is the one you've been waiting for.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMOPVQSHIic" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Lego Fortnite Expeditions is the first official Lego mode in Epic's metaverse that doesn't involve building stuff--the purpose of this game is to battle enemies and solve puzzles alongside your friends. But don't worry--you won't be stuck using only the same sorts of weapons and items you can find in Lego Fortnite Odyssey, because Expeditions has character classes with unique abilities that you can upgrade as you complete missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the three classes–Hunter, Shadow Caller, and Rift Ripper--has its own unique main power and movement ability. The Rift Ripper, for example, can use rifts to get high ground or travel, or to drop crystal on the heads of baddies, while the Hunter can mark and make enemies more vulnerable to damage with its Bulls-eye Blade. If you wanna get weird, try out the Shadow Caller class, which can turn into a flock of ravens in an instant to escape any bad situation.</p><p dir="ltr">When Expeditions launches on Wednesday, it'll be accessible both as its own mode in the Discover page in the lobby, and by visiting a battle bus location in Lego Fortnite Odyssey or Lego Fortnite Brick Life. Odyssey, Lego's sandbox crafting mode, will also experience some bleedthrough from Expeditions, as new baddies introduced in the mode will start invading Odyssey islands in July sometime.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Fortnite Expeditions is just one of several parts of the massive June 18 update, which almost feels big enough to be a new season update by this point. In addition to Expeditions, this update will begin a new season of Fortnite Festival with a brand-new headlining artist, launch <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-getting-yet-another-new-battle-royale-mode/1100-6532468/" data-ref-id="1100-6532468">the new Blitz Royale mode</a>, and see Ballistic expand with another new map.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I was always a bit more of an outlier on the playground back in the day, preferring tales of destined children contending with trauma alongside digital monsters than everyday pre-teens leaving home to collect pocket monsters. Years later, Digimon still has my heart in a way Pokemon never will. The one area of the two respective franchises where I've enjoyed Pokemon more than Digimon is the video games. But I continue to hold out hope, dreaming of a Digimon video game that can rival how much I enjoy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-diamond-pearl-platinum-version/" data-ref-id="5000-35035">Pokemon Platinum</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-alpha-sapphire-omega-ruby/" data-ref-id="5000-272937">Omega Ruby</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus/" data-ref-id="5000-527659">Legends: Arceus</a>, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Scarlet</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm still not sure if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/digimon-story-time-stranger/" data-ref-id="5000-663007">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a> is that game. The latest in the Digimon Story series, you play as a secret agent in Tokyo, Japan who witnesses a city-leveling disaster and then suddenly travels eight years into the past. With your knowledge of what's to come, you have to investigate the mystery surrounding the coming disaster. Your actions twist the world and reshape history, plunging you and your allies through alternate timelines. Your investigation also leads into the Digital World, a parallel reality where Digimon live--you can befriend and train these digital monsters as partners to use while in conflict with Digimon that mean you harm.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRCH0qPHYzo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JRCH0qPHYzo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">As you might have surmised given the name, the Digimon Story series has regularly told their stories very well--the focus of the series has been to submerge the player in narrative-rich experiences. Gameplay has been the part of this series that can be very hit-or-miss, and I'm not sure Time Stranger bucks that trend.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't get to play too much of Time Stranger at Summer Game Fest--about 20 minutes in total. After exploring a hub-like area and seeing various Digimon (including a fun Digimon Adventure 02 easter egg of Veemon, Hawkmon, Armadillomon, and Wormmon hanging out together), I played through two fights: a quick bout against a bunch of smaller Digimon, and then the first few turns of a boss battle against Parrotmon. Time Stranger's turn-based combat is built on a Rock, Paper, Scissors framework--certain digital monsters resist attacks of specific types, and are weak to other types.</p><p dir="ltr">Time Stranger uses the franchise's long-used Data, Vaccine, Virus format, in which Virus corrupts Data, Data rewrites Vaccine, and Vaccine cures Virus. A Digimon of a specific type tends to mostly learn moves of that type, but stronger ones can learn from at least two different types to help cover for weaknesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515277"></a><figcaption>Combat is turn-based.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515277-ss_7394bab7c2a9409c4a6e5db2941b497cfeddb7bd.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's pretty straightforward to pick up. Whenever a new Digimon shows up, there's some detective work needed on the player's part to figure out whether you're dealing with a Data, Vaccine, or Virus type, but simple experimentation with a variety of moves will reveal the result. It's not very hard, especially with only three options.</p><p dir="ltr">The potential issue I see is that, to make this dynamic more challenging, Time Stranger seems to have opted for making opponents have very large health bars. After playing through one round of combat against Parrotmon, I had deduced its type and which of my Digimon were best suited to fighting it--I switched out my Virus team members who would take extra damage from Parrotmon's Vaccine attacks, and directed my Data allies to leap into the fray. For the next three rounds, I pumped the same super-effective attacks into Parrotmon over and over. But even though my attacks were doing massive damage and Parrotmon's attacks were reduced to negligible numbers, I was only knocking off a tiny chunk of the boss's health bar each round. After the four rounds I played, Parrotmon still had over three-quarters of its health, and no new enemy had shown up, meaning the only thing left to do was keep clicking on my tried-and-true strategy for several more turns.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515278"></a><figcaption>The hub space in the Digital World is so cool!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515278-ss_e119215706a1b0469c756c0ec2148d09777e447c.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Had I kept playing, I imagine the initial thrill of strategically reacting to Parrotmon's type and implementing a winning strategy would have dulled into tedium as I needed to keep chipping away at the giant parrot with the same moves over and over. There's no way to know for sure that would have happened, as my hands-on time with the demo ended there, and I didn't see what happened next, but that grind isn't appealing. It tries to create difficulty by making a boss fight longer than a traditional fight, not by making it more complex and incentivizing you to think about what move to use next.</p><p dir="ltr">This has been an ongoing issue with Digimon games for years--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/digimon-survive-review-digital-devolution/1900-6417936/">I actually expressed similar complaints with Digimon Survive</a> back in 2022, which made fights "more difficult" by making each subsequent encounter last longer and longer. It did include one of the two non-standard Digimon types, Free, but that all-resistant type just made certain fights last even longer. I would have much preferred Variable/Hybrid boss battles--Digimon that change their type mid-fight, forcing an opponent to adjust their strategy on the fly. With that, Survive might have been more than another Digimon game with a great story and okay gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515279"></a><figcaption>Digimon of many forms and levels can be recruited, even non-traditional options like BeelStarmon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4515279-ss_f1acb4c9cd3eb3a6293850fcce17eb64c336fdfb.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Much in the way Survive immediately pulled me in with its likable characters and kept wowing me with its timey-whimey narrative, what I've seen so far of Time Stranger's story is intriguing. Like past Digimon games, I think that's where the game is going to excel. I loved exploring the hub area in the early part of the demo and seeing Digimon use their traditionally violent powers for everyday tasks, like Zudomon wielding its lightning-generating hammer to build tools as a blacksmith. The culture of the Digital World has never been a huge part of any of the games or anime, so having a hub that delves into that sounds exciting.</p><p dir="ltr">I left the demo of Time Stranger once again wishing for a Digimon game that would just be a visual novel. That said, I feel like I haven't had a chance to give Time Stranger's combat a fair shake--I only played one minor fight and part of a single boss fight. I was told that the two fights I played will occur about midway through the story, so it stands to reason that they're a fairly accurate representation of what combat will be like throughout Time Stranger. But it was a demo, and other fights might be wildly different. Heck, if other fights at least see you face off against multiple Digimon of various types, I think the game could deliver a decently strategic gameplay experience. That's just not what I saw at Summer Game Fest.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't have long to wait and see what the final game will be like. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC on October 3.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> Expeditions' existence isn't much of a mystery given all the teasing Epic's been giving it on social media recently, but the teasing has now made way for a full reveal. And what is it? Expeditions, it turns out, is a mission-based PvE mode where players join forces to thwart the nefarious plans of an evil mask maker. As for the when, it's out this week.
</p>
<p>
Those wishing to embark on an Expeditions adventure will be enrolled in the Supernova Academy, where they'll hang out with other players, chat with members of the faculty (including founder Vengeance Jones), and take on co-op missions pitting them against Mask Maker Daigo's minions - which include sentient crystals, demon guards, and formidable Titans.
</p>
<p>
These missions whisk players (and as many as three friends) to key locations around the world map, including Utopia City, Spire Excavation Site, and Busted Bridge, with more - such as Demon's Domain, where Daigo resides - coming after launch. As for what you'll be doing out in the field, there's talk of rescuing civilians, setting up comm relays, and deploying field generators, all while fending off waves of enemies - and if players can find moment to explore amid the chaos, they might uncover useful resources, currency, gear, and more.

<p>
To aid in their adventures, players can switch between four distinct classes at will, each with their own XP-based skills trees. Shadow Caller, for instance, can summon projectiles that heal or deal damage; The Hunter is all about inflicting massive damage to a single target, while Rift Rippers can use their rift abilities against either single or multiple foes. Players can also randomly acquire gadgets and weapons - including Plasma Pistols, Dual Daggers, and the War Hammer - by spending Essence found during missions back at the academy.
</p>
<p>
As missions are completed, they'll contribute to global goals known as Team Projects, and Epic also mentions Academy Assignments, additional objectives players can pick up from faculty members and tackle during their downtime.
</p>
<p>
Lego Fortnite Expeditions comes to all versions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> on 18th June, and can be accessed via the Battle Bus in either Odyssey or Brick Life modes. Additionally, Expeditions monsters will begin infiltrating Odyssey in July (hero classes will follow, according to Epic), and players can start crafting Expeditions weapons in preparation soon.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-teasing-red-dead-announcement-coming-this-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-seem-to-be-teasing-a-red-dead-related-announcement-coming-this-week.1220568/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-voice-actors-teasing-red-dead-announcement-coming-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rob Wiethoff, the actor who plays John Marston in Red Dead Redemption and Red Dead Redemption 2, teased in a <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1934015849603453002">live stream this past Saturday</a> while playing Red Dead Redemption, that there's 'something' coming this week related to the Red Dead series, likely closer to Friday, that he is incredibly excited to share and discuss with players, once the news is made public.</p>
<p>"<em>I've got such exciting news. I can't share it with you right now, and it's absolutely killing</em> <em>me</em>," he began. "<em>By the end of this week, hopefully sooner. Not this week, I guess. Probably, not as soon as tomorrow, but definitely before Friday. Oh my goodness, the news that I have to share - and I won't be the only one sharing it. I cannot wait for you to know what's going on. And that's all I can say.</em>"</p>
<p>What made it seem like a direct reference to Red Dead and a Red Dead-related announcement coming is that he ended his vague and excited statement by saying "<em>I'm so excited, but I truly cannot think of anything else, especially playing this game, I can't think of anything else.</em>"</p>
<p>Adding to Wiethoff's vague statements after the live stream was Roger Clark, the actor who plays Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2. When asked if he knew what Wiethoff was talking about on X, <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">he replied with a simple "<em>Yes,</em>"</a> and a gif of a grinning dog, smiling like they have a secret no one else knows.</p>
<p>Then, Noshir Dalal, the voice actor for Charles in Red Dead Redemption 2, <a href="https://x.com/NoshirDalal/status/1934390960332378568">replied to Clark's tweet with his own vague tease,</a> adding even more weight to the pile.</p>
<p>It's possible that all three actors are hinting that we'll finally get the reveal of the long-awaited current-gen update for Red Dead Redemption 2, a game that originally launched on PS4 and Xbox One, and is still without a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version. Red Dead Redemption 2 looks great on PC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-enhanced-ambient-occlusion-trailer-quality/">even better with certain mods,</a> but console players are still left playing the last-gen version. A PS5 and Series X/S version would be a huge announcement for fans of the series.</p>
<p>And now that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-better-lighting-shadows-comparison/">first Red Dead game has a remastered</a> and graphically upgraded version, it's high time the sequel gets its due.</p>
<p>It could also be that Rockstar is about to add another game to the Nintendo Switch 2 lineup, with a Switch 2 version of RDR2 coming. It could also be that the game is coming to Switch 2, and it's getting a native PS5 and Xbox Series X/S version with graphical upgrades.</p>
<p>Or it's none of them, and instead we're getting some sort of Red Dead adaptation or just something else entirely. Who knows at this point, but you have to imagine that Wiethoff and company wouldn't get players riled up if there wasn't something big behind it. Just weeks ago, we saw voice actors from the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-third-persona-4-voice-actor-has-confirmed-they-wont-be-returning-for-the-persona-4-remake/">Persona 4 cast make subtle hints</a> in the lead-up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-revival-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-new-trailer/">Persona 4 Revival's</a> reveal. Hopefully, these teases are leading towards a similar level of announcement.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tron-catalyst-review-rocky-revolution</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tron-catalyst-review-a-rocky-revolution.1220565/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tron-catalyst-review-rocky-revolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following up on 2023's visual novel&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-bithell-talks-about-his-dream-star-trek-game" rel="nofollow">Bithell Games</a>' sophomore outing with the franchise. In this more ambitious game, the team delivers a more direct experience, complete with the action fans expect, with both disc-to-disc combat and light cycle riding. However, this broadening of focus makes it much different than its predecessor-- for better and worse.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - A New Identity</h2>



<p>The biggest change from the previous&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>game to this one is the shift from a relatively hands-off visual novel to a more isometric action-oriented approach. This was a change that I felt would really benefit the game. I really enjoyed my time with&nbsp;<em>Identity</em>, but it was hard to push how fun riding a light cycle would be out of my mind.</p>

<p>Luckily,&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>delivers the power fantasy that&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>fans would want, from disc-to-disc combat to light cycle riding. Unfortunately, the delivery of this new direction is one of the weaker parts of the game. Watching the game seems like it would deliver, but the reality was a little more clunky.</p>

<p>The bulk of the combat revolves around attacking with one button, and a parry and dodge. There are some additional techniques that unlock as well. The most fun ends up being throwing your disc, which can bounce between enemies and even yourself as it upgrades.</p>

<p>The one button that you end up needing, though, is the parry button. As you upgrade the skill tree, this parry becomes far too overtuned. While playing on the hardest difficulty, I managed to defeat the final boss with a single parry. To have any challenge, it felt like I had to purposely fight with one hand behind my back.</p>

<p>In addition to combat on Exo's feet, she utilizes her light cycle. One of the most iconic parts of the&nbsp;<em>Tron&nbsp;</em>mythos, the light cycle delivers on what you would want from it. It can feel a little clunky to use in crowded streets, but it shines in open areas. Derezzing enemies with its ribbon was one of the most fun things to do during my time in the Grid.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Grid Greatness</h2>



<p>Speaking of the Grid, the world of it is the most compelling part of the game. After proving itself with its isolated Repository area in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Identity</em>, Bithell Games has created a fully realized Grid that feels right at home in the franchise.</p>

<p>The characters that populate the Grid are a bit part of this. Exo herself is compelling enough, but the real standout for me was Conn, one of the antagonists in the game. Seeing him develop was one of my main motivators for continuing to see the story through.</p>

<p>The Automata faction's return was another highlight of this iteration of the Grid. The way they challenge the status quo of the world in&nbsp;<em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is one I found myself invested in. It helps that their pink and white color scheme absolutely shines in the world.</p>

<p>One of the lacking parts of the world was its exploration aspects. It's always easy to find where you're going, but I never felt the motivation to explore the previous areas with new abilities as I got them. These paths mostly only led to skill points, which I felt&nbsp;<em>Catalyst&nbsp;</em>was already incredibly generous with.</p>

<h2>TRON: Catalyst - Glitching Pains</h2>



<p>One of the biggest gripes that developed for me as I played was the Glitch, a mechanic introduced that allows Exo to repeat a cycle to make different decisions. The thought of this system excited me, as the branching paths of&nbsp;<em>Identity&nbsp;</em>were arguably its strongest suit.</p>

<p>This looping, unfortunately, ended up being mostly a letdown. While it gets a little more open later on, it begins feeling like a chore to extend certain sections.</p>

<p>In addition, going back to change certain decisions was fun, but almost never seemed to have the sort of butterfly effect that I wanted. I repeated decisions with a character to try and help them the best I could, only to never have a meaningful interaction with them again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was also plagued by actual glitches alongside the Glitch mechanic. Frequently, when throwing my disc, it could get stuck, especially on narrow paths. This inconsistency ended up leading me right back to that powerful parry, just to get through the combat, instead of getting more creative.</p>

<h2><em>TRON: Catalyst</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Tron: Catalyst&nbsp;</em>is a largely uneven experience. It has some great highs, especially in the worldbuilding and story departments. However, the gameplay can be largely uneven and even frustrating at times. Tron fans are sure to have a lot of fun with the story and even the gameplay, despite my hangups.</p>

<p>With this and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army" rel="nofollow">Strange Scaffold's <em>Ninja Turtles</em> game</a>, it's been fun to see IP owners loosen the grip on certain franchises. Despite my complaints, I do really hope that Bithell Games gets to finish what seems to be a planned trilogy of games. The bones of a great game are here. I would love to see where this story goes and ends. I just hope that the journey to find that answer is a lot more fun next time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle Train Review - Fear of Flying]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying.1220562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/battle-train-review-fear-of-flying<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An unsung guilty pleasure of mine is the secret stress test known as <em>Train Valley</em>. A jaunty little jog through the legacy of locomotives that quickly becomes the most intense experience you’ll have next to open heart surgery. Sometimes, however, a more direct approach is required, which is why <em>Battle Train</em> is here to dismantle all this complexity of train travel.</p>

<p>This is the latest release from Terrible Posture Games, a rather underseen developer in the grand scheme of things, with titles like <em>Tower of Guns</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mothergunship-review-fire-and-forget" rel="nofollow"><em>MOTHERGUNSHIP</em></a> under their belt. After a successful Kickstarter campaign to start things off, <em>Battle Train</em> sees Terrible Posture still scratching that roguelite itch, with help from co-developers Nerd Ninjas – who’ve helped Niantic out with their AR titles <em>Peridot Beyond</em> and <em>Pokemon Go</em> – and publishing help from none other than Bandai Namco.</p>

<p>You play as a contestant on the show viewed by “10 billion people” (the figures are real, trust), Battle Train, a <em>Takeshi’s Castle</em>-esque game show filled with explosions, a lively host, and a worthy final villain in the form of Supreme President Conductor Aalvado. Through the framing device of a fly-on-the-wall documentary detailing inner turmoil and office politics, you’ll slowly uncover a web of network shenanigans, celebrity ego, and image sacrificed for ratings… while also smashing trains into each other.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going on here, from the narrative which is implemented into story events you can run into on the world map, to the fusion of deck-building roguelite and board game. It’s easy to consider it blind ambition, or blind anything, since everything is on-the-spot; who your opponent is, what events you’ll run into, etc. There's not a lot of prediction in <em>Battle Train</em>, only the next stop, which may be your last.</p>

<p>Gameplay consists of you and your opponent taking turns on a board to build tracks into each other's outposts, so you can slam trains from your base into them for damage. There are energy deposits in the form of scattered minerals and mines placed on the map, so you have to balance between wanting your opponent to lose and generating an economy to realize that objective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another rule is that both you and your opponent should be able to use the same tracks, should they both connect to your stations, something which is just as prosperous as it is dangerous. Place a few obstacle generation cards and alternative methods of damage, and you should have a charismatic mix of chess by way of <em>Under Siege 2</em>, right?</p>



<p>Almost, but not quite. Since it’s a deck builder, there’s still a lot in the way of the type of build you can, could, and <em>should </em>generate, as well as prospects in the form of upgrading your train. Extra minerals, extra gold, more health, etc. – it all takes further priority than what you want your deck to achieve. Regardless of which direction you take, there will be certain patches of dead air in battle where you and your opponent will simply end turns until you can accrue the cards you need.</p>

<p>Indeed, a lot of the train upgrades are where you’ll find your muscle in battle, leading to some exceptionally one-sided affairs of runs. That isn’t to say that <em>Battle Train</em> can’t generate some exciting and tense battles later down the line, once you unlock more cards, upgrades, and understanding of your fairly small but varied roster of opponents. As it stands, though, a fat handful of your victories will lie in whether or not you can summon a lucky enough upgrade in the initial stretch.</p>

<p>A disappointing prospect to consider, especially when fighting tooth and nail to survive, is where <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely shines. Find yourself down and out, one hit away from death, and turn meek retreat into a cartridge trap of sudden connections to your enemy outposts, as your railway starts connecting to theirs, and now there’s a long train comin’. It’s a rare sight, but when tactical fortitude is what wins you a run in <em>Battle Train</em>, you will not stop beaming for a while after the run.</p>



<p>Also, in a rather deflating decision, there’s no PvP element for you to face your friends… what gives? In its peaks, <em>Battle Train</em> absolutely taps into the same vein of silliness and teeth-clenching moments that something like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">Worms</a> </em>would provide, so it’s disappointing to see that, eventually, you will run into a brick wall in terms of what <em>Battle Train</em> can provide for you.</p>

<p>Part of me believes Terrible Posture are aware of this, which is why they put all their chips on providing a rather hefty narrative to go alongside the gameplay, a brave decision for a roguelite. You could ignore it entirely, but you’d be remiss of a rather delicate writing affair that’s trying to juggle childish endeavors with an almost adult flavor. It’s not some secret genius theory like, I dunno, “The Sinister Undertones of <em>Bluey</em>” or what-have-you, it’s more that <em>Battle Train</em> wants to convince you of its writing chops.</p>

<p>It certainly convinced me. Every time it got a bit too cynical or saccharine to deal with, it turned right back around into being absorbing, if not charismatic. This is thanks to some well-done characterization in the form of Aalvado, and the stupidly adorable Todrick the Turtle, as well as knowing when and where to let a joke lie. Even with a lacking cast, <em>Battle Train</em> grows a lot from a little, and it was worth it to play the game just to see the next cutscene, which feels weird to say, right?</p>

<p>Still, that’s my opinion, and not everyone wants the promise of smashing trains into buildings to be uprooted by <em>30 Rock</em> meets <em>The Crystal Maze</em>. You can still go through <em>Battle Train</em> and completely ignore the story it presents, but it’s there to consider why, at times, the gameplay and its mechanical opportunities might feel blunt, or even stodgy. Is it still fun? Absolutely, but this isn’t chess we’re talking about here. Not even checkers… tiddlywinks, maybe.</p>



<h2><em>Battle Train&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>When it works, <em>Battle Train</em> is ingenious, sharp, and oddly alluring with the twists and turns it presents, and when it doesn’t work, you still have what is essentially an outrageously silly board game. It’s not got the depth to match your favorites, but it has the passion, the charm, and the wits to know it’s better to go for broke with a blunderbuss. I certainly know one thing, though.</p>

<p>This is a no-Todrick-slander zone from now on.</p>

He said at a speaking event in Sydney, Australia recently that he's a big fan of the game and particularly its relatively small team size.</p><p>Expedition 33 was developed by a small team at Sandfall Interactive, and Kojima said it was impressive to see the studio make the game with "like 33 team members and a dog," <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-calls-clair-obscur-expedition-33-ideal-for-one-key-reason-3215153/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto reported</a>. It's not exactly true that the game was made by 33 people alone, as the core team at Sandfall was helped by dozens of other people. But in any event, Kojima said a small team size like Sandfall had for Expedition 33 is "ideal."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"When I first started, it was like a team of six," Kojima said. "You could do everything yourself. Now, it's expanded. You can't really control each employee, so you delegate. But sometimes, the idea doesn't really work out because it's a bigger team."</p><p>Many modern games are developed by teams of hundreds of people, and this can feel like "factory" work, Kojima said. When teams get that big, they lose cohesion, Kojima said.</p><p>"Big companies, like 600, 1,000 people, they're full of totally different teams," he said. "Everyone's concentrating on their work and then combining together. Creation has now become much bigger. It's kind of a war between how efficient you could [be] with the small team, but you have to make it so grand."</p><p>Regarding Expedition 33's team size, Matthew Handrahan of publisher Kepler Interactive told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-sandfall-and-kepler-on-team-size-the-return-of-aa-games-and-whats-next" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that the "creative engine" of the game was about 30 people. He said it's true dozens of other people from places like Korea contributed to the game, but he said "none of them were full time." Then there was a "galaxy of partners" working on the game as well, including musicians, translators, testers, and more.</p><p>Handrahan said people get "fixated" on how many people worked on Expedition 33. That's actually missing the point, though, which he said was that Expedition 33 is not a "AAA" game and that becomes obvious when you look at the game's credits.</p><p>"Some games can make it work. Grand Theft Auto 6 is going to make it work, I think we can all say with great confidence. But there are plenty of games made with very large teams and for huge amounts of money that don't land, and there is a human cost to running things that way," he said. "People lose their jobs. God knows how many layoffs there's been in the industry over the last few years."</p><p>At Summer Game Fest recently, host Geoff Keighley praised Expedition 33 in part for how it was made by a team of "under 30 developers." Many quickly pointed out that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/no-geoff-keighley-clair-obscur-expedition-33-was-not-made-by-a-team-of-under-30-developers-and-devs-say-repeating-the-myth-is-a-dangerous-path/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this is a myth</a> and that saying this downplays the critical role that people outside of the "core" group had in the making of the game.</p><p>As for Kojima, his next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>, and it launches on June 26 for PS5. He has multiple other games in the works as well, including OD and Physint.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-camelia-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Studio Camelia, the team behind Kickstarted RPG&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, has announced it will be closing its doors, and that development on the game is now "on an indefinite pause".</p>

<p>In a Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> posted earlier today, Studio Camelia says that prior to the Kickstarter's commencement, it had secured funding for "half the development" of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, and that the crowdfunding campaign was intended to "reduce the perceived risk" for potential partners.</p>

<p>The studio says it used the Kickstarter money to create a new demo, but that no discussions with potential partners resulted in a publishing contract, "despite having a playable demo, a senior team, half of the funding secured, and the Kickstarter campaign".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-shuts-down-combat.jpg?itok=xav39mTu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alzara-radiant-echoes-studio-shuts-down-combat.jpg?itok=11jOzAaZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alzara Radiant Echoes&nbsp;</em>was to be a throwback turn-based RPG, but it's dead in the water now, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, since Studio Camelia couldn't secure funding to continue development on&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>, the studio was liquidated, and development has been paused indefinitely.</p>

<p>Studio Camelia says there's a "slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project", but that this would result in a "different direction" for the game, although the studio says it hopes that direction would be "for the better".</p>

<p>Backers who gave their money to&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' campaign won't be refunded, the studio says, and given that the game managed to make almost three times the amount the studio asked for, that's got to sting for a lot of folks.</p>

<p>Indeed, many backers are incandescent in the comments section of the aforementioned post, variously calling the campaign "scammy", "a bold-faced lie", and "full of BS".</p>




<p>Some users accuse Studio Camelia of a lack of transparency; as recently as February, an update was posted that made no mention of&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes</em>' ongoing financial trouble, although Studio Camelia would surely have been well aware of its problems by then.</p>

<p>Additionally, some commenters say that it wasn't clear the funds they were contributing wouldn't necessarily be put towards the development of a full game, but rather a demo for investors and publishers.</p>

<p>Kickstarter is often used to fund video game development; notable success stories include the excellent&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-crowdfunding-closes-may-14" rel="nofollow">Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</a>&nbsp;</em>and Larian Studios'&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/divinity-original-sin-2-quickly-funded-explains-gameplay" rel="nofollow"><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em></a>, which laid much of the groundwork for&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>.</p>

<p>Still, Studio Camelia and&nbsp;<em>Alzara Radiant Echoes&nbsp;</em>are a cautionary tale of the ways in which crowdfunding can go wrong, although that won't be very reassuring to the backers who won't see their money returned.</p>

Prime Gaming distributes a lot of these games via GOG (alongside Epic and their own internal software), and in those cases you’re getting DRM-free executables of games.</p><p>I never remember to grab these, which is dumb. It’s worth it just for the sake of archiving my access to games that could otherwise get revoked by Valve or whomever at any point. And June’s collection is about to grow to 31 games, which is bonkers.

Users who backed the Kickstarter campaign will not be refunded. <span id="more-974408"></span></p><div><p>Hello everyone,</p><p>Here is an update that is very difficult for us to write. It is with deep sadness that we announce the closure of Studio Camelia. In this update, we will take the time to explain the circumstances that led to this outcome, as well as provide some clarity regarding the Kickstarter and the future.</p><p><strong>How We Got Here</strong></p><p>We founded Studio Camelia based on our love for <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,682 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPGs</a>, with the desire to bring a fresh perspective to the genre while staying true to the essence of what makes a JRPG, produced by professionals from the industry. With <em>ALZARA</em>, we wanted to create a Mediterranean-inspired JRPG, influenced by games like <em>Golden Sun</em> and <em><a title="Series > Final Fantasy [141 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/final-fantasy">Final Fantasy</a> X</em>, with dynamic turn-based combat and centered around the theme of “Togetherness.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The studio was officially created in May 2022, but the journey began nearly four years ago. From the very start, we fought tirelessly to bring our dream to life and were constantly seeking funding. We started the studio with our personal savings and managed to convince business angels, banks, and institutions who believed in our vision and supported us. We were even honored to be accepted into Microsoft’s Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>With all this support, we had half the development of the game covered, and only needed to secure the other half through an industry partner. However, as you know, the video game industry is currently going through a crisis. Many studios have been forced to close due to lack of funding, and over 20,000 workers have lost their jobs. Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk.</p><p>To give ourselves the best possible chance of securing funding, we turned to Kickstarter to reduce the perceived risk for some partners and reassure them of the project’s profitability. The campaign was a huge success: <em>ALZARA</em>&nbsp;became one of the most-backed Gaming projects on Kickstarter in 2024, with over 5,000 backers and nearly €300,000 in pledges. Thank you again for your support! It was an incredible time for us.</p><p>We used that success to develop a new demo of the game incorporating the latest advances on <em>ALZARA</em>. We attended various events (Tokyo Game Show, <a title="Companies > DICE [232 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/electronic-arts/dice">DICE</a>…) to meet with potential partners from around the world. We had in-depth discussions earlier this year, but unfortunately, none of them resulted in a contract, despite having a playable demo, a senior team, half of the funding secured, and the Kickstarter campaign. We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could.</p><p>This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn’t be more true.</p><p><strong>Is There a Chance <em>ALZARA</em>&nbsp;Will Continue?</strong></p><p>The studio’s liquidation was declared on April 28. At the time of writing, various legal procedures are underway and will be ongoing for some time. As you can imagine, we are unable to share the details of these procedures, but they pertain to the liquidation of a company.</p><p><em>ALZARA: Radiant Echoes</em> is now on an indefinite pause. There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!</p><p><strong>About the Kickstarter</strong></p><p>As you know, backing a Kickstarter project comes with risks: the very idea of the platform is to give creators a boost so they can bring their projects to life. It does not guarantee the final commercialization of the project, and therefore there is always a risk it won’t come to fruition.</p><p>Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that. For more information, you can consult the FAQ provided by Kickstarter.</p><p><strong>A Bit of <em>ALZARA</em></strong></p><p>Before concluding this update, we’d like to share some excerpts from the demo we presented to our partners, showcasing the latest progress on the game. Sadly, this demo cannot be shared publicly for copyright reasons, and the company’s liquidation prevents us from releasing any game content. Please keep in mind that these are snippets from a work-in-progress game, and all elements shown would have been finalized during production.</p><p><strong>The End</strong></p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this message in full. If you have any questions, we will take the time to answer them as best as we can, within the limits of what we are allowed to share.</p><p>We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this. Know that we share your sorrow. We would have loved for this project to see the light of day. We were deeply invested in the world of <em>ALZARA</em>, its characters, and its story. We would have loved nothing more than to celebrate its release with you.</p><p>From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for your support from day one. Thank you for believing in our project. Thank you to our community for its kindness and words of encouragement.</p><p>With all our hearts,<br>The Studio Camelia Team</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      </div>
<p>EA never confirmed a June announcement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>--only that the game would be revealed sometime this summer. Many assumed a reveal would happen in June alongside the video game industry's numerous other events, but it's unclear if June is when the unveiling will be.</p><p>The official last day of summer in the northern hemisphere is September 22, but no one is expecting EA to wait that long to reveal Battlefield 6.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/leaked-battlefield-6-footage-gives-off-bad-company-2-vibes-dev-says/1100-6531668/" data-ref-id="1100-6531668">Lots of gameplay footage and details about Battlefield 6</a> have emerged from Battlefield Labs testing program, but everything seen so far is a work-in-progress and non-final. The game, whatever it ends up being called, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially set to launch by the end of March 2026</a>, but with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> slipping to 2026, some have theorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">EA might capitalize on the delay and launch Battlefield 6 this year</a>. That remains to be seen, however, and the company has said it's keen to avoid bringing the game to market too soon to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">help avoid having another Battlefield 2042 situation on its hands.</a></p><p>You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for the Battlefield Labs testing program</a> for a chance to try the game early.

This statue is based on the scene from the game when the duo arrives at the University of Eastern Colorado, and has been brought to life by Substance Modelworks for Dark Horse (monkeys not included).&nbsp;</p><p>Naughty Dog's 2013 post-apocalyptic action-adventure game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/the_last_of_us/b/ps3/archive/2013/06/05/the-last-of-us-review-naughty-dogs-grim-masterpiece.aspx">The Last of Us, remains a favorite among fans</a>, even today, more than a decade later.

You can check out the statue in the glamour shots below:&nbsp;</p><p>"Ellie rides atop Callus the horse, wearing her signature striped hoodie and backpack complete with her iconic pins," Dark Horse says of the statue. "Callus is brought to life with stunning details from the worn saddles to the reins, to even the branded 'J' on their leg from Jackson County. Joel walks alongside them, grounded in his rugged gear, rifle gripped in hand and pistol secure in his holster.&nbsp;</p><p>"Together, they tread slowly across a weathered concrete base, including a spray-painted Fireflies symbol, fallen autumn leaves, moss, and the ever-encroaching presence of cordyceps emerging from below."&nbsp;</p><p>The statue stands 13 inches tall, 12 inches wide, and 12.75 inches deep.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Predictions" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9a72fe1248e8c/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-predictions.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>What's that? You thought the arrival of Switch 2 a mere two weeks ago would be enough to halt the hype train for a while? Oh no, no, dear readers, Nintendo is full steam ahead, reminding us what's <em>next</em> for the freshest console on the block. The next station stop: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>A Direct presentation focused on DK's upcoming adventure will be heading our way tomorrow, <strong>18th June 2025</strong>, at <strong>2pm BST / 6am PDT / 9am EDT, 3pm CEST</strong>. We know that it'll be 15 minutes long and that it will contain "information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game," but that's it. The precise details are still up in the air, so strap in folks, it's time for some speculation.</p>
<p>Below, a handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared what we're hoping to see in this DK-focused...bananza. Have a gander through our predictions and then take to the comments to share your own.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-direct/related-articles:183956 @ 1750168806 -->
<h2>Kongs &amp; cameras (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e98789382cb98/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo was proud to showcase a certain familiar face in Donkey Kong Bananza's Treehouse footage (it was Cranky Kong, in case you missed it), and I would be very surprised if ol' grandpa is the <em>only</em> Kong Kameo in the game — let's not forget, we haven't seen DK in a 3D capacity like this since the character-stuffed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>. My money's on Diddy Kong making an appearance, especially with that redesign out there, but I'll lose my mind if we see Funky.</p>
<p>The only other thing that I'd like to feel a <em>little</em> more secure about is the camera. I loved what I played at the Switch 2 Hands-On Experience a few months back, but all that tunnelling and rock smashing didn't make for the easiest camera controls. If this Direct can show me the exploration sections running 10% smoother, I'll be fully back on board.</p>
<h2>A reason to go bananas (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3892927a3439f/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Playing Donkey Kong Bananza at the Nintendo Switch 2 event back in April, I came away feeling slightly more concerned than elated. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast tearing through the environment and finding little ore deposits, but I can't help but wonder if that was all there is to it.</p>
<p>I'm sure Nintendo has lots more up its sleeve for Bananza, so that's mainly what I'm hoping to see. If this is truly by the team that made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Mario Odyssey</a> (which I still find myself doubting), then I want to see gameplay mechanics that have my jaw dropping to the floor. Smashing bits of rock is fine for a while, but I don't know if this can stretch to keep me compelled for the entire game.</p>
<h2>Lots of smashing, no frame rate drops (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33c32f48c28d1/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very, very excited about this new DK entry. I love the look of it, I love all the smashing, but I am concerned that it might end up struggling a bit in terms of its frame rate and end up making my new console feel underpowered.</p>
<p>Yes, it'll most likely be fine, I do like to worry about nothing. More positively, the idea of this Odyssey style of caper with everyone's favourite ape front and centre feels like it should have happened ages ago, and if the gameplay can match its looks I think we're in for a good time. Just make sure it's a nice, stutter-free time, too, please.</p>
<h2>K. Rool intentions (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Smash Bros. Ultimate K. Rool" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/113455f5ff6aa/smash-bros-ultimate-k-rool.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Give me a K. Rool and a pair of boxing gloves, and I'll be happy. A few more worlds and a look at some of the deeper mechanics. Maybe a deep-cut Kong or two - I've got a soft spot for DK64, so a little Lanky or Chunky would be great.</p>
<p>I'm just looking for something that doesn't pour cold water on my enthusiasm, really. I went into the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-mario-kart-world-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">Mario Kart World Direct</a> expecting to be dazzled...and it was essentially a recap of everything we already knew, and I ended up coming away significantly less excited for the game.</p>
<p>Let's try and give the hardcore fans a little more to chew on this time while ticking those mainstream messaging tick boxes, please Nintendo.</p>
<h2>Peeling off the layers (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/81257345da9bb/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>After feeling a bit deflated from Mario Kart's collectibles, I want to know more about what DK has to offer. I know, exciting stuff, right? But I just want some creative, fun rewards that actually feel meaningful rather than a little challenge. And Bananza's destructibility gives tons of room for that.</p>
<p>Outside of that, a little look at some of the other levels in a bit more detail, some returning faces (no one here has mentioned Dixie... tut tut), and that's about it. I don't need a deep dive, just a little teaser of what to expect. Individual game Directs don't really get me that excited anyway, but I'm ready to be surprised.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>There are our hopes and dreams for the DK Direct, but what about you? You can let us know if you share any of our predictions in the following poll, but then take to the comments to spill the beans on what else you'd like to see.</em></p>

			<p>Today, Remedy Entertainment has released FBC: Firebreak, its first cooperative multiplayer game set in the so-called Remedy Connected Universe. You can read our review-in-progress <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>NVIDIA has just released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 576.80) that delivers day-one optimizations for the game. The driver also fixes several bugs in many games, as noted in the <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.80/576.80-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official changelog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dune: Awakening: stability issues</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25: stability issues</li>
<li>Dragon's Dogma 2: displays shadow flicker</li>
<li>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33: stability issues</li>
<li>Enshrouded: crashes after launching game</li>
<li>Monster Hunter World: stability issues when playing in DX12 mode</li>
<li>Gray Zone Warfare: stability issues</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals: stability issues</li>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut: Flickering/corruption around light sources</li>
<li>GTA V Enhanced: stability issues</li>
<li>Honor of Kings: World: stability issues</li>
<li>Forza Horizon 5: stability issues</li>
<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: Image corruption</li>
</ul>
<p>FBC: Firebreak, like Control and Alan Wake 2 before it, supports the full extent of the NVIDIA RTX suite. It integrates DLSS 4, including DLSS Super Resolution, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Multi Frame Generation, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction to enhance ray tracing fidelity and frame rates. Additionally, all GeForce RTX gamers benefit from the NVIDIA RTX Mega Geometry (a feature that <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-rtx-mega-geometry-performance-vram-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debuted</a> in Remedy's Alan Wake 2, which also runs on the Northlight engine) when ray tracing is enabled, reducing CPU and GPU Bounding Volume Hierarchies build and update times and reducing VRAM consumption.</p>
<p><iframe title="FBC: Firebreak | 4K RTX On Gameplay - Full Ray Tracing &amp; DLSS 4!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nV2pLZxBWNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>According to NVIDIA, FBC: Firebreak runs 9.3x faster on average when DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at 4K max settings on GeForce RTX 50 Series desktop graphics cards.

<p>Another NVIDIA-partnered game, id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages, will receive its highly anticipated path tracing update tomorrow. On top of all the aforementioned DLSS features, the game also introduces NVIDIA's Spatial Hash Radiance Cache (SHaRC) technology, which enables the efficient computation of path-traced light; moreover, Shader Execution Reordering technology further enhances the performance of GeForce RTX GPUs. NVIDIA reports that DLSS 4 accelerates performance at 4K by an average of 6.8x on GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 cards. The flagship GPU averages 234 frames per second, while the RTX 5080 registers around 167 frames per second.</p>
