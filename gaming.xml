			<p>As we hurtle steadily towards the festive season, manufacturers of all and sundry are set on filling the space underneath your spruce with as many of their own products as humanly possible. OneOdio, a Chinese audio specialist, are also set on getting you there on a budget, with their latest, the Focus A6, coming in at a thoroughly reasonable £55. Does this make it a budget king in 2025? It certainly comes pretty close.</p>
<p>The OneOdio Focus A6 sure is a pair of wireless headphones. That’s not a knock, but this is a thoroughly understated and relatively unassuming pair of cans. Decked out all in Midnight Black – it’s also available in the light Ivory Blush – you could almost be forgiven for thinking they’re an older pair of Sony’s iconic XM3/MX4 headphones, were it not for the small OneOdio logo on each earpiece and gold ring circling it.</p>



<p>After the larger, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">XM5-aping A5</a>, this is a welcome step back. I like their looks, opting for subtle rather than overpowering, but that does make them feel slightly unremarkable. I guess that’s a plus or negative depending on how much of an extrovert you are, and whether you view headphones as a fashion accessory.</p>
<p>The Focus A6 feel quite plasticky. There are areas here where that plastic feels thin and cheap, particularly at each end of the metal headband, where it joins to the earpiece joints. If you’re sensitive to a spot of plastic ick, then this is the worst part of the A6, but other areas such as the metal headband and its suitably plush memory foam padding help to balance things out. I’ve worn them for hours at a time and I don’t feel like I need to take them off; the leatherette earpads in particular are really soft, and that light plastic does help to keep the weight down to a head-pleasing 240g.</p>

<p>It doesn’t necessarily make the A6 feel weak either. I was able to twist and pull at the headband without wrecking it, and the A6 has been robust enough to be folded up and chucked into my backpack with a lunchbox bouncing along beside it. The fact they fold up is also a huge bonus when everyone else seems to have forgotten that this is a really handy thing for headphones to do.</p>

<p>Some people will rejoice at the news that the Focus A6 has physical controls – seated in easy reach on the right earpiece – and they do exactly what you need them to do. The cheap plastics carry through here, but with a toggle for ANC, Power and a volume rocker that doubles up for playback control, you can definitely live with it.</p>
<p>Despite the slightly underwhelming aesthetics, the Focus A6 is packing a host of features that are worth talking about. Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation nestles up to wired and wireless Hi-Res certification, with support for the LDAC codec ensuring that your experience sounds as true to the original recording as possible, though not on Apple products.</p>
<p>You’ve got to do a bit of work to get there though. The standard sound profile of the Focus A6 is thoroughly lifeless, and it’s lucky that the OneOdio app is on hand to bring everything up to scratch. There’s only three preset EQs, and of these, only the Pop setting comes close to being useful. Fortunately, there’s space for three custom EQ presets, and I found that dialling things in with a deep scoop in the mid-range brought out the best of the A6, at least for the rock and metal genres I tend to listen to.</p>

<p>Embarking on a Nine Inch Nails marathon thanks to the brand-new Tron Ares soundtrack, my first port of call was the album’s first single, As Alive As You Need Me To Be. The A6 did a great job here, delivering the dark synth tones and thumping beats with a surprising level of clarity. It’s warmer rather than detailed, and it feels like the A6 has been designed as a real crowd-pleaser with its approachable audio abilities and welcoming price point. If you’re looking for absolute detail, you might want to look elsewhere, but when it’s handed a lossless piece of audio, the Focus A6’s 40mm drivers sound good. You might find they sound even better when you think about how little they cost, and they’re a huge step up after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/29/oneodio-a5-headphone-review/">their bass-heavy predecessor</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the budget pricing, there’s the welcome inclusion of Hybrid ANC. This now-essential inclusion helps to reduce external noises, and lets you focus on whatever you’re listening to, rather than the big bad real world. It’s clearly nowhere near the level of Sony or Bose over-ear masterpieces, but the A6 costs a quarter of the price, and their performance far exceeds that. There is an audible low-level hiss when activated and without any audio playing, but that disappears in normal use. The corresponding Transparency mode isn’t as clear as the best efforts out there, but once again, it’ll serve you well when you’re ordering a coffee or paying at the checkout.</p>
<p>There’s also a very healthy 40 hours of battery life here with the ANC enabled, and a whopping 75 hours with it turned off, which trounces both Sony’s XM5 and newer XM6, and leaves the Bose QuietComfort Ultra in the dust. They might both have more effective ANC, but it clearly comes at a cost to battery life. If you’re the kind of person who doesn’t want to think about charging their gear too often, this is the headset for you.</p>

<p>There are a couple of bonus features to enhance your audio consumption with the Focus A6, but they come with a pair of caveats. The first is the low-latency Game Mode, which is perfect for competitive mobile gaming, but can only operate alongside the less detailed AAC codec, and this forces you to reconnect the headphones when you switch. Alongside that, there’s a Cinema Mode, which slightly ups the immersion when watching big blockbusters, but which is fiddly to activate. If there was a way to activate either modes on the headset, I could see them being useful, but it’s unlikely I’ll hop into the app to toggle them on, especially when the headset does a decent enough job on its own.</p>
<p>The OneOdio app also takes care of the things you’d hope for, including updating your headset to the newest firmware. I was impressed by how quickly and easily this was done, especially when other, far bigger firms somehow struggle to reliably update their own headsets without losing connection. From here you can dig into all the settings, and there are two additional ANC modes, with wind reduction options for both ANC and transparency. It’s nice to have them, and they do help to drop interference from the wind to a small extent, but once again, it’s an additional setting in the app to have to reach for, and largely, you’ll be happy with the standard ANC settings.</p>
<p>The sub-£100 category has become so competitive in the last couple of years, and the OneOdio A6 has brought the fight to its competitors. It’s on a par with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/07/final-ux2000-headset-review/">Final UX2000</a>, though the Final pair may just edge it on the comfort front. There’s also the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/09/monoprice-bt-600anc-headset-review/">Monoprice BT600-ANC</a> to consider, which has the benefit of coming with its own hard case as well.</p>
<p><em>There’s currently a nice little discount available on the <a href="https://bit.ly/4em8cFG">official site</a> with the following discount code ONESPPRMR (15% OFF), making the A6 even better value. Valid from July 7 to September 30.</em></p>

			<p>Today, CCP Games announced the launch of Operation Nemesis, a major milestone for its MMOFPS EVE Vanguard. The studio has famously attempted to link its long-running sci-fi MMORPG EVE Online to a shooter game with the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-working-on-new-ue4-powered-fps-for-pc-as-dust-514-is-discontinued/">Dust 514</a> and its spiritual successors that never saw the light of release, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-nova-developers-drawing-board/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Nova</a>. Despite the failures, CCP Games continued to find the right way to achieve that vision, and now they're one step closer with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-londons-game-is-a-genre-defining-hugely-ambitious-eve-shooter-says-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London studio's game</a>.</p>



<p>Starting with Operation Nemesis, Warclones on the ground (in EVE Vanguard) and Capsuleers in the cosmos (in EVE Online) will now influence the same conflict. Vanguard squads uncover intel that enables Capsuleers to reveal and raid Upwell convoys in space. This persistent economic and military connection unites boots-on-the-ground combat with interstellar warfare, giving players the power to shape the fate of New Eden together.</p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, Executive Producer at CCP Games, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Operation Nemesis marks a major milestone for EVE Vanguard. This is the first real taste of our much grander vision: We’re delivering a persistent, online sandbox shooter where your actions resonate across a living, player-driven universe. With the foundations in place, we’re now fusing new systems into the framework as we set the stage for Early Access. EVE Vanguard is growing with every milestone, and players are starting to see the boundless potential of the ultimate sci-fi experience we’re building: one universe, one war, fought across space and planets.</em></p>



<p>Scott Davis, Game Director for EVE Vanguard, added:</p>



<p><em>The feeling at CCP’s London studio is that we’re building the game of our dreams. EVE Vanguard represents our vision for a bold new FPS that combines the intensity of brutal combat with the depth and persistence usually reserved for MMOs. Operation Nemesis is the most significant step forward so far, giving fireteams and solo operators the chance to battle-test and influence the game ahead of next year’s Early Access launch. So grab your friends, squad up, and help us build it together. We’ve only begun to scratch the surface of what’s to come.</em></p>

It features one out of the three routes in the full game in its entirety. <span id="more-992711"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><a title="Genres > Roguelike [369 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">Roguelike</a> x unknown discovery in the depths of a million underground floors.</p><p>“Embark on a roguelike journey into the depths of Earth, explore a million underground floors, and uncover the unknown.”</p><p>After Earth’s downfall, the protagonist “Moma” aims to explore the depths of a million underground layers. Being attacked by unique creatures and androids from the underground, Moma fights back using weapons she crafts along the way. Sometimes, the stunning views of the underground world steal her heart as she uncovers the mystery behind the downfall of underground humanity and the truth about “YOU.” Her quest for answers drives her to continue exploring the depths.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><a title="Genres > Crafting [45 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> and Battle</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Crafting System Where Your Drawings Transform into Weapons</strong> – To survive the harsh underground environment, you must craft weapons and armor depending on the circumstances. You can create your own weapons and armor by combining various parts. It’s up to you to decide whether to make them more powerful for attacking, easier to defend against enemy assaults, enhance mobility for quick movement, or go for a stylish look – it’s all up to your imagination!</li><li><strong>Combat System Where the World Stops When You Stop</strong> – By using the “Biotope Jammer” brought from space, Moma can freeze all movement around her while she remains still. It is essential to think carefully and adapt according to the situation.</li><li><strong>Unique Battles</strong> – In these battles, you can see the enemy’s attack power, and you can reduce their power by hitting them with your crafted weapons. However, when your crafted weapon hits the enemy, it starts to crumble. Once it surpasses a certain threshold, it enters an automatic recovery mode and becomes temporarily unusable. This leads to strategic battles where you have to figure out how to preserve your own weapons while dealing damage to the enemy.</li></ul><p><strong>Unique Storytelling Through Parallel Worlds</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A Story that Changes with Every Replay</strong> – This game employs a “multi-ending” structure, branching based on encountered levels and specific conditions. Moreover, these endings can influence the next player’s gameplay (the past “Moma” in parallel worlds). With each playthrough, you’ll notice changes in the same NPCs (the androids) as well. With various parallel worlds, you can repeatedly enjoy the evolving story. Discover the ending that Moma desires the most!</li><li><strong>Discovery of the Unknown</strong> – In the underground, you’ll find numerous floors that make you wonder, “Why would something like this be underground?!” While enjoying short stories from those floors and learning about past humanity, players gradually piece together the puzzle of what befell past mankind. However, is that understanding truly accurate? Delve into the joy of unraveling a complex story woven across multiple parallel worlds!</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Million Depth</em> is due out for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on November 12.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/million-depth-demo-now-available]]></content:encoded>

For example, Shocked, Paradisal, Celestial, and Dawnbound all give the highest increase of values available in the base game without any events. However, they’re also the most difficult to obtain as they require either luck for the plant to be hit by lightning or meteors, combining even rarer weather effects, or submitting sunflowers to a god that rarely appears. Pets with the Ascended mutation give plants a whopping 150 times their value, but you’ll rarely, if ever, see them.</p><p>As for the more commonly available base game weather events, Heat Wave weather gives Sundried mutations, which have a massive 85x multiplier. They’re rare, but only require the Heat Wave weather to be in effect to apply to your crops or pets. The rates do drop significantly from here, though a Frozen crop gives 10 times the value of the base crop and is relatively easy to get, provided a Wet or Drenched plant is subjected to a Frost weather effect. Sushi Bears also grant plants the Frozen effect.</p><p>Your best bet is to focus on the event-only weather conditions and unlocking the associated pet. Obtaining the animal companion requires a lot of investment of time and resources, completing event quests, and eventually buying the egg to stand a chance to hatch the correct critter. Some events also trigger effects, such as the Zen update’s Zen and Corrupt weather, which automatically converted plants and gave them an extra 20 times their overall value. The most valuable event pets in the game are the Disco Bee and the Lobster Thermidor, as they have a chance to affect your crops with the Disco and Meteoric mutations, respectively, granting affected plants 125 times their value.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Pocketpair is aiming for a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> 1.0 release in 2026, following the game's launch in early access at the start of 2024.
</p>
<p>
In a video update, Pocketpair revealed it's working on big fixes and clean-up of the game ahead of a full release next year, though there's still more content planned for the rest of 2025.
</p>
<p>
Since its initial launch, Palworld has become a remarkable success: it sold <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-passes-5m-copies-sold-in-three-days">6m copies in just four days</a>, and has the third highest concurrent player count on Steam ever at over 2.1 million players. In that time, though, the company has been rocked by an ongoing lawsuit with Nintendo and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-says-pokemon-lawsuit-will-prompt-more-disappointing-changes-as-it-continues-to-dispute-claims">made changes to gameplay despite disputing claims of infringement</a>.

<p>
Pocketpair has shipped five major updates to Palworld, each adding new elements to gameplay like raids, new environments, and cross-play with other platforms. 
</p>
<p>
"Now we've reach a crossroads and need to decide what comes next," explained Palworld communications director Bucky in this video update. "While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about Palworld 1.0.
</p><p>
"Beyond just adding new content, there's a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit Early Access. It's no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game."
</p>
<p>
That's why the studio will be a little quieter until the 1.0 release, although a winter update is still planned - just smaller than last year's.
</p>
<p>
What's more, Pocketpair now has a publishing arm and is working on multiple projects. It's already released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-newbon-and-ben-starr-lead-surgent-studios-new-live-action-psychological-horror-blurring-film-and-game-boundaries">Dead Take with Abubakar Salim's Surgent Studios</a> this year, with more to come.
</p>
<p>
Pocketpair itself is also working on new projects, though the majority of its efforts remain on Palworld leading to that 1.0 release.
</p>
<p>Nintendo, meanwhile, is increasing its catalogue of patents. Earlier this month, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">new patent was granted that could have implications across the games industry</a> - but is it enforceable?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Battlefield 6 is now only three weeks away from its October 10 launch date. Fans are counting down days following the successful beta, and the developers share more info through interviews. Yesterday, Technical Director Christian Buhl <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that having to optimize for a lower spec hardware like the Xbox Series S actually benefited the more powerful platforms, too.</p>



<p>Now, in an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with IGN</a>, Buhl and Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson have discussed the importance of delivering a great console experience in Battlefield 6, to the extent that Nickerson joked it was like the game was 'secretly console first'.  </p>



<p><em><strong>Christian Buhl:</strong> I could say we've been thinking about console and the console experience from the start of Battlefield 6. It has been a top-of-the-line thing. We have to build this game as if it was made primarily for console players. Obviously, we're still also thinking about PC players, but in the past, frankly, Battlefield was built as a PC game and then ported to console, and it probably felt like that. That is not how this game was built. We built this from the beginning with the idea in mind that this is going to be on both console and PC. It has to feel and play like it is a console game that was built to be a console game.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>Matthew Nickerson:</strong> We have a saying here in the office, in Ripple Effect when I joined the team, that I created, called 'Secretly Console First.’ It's a little moniker that kind of pokes fun. We don't want to, obviously, tear down or destroy any of the legacy that Battlefield has, which is, first, a PC game, but we really have to care about console at the end of the day. We've been putting in the reps, putting in the work, just like Christian said. Console has been at the forefront of Battlefield 6 development since day one, and really, we're honed and we are well-crafted in providing this product at the highest quality possible.</em></p>



<p>In the interview, the two also shared that Battlefield 6 will offer console players the option to turn off cross-play with the PC version (which they may want to do in case of cheating issues) while maintaining cross-play between Xbox Series S|X and PlayStation 5 consoles. When cross-play with PC is enabled, the matchmaking system will still look for console players first if you're playing on Xbox or PlayStation, only expanding the search to include PC if the lobby requires more players. Moreover, the developers have revamped aim assist compared to Battlefield 2042 to ensure cross-play is fair for all players.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-mode-details-testing-starts-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testing of the Battle Royale mode is ongoing on the Battlefield Labs platform</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-dk-island-emerald-rush-hands-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-bananza%E2%80%99s-dk-island-emerald-rush-dlc-is-an-odd-mix-of-rare-and-roguelite.1298937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo often makes fans wait a spell for DLC or expansions for their favorite games, so it came as somewhat of a surprise when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-announced-friday-september-12/">most recent Nintendo Direct</a> announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, released only two months ago, was getting DLC the same day as the presentation. The DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC adds a new stage based on DK’s tropical home featured in Rare and Retro Studios’ games, as well as a new fast-paced roguelite mode.</p>



<p>Is the DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush DLC a gem or are its flaws all too apparent? Swing on down for my full impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As the title of the DLC implies, the centerpiece of Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is a new HD recreation of the big ape’s island home from the Donkey Kong Country games. Nintendo has really gone all out rendering DK Island in all its glory, packing it with familiar characters, landmarks, and plenty of Easter eggs. It’s a welcome addition to a game that’s really a celebration of the Donkey Kong franchise as a whole, although it is hard to overlook the fact that Super Mario Odyssey included something similar – a stage based on the classic Mushroom Kingdom – as an in-game unlockable, while DK Island is stuck behind a $20 price tag.</p>



<p>Super Mario Odyssey’s Mushroom Kingdom was also fully integrated into the core game, offering fresh challenges to tackle and Power Moons to collect. The same can’t be said of DK Island. While the tropical locale looks nice and will give you fuzzy nostalgic feelings, it strangely sits apart from the main game. There are no new Banandium Gems or fossils to collect here, making the whole experience feel a bit too much like a superficial theme park attraction.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At least that’s true until you jump into Emerald Rush mode, which DK Island was clearly designed around. Emerald Rush is essentially an accelerated take on the roguelite genre, with all the gold in the game turned into glittering green gems. Over a series of quick 99-second rounds, you’re challenged to collect a specific quantity of green goodness by smashing ore deposits, defeating enemies, and finding green bananas (again, bananas can only be found on DK Island in Emerald Rush mode). The number of rounds you have to survive depends on the difficulty you’ve chosen, but thankfully, finding emerald fossils will grant you stackable upgrades that will help you as the rounds get tougher.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Emerald Rush is fun enough, in a simple, smashy-smashy sort of way, although it condenses the roguelite experience to such a degree that it all starts to feel a bit meaningless. You'll be picking up a <em>lot</em> of fossils, requiring you to choose upgrades almost constantly. While I'm absolutely sure some folks will get <em>really</em> into strategizing and finding synergies between upgrades, I found myself succumbing to information overload fairly quickly.</p>



<p>In addition to DK Island, you can unlock the ability to play Emerald Rush on the majority of DK Bananza’s layers, and it will likely take a solid half-dozen hours or more to unlock all the DLC’s new content. Even then, you can pump up the difficulty on each layer for a new challenge. That said, I'm not sure how long the average player is going to stick with the mode. Emerald Rush reminds me a lot of the Balloon World DLC for Mario Odyssey, in that it's something I think <em>some</em> players will really get into, but will be largely ignored by most.</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-not-a-knockout-follow-up-punch"><strong>Not a Knockout Follow-up Punch</strong></h2>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush isn't without its charms, but the titular island's lack of integration into the main game, Emerald Rush mode's relatively simple gameplay loop, and a substantial $20 price tag means this DLC will likely only appeal to a relatively small subset of Bananza owners. If you've read through these impressions and are still interested, by all means, dig in, but given how substantial the core Donkey Kong Bananza experience is, others may prefer to keep mining for fun there.</p>



<p>Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush is available now on Switch 2 for $20.</p>

            <p>
KPop Demon Hunters is headed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, according to the latest leaks.
</p>
<p>
If you're somehow unaware, KPop Demon Hunters is an animated film from Sony Pictures depicting a fantastical take on the South Korean pop industry. Not only have the songs (sung by prominent KPop artists) dominated music charts, the film itself is the most watched original title in Netflix history.
</p>
<p>
It's no wonder, then, a crossover with Fortnite is on the way, as spotted by Fortnite leakers <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1967649620449968264">SpushFNBR</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1967649617547497872">Loolo</a>. It's gonna be golden for sure.
</p>

<p>
But what might the crossover include? The most obvious would be dance emotes based on songs from the film, which each have their own dance routines. I can't wait to see Metal Gear Solid's Solid Snake dancing along to Soda Pop.
</p>
<p>
Skins based on the three Huntr/x singers would also work, considering they're also fighters alongside being in a pop band.
</p>
<p>
Just as KPop is taking over the music charts, games from South Korea are proving extremely popular too - as proven recently by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-runaway-success-on-pc-proves-south-korea-is-positioning-itself-to-become-a-major-force-in-global-gaming-and-experts-agree">the huge success of Stellar Blade on PC</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is set to finally emerge from early access in 2026, developers Pocketpair have announced. There's a lot of work the game about not-Pokémon, guns, and maunfacturing will need prior to that point, say the studio who've been busy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">staring down Lionel Hutzes who probably know the DK rap off by heart.</a> They've also teased that a bunch of new additions are in the works for the 1.0 update. </p>

<p>"While we have a lot of ideas for where we want to take Palworld, we also need to start thinking about Palworld 1.0," Pocketpair communications director and publishing manager John ‘Bucky’ Buckley said in the above video announcement. "Beyond just adding new content there’s a lot of cleanup that needs to be done before Palworld can exit early access.</p>
<p>"It’s no secret that Palworld has a lot of quirks and jank, and we want to take the time to properly address those before releasing the game. With that in mind, we plan to start that cleanup this year. Our goal is to ultimately release Palworld next year, in 2026, and we think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game."</p><p>As a result, the studio plans to be "a little quiet" for the rest of 2025, with the survival game's winter update not set to be as chunky as the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/518574472406499342">Feybreak or v0.4 update</a> it got last December. That said, Buckley did still indicate "a few surprises" are planned for that winter update.</p>
<p>The big tease-a-thon continued, with the community manager declaring that a "truly massive amount of content" is in the works for the 1.0 update that'll bring Palworld out of the early access cocoon it's occupied since January last year. "We plan to share some sneak peeks about Palworld 1.0 in the very near future," he concluded.</p>
<p>Amid releasing updates including the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-palworld-update-adds-crossplay-photo-mode-new-drafting-table-feature-and-cosmetic-armour">crossplay</a> and a Terarria <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/with-palworlds-terraria-collab-now-out-in-the-wild-terraria-will-be-getting-its-own-palworld-crossover-eventually">collab</a> so far this year, Pocketpair have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">getting a publishing arm up and running</a>. Horror game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Dead Take</a> from Tales Of Kenzera: ZAU devs Surgent Studios and retro-handheld-inspired angler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611240/Normal_Fishing/">Normal Fishing</a> are among the titles the studio have helped release or signed up so far. All while Mario gives them the evils from a window across the road.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has sold 3.2m copies on Steam alone since its release, according to analyst estimations.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of its release, Silksong was the most wishlisted game on the platform with 4.8m wishlists. It seems the majority of these have converted into full sales. That's all led to large numbers of concurrent players - Silksong reached a concurrent player peak of over 587k two days after release, making it the 17th most played game on Steam.
</p>
<p>
These sales are according to analysis from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-hollow">GameDiscover</a> in its latest newsletter, which adds Silksong has sold around 500k copies each on PlayStation and Switch (both consoles), as well as reaching 1.5m downloads on Xbox Game Pass.

<p>
Of course, part of that success is down to the popularity of the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. According to GameDiscover's data, there's a 78.78 percent overlap in audience between the two games, with 22 percent of all Hollow Knight players on Steam buying the sequel.
</p>
<p>
The original game sold 15m copies, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-silksong-hasnt-been-in-development-hell-hype-skyrocketed-sales-of-the-original-game-to-give-team-cherry-financial-freedom">sales skyrocketing due to extended hype around Silksong</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another part of that success is the game's price - it came in cheaper than many expected, causing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">debate across the industry around the appropriate cost of indie games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The ever delightful Gearbox CEO, Randy Pitchford, has reminded PC players in his own unique style that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/"> Borderlands 4</a> has minimum spec requirements and it’s not going to work very well on older PCs.</p>
<p>His comments follow PC gamers complaining of performance issues and suggested that players need to “learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game”.</p>


<p>“The minimum and recommended specs are published. The most common hardware is a four year old cell phone. Borderlands 4 is a premium game made for premium gamers. Just as Borderlands 4 cannot run on a PlayStation 4, it cannot be expected to run on too-old PC hardware”, he<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966958001216253985"> tweeted</a>.</p>
<p>“Unlike on PlayStation and Xbox, we cannot prevent a PC player with sub optimal hardware for the game try to play it. So some try and get mad. And some have actual issues we need to fix. And some need to learn how their PC’s work at the high end for this specific game in 2025 and use the tools available to them to find the right balance between frame rate, resolution, and graphics features. This is not a game made to run on 10 year old PC’s – this game uses the full capabilities of modern bus, CPU, and GPU.”</p>
<p>“If you’re trying to drive a monster truck with a leaf blower’s motor, you’re going to be disappointed. If you discover your system can’t run the game well by accident or wishful thinking and/or don’t want to try to mess with settings to make things good enough for you, please use the refund feature on Steam rather than have a subpar experience.”</p>

<p>Below are the PC specifications as stated by Gearbox.</p>

</section></header><div><section>

<p>There's been some fairly heated debate since the announcement of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, over the remastered collection's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2-prices-are-live-and-its-sticker-shock-time">hefty price tag</a>. It's quite a lot of money for a pair of Wii games, as absolutely phenomenal as they are, there's no getting around it.</p>
<p>However, we do already know that the games present at 4K/1080p on Switch 2 (1080p docked on Switch 1), and that they offer up a sprinkling of new features such as a new Assist Mode, a new chapter of Rosalina's storybook, amiibo support, and what's described as "visual enhancements". How very vague of you, Nintendo.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Mario Galaxy</a> has already been re-released not so long ago as part of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection on Switch, and it's this version that those fine folk over at <a href="https://youtu.be/wOF6b0HgxCA?si=v1yUJir69RRo0CpC">GVG</a> have been checking out in a comparison video that gives us hope that we'll get a little more for our money than Nintendo was being clear about.</p>
<p>You can check out the full video above, which includes a playthrough comparison of the five minutes of Super Mario Galaxy's latest port (on Switch) as posted on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Galaxy-Super-Mario-Galaxy-2-2915270.html">Nintendo UK's website</a> versus the one we got with Super Mario 3D All-Stars, giving better examples of texture work that's been done than "visual enhancements" really gets across. Just check out the cobblestones in the area shown below as Mario lands; there's a big difference in the detail.</p>

<p>Cutscenes have also been properly re-rendered this time out, rather than upscaled, which introduced some banding issues in the 3D All-Stars collection - they're now gone, according to GVG. Oh, and the aspect ratio has also been changed to fill the screen. Nice.</p>
<p>Another interesting point to note here is that all the footage on Nintendo's site, it seems, is from the Switch versions of the games, so we've yet to actually get a look at just how they'll appear with the full Switch 2 treatment. Fingers crossed we're in for more of a surprise from these re-releases than first appeared.</p>

This “cleanup” starts this year, with 1.0 coming next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We think taking the time now to fix those problems will ultimately lead to a better game,” Bucky continued. “It means things will be a little quiet from us for the rest of this year.” Related, the upcoming winter update won’t be as big as December 2024’s Feybreak update, although Bucky teased “a few surprises.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">1.0 will be a “major milestone," Bucky continued, “and we have a truly massive amount of content planned for the 1.0 update.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Pocketpair is “experimenting with other ideas for games,” although Bucky insisted “most of the company’s focus is on Palworld.” We will hear about these smaller teams and their ideas soon, he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Palworld news comes as Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile patent lawsuit against Pocketpair soldiers on. Nintendo has been busy obtaining patents — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-should-never-have-received-controversial-summon-character-and-let-it-fight-pokmon-patent-ip-lawyers-say">some of which IP lawyers said should never have been granted</a> — as it develops its case. Meanwhile, Pocketpair has vowed to defend itself in court, and continue to update Palworld along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The case involves <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three patents</u></a> granted by the Japan Patent Office: two related to monster capture and release, and one related to riding characters. All three patents were filed in 2024, after Palworld came out. However, they are actually derived from earlier Nintendo patents dating from 2021. In other words, it seems that once Palworld came on the scene, Nintendo filed divisional patents that were geared to fight specifically against Palworld’s alleged infringement of the original patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20250508" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>has made changes</u></a> to Palworld’s disputed mechanics. The November 2024 patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pokéball-like Pal Spheres (now Pals just materialize next to you when summoned). In May this year, another Palworld update changed how you can glide in the game — instead of directly grabbing onto Glider Pals, now you just simply use Pal-buffed Glider equipment. Then, in July, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-rewrites-patent-mid-case-in-ongoing-lawsuit-against-palworld-dev-pocketpair-but-why"><u>reworded one of the patents in the case</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At GDC in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood"><u>IGN sat down for an extended conversation with Bucky</u></a> following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals. He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>One technical issue the console version of Borderlands 4 is facing is a lack of a customisable field of vision slider, as the game has on PC. Currently the console FOV is low and the zoomed-in perspective is making some players feel sick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-is-pretty-damn-optimal-randy-pitchford-responds-to-borderlands-4-pc-performance-complaints">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford polled console players recently</a> about how strongly they felt about changing this, and three quarters of respondents felt very strongly about it. So, Gearbox appears to be doing something about it.</p>
<p>"We have heard your feedback on FOV (Field of View) sliders on console," <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1967001003422871921">Gearbox announced on the Borderlands 4 X account.</a> "The team is currently exploring how to bring these sliders to both Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 versions. We will continue to read your feedback &amp; prioritise game updates with your experience in mind."</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 had a popular opening weekend but is facing some backlash on PC for its technical performance there. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-exploring-getting-borderlands-4-fov-sliders-on-console">Randy Pitchford took to X over the weekend</a> to tell players they needed to make some graphical trade-offs if they wanted high frame-rates, and suggested high frame-rates weren't, in a campaign-based looter shooter like this, the studio's top priority. "It's not a competitive FPS," he said.</p>
<p>Our Borderlands 4 review is currently in the works.</p>

            <p>
Sales of physical software accounted for just three percent of PlayStation sales last year, according to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2025_E.pdf">latest corporate report</a>.
</p>
<p>
Considering the company's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/24q4_sonypre.pdf">total gaming division sales in 2024</a> were 4,670bn yen (around $31.77bn by today's conversion), Sony still made around $953m in physical software sales (as a rough estimate). 
</p>
<p>
However, that number has dropped from six percent of sales <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/corporatereport/CorporateReport2020_E.pdf">back in 2020</a>. It's no wonder Sony's PS5 consoles are primarily digital-only when fewer consumers are buying physical games, even with the option of a disc drive. Or has there been a decline in physical games <em>because</em> of the digital-only consoles? And with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-playstation-6-is-planned-to-have-a-detachable-disc-drive-on-launch/">reports</a> the PS6 will also be digital-only with an optional disc drive, it's a trend that's only set to continue.

<p>
By comparison, hardware makes up 24 percent of sales, though that's a given considering the high cost of consoles - a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">price that keeps getting higher</a>. That's increased from 19 percent in 2020.
</p>
<p>
Digital software sales, meanwhile, account for 20 percent of revenue - a huge margin compared with physical sales. 
</p>
<p>
Add-on content (DLC, effectively), accounts for 29 percent of sales, the biggest revenue driver of all. It's no wonder, then, Sony is so keen to push live-service games - its report highlights the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, Gran Turismo and MLB The Show, as well as noting the "eagerly awaited Marathon".
</p><p>Interestingly, the proportion of network services sales has dropped since 2020 from 17 to 14 percent (perhaps due to the rise in hardware sales). However, since 2022, monthly active users have increased 14 percent to 124 million accounts in 2024.</p>

<p>
Another reason for the lower physical software sales last year could be the limited number of first-party games released, which tend to be bought more as physical editions. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> was the company's biggest release last year, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">sold 1.5m in its first month</a>, but it was otherwise a quiet year.
</p><p>
PlayStation's decline in physical game sales parallels Nintendo's struggles with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>. As game sizes have increased, it's become more difficult to squeeze them onto physical media - that's why Switch 2 uses game key cards that act as a key for a download. But with digital storage at a premium, it means massive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">games like Final Fantasy 7 Remake will take up huge amounts of capacity</a>.

            <p><a href="https://thecrewunlimited.com/home/">The Crew Unlimited</a>, a fan project making Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> playable again following its unceremonious shutdown last year, released yesterday, September 15th. There's been some early issues to rectify, with the developers having put out two hotfixes already and emphasised that they're "not responsible" for any problems caused by people having grabbed "broken/corrupted game files" from "shady sources".</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fan-made-the-crew-revival-gets-a-release-date-a-year-and-a-bit-on-from-the-ubisoft-racers-controversial-shutdown">reported earlier this month</a>, The Crew Unlimited's devs started working on it not long after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play"> pulled the racer's official servers offline</a> in March 2024, rendering it unplayable. Cue a group of fans deciding to set up a server emulator that'd allow them to get it up and running again for players who still had the game files installed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Upon opening up its gullwing doors yesterday, the project quickly ran into some teething issues. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1107329778396172348/1417303193984962570">an announcement on Discord</a> early this morning, project lead whammy4 revealed that the team have performed "over 10 hours of non-stop tech support" out of the gate, and it looks like the majority of the issues have affected folks who didn't already legitmately own The Crew's game files via Steam prior to grabbing The Crew Unlimited.</p>
<p>"It has come to my attention that a lot of you have acquired (by whichever shady methods...) broken/corrupted game files," the developer wrote. "If you have acquired the game files from shady sources then we are not responsible for whether your game works or not. Players with legit Steam copies have had by far the least issues, no wonder. Also, to those who expect swift 24/7 around-the-clock support for them and them personally - I don't want to say rude things in announcements."</p><p>Prior to the project's release, its developers had acknowledged via their <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1246439486641143960/1246479173502107678">Discord FAQ page</a> that while they wouldn't be distributing any of The Crew's game files, "as long as you manage to run the game files, we have absolutely no way to tell a legit copy from a non-legit one, so we just have to let you in."</p>
<p>Around that announcement, the team have put out a number of fixes. The first, a launcher update called <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417254654672113735">version 1.1.0.0</a>, fixed the default save "disappearing and preventing the game from logging you in", as well as some DateTime string errors. It also added an 'Apply' button to the cheats section in the hopes of averting some "interface confusion".</p>
<p>That update's been followed by two hotfixes. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417310879262965870">Version 1.1.1.0</a> stopes a default 'TCUPlayer' profile being automatically created and save game names being left blank, while <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1080974618082431018/1227040919836954705/1417332986105430066">version 1.1.2.0</a> rectifies the player being automatically given the username, er, "UserName" instead of the default 'TCUPlayer' due to "a logic error in the launcher" if you clicked play straight away.</p>
<p>I can't remember if I've mentioned this before, but my defining memory of The Crew is not being able to get the Artic Monkeys' 'Do I Wanna Know?' out of my head, no matter what I tried. I'm not sure I wanna know if it's as overplayed in this fan revival.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overseas-publishers-microsoft-want-games-done-quickly-as-possible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overseas-publishers-like-microsoft-want-games-done-as-quickly-as-possible-says-kamiya-who-still-can%E2%80%99t-let-scalebound-go.1298853/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It may be over eight and a half years since Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/action-rpg-scalebound-cancelled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancelled Scale</a>bound, the action game it would publish as a PC and Xbox exclusive from developer PlatinumGames, but Game Director Hideki Kamiya still hasn't let this go.</p>



<p>In the following years, the veteran game designer and director, whose works include Resident Evil 2, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Ōkami, Bayonetta, and The Wonderful 101 among others, often remarked on how disappointed he was in what happened with that project. Earlier this year, he even <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he'd love to resurrect Scalebound someday.</p>



<p>In a fresh interview <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/clovers-interview-kamiya-and-koyama-talk-okami-2-industry-layoffs-and-a-potential-future-with-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with VideoGamesChronicle</a>, he returned to the subject from another perspective: discussing the differences between Japanese and Western publishers.</p>



<p><em>What it feels like when working with Japanese publishers is that the development culture feels closer to mind, and they tend to be more understanding toward creators. On the Japanese side, my impression is that they see you’re trying to make a new invention. They understand the struggle of trying to give birth to something new, and they watch over the process with patience. That’s where I see there’s a difference with publishers.</em></p>



<p>When asked if Scalebound could have made it with a Japanese publisher, Kamiya answered that overseas publishers (like Microsoft in this case) tend to want a game done as quickly as possible. In contrast, Japanese ones might have been more understanding of the difficulties.</p>



<p><em>I do think it would’ve been different. I don’t mean that if it had been a Japanese publisher, the game would necessarily have been completed and released, but I imagine the process itself would have played out differently. Japanese companies tend to be more open to new challenges, and I think the conversations would have been more positive, like, “Okay, so how should we approach this together? For me personally, overseas publishers seem to have a much stronger desire to see a finished product as quickly as possible. If it had been a Japanese publisher, I feel they might have given us more leeway</em></p>



<p>As Kamiya had mentioned before, PlatinumGames did not have a frame of reference for a game where players controlled a dragon and a human character at the same time, which caused problems. Still, having said that, the game director maintains that the ultimate responsibility was his, and with Scalebound's experience, he might work better with a Western publisher in the future.</p>



<p>Kamiya is now working at Clovers, a new studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developing an Ōkami sequel for CAPCOM</a>.</p>

The updated app will now list games from Steam, Battle.net, and other PC storefronts — making it a launcher for games you have installed on your PC.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">has been testing</a> this aggregated library in recent months with Xbox Insiders, but it’s now available to all Xbox PC app users. It’s designed primarily for the new fullscreen Xbox experience that will ship on the Xbox Ally devices, but it’s also part of Microsoft’s efforts to make the Xbox app on Windows <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">the home of PC gaming</a>.</p><p>“When you install a game from a supported PC storefront, it automatically appears in ‘My Library’ within the Xbox PC app, as well as the ‘Most Recent’ list of titles in the sidebar, so you can jump back into your favorite games with just a click,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/15/access-gaming-library-xbox-on-windows-pc-and-handheld/">explains Jason Beaumont</a>, vice president of experiences at Xbox.</p><p>Alongside the library integration, Microsoft is also rolling out a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities">new My Apps section</a> in the Xbox PC app that allows PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and rival storefronts. This new feature is also designed primarily for handhelds, to help people download and launch games from multiple stores.</p><p>Later this month, Microsoft will also add cloud-playable games and game history to the Xbox app that syncs your recent games list on Xbox consoles, PC, or handheld. Microsoft already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/767697/xbox-cross-device-play-history-cloud-gaming">started rolling this out</a> on Xbox consoles last month. “Once this feature is released, look for the ‘Jump back in’ list on the Home screen of your console, PC, or handheld to find your recent play history and pick up where you left off,” says Beaumont.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/778627/microsoft-xbox-pc-app-stream-integration-stores-update#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/778627/microsoft-xbox-pc-app-stream-integration-stores-update]]></content:encoded>
