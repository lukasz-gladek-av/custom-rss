<p>It was recently discovered that Jagex, the long-time developer behind RuneScape, has filed for a trademark in the United Kingdom for ‚ÄòRuneScape: Dragonwilds‚Äô, an unheard-of game. It‚Äôs regarded as being computer software first and foremost, but it‚Äôs also representative of what could be interpreted as merchandise lines, suggesting it‚Äôs a full-fledged project at Jagex.</p>



<p>The running consensus is that this is Jagex‚Äôs open-world survival game, which is being built in UE5. This isn‚Äôt a <strong>new thing</strong>, as Jagex has been actively seeking play testers for a while at survival.runescape.com, but it could be the first glimpse we‚Äôve got at the game‚Äôs identity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-into-the-dragonwilds">Into the Dragonwilds</h2>



<p>It was revealed several months ago that Jagex is working on an open-world survival game aligned closely with the core RuneScape universe. What that game will look like, nobody knows, but this latest <a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00004168748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trademark filing in the United Kingdom</a> puts us one step closer to finding out.</p>



<p>RuneScape: Dragonwilds is the name we‚Äôre working with, but that doesn‚Äôt give much away.</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt Jagex‚Äôs first foray into the survival genre, though. In 2018, Jagex was the publisher bringing SCUM to life, which is one of the most well-reviewed survival games on Steam. At the time of writing, SCUM had secured 87,300 ‚Äòmostly positive‚Äô reviews.</p>



<p>What‚Äôs most interesting is that RuneScape: Dragonwilds is being assembled in Unreal Engine 5, which is expected to be a far cry from the ‚ÄòRuneTek‚Äô engine that was used to piece together RuneScape. It might be set in the RuneScape universe, but it‚Äôs likely going to represent a serious technological evolution over what we‚Äôve come to know from the franchise.</p>



<p>As we don‚Äôt know a thing about RuneScape: Dragonwilds, you‚Äôre free to interpret the game as you see fit. What do you want to see from a Runescape-based survival game? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-texas-finally-wins-a-series-as-cdl-major-ii-bracket-is-locked-in.1136199/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-ii-bracket-locked-in-optic-texas-win/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas broke the losing streak of a lifetime last night, beating LAG M8 in the final series of Major II‚Äôs qualifying stage. Until that win, OpTic Texas had been standing under a 0-18 map loss streak, with many at the organisation firmly believing that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they were <strong>cursed</strong></a>. They cited a move into a new room as one of the reasons why their luck turned for the better.</p>



<p>Now, Major II is locked in, and the bracket is confirmed. This will be OpTic Texas‚Äôs home Major, but the team is starting in the worst position possible in the loser‚Äôs run. One loss will mean instant elimination, and fans are harbouring trepidation at the path ahead.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-business">Major Business</h2>



<p>Two teams managed to put up a perfect record during this qualifying stage. LA Thieves managed to secure a series win record of 7-0, while the Vegas Falcons continued a staggering losing streak, landing a record of 0-7. The Falcons have yet to win a single series since entering the Call of Duty League when the season started in December 2024.</p>



<p>The favourite spot for Major II is split between LA Thieves ‚Äì the ‚ÄòSuper Team‚Äô ‚Äì and Atlanta FaZe, which put up a 6-1 record after winning Major I in Madrid in February. It could very easily be back-to-back wins for Atlanta FaZe, but LAT is looking <strong>white hot </strong>right now.</p>



<p>OpTic‚Äôs Pred suggested that ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt matter which‚Äô team the squad faces in the lower bracket, but many have branded that big talk after securing one of the worst losing records in CDL history.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Pred reacts to Major 2 bracket &amp; OpTic facing up against FaZe or RokkrüëÄ

‚ÄúAt the end of the day, it doesn‚Äôt matter which one we have..‚Äù </span></p></article></div>







<p>Per the Major operating model, the first four matches have been locked in and are starting on <strong>March 20</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vancouver Surge v. Carolina Royal Ravens (predicting <strong>Surge</strong>)</li>



<li>Cloud9 New York v. Toronto Ultra (predicting <strong>Ultra</strong>)</li>



<li>Boston Breach v. LA Thieves (predicting <strong>Thieves</strong>)</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr v. Atlanta FaZe (predicting <strong>FaZe</strong>)</li>
</ul>



<p>While the Green Wall is hoping that OpTic Texas gains ground at Major II, plenty of eyes will be on the Vegas Falcons. The team will face either the Royal Ravens or Surge in the squad‚Äôs opening round at the Texas Major.</p>



<p>With a 0-17 loss record in the regular season and a map win percentage of just 15%, the Vegas Falcons represents the worst team we‚Äôve ever seen in the Call of Duty League, but a single win would likely break the internet ‚Äì even if for a short time.</p>



<p>Who do you have winning Major II? Let me know in the comments.</p>

<p>CS:Legacy, a full standalone remake of Counter-Strike 1.6 built from the ground up on Valve‚Äôs official Source Engine SDK, is set to be released on Steam in 2025. The project is being worked on by several former developers of the classic CSPromod project, but could face obstacles in the form of Valve and competition from another classic remake.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-full-remake-of-cs-1-6-is-coming-in-2025">A Full Remake of CS 1.6 is Coming in 2025</h2>



<p>While many current Counter-Strike fans were playing CS2 or watching the ESL Pro League Season 21 finals, the CS: Legacy quietly released an official launch trailer. The standalone remake of CS 1.6 will be ‚Äúbuilt from the ground up with 100% custom code and game assets,‚Äù according to the trailer‚Äôs description. While it will use the official Source engine, it will feature the developers‚Äô ‚Äúown major rewrites to the renderer, shaders and various system.‚Äù</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="CS:Legacy - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PspuiHlF5dM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer showcases many of the original aspects of Counter-Strike that players remember from 1.6, including the classic audio sounds, ragdoll animations, and a remake of the original Nuke map. To support development, the team behind CS: Legacy also created a Patreon which rewards Discord access and your name in the credits.</p>



<p>Some fans are worried if Valve will allow CS: Legacy to release on Steam, but examples like Black Mesa, the fan-made remake of the original Half-Life, indicate that Valve is willing to let it be listed. CS:Legacy isn‚Äôt the only classic Counter-Strike project in the works, as another team is working on Classic Offensive, a remake/mod of CS:GO. However, the Classic Offensive project has run into numerous setbacks. Classic Offensive was shutdown out of nowhere this past January, but even after getting reinstated, it was <a href="https://www.dust2.us/news/59005/classic-offensive-mod-blocked-by-valve-one-day-before-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked by Valve</a> a day before release just this past week. </p>

And, extra-especially, a pirate game that‚Äôs currently on sale? Glory Islands, from Rio Grande Games, typically retails for $45, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/QqX1Wy?object_uuid=43c3d5ed-a42c-47b6-8fab-da36d7aa7029&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon has it on sale</a> right now for the oddly-specific price of $32.17. To save you a calculation, that's a 28% discount. Not bad.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Glory Islands for 28% Off</h2><div catalogid="e2e7f16c-e8b9-4dcf-9e4c-4bf24c3fa05f" id="216792"><div id="216792" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Glory Islands</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In Glory Islands, you‚Äôll be dropping off your scurvy crew onto the spaces in the hope of winning treasure and scoring points via a fun mishmash of different mechanics that adds up to a shipshape whole. Ship movement is governed by playing numeric cards from your hand that also have special powers, such as the five allowing you to pause and drop a second pirate. But be careful, as using too many high-value cards will cost you points at game end. Occupying an island space wins you small bonuses but, once an island is full, it bags a bunch of points for the player with the most crew members there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Glory Islands is a fast, fun, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-friendly board game</a> that doesn‚Äôt have the depth to sustain itself over repeat plays or for hardcore hobbyists, but it‚Äôs plenty enjoyable if you pick it up at sale price. Getting the balance right between doing well in the race, while still hitting the spaces you need to score with your crew and not incurring a penalty for sailing too recklessly is surprisingly hard. And there‚Äôs real tension in watching where other players drop their sailors, as islands you think are in the bag can swing away from you with surprising speed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game also comes with neat wooden ships and sailor pieces, plus miniature barrels of rum you can stockpile to really feel like a miniature pirate king.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Check out more cool board games:</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance writer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

But that was long, long ago, and the immortal god‚Äôs children, now locked away in the underworld, are but malevolent powers who leech their influencer into the kingdom of Lethe. But who are you? Well, you‚Äôre just a member of a guild, trying to survive the grim and ghastly world of <i>Doomsong</i>.</p>

<h2><b>What Is </b><b><i>Doomsong</i></b><b>?</b></h2>

<p><i>Doomsong </i>is a brand new Tabletop RPG created by Jack Caesar, Chris Caesar, and Morgan Finley (illustrator), published by Caesar Ink. In this game set on the verge of a biblical apocalypse, players take on the role of guild members struggling to eke out an existence and survive in the treacherous kingdom of Lethe.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=ZLedlZa5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-travelers.jpg?itok=l4tC_XGO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With a core rulebook coming in at nearly 300 pages, as well as additional materials already available for purchase like the adventure <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us</i>, printed maps and calendars, and more - <i>Doomsong</i> is hitting the market ready to make a splash.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Revels In Simplicity</h2>

<p>The core mechanic of <i>Doomsong</i> can, essentially, be boiled down in wonderfully simple terms: your character makes checks by rolling a d6, and the player will consult their character‚Äôs traits and abilities to make a case for why their roll should be higher.</p>

<p>With many of the difficulty checks set at 5, you‚Äôll need those traits to add to your roll. Is your character from the slums with the Slumcaste trait? Then you‚Äôll have an easier time navigating the city and get a +1 to your roll. But traits can be hindering, too. For example, if the same character from the slums wants to impress a noble, that Slumcaste trait could end up giving them a -1 to their roll!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=-2vqodas 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-attack-sequence.jpg?itok=Dr2uXdvA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Combat follows a similar logic, with the difficulty of the roll to attack set by your opponent‚Äôs toughness. As you hack away at your opponents (and they do the same to you), that toughness level will drop (damage is dealt to a character‚Äôs toughness, there‚Äôs no HP as it were), making it easier and easier to hit them with each successive strike.</p>

<p>But combat also has a great dice-assignment mechanic to it. Each PC has two dice that they assign at the start of their combat round to various actions. The faster they happen, the less powerful, the longer they take to go off in a round, the more valuable or powerful the action. It's a great way to handle what ends up being a really interesting, mixed activation initiative.</p>

<h2>The World of <i>Doomsong</i> is Rich and Deep</h2>

<p>While you can pick this game up <a href="https://caesar.ink/shop" rel="nofollow">off the shelf</a> (or off of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499566/doomsong" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a>), learn the basic mechanics, and set your table off on their (not so) merry way, <i>Doomsong</i> really rewards GM‚Äôs who are into the world building, into the lore, and take the time to read through the book.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=QO1dNOzM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-fish-monster.jpg?itok=WHP8Cnmo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That‚Äôs the experience I had with this game. I sat down and read this book cover to cover, totally engrossed in the world created here. Subway ride after subway ride to and from the day job, I had my nose stuck in this book, learning about the various powers that shape and control the Kingdom of Lethe.</p>

<p>Ruled by a vicious ecclesiastical government who seeks to root out and destroy any who perform heretical magic (as all supernatural power comes not from the dead true god, but his ruinous children), and set in a low-magic world that is, for lack of a better term, falling apart at the seams, <i>Doomsong</i> and its world was right up my alley.</p>

<p>For fans of medieval horror like myself, sometimes playing this game feels like the TTRPG equivalent of the baroque, terrifying, chokingly religious vibe of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543121-between-two-fires" rel="nofollow"><i>Between Two Fires</i></a>, which is‚Ä¶ just about exactly what I‚Äôm looking for in a game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=CEweoPbh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-enemy.jpg?itok=hQOfXQFo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game contains a full bestiary of nasty adversaries, from your common mercenary to talking bears, stomping giants to the Sublime demi-god named Hope (not as good an entity to run into as the name implies).</p>

<h2>Death is a Fact of Life in <i>Doomsong</i></h2>

<p>This is not the kind of roleplaying game where you create your character, kit them out with incredible gear, and set out to avenge the murdered one true god. Not by a long shot. <i>Doomsong</i> is a game that revels in its own lethality, and encourages players to think of their characters as one part of a great story, actors who can - at any moment - exit stage left.</p>

<p>In my first game with my table, after a bit of carousing with other members of the Ratcatchers guild, they set off to find out why a church bell won‚Äôt stop ringing (I pilfered a few of my favorite adventure hooks from the <i>Lord Have Mercy Upon Us </i>campaign book for my custom campaign), and were soon ambushed by robbers on the road.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=Ou39HPxg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-villagers.jpg?itok=EEyq8SFJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A fair fight, weighted slightly in my players‚Äô favor, and still they left the fight bruised, banged around, and with one of my characters missing an eye! That was just the first fight, with little nobodies in the grand scheme of the bestiary. What a rush!</p>

<p>And the one thing I think <i>Doomsong</i> does <i>so</i> right here to soothe some of that sting from a highly lethal game is simple: character creation is quick and really, really fun.</p>

<h2><i>Doomsong </i>Character Creation - Roll With It!</h2>

<p>In <i>Doomsong</i>, creating your character is all about rolling on tables and making decisions based on those rolls. First, you roll on the Origins table to see where you‚Äôre from, originally.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=Eu1uH98u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-character-origin.jpg?itok=CpylUMJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You could end up rolling and being from the uncharted wilds of the Weald, born in the slums, from a working family on a farm, the middle class, or wealthy elite (or you could be something really strange/special). After determining your birthplace - which does make a lot of difference in the world of <i>Doomsong</i> - you‚Äôll be instructed to turn to another page to resolve another life path roll.</p>

<p>Rolling on that table may offer you options, and this is where you acquire traits, abilities, and sometimes (though its more rare) starting gear: do you gain some new trait from having lived at one time as a performer? Were you a soldier in the army? Only the dice (and your own decisions you make throughout) will tell.</p>

<p>In this way, character creation is fun and fast, and does an incredible job of mixing intense randomness through dice-rolling with giving you choices and options throughout. Hell, you can even die during character creation!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=fkbBHK1p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doomsong-lifepaths.jpg?itok=wzKD_ssK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><i>Doomsong </i>TTRPG - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>And that‚Äôs why I love <i>Doomsong</i> so much, every step of the way you‚Äôre</p>

<p>invited to truly choose your own adventure, from character creation on up to how you interact with the world, it‚Äôs the perfect blend of gritty details (do you have enough food to last your journey) and abstraction (your weapon gives you a +1 to your roll‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs usually it).</p>

<p>With absolutely stunning artwork that truly evokes a feeling of dread, and gameplay that is as entertaining and thought-provoking as it is brutal, <i>Doomsong </i>is an absolute must-try for fans of classic RPG‚Äôs, and for players who want to get away from the plot-armor of other big-name fantasy RPGs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Give it a try, there‚Äôs even <a href="https://caesar-ink.itch.io/doomsong-demo" rel="nofollow">a free download of trial rules available on </a><a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow">itch.io</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Metro 2033 is celebrating its 15-year anniversary today, March 16, 2025. Below, we examine how its subtle morality system helped to illustrate its broader points about humanity and violence.</em></p><p dir="ltr">In video games, evil tends to be gigantic. Think of the rivers of blood in Baldur's Gate 3's evil endings or an army of Sith bowing to the player in Knights of the Old Republic. These moments are not exactly comical, but they have a glee to them. They have the joy of a cackling cartoon villain. In some sense, Metro 2033 is no exception. In the wake of atomic devastation, the Moscow metro populates itself with cruel bandits, monstrous mutants, and authoritarian militants. It is grimmer than the prior examples to be sure, but there is still a note of the absurd in its endless cruel men. But the game's ultimate quest, to destroy a mutant army of "Dark Ones" with an atomic weapon, casts the shadow of real-world brutality. Metro 2033 concerns itself with the miniscule decisions and delusions that build up to atrocity, all under an atomic shadow. Unlike most other morality systems, Metro 2033 does not announce itself; instead it builds up the protagonist's character through tiny individual moments: beats of butterfly wings that become a hurricane.</p><p dir="ltr">This works in a simple binary way. Completing certain tasks will net protagonist Artyom moral points. Get enough points and he'll have the opportunity for the good ending. In contrast to other games with morality systems, the player cannot see how many points Artyom has earned. There is only a sound and a flash of light (a more ominous sound plays when Artyom loses moral points). Fittingly, Artyom has humble origins. He is not a soldier. His station is distant from the comparatively sprawling central stations of the Metro and he has rarely left his home. He is as explicit a player-insert as a game like this can muster. More familiar with the world than the player to be sure, but also an outsider and newcomer to most of it. A sort of greatness awaits him. The game opens in media res: Artyom outfitted with military-grade gear and fighting a massive migration of mutants on the surface. But at the start, he is only arrogant because of his youth, not his power. He is incapable of atrocity; it takes an invitation for him to become a monster.</p><p dir="ltr">Metro 2033 opens with Artyom's older friend and mentor Hunter visiting his home station. Hunter is a ranger--a kind of special forces operative who acts as a de facto police officer in the metro. He warns of the Dark Ones, claiming they have destroyed other stations, intoning, "My order has a motto: If it's hostile, you kill it." As he departs to find them, Hunter leaves Arytom with his dog tags, telling him to warn the Metro's central government at the "polis" station should he not return. Hunter trusts Arytom with this task, because of his liking for him--not because of any special ability or skill he has. Doing a favor for a friend is a long way from dropping a bomb.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="524212093" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Artyom's accumulation of allies and weaponry, but in the sense of emotional capacity for harm. There's a lot of downtime in Metro 2033. The gas-lamp markets and claustrophobic bedrooms of the stations act as spaces to breathe between the dark wasted corridors of the train lines and the barricaded, hostile settlements of bandits and fascists. Outside of the stations, Metro 2033 has a survival-horror quality: horrific monsters, limited ammo, and wasted environment. But the stations themselves act as tours for the mundane life of the Metro's citizens. Beggars plead for money, domestic disputes bleed through thin walls, and conversations wait to be overheard. Arytom does more than fight monsters. He can give to beggars or ignore them. He can chat up the station's inhabitants or blow right past them. In other words, Arytom can avoid atrocities by paying attention to other people. But generosity is only a part of it.</p><p dir="ltr">The morality system also values this attention even when it isn't applied to human beings. The Metro's economy is based on military-grade bullets, which can be spent outright or used as powerful ammunition on their own. On the irradiated surface, Artyom must wear a gas mask, but its filters deplete quickly; he must scavenge or buy more to survive. These systems in combination encourage Arytom to search for materials to aid his journey. Finding caches left by dead rangers or even examining the corpses themselves will net Artyom more moral points. Levels are linear, but labyrinthian. The game rewards the player when they explore its margins or off the path set for them.</p><p dir="ltr">In a sense, Metro 2033‚Äôs emphasis on the path less taken makes it an anti-military shooter. Even at their most expansive, Call of Duty campaigns are focused on objective markers and straightforward, set-piece level design. Metro 2033 takes cues from this, but often allows for multiple approaches. Its UI is absent of any path indicators. When it slips into a more military-shooter mode, it is when Arytom has a guide, someone else, often a soldier, to show him the way. But even in those moments, the morality system still tracks deviations from the path and rewards them.</p><p dir="ltr">In other words, when Arytom obeys orders, he kills innocents. Hunter attributes violence to the Dark Ones, but Arytom never actually sees it occur. Instead, Arytom sees them looking at him and they scuttle off into shadows when he returns their gaze. Hearsay and rumor make them out to be an existential threat, but experience gives Artyom something else. The Dark Ones dot his journey with visions, mostly of Moscow before the bombs fell. It's a simple message: "Don't do this again." The Atom Bomb rends the world, just not in literal terms, but psychically--spiritually. The Dark Ones are vessels of that loss: prophets that seek to prevent its second destruction.</p><p dir="ltr">Mountains of individual decisions led to the atrocity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, even though we tend to lay it at the feet of men like Truman and Oppenheimer. But even these men were composed of small choices. American Prometheus, the biography upon which Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is based, gives its subject curious virtues. They are the very traits that made Oppenheimer a charismatic and affable figure that enabled him to build the bomb: his powers of persuasion, his ability to comprehend and summarize complex information, and his consideration for the many people who worked under him. What does it mean to be a "good" person, even someone with strong moral convictions, when what you build is death? It would be easy to blame Oppenheimer's sins and deficiencies for the bomb, but there is often a stronger connection between the first atomic weapon and his virtues.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a nuance that Metro 2033 cannot quite manage. If Arytom is caring, generous, and attentive, he will have the opportunity to prevent the Dark One's obliteration. If he is simple and bullish, he will kill them all. But atrocity is woven into mundanity in insidious ways. Even generosity can go hand in hand with violence. One only needs to take a look at the investment portfolios and political donations of philanthropists to bear that out. There is a simplicity to Metro's moral fable that undercuts its aspirations.</p><p dir="ltr">But Metro 2033 still has power, not just for its sheer subversion of military shooters, but its apocalypse mood. Light is soft, scant, and diffuse. Darkness is dank and all-enveloping. What plant life appears is gnarled and dead, twisted like the metal of the Metro infrastructure. The shadows of ghosts stand in flashlight brightness, vanishing with the click of a switch. The world is haunted. Metro 2033's journey is Arytom deciding whether he will be haunted too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fromage-review-say-cheese<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It‚Äôs the early 20th century, and as an artisanal French cheese maker, your to-do list keeps growing! There‚Äôs the cheese to make, of course, but do you have everything you need for the cheese festival? Are you ready to deliver your cheese around France? These questions, and more, curdle players in the all-new board game <i>Fromage </i>designed by Ben Rosset &amp; Matthew O'Malley (<em>The Search for Planet X</em>), and published by R2i Games.</p>

<h2>What Is <i>Fromage</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is a simultaneous worker placement board game where players take on the role of French cheesemakers, trying to gain prestige points to become the best in all of France.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>Fromage</i> Stats:</p>

<ul><li>1 - 4 Players</li>
	<li>Est. Game Time: 30 - 45 min.</li>
	<li>Game Genre: Simultaneous Worker Placement</li>
	<li>Complexity: Medium+</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>In the game, you‚Äôll use your limited amount of workers to make cheese and place that cheese in various parts of a rotating board. Each player has 15 cheese tokens, and the game ends when one player places their final token. From there, you‚Äôll tally up points you gain in four different sections of the board, and your own personal player mat, and the player with the most points wins.</p>

<p><i>Fromage </i>is all about carefully planning out your turns to balance using your limited workers - of which you only have three - either to gather resources (needed to gain various benefits), or to make cheese on the quadrant of the board currently facing you.</p>

<p>And that‚Äôs the most crucial part of <i>Fromage</i>, in my opinion, that bit about ‚Äúcurrently facing you.‚Äù Implementing a unique rondel component for the central board, you‚Äôll assign your workers to the quarter of the board facing you at the table.</p>

<p>Then, once everyone has played their workers and the round ends, the board rotates one quarter of the way around. You recover any worker of yours currently pointing at you when the board rotates. Less valuable/quicker actions will have your worker pointing at you the next turn of the game, but longer actions could take up to three turns.</p>

<h2>So Much To Do At The Dairy Farm!</h2>

<p>I love this style of worker-placement game, where you have so many options, and can see so many different paths to victory laid out ahead of you. The four main quadrants of the board, called venues, each offer a tantalizing way to earn victory points - but you‚Äôll only see them once every four spins.</p>

<p>First, there‚Äôs the Festival venue, where you‚Äôll show off your cheeses to crowds at a cheese festival in the town square (I want to go to a cheese festival in <i>my</i> town square!), and you score points by making orthogonally adjacent cheeses on the game board grid.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=0OpTG3M9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-board.jpg?itok=2KcdbU75 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The entire Fromage board offers so many possibilities in each of the four different villes. In front of us is the Fromagerie ville.</figcaption></figure><p>The Fromagerie venue is all about placing down cheeses on shelves to gain immediate resources in return, and you‚Äôll score in the end for have cheese on different shelves. This is a great venue for trading some lighter points for useful resources like fruit (which some cheese spots across the four venues call for).</p>

<p>Third is the Bistro venue, where you‚Äôll offer up your cheeses at a prestigious French restaurant for pairings. Each time you successfully pair two cheeses of your own on the same table, you‚Äôll increase the value of all your cheeses at this venue.</p>

<p>And finally there‚Äôs the Villes venue, which is - I‚Äôm not joking - a fun little area control portion of the game where you‚Äôre trying to deliver cheese to cities across France to grow your customer base.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=EGl2DqYQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-territories.jpg?itok=lkz3v8S0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villes invite friendly local competition.</figcaption></figure><p>There‚Äôs so much to do, and it would be in your best interest to mostly ignore some of these venues and focus on gathering resources and honing in on one section - but that‚Äôs easier said than done when every rotation of the board opens up new possibilities.</p>

<h2>Fromage Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can tell from this review, I‚Äôm totally enamored with <i>Fromage</i>. I think this is an absolutely unique gameplay style, with a fun and innovative approach to worker placement that I‚Äôve not come across previously.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like how each venue feels very different from one another, and though I didn‚Äôt cover it much here in this review, you have your own player board that allows you to stash resources needed to gain extra points and build up your farm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=xQb1R2HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fromage-player-board.jpg?itok=w5Le4PE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrade your player board to help boost your cheese production and reputation!</figcaption></figure><p>Though the order cards, and some upgrades to your farm, feel a little under-ripened (who has enough time in this game to devote to special orders and fully upgrading?), it all works together to hint at many different areas of opportunity to score points.</p>

<p>All said, if you‚Äôre looking for a new take on worker placement, then it may just be time to get cheesy with <i>Fromage</i>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/630856/angry-miao-am-infinity-mouse-gaming-price-specs-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Angry Miao is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23312108/angry-miao-cyberblade-anc-earbuds-am-hatsu-mechanical-keyboards-arthouse-design-tech">ridiculous</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204005/angry-miao-am-rgb-65-nintendo-game-boy-mechanical-keyboard-price-specs">over-the-top</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24277781/this-655-keyboard-is-wired-only-because-it-has-to-power-389-leds">mechanical keyboard</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23416961/angry-miao-adjustable-flex-alice-mechanical-keyboard-anime-availability-specs-price">designs</a>, but now it‚Äôs made a gaming mouse that‚Äôs, you guessed it: ridiculous and over-the-top. It‚Äôs also cool as all hell, starts at $125 on a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/angrymiao/am-infinity-mouse-gaming-mouse-with-unlimited-battery-life">Kickstarter preorder special</a> ending March 17th, and may be my new favorite mouse. </p></div><p>The AM Infinity Mouse has a skeletonized magnesium-alloy shell that weighs just 49 grams, making it one of the lightest full-size mice on the market. Within its hollowed-out, super lightweight black chassis is a magnetic battery that can be popped out and swapped in seconds. A spare is kept charged and at the ready on the mouse‚Äôs 2.4GHz receiver. This functionality gives the mouse its name, as Angry Miao claims hot-swapping equals ‚Äúinfinite‚Äù battery. Just like how my fridge has infinite ice cubes, obviously.</p><p>The Infinity Mouse‚Äôs more conventional features include an 8,000Hz polling rate for minimal input latency, even with high-refresh monitors. Its PixArt <a href="https://mechkeys.com/blogs/news/pixart-introduces-paw3950-upcoming-flagship-optical-sensor-for-gaming-mice">PAW3950 optical sensor</a> is capable of 30,000 DPI so you can make the mouse as ridiculously sensitive as you want. And its new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDl6HXIYgeI">TTC Orange Dot Optical V2 micro switches</a> have a nice tactile click, sensitive enough to confidently register when pressing anywhere on the left and right mouse buttons (even up near the mouse‚Äôs center). Its forward and back buttons on the left side are see-through blue in this pre-production model, but Angry Miao says they‚Äôll be black on final units expected to ship in June.</p><p>In addition to the 2.4GHz connectivity enabled through its RGB-illuminated dongle / battery charger, the mouse also supports Bluetooth and wired USB-C. (In wired mode without a battery, it‚Äôs just 39 grams). Angry Miao claims that when using 8,000Hz polling over 2.4GHz wireless you can get up to 17 hours of continuous use before having to swap its 340mAh battery. That‚Äôs ample time for it to recharge on the receiver. And if you bump the mouse down to 1,000Hz the estimated battery life extends to 43 hours.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The wireless receiver puck has RGB lighting that shows charging status once you swap batteries.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I expect the most polarizing aspects of the AM Infinity Mouse to be the aesthetics and the ergonomics of its open design. The open look may not be to everyone‚Äôs liking, especially if you don‚Äôt want to deal with dust buildup on your mouse‚Äôs circuitry. While plenty of other mice have had cutouts for the sake of weight savings, they‚Äôre usually much more conservative honeycomb patterns. The Infinity Mouse leaves just the bare-minimum of metal. Angry Miao claims it pursued this design upon inspiration from the <a href="https://www.carscoops.com/2022/04/the-evanora-imagines-the-ultimate-lotus-speedster-for-the-track/">Lotus Evanora</a> concept and late-1970s <a href="https://media.lotuscars.com/en/heritage-race-cars/lotus-type-79.html">Lotus Type 79 F1 car</a>, and it does look like a small sampling of automotive art on your desk.</p><p>But like a race car, the Infinity Mouse and its massive cutouts may not comfortably accommodate everyone. My average hands feel perfectly fine gripping the Infinity Mouse, but none of my fingers or palm touch points fall directly on an edge. If you have small hands and rest your palm harder on the base of your mouse, you may feel differently about this one‚Äôs comfort.</p><p>I love this thing. Like Angry Miao‚Äôs keyboards, it‚Äôs a striking design piece to have on your desk. But unlike its boutique mechs, the Infinity Mouse is priced much more logically. I‚Äôm no esports competitor, but I‚Äôve used my share of quality gaming mice from the likes of Logitech, Razer, and SteelSeries ‚Äî and I regularly use an older Logitech G Pro Wireless.</p><p>The Infinity Mouse has great tactile click sounds, it feels snappy and solid, and its movements on a desk mat are nice and smooth. It makes my 80g Logitech feel a little hefty by comparison, and its swappable batteries are a treat. I never have to worry about pulling a cable out to clutter up my desk while the mouse charges.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->17</strong><span><figcaption><em>Here are a whole bunch of macro detail shots of the Infinity Mouse, if you‚Äôre like me and like staring at every square inch of this thing.</em></figcaption></span></p></section><p>I know you can free yourself of mouse charging woes with something like a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23005435/magic-mouse-apple-logitech-powerplay">Logitech G Powerplay</a> (of which my mouse is actually compatible). But that Qi-based charging pad alone costs over $100 and still requires a cable stretching across your desk. The Infinity Mouse‚Äôs receiver can just discreetly hang out at the perimeter of your desk (even more so if you turn off its RGB lights) and have your fresh charge ready for you in a snap. A mouse that uses AA or AAA batteries is arguably just as hot-swappable as the Infinity Mouse and costs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-LIGHTSPEED-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07CMS5Q6P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">as little as $30</a>. But any old mouse like that is not going to look this cool or feel this smooth. And dealing with disposable batteries is a wasteful nuisance that I personally, strongly dislike.</p><p>There‚Äôs a lot of marketing hype around high-performance mice being tuned for esports-level performance and giving you a competitive edge. The reality is, most people are not able to take full advantage of a mouse or other peripheral to make much of a difference in their KDR or how often they land the dub. But let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs fun to pretend our tools enable us to perform our best, even when we know it‚Äôs overkill. The Infinity Mouse has those fancy specs like a lot of other mice out there, but it‚Äôs also got a truly unique design and some handy functionality benefits.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

<p>Recently, a clip surfaced online showcasing an AI-driven version of Aloy from the Horizon series. The real-time AI bot was shown having a conversation with a human, responding to questions while standing in an in-game environment. The clip was subsequently taken down, but not before it reached Aloy‚Äôs actor, Ashly Burch, who raised key concerns.</p>



<p>She was advised by Guerrilla Games that the AI bot didn‚Äôt reflect anything in development, nor did it use her motion capture or vocal talents, but it‚Äôs still enough to set a worrying precedent about the character ‚Äì and all other characters voiced by such iconic performers.</p>



<p>We‚Äôve been here before ‚Äì a while ago, I interviewed Doug Cockle (Geralt, <em>The Witcher</em>) about AI voice replication, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doug-cockle-ai-voice-replication/">he labelled it ‚Äòtheft‚Äô</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-i-feel-worried-about-this-art-form">‚ÄòI Feel Worried About This Art Form‚Äô</h2>



<p>In a clip <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734">uploaded to TikTok</a>, Ashly Burch addressed the current SAG-AFTRA strike, which is taking place <strong>because </strong>AI technology exists. She stressed that voice actors are asking for ‚Äòprotections‚Äô against AI replication, which is arguably the biggest concern troubling actors ‚Äì and it has been for the last year or two.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I feel worried, not because the technology exists, not even because game companies want to use it, because of course they do, they always want to use technological advancements, I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone‚Äôs performance attached to it.</p>



<p>That does have someone‚Äôs voice, or face, or movement, and the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn‚Äôt have any protections, any way to fight back, and that possibility, it makes me so sad. It hurts my heart, it scares me.</p>



<p>I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ashly Burch has long fought for the betterment of the VA vertical. Almost a decade ago, she was unable to reprise her role as Chloe Price in <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</em> because she was striking with hundreds of other actors on the grounds of compensation rates and pay scales in the industry.</p>



<p>We‚Äôve seen many actors fight back against AI replication. On social media, Roger Clark (Arthur Morgan, <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>) and Ned Luke (Michael de Santa, <em>GTA 5</em>) have been outspoken against videos using AI versions of themselves ‚Äì even if those videos are silly parodies or memes. </p>



<p>In September 2024, Jennifer Hale <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jennifer-hale-ai-voice-acting/">went on record as saying</a>, ‚ÄòAI is coming for all of us.‚Äô</p>



<p>Do you think voice actors are right to be concerned about the sharp rise of AI replication? Let me know your thoughts in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-files-defamation-suit-media-outlets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard, has filed a suit in Delaware against G/O Media, naming Kotaku and Gizmodo specifically. The suit complains that both outlets attempted to smear Kotick by ‚Äògoing out of their way‚Äô to besmirch his name by mentioning false, withdrawn allegations of discrimination and workplace harassment.</p>



<p>It was claimed by Kotick that articles were penned with the ‚Äòmalicious purposes of causing further harm‚Äô to his name, which was at the time already considerably tarnished.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seeking-damages">Seeking Damages</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://courtconnect.courts.delaware.gov/cc/cconnect/ck_public_qry_doct.cp_dktrpt_frames?backto=P&amp;case_id=N25C-03-157&amp;begin_date=&amp;end_date=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delaware suit</a> filed by Bobby Kotick is pretty basic on the surface, but details of the complaint were obtained and published <a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/former-activision-blizzard-ceo-sues-over-news-articles-accusing-him-of-workplace-harassment-discriminatio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Courthouse News Service</a> on March 13.</p>



<p>The complaint from Kotick reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Neither article had anything to do with Activision. </p>



<p>Both were about rumors that Kotick was interested in buying TikTok. Yet, Kotaku and Gizmodo went out of their way to include withdrawn, false allegations relating to workplace issues which G/O Media knew had been conclusively disproven by numerous investigations ‚Ä¶ purely for the malicious purposes of causing further harm to Kotick.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The articles in question were reports published by Kotaku and Gizmodo about the claim that Bobby Kotick was part of a cabal looking to acquire TikTok in the United States. For reference, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bobby-kotick-buy-tiktok/">I also covered those claims</a>, but I neglected to insult the man or bring up his troubled past at Activision Blizzard, aside from mentioning what employees were saying about him on social media.</p>



<p>But that‚Äôs probably why I‚Äôm not being sued.</p>



<p>Courthouse News Service noted that Kotaku and Gizmodo updated their articles to remove more negative terminology, but Kotick insists that, as a general rule, they‚Äôre still ‚Äòmischaracterising‚Äô him, and he‚Äôs seeking damages. </p>



<p>Stay tuned to see how this unfolds.</p>

            <p>
I get that in-world the whole appeal of Dune's Arrakis is all of that spice it harbours, but to be honest the giant sandworms are a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Even still, I have to  admit that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> looks pretty neat even with that ever present threat, and a new trailer all about exploring the desert planet that dropped this week has helped pique my interest a little further. For starters, that desert bike looks pretty nifty, my time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> taught me that I love a good zoom through beautiful, sandy vistas, and this looks to be similar, even if Dune: Awakening's world is a bit more hostile.

I'm glad that like many games before it, it's copying Breath of the Wild's climbing so you can scale pretty much any clifface. Once you're up there you can do the video game staple that is scanning your environment to reveal the nearby area on your map, which will highlight shipwrecks or abandoned testing stations. You know, the Ubisoft effect. What actually makes that kind of interesting are the coriolis storms.

Most of the times storms in video games are just about blocking your vision, preventing you from going somewhere, maybe making it harder for you to be seen by enemies and vice versa, but Dune: Awakening's coriolis storms change the entire map every single week. Being an online survival game, obviously this is something to keep players coming back so that it feels fresh week to week, but if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> can execute it well it could make for an interesting time, the headaches for cartographers aside.
</p>
<p>
If you're eager to jump into the game, you can't quite do that yet because it's not out until May 20th. However! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/its-time-to-create-a-character-and-benchmark-a-sandworm-in-dune-awakening-assuming-youre-buying-it-in-may">You can already make your character ahead of its release</a>, so you've got plenty of time to make a cooler, more sci-fiy version of yourself, or some nightmarish creation you post on social media for 11 likes.

            <p>
Remember when Nvidia announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> RTX mod way back in, crikey, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-rtx-mod-brings-ray-tracing-and-dlss-to-another-valve-classic">2023</a>? Yeah, I didn't realise how long it had been either. To be perfectly honest I thought it had already come out, but apparently not, because just this week Nvidia shared that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2-rtx">Half-Life 2 RTX</a> is getting a demo next week on March 18th. No, the full mod still doesn't have a release date, but when do any game projects ever release quickly after they were announced?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo will specifically let you play through the Ravenholm and Nova <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prospekt">Prospekt</a> levels, and a <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-half-life-2-rtx-demo-launching-march-18/">really long blog post from Nvidia</a> has desperately tried to make it clear all of the ways this mod supposedly makes the original game look better. Apparently "every aspect of each level has been upgraded" and everything from weapons, to enemies, to skyboxes have all been remade.
</p>

<a aria-label="Half-Life 2 RTX | Demo with Full Ray Tracing and DLSS 4 Announce" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j31ISEd8xRM?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>
Nvidia's blog post lets you do that thing where you can slide an image back and forth to see what it looks like with RTX on and off, and to be perfectly honest, most of the time it doesn't look better, it just looks foggier. The original game still looks incredible to this day if you ask me, there's a reason so many people still love it. 
</p>
<p>
Besides, most people aren't going to be able to play the dang thing anyway - the post notes that to "play at the level of detail shown in the screenshots and videos seen in this article, we recommend a GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics card," even if there are ways to supposedly "ensure a great experience on previous-generation GPUs, too." I don't think I want to turn my PC into a jet engine for a 20 year old game, thanks very much.
</p>
<p>
The base version of Half-Life 2 actually got a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/half-life-2-is-20-years-old-and-has-been-updated-with-steam-workshop-support-and-developer-commentary">pretty nice update</a> last November for its 20th anniversary, which folded Episodes One and Two into the main package, and even fixed some old bugs. Cheers for that again, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a>.
