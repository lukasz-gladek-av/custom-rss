            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-q3-2024-financial-report-cites-growth-for-magic-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Hasbro Q3 2024 financial earnings report has been released. The report by one of the world's largest toy and game companies cites a decline in revenue alongside growth with their tabletop properties, specifically the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set and the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 books.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8150e0fd-4d0f-4f25-a904-639e74eb79c2">Hasbro Q3 2024</a> report, the company's revenue decline 15%. Excluding the divestiture of their film company eOne which produced the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> movie</a>, that revenue decline becomes 9%.</p>

<p>But this doesn't mean Hasbro has lost money. In fact, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is marked as a standout in growth for this financial quarter, lead by the release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bloomburrow</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Duskmourn</em></a> sets and set to grow with the recently announced licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel cards</a>.</p>

<p>The wildly popular card game's revenue has increased 3% behind growth in both tabletop and the digital platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-gathering-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, the Hasbro Q3 2024 report states the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 Player's Handbook</a> is the fastest selling product in the fantasy TTRPG's 50-year history, beating plan by over 50%. This, combined with ongoing support for D&amp;D Beyond has lead to more than 19 million registered users on the digital platform alongside 60% increase in revenue.</p>

<p>Before this earnings report went live, Hasbro announced <a href="https://toybook.com/hasbro-organizational-changes-fall-2024/">sweeping organizational changes</a>. This "operational streamlining" of their staff included laying off 100 employees. Among those employees were four <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-hit-with-layoffs-wizards-of-the-coast-impacted.707539/">from Wizards of the Coast</a>, including creator relations manager Dixon Dubow.</p>

<p>Overall, Hasbro has reported a year to date operating profit of $630 million with a $98 million dividend payout to their shareholders.</p>

            <p>I played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> for an hour, had a pleasant time, then uninstalled it. I know a trap when I see one. Perhaps you are made of stronger stuff than I am, however. Perhaps you like that monkey on your back. For you, there's a new free update, which adds a second set of themed card art to the game inspired by the games Binding Of Isaac, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Slay The Spire.

<p>These aren't new cards, they're just card skins and so only make a cosmetic difference to the game. You can switch to the new card art via a new Customise Deck settings menu in-game. Or presumably a "Customize Deck" menu, but I can't bring myself to spell it that way.
</p>
<p>The first Friends Of Jimbo free update dropped back in August and likewise added card art related to four other games: The Witcher 3, Dave The Diver, Vampire Survivors and Among Us. 
</p>
<p>While my time with Balatro was short, other treehouse dwellers here at RPS dove deeper into the decks. Katharine gave it a Bestest Best in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">Balatro review</a>, and made a strong case for the worthiness of spending time with it:
</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, Balatro is a game that delights in the art of making numbers go up - big, fast and on fire - by whatever means necessary. It reels you back in not to exploit psychological weakness, but to celebrate the inherent joy of learning, mastering and beating a system gamed around impossible odds, all while being just a teeny bit naughty in the process. It not only invites you to sit at the table, but openly hands you all manner of scalpels to tear into it, make it bleed, and gut it for everything it's worth - and it will smile and applaud you for it every step of the way. Balatro is very generous, in that sense, even when victories are seemingly few and far between. Indeed, the only way I ever felt cheated by Balatro is when I had to stop playing and not spend more time playing Balatro.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great! I'm still not falling for it, though. Sure, Katharine said all that back in February, but has anyone heard from her since? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fawzi-mesmar-becomes-creative-director-for-beyond-good-and-evil-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It has been a long-term concern by fans of the first game that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was no longer in the works. However, it was recently confirmed that it is, and now we've received news via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that Fawzi Mesmar is joining the team as Creative Director. This was announced publicly on LinkedIn, with Mesmar announcing his new role at Ubisoft Montpellier, after previously working as Vice President of Editorial over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Emile Morel was the previous Creative Director for the title but unfortunately passed away suddenly last year. This led to Mesmar filling the role. This industry veteran has over 20 years of experience in the industry, working for companies such as DICE, King, and Gameloft. He additionally won an Ambassador Award at the 2024 Game Developer's Choice Awards.</p>
<p>For many, this news comes as a shock, as Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, with a trailer being released during Ubisoft's 2017 E3 conference, and there has been very minimal information about the sequel since then. The original director Michel Ancel even left Ubisoft in 2020, and now works in a wildlife sanctuary instead. However, he is now consulting on a new Rayman project.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been any news on Beyond Good and Evil 2, a 4K remake of the original was released earlier this year. However, this meant that the original version of the game was removed, and people were forced to buy the 20th Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>With Beyond Good and Evil 2 still reportedly being in development, this now makes it the longest development time for a AAA game, with Duke Nukem Forever's record being fifteen years. It's said that development has taken so long due to toxic leadership, chaotic direction and constant gridlock when it came to making decisions about how the game was going to look, and what features would be in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to Fawzi Mesmar joining the team, Francide Coldeboeuf is now taking over as Producer on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">struggles Ubisoft</a> has been dealing with their other projects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/"> XDefiant</a> not performing to their expectations, it's quite a surprise that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development all these years later.</p>
<p>However, the title has reportedly passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from the leadership, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. Whether that means that the game is actually progressing nicely is uncertain, and it's anyone's guess as to when the audience will finally see this game come to fruition.</p>

Highlights in the patch notes include more forgiving stealth conditions in “False Flag” and other missions, fewer collisions while riding speeders, more auto-saves while playing, and scaled “wanted” difficulty based on player progression. A bunch of bugs were also addressed, while overall stability and framerate drops are also supposed to be better.</p><p>Unfortunately, the thing many players on PS5 instantly noticed after booting the game up post-update wasn’t any of these improvements but a noticeable visual downgrade with screen tearing, i.e. ripples across your TV while navigating the world and even menus. The problems are particularly bad in performance mode, which is how most people play their PS5 games. </p><p>“I loaded the game up about half an hour ago and noticed the screen tearing immediately, tried fiddling with the settings for a bit but favor quality (40fps) seems the most stable with very little screen tearing compared to the other graphic settings,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the subreddit. “I just hope this gets fixed soon as the visuals are the only thing that game really has going for it and having to deal with screen tearing is just getting in the way of enjoying the game overall.”</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has one more major update planned for November alongside its arrival on Steam on November 21. That patch is supposed to go even more deeply into fine-tuning combat and stealthy systems, with a Lando-based story pack and free new contract mission types also getting added that month. That’s just in time to make it an extra appealing Black Friday discount pickup for anyone who hasn’t already given the Han Solo simulator a try, at least as long as no more visual bugs get introduced along the way. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first will take place a week into the new season, which begins on December 10. Rather than a direct return to the 2-2-2 role spread of the original <em>Overwatch</em>, this test will require the team to have at least one hero of each role, but no more than three per team composition. For example, in a six-person team, you could have one tank, one DPS, and one support, and as long as those are accounted for, the other three players can freely pick whatever hero they want so long as there are no more than three per role. This way you’ll definitely have at least one person on healing and another person to tank, so a group can’t just queue up with six damage heroes.</p><p>The second test will take place midway through the season, but will “incorporate some new principles” from the sequel like incorporating hero reworks and deprioritizing crowd control abilities.

This means you can finally have two tanks again, but they will have the nerfs associated with the open queue format, so they won’t be quite as powerful as they are in the current, standard role-locked play. This will also include a midseason game mode codenamed “Kingmaker” that will reward any player who is the lone person in one role with a “bonus,” but they didn’t get any more specific than that.</p><p>Blizzard says it’s going to look at the reaction to these tests and determine what’s next, but the studio says there’s a possibility that both 5v5 and 6v6 could exist in the game simultaneously, which might be the best of both worlds, though it does sound like a lot to manage for a team that has seen such drastic cuts in the past year.</p><p>This is probably exactly what some folks who miss the days of the original <em>Overwatch </em>were hoping for, but I still find it hard to get too excited about <em>Overwatch 2</em> when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">it’s given me so little in the past two years</a></span>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surgent-studios-unveils-tales-of-kenzera-project-uso.1018881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Surgent Studios, the creator behind Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, has unveiled Project Uso, the next game in the multimedia universe pioneered by the creative mind of Abubakar Salim. In a release issued by Surgent today, it was confirmed that Project Uso will be ‘darker and more visceral than our debut game.’</p>



<p>It’s a return to Kenzera but in a completely alternate aesthetic. Project Uso will be centred around a ‘vampiric android’ that’s designed to house the spirits of the deceased. It’s set to be a crossover between a choice-driven RPG and an ‘electrifying’ beat-em-up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-next-chapter">The Next Chapter</h2>



<p>Recently, Surgent Studios was in the news following the revelation that the games branch of the firm had been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-studios-game-division-redundancies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put on notice of potential redundancy</a>. This news came amid financial struggles and a lack of funding for future projects – including Project Uso.</p>



<p>The press release published by Surgent Studios to mark the announcement of Project Uso bore that message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Surgent Studios has developed a fully-functional prototype of PROJECT USO and is actively seeking a partner to bring it to life.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a statement attached to the press release, Surgent’s founder, Abubakar Salim, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Project Uso is set to be darker and more visceral than our debut game. Where ZAU is about dealing with death in a healthy way, USO is about letting your fear of death consume you. Inspiration struck following the birth of my daughter, when I grappled with a crisis of identity as I took on the role of parent for the first time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Similarly, the concept for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU came about when Salim was wrestling with the untimely loss of his father and trying desperately to figure out how to cope with the grief that followed.</p>



<p>In Uso, players will assume control of a unique RPG system created by Surgent. They’ll have ‘the powers of an android and a god at their disposal’, given that the protagonist houses the spirit of Eshu, ‘the god of chaos’. </p>



<p>At first blush, it sounds a little deeper than ZAU in terms of gameplay mechanics, and the choice-based features should add a little more variety and replayability, whereas ZAU was much more linear and one-track. Project Uso is also set ‘decades’ after ZAU, so the world is much more advanced.</p>



<p>Here’s hoping Surgent manages to find a partner to help produce Project Uso.</p>

			<p>It's not long until the long-awaited release of the next installment in the Dragon Age franchise. Dragon Age: The Veilguard is just around the corner, with a release date of October 31. To celebrate the game being in a countdown period, EA and BioWare revealed the official launch trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. The trailer is just over two minutes long and showcases some of the enemies that players can expect to encounter. The trailer is comprised of gameplay and in-game cinematics to show those interested in the game what they could be experiencing by playing the upcoming title.</p>
<p>To get people excited, it showcases the darkspawn, blighted dragons, and some of the treacherous choices Rook will have to make alongside their companions, which could have a lasting effect on their relationship. Rook and their companions are on a long, perilous journey to defy the gods, which will have consequences depending on their actions. In this game,<a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-speaks-on-how-balancing-reappearing-characters-and-solas-role-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard/"> Solas is front and center</a>, which is a first for the franchise. Solas was first introduced in Dragon Age: Inquisition and had one of the biggest plot twists in the franchise, which led up to Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdtmtuzICOI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This single-player fantasy RPG will be released worldwide on October 31 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. For those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who have pre-ordered the game</a>, you'll receive Rook's Blood Dragon armor cosmetic for the three classes available: Warrior, Mage, and Rogue. Fans have been waiting for this game for 10 years, and the comments under the YouTube video show off all of the excitement of those who love the franchise.</p>
<p>There is also some criticism in the comments, saying that this trailer should have been used as the reveal trailer, as there were a lot of complaints when the reveal trailer came out. However, this trailer seems to be the one that is turning the tide and making people excited for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. If you want to check out the trailer, make sure to check out the video above, which showcases some of what you can expect.</p>
<p>The video showcases stunning graphics and effects, with the world being consumed by blight. There are many different environments that players will get to explore, including bustling cities, empty beaches and catacombs.</p>
<p>If you want to know whether this game will be for you, check out<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hands-on-preview-rook-takes-queen-checkmate/"> our preview of the game</a>, written by Kai Tatsumoto.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/windblown">Windblown</a> looks rad. It's an action-roguelite for 1-3 players in which you dash-and-slash in rapid combat on floating islands, and I am extremely interested in feeling its game-feel for myself. Good news! I can get my game-feelers on it now because it's out in Early Access today.
</p>
<p>If you watch its launch trailer below out of context however, you might be fooled into thinking it's actually the emo second half of an Isekai anime series.

<p>My interest in Windblown is partly driven by its trailers, but also by Motion Twin's previous game, Dead Cells, which was also an action roguelite that nailed game-feel from the off and was fun to follow through its Early Access journey.
</p>
<p>The dash impressed Edwin when he saw Windblown <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-dead-cells-developers-new-roguelike-windsblown-has-a-dash-so-potent-it-makes-the-game-seem-disposable">earlier this year</a>, although he worried it was so powerful and quick it rendered the experience disposable:
</p>
<blockquote>Windblown's dash seems expressive, at times, of deep impatience towards the rest of the game, which sounds perverse on the surface, but makes sense when you consider the roguelike's intrinsic element of repetition. It's a dash dedicated to the experienced player's desire to immediately return to the biome where they last popped their clogs. There are some familiar elements that slow you down, however: boss enemies that must be fought to progress the story, and the basic pressure to defeat foes and gather new equipment, or else get your arse handed to you by an unskippable threat in the next biome along.</blockquote>
<p>Motion Twin reckon Windblown will remain in Early Access for at least a year, but it's already launched in a substantive state with 5 biomes and 12 main weapons. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/">grab it from Steam</a> with a 20% launch discount for £17.59/$20/€20.

<p>The VCT Spotlight Series has officially concluded, crowning GIANTX as the winner. The popular co-ed tournament series was developed to give fans competitive Valorant action during the off-season. With 14 teams participating and a decent-sized prize pool, the series ended with quite a bang.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-vct-spotlight-series-concludes-with-giantx-taking-first-place">VCT Spotlight Series Concludes With GIANTX Taking First Place</h2>



<p>The VCT Spotlight series began back on October 10, 2024, and concluded today, October 24. Held in Paris, the event featured 14 co-ed teams formed from some of the best organizations within the VCT.</p>



<p>From G2 Esports to Karmine Corp, the VCT Spotlight Series was stacked with Valorant talent, and fans were able to witness both women and male competitors face off against one another. </p>



<p>Each team had both women and male members from its roster team up to face off against other organizations with a $32,000 prize pool on the line. In the end, however, GIANTX was able to take home first place by beating G2 Esports in a 3-1 victory.</p>



<p>The organization took to Twitter earlier today to post: “We have taken our revenge and made history by winning the first VCT EMEA mixed competition.”</p>

<p>History was in fact made, and it will be interesting to see how to organization performs next year. </p>

<h2 id="h-prize-pool-competing-teams-and-more">Prize Pool, Competing Teams and More</h2>



<p>The event marks a victorious era in competitive Valorant content, showing that normal tournaments are not the only types of tournaments here to stay. </p>



<p>With a $32,000 prize pool, GIANTX was able to walk away with $16,000. G2 Esports, who finished in second, left the tournament series with almost $11,000 in winnings. </p>



<h4 id="h-all-competing-teams">All Competing Teams:</h4>

<li>NOVO Esports</li>



<li>SK Gaming</li>



<li>Twisted Minds</li>

<p>What’s even cooler is the fact that the event had 26 different nationalities represented by the players. These included Germany, the United States, Palestine and more.</p>



<p>With the event being extremely successful, it will be exciting to see if the prize pool rises for next year’s tournament.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">Few games defined the Xbox 360/PS3/Wii generation as much as Bioware’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect</a> trilogy. Whether you picked the red strawberry, blue raspberry, or green apple ending, characters like Commander Shepard, Wrex, Garrus, and others have become icons among the video game pantheon. Which is to say that when Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz was announced, I was stoked, and even more so when I got an early copy to play for this review. After rolling some dice with my old crew from the Normandy, I have to say, this board game version of Mass Effect is a pretty fun little romp.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Mass Effect: The Board Game – Priority: Hagalaz</h2><div catalogid="7687b88c-2182-47f7-b35c-3978a43574ba" id="207003"><div id="207003" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mass Effect: The Board Game – Priority: Hagalaz</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Designed by Eric Lang and Calvin Wong Tze Loon (both of whom we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-preview">interviewed</a> in our preview) with art by David Benzal, Priority: Hagalaz,<em> </em>in Mass Effect style, is a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign game</a> with branching quests and alternate endings. More than 10 unique missions are neatly bound together in a campaign book containing each missions' map, along with the various objectives (each mission has neutral, paragon, and renegade objectives) and the list of the enemies you'll be facing. This campaign book, paired with a narrative book, handles the story and what the results of your actions turn out to be. Like I said in my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review">review of the Divinity: Original Sin board game</a>, I love that more campaign games are opting to use books for their maps and are shifting away from the cardboard titles to construct the maps yourself. It makes it so much quicker to set up, and that makes this game all that more enticing to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Except for the player characters’ miniatures, the game’s components are full of cardboard tokens. From the enemies and elites to the treasure boxes and objectives, you can expect maps full of little markers. Thankfully, the cardboard is sturdy and punches easily with no tearing or pulling happening with my copy. Still, if you prefer to cram your board with plastic minis, then you can opt to purchase them separately from <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ywY2n?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Modiphius’ store</a>, but expect to pay a hefty price, ranging from about $38 US for a single squad up to $325 US for 48 models (some assembly required and unpainted). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The player boards, one for each available character, is made of a sturdy laminated paper that allows it to be marked up with the included dry-erase marker. Each time a character levels up by gaining enough experience, you mark on the board to keep track of that character’s experience or skills they've unlocked, with one new skill unlockable per mission. It works fine, and so far I haven’t seen much in the way of staining due to the marker, but that being said, I wish that the game had gone with a duel-layered playboard instead with little areas that you would just slot in cubes or cards or something instead of the marker approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on these dangerous missions will of course require a hardened group of soldiers, and Priority: Hagalaz<em> </em>features a great selection of fan favorite Mass Effect <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Squadmates">squadmates</a>. Both male and fem Sheps are available to choose from, with identical skills and stats, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Garrus_Vakarian">Garrus</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Liara_T'Soni">Liara</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Urdnot_Wrex">Wrex</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mass-effect/Tali%27Zorah_nar_Rayya">Tali</a> each come with a unique set of skills that work best in different situations. Garrus, for instance, can take aim and dish out a bunch of damage all at once; Tali can send out her drone; Liara can use her biotics to freeze enemies in place with Statis; Wrex gets mad and takes it out on any unfortunate Cerberus soldier or Reaper near him; and Shepard can inspire and command the troops, letting them perform better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Missions require you to take four party members, one of whom must be Shepard (and loyalty missions require said character as well), which means you will always have to leave one of your alien friends behind on the Normandy. Every character has their own unlockable skill tree, including special abilities that can be learned by taking on their loyalty missions between main mission scenarios. Wrex has by far the best-named skills out of everyone, with attacks like “Wrex not happy” and “Shoot it 46 more times” that are just peak Krogan goodness. There will be missions where Character A will be better suited to handle the objectives than Character B, but Mass Effect is balanced in a way that you are never screwing yourself over if you don’t take that one crew member with you. Strategy and not spreading your team too thin is far more important than its composition, which I find to be faithful to the series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that I really appreciate about Priority: Hagalaz is that it doesn't require players to meet up for a ton of games in order to see the story through to completion. In fact, with each scenario taking maybe 40 - 90 minutes, and each “run” of the story consisting of about five scenarios, you could comfortably make it through a playthrough in a day or weekend. No yearlong-plus commitments here! Now, if you want to see every outcome, then that will require a bigger time commitment and multiple playthroughs, but I wouldn't say that's necessary. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The designers should be commended for putting together a solid and rewarding campaign experience that supports multiple replays but is also welcoming to new players of the genre without much sacrifice. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting into a game is pretty painless. All you have to do is flip to the correct page in the campaign book, pull that level’s enemy tokens from the included cloth bag and place them on the marked spots, grab either the Cerberus or Reaper hazard deck, and finally place your character minis at the starting location and you’re ready to go. The whole process maybe takes five minutes. Learning to play is also a straightforward affair with everyone I taught usually picking it up after a full round around the table. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turns start with the active player <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dice-rolling-board-games">rolling a set of dice</a>, picking three dice and using the face’s displayed actions by placing it on their boards. Then you draw a hazard card to see what enemies spawn or take an action, and then the turn passes to the next player who repeats the same steps. Each subsequent player rolls three less dice for their actions, meaning the last player is forced into whatever they roll – however, everyone but the first player can “lock” one of the dice that the previous player rolled and didn’t use. If you opt to complete the Paragon objectives in stages, you can earn yourself additional dice. Choose Renegade, and you earn special tokens you can use to change the face of a dice you roll.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reduction in dice is an interesting mechanic, but I would have rather have a smaller pool of dice, perhaps five, that everyone rolled as opposed to a shrinking pool of dice. It feels good to roll a lot of dice, giving you a lot of choice, but if you’re stuck at the end, only getting a few dice to roll – or less if you opt to lock in one the previous dice to play it safe – it’s not so much fun. You feel penalized, at no fault of your own, that you are last in the turn order, and I would much prefer giving up my ability to roll 12 dice as first player, if it means someone doesn’t get stuck with only three.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps my biggest issue with this game is the character Shepard and the mechanic that if they get taken out, the whole mission fails immediately. While this may be loyal with how it’s handled in the video games, in those, you never lose control over Shepard and can always move him out of harm's way – something that you can’t do here in the board game. Here, you have four randomly drawn enemy turns standing between you and when you can act next, with no real way to defend yourself if the cards aren’t in your favor. Instead of being the hero of humanity, who would run into any fight alongside their crew, this makes Shepard feel more like a liability or third wheel that should stay at home where it’s safe. I have had more than one mission fail simply because I died, and in one of them I was even at full health at the end of my turn, and everything went downhill before I could take any action. Had the game added a round timer or something that gave the rest of the party a chance to revive him, it may alleviate my issue with this decision, but as written, I quickly stopped wanting to be the person stuck playing as the Commander.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This issue also touches on another aspect of Priority: Hagalaz, which prospective players should know. If you aren’t a fan of uncontrollable randomness in your games, this game may not be for you. From the actions you can take via the roll of the dice, to what enemies may or may not take action (and what character may be attacked), even to what enemies you may spawn by drawing them from the bag, is all left up to chance – chance that you and the other players have no way of mitigating. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz releases this October just in time for N7 day (November 7), with pre-orders available now on <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEV73M?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Amazon</strong></a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aAVmGq?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article&amp;_ga=1596000954.1718032005" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Asmodee</strong></a>, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/92bEvE?object_uuid=572fe1d6-d74f-47c2-916b-151eacfd9d55&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u><strong>Modiphius’ website</strong></u></a>. </p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 24, 2024 6:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Mass Effect: The Board Game - Priority: Hagalaz does a good job adapting the personalities and gameplay of Bioware’s legendary space epic while offering some fun twists to the formula to make it work with this new cardboard medium. While it doesn’t land every shot it takes, it lands enough to make it a worthwhile time for fans of the source material and also campaign-style board game aficionados or newcomers alike. The system is sound and ripe for new modules and expansions with new characters and missions. I would love a more dedicated skirmish map or pack that offers a bunch of maps that are good to fight enemies on and forgo the whole narrative aspect. Until then, I will dream about flying around space in the Normandy and rolling dice with my bros, Garrus and Wrex.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because it skips the part of the game where Aerith leaves the party, she sticks around, and ultimately witnesses her own death at the hands of Sephiroth only to join the battle against Jenova Life moments later.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The biggest skip in FF7 has been found. <a href="https://t.co/HXVfrbOJd4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HXVfrbOJd4</a></p>— Luzbel / ルズベル (@Luzbel789) <a href="https://twitter.com/Luzbel789/status/1848974866516742269?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The actual skip is pretty complex and the kinks are still being worked out. It involves using a Chocobo on the world map to trick the game into letting you walk on the ocean, and then Cloud simply strolls across the water over to Forgotten Capital without doing any of the other stuff required to get there. The cutscene there plays as normal, but the party composition remains what it was before. Kuma's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x02RR6qZb9E" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got a tutorial on YouTube here</a> for anyone interested in trying it themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, there are a lot of asterisks on this skip actually working. For one, if you don't use a version of the game that lets you disable encounters, the skip is impossible, because getting into an encounter while walking on the water will softlock the game. And because Aerith isn't supposed to be in the party at this stage, the game also softlocks whenever there's a scene with the party that she shouldn't be involved in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The community is currently working to try and find ways around this, including <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2282022243" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one agonizing five-hour effort from AceZephyr</a> using pause buffering to avoid encounters while walking across the water. Hopefully they find one, because if it ever becomes viable it will supposedly save runners around two hours, allowing them to blast through disc one faster than ever.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If this has sparked your interest in Final Fantasy 7 again, you don't need to speedrun the original to enjoy it. Final Fantasy 7 Remake and Rebirth are pretty incredible too, and together they cover a sliiiiightly different version of all the story that speedrunners are skipping on ye olde disc one. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">Final Fantasy 7 Remake an 8/10</a>, and Rebirth got a 9/10. Our reviewer wrote: "Final Fantasy VII Rebirth impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion as both a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenge and depth, and as an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>
Following Blizzard's announcement earlier this year it was considering bringing 6v6 matches to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>, having ditched them when it transitioned from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> 1 to its sequel, the studio has now made their reintroduction official: 6v6 will come to Overwatch 2 in the form of two test modes next season, and Blizzard says it'll be 'watching the results closely'
</p>
<p>
When Blizzard <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">revealed it was mulling over 6v6's return</a> back in July, it explained the original mode could have "really high, highs, but reaaaally low, lows" in Overwatch 1, and that 5v5 was ultimately selected for Overwatch 2 in a bid to "raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of some of those high moments." However, the studio acknowledged the changes had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom" and so it was looking at how 6v6 could potentially be reintroduced.
</p>
<p>
And now, four months on from that announcement, Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return. In <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion">new post on the Overwatch website</a>, game director Aaron Keller said the studio will be introducing "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's upcoming Season 14. The first of these is set to launch a week into the season and will be a variation of Open Queue - requiring each team to have at least one of each role but no more than three, with players able to switch roles on the fly during a match as long as the limit isn't broken.

<p>
Blizzard's second 6v6 test will arrive as part of Season 14's mid-season refresh, offering the classic 2-2-2 team composition while incorporating some of Overwatch 2's "new principles", such as less crowd control and hero rework. Both test modes will feature rebalancing specific to 6v6 - such as a reduction in the power and survivability of tanks - but they'll still have their own card in Unranked alongside other modes. Keller says the goal of Season 14's 6v6 format tests is to understand if it "can make the core game even stronger", adding that it'll be "watching the reception and results of these tests closely."
</p><p>
"In the world where a surge of players join this mode and continuously play it, then we have the signal we need to do more with it," Keller continued. "I think what that 'more' is depends on the level of excitement. Is there a world where both 5v5 and 6v6 exist permanently in Overwatch 2? If you had asked me a few months ago, I would have said no. As we've discussed Overwatch 2's future... we know our players can want more than one experience, and it would be something we'd need to consider moving forward."
</p>
<p>
Notably, Blizzard isn't stopping at experimenting with a potential 6v6 mode. It also plans to test variants of Overwatch 2's existing 5v5 mode as part of Season 13, examining the "flexibility within this format". There's a Quick Play: Hacked variant called Limit 2 coming soon, which caps each role per team at two, and there's a mid-season mode called Kingmaker that'll feature Limit 2's role cap while giving a bonus to the player not sharing a role.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard says it'll have more information on all the above "closer to their launches".

            <p>Blizzard announced earlier this year that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzcon-wont-happen-in-2024">BlizzCon wouldn't happen in 2024</a>, with the live event instead being replaced by a series of franchise-focused streams. Next on the schedule is Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct, which Blizzard have now announced will stream on Wednesday, November 13th at 6pm GMT/1pm ET/10am PT.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's a big year for the Warcraft universe and whether you're a Hearthstone fan, you've joined the chaos in Warcraft Rumble, ventured into the world of Azeroth for the first time in Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, or you're a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> player, there's something for everyone in our Warcraft 30th Anniversary Direct stream," according <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24149105/save-the-date-for-warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-on-november-13">to the announcement</a>. "You won't want to miss a moment - or a single surprise."
</p>
<p>The stream will be followed by a 20th anniversary concert celebrating 20 years of World Of Warcraft music.
</p>
<p>World Of Warcraft's The War Within launched earlier this year, but Blizzard have already spoken about it being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/world-of-warcrafts-next-three-expansions-have-been-announced-starting-with-the-war-within">the first in a trilogy of new expansions</a>. The next in line is World Of Warcraft: Midnight, which will then be followed by The Last Titan. 
</p>
<p>An expansion aside, I've no idea what other surprises or announcements could appear at the event. Hopefully something less disappointing than Warcraft 3 Reforged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warcraft-3-reforged-review">turned out to be</a>, and more exciting than a mobile game like Warcraft Rumble.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seemed clear from the show’s start that Aubrey Plaza’s Rio Valda wasn’t exactly who she said she was. Fans had a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-agatha-all-along-mcu-theories-wiccan-mephisto-1851656313">wide array of theories</a></span>, but they don’t have to guess any longer. As some may have suspected thanks to the show’s many hints, Rio Valda is none other than Death herself. This was most obviously hinted at in episode five when a ouija board the coven uses says that Death is in the room with them, which we now know meant Rio Valda. The revelation has an ominous note to it, as Death tells Patti LuPone’s Lilia that all roads lead to her. This is clearly implying that the coven’s journey on the Witches’ Road will lead to their deaths.</p><p>This, tragically, seems to be true, as by the end of episode seven Lilia meets her demise. Before the episode’s flashy finale, however, Patti LuPone steals the show and delivers the performance we’ve all been waiting for. The casting of LuPone was exciting for Broadway fans, as the actress is a legend of the stage known for her killer presence and voice. Given her star power, it came as a shock that LuPone takes the backseat in <em>Agatha All Along</em> for the first six episodes. Sure, she has some good quips in there, but it often felt like the show was scared to let her go all-out and risk her overshadowing the lead performances of Kathryn Hahn and Joe Locke. But in episode seven, LuPone gets to let loose.</p><p>With Agatha and Billy coming to a tentative truce after the revelations of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-episode-6-twist-spoilers-recap-1851676452">the last two episodes</a></span>, the coven find themselves in yet another trial of the Witches’ Road. This one traps them in a room with a tarot deck and a ceiling full of swords slowly pressing down toward them. The only way forward is to place the correct cards on the table, a job which falls to fortune teller Lilia. The episode then dives into how Lilia sees events take place which, due to her ability to see the past and future, occurs out of order for her. That means we get a lot of cutting back and forth between time periods as the show depicts Lilia’s disorienting life, a life that, it seems, has always been leading to this moment. Throughout it all, LuPone infuses every scene she’s in with a palpable emotion that blows her co-stars out of the water, and it all builds up to her sacrificing herself to save Agatha, Billy, and Jen. It’s a climactic conclusion to Lilia’s arc, anchored by a performance only Patti LuPone could give.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fagatha-all-along%2F6Nf0RIVHbJnh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Agatha All Along</em> is streaming now on Disney+.</a></span> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He said 2K "injected a lot more resources" into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and acquired Irrational in 2006, which in turn freed up the studio to try enabling each team to have its own individual project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Irrational's Boston team would lead development on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>BioShock,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> its Australian side looked at making an FPS installment for XCOM, whose then-last installment released in 2001. Ed Orman, the project's lead designer, told PCGamer how turn-based was "a bit of a niche" back then as shooters were becoming popular, hence "having a crack at a first-person version of XCOM."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even so, first-person shooters can struggle with squad commands and partner AI, something Irrational itself ran into with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>SWAT 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For mechanical inspiration and guidance, Gearbox's Brothers in Arms games were looked at, along with the 2004 shooter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum Warrior</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which Chey described as "was real-time, but it had a turn-based feel."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prototypes for the XCOM shooter took on various forms; the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Full Spectrum-</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">inspired one was deemed "too niche," according to internal feedback. Another pitch, which featured soldiers fighting alien kaiju and climbing atop them, was influenced by Call of Duty campaigns, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadow of the Colossus, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and the movie Starship Troopers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both pitches, and an asymmetrical multiplayer mode where players would take on the roles of aliens they fought in the campaign, ultimately went nowhere. In trying to make the franchise into a shooter, Chey said Irrational "exposed the tension. It sounds great when you say, 'Let's do a first-person shooter XCOM.' But they're different worlds. So how do you bring them together?"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The once and future XCOM">The once and future XCOM</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, Irrational settled on its XCOM shooter being set in the 1950s. Per Chey, this "more horror-based approach" would include jump scares and discordant music, and using conventional military equipment to fight enemies "operating on another dimension."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chey would eventually leave Irrational in 2009 once progress on the project XCOM stalled. At the time, he felt he "had [not] made the sort of progress that I wanted to, or like I was contributing a lot and being the person who could make that project successful."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking back, he said the studio should have committed more to its XCOM being XCOM. "People who loved [the series] wanted to see the same creatures from the tactical game in first-person," he explained to PCGamer. "[Mutoids and Sectoids] may not be the most original monster designs ever, but they're part of what people love."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Orman, who left Irrational months after the game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/JdVb4UnqO7A">E3 2010</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> reveal, believes Irrational Australia being integrated into 2K Marin exacerbated issues with the project. Irrational's team members were now "basically separated" from their Boston coworkers, and they "could not work together with the 2K Marin team," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With both Chey and Orman gone, and the departures of other senior staff, Irrational's XCOM was dead in the spaceship. 2K Marin went on to reboot the project, which became 2013's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">a third-person shooter and Marin's last game before its </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/layoffs-hit-2k-marin-remaining-workforce-to-be-reallocated-">closure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> later that year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Firaxis' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Enemy Unknown </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was a critical and commercial hit.

		<p>Developer Rat Cliff Games has announced that its survival horror game Among Ashes is going to be released on PS5, alongside the already confirmed PC version. To mark this announcement, a new trailer has been released, which shows never before seen footage of some of the horror players will come face to face with as they keep playing the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Among Ashes is a bit of a layered game in which players have to play a haunted videogame, called Night Call, and keep playing it until the very end. This means that in the game, your character will boot up the haunted game to play that and get through its challenges. In Night Call you will come across various monsters to fend off, but in the “real world” of Among Ashes the horrors are much more subtle and darker, delving more into psychological threats. There is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">demo available now on Steam for Among Ashes</a>, if you are in the mood to play a haunted video game.</p>
<p>Rat Cliff Games are self publishing the PC version of Among Ashes, while new publisher Dojo System will be publishing the PS5 version of the game.</p>
