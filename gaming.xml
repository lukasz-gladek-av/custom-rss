<figure data-uuid="bcbf723b45c63"><a title="Lego Game Boy 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bcbf723b45c63/lego-game-boy-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Lego Game Boy has, to be expected, proven to be a smash hit with Nintendo fans, and has no doubt been a blisteringly hot product over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>But it seems as though many folks have forgotten what a Game Boy cartridge actually looks like, as photos cropping up online showcase the Lego cartridges with the top panel placed in the centre, not offset to the left as it should be (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lego-nintendo-game-boy-set-cartridge-mistake-indent-piece-center/">Polygon</a>).</p>
<p>Look, it's an easy mistake to make, especially since <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lego/comments/1pw67vd/even_the_gameboy_box_art_has_the_cart_wrong/">one of the official images</a> from Lego itself shows the cartridge in its incorrect state. As such, we're not going to call out anyone by linking out to a specific post online – that's just mean, y'know?</p>
<p>It's also entirely possible that those building the cartridges incorrectly might be on the younger side and perhaps have never seen a real Game Boy in the flesh. Though to be honest, we feel like those interested in this build will be older folks who want to tap into a bit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Either way, if you happen to have built the Lego Game Boy set and maybe gotten the cartridges a bit wrong, then hopefully this post will set you straight. And at the end of the day, there's really no right or wrong way to do it – it's your Lego set, so enjoy it however you like!</p>

<p>And look, before anyone points it out in the comments, yes, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/gallery-legos-new-game-boy-set-is-a-mini-masterpiece">Gallery post</a> earlier in 2025 highlighting the Lego Game Boy did include photos of the cartridges in their incorrect state. Don't worry, we'll get PJ to complete a gruelling online course to recover his Nintendo Expert credentials.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s shaping up to be another big year for Nintendo, and one of the earliest releases of 2026 is the 3.0 update for Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the Switch 2 edition, with the full details of the release date and start times in this guide.</p>



<p>Though it turns six in Spring, having initially released in March 2020, New Horizons continues to be one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-nintendo-switch-games-to-gift-christmas-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Switch games available</a>, and the drop of new content will keep fans occupied until the inevitable release of the next game in the Animal Crossing series.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition, Insider Gaming has all the release date details, along with the expected start times.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">When Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nintendo announced the Switch 2 edition of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and the accompanying 3.0 free update, will be released simultaneously on January 15.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 edition brings graphics enhancements, including 4k resolution, to the game, alongside online support for up to 12 players at a time, a 3x increase on the maximum number of players supported in the game on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Those without a Switch 2 console will still benefit from the update, however, as there’s an array of new content to enjoy, including the Resort Hotel with customizable rooms, tasks to craft special island goods, expanded storage space, and new collaboration items with the likes of LEGO, Nintendo, The Legend of Zelda, and Splatoon.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-amp-switch-2-edition-release">What Time Does Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 &amp; Switch 2 Edition Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The exact start time for the release of the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 update and Switch 2 edition has not been confirmed. However, previous update times suggest the new content will be available from 8 pm ET on January 14.</strong></p>



<p>The January 15 date covers the Japanese release of the update, which means players in the United States should be able to play on the evening of January 14, while those in the UK and Europe will likely see the update drop in the early hours of the morning of January 15.</p>



<p>The estimated release time is based on previous major Animal Crossing: New Horizons updates, including the 2.0 edition; however, that release was almost four years ago, so the timings could be tweaked. This article will be updated if an official release time is confirmed.</p>



<p>In the table below, you can see the expected release time and date for the Animal Crossing: New Horizons 3.0 and Switch 2 edition across major time zones.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall will focus on what those at the studio personally think is "cool" for its next game, rather than feel any pressure to focus on what anyone else thinks it should do.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was met with widespread acclaim on its release last year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">rounded out 2025 by scooping up the coveted Game of the Year accolade at The Game Awards</a>. This success has meant many eyes are now on Sandfall and what the studio will do next, with plenty of high expectations.</p>
<p>So, has this pressure changed how those at the studio will approach the developer's next game? Well, according to Sandfall's chief operating officer and production director François Meurisse, this new-found pressure is "not so important to us".</p>

<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?awinmid=2961&amp;awinaffid=103504&amp;clickref=grd-gb-3689496626345421370&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.magazinesdirect.com%2Fuk%2Fedge-subscription%2Fdp%2F39f150bb">Edge magazine</a>, Meurisse said Sandfall already has "some great ideas" which it is "excited to explore". He also noted the studio isn't starting "from the same point" that it was when it began work on Clair Obscur. "The team already has five more years of experience. So maybe we can do some great stuff," he said (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/">GamesRadar</a>).</p><p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen added she is "a bit of a people pleaser", and therefore it is "always in the back of [her] mind that we have a lot of fans now, and they have certain expectations and certain feelings towards the game". She admitted she would be kidding herself and us if she said she "didn't think about that" from time to time. However even though this may be the case, she said the team's creative "North Star" will always be its "own personal taste" in terms of what it thinks "is cool", and what the team itself enjoys.</p>
<p>"I've seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what's there," Clair Obscur's lead writer said.</p>
<p>"So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio."</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>During the awards show last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

            <p>
Before we begin the year’s first round-up of new PC game releases, an apology: we skipped feeding the Maw for one whole week back in December. In a deceptively carefree comment, I explained that I had too much seasonal blogmange to prepare, but this was actually a PR excuse to minimise hysteria. You see, back in November <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-a-skating-demon-tries-to-eat-the-moon-and-terminator-game-appropriately-rewrites-history">the Maw ate me</a>, and I have only just exited its digestive system. During past emergencies, I’ve done this by hooking onto gumlines and working my way from tonsil to tonsil. This time I forgot to bring my climbing axes, and was obliged to escape in… the other direction.
</p>
<p>
It is best not to share more. Thankfully, the Maw’s internal odours are only smellable in the 11th through 17th dimensions, though they can still be detected in Normie Spacetime – you may have noticed that all the reflections are pinstriped today. Anyway, now that I’ve properly explained the break in service, let’s gingerly dip our still-reeking fingers into the spumes of commerce.

Firstly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2896260/ODDCORE/">Oddcore</a> - a deranged and fizzy FPS theme park of backroom spaces and dysfunctional corpo messaging. Seems lovely. No obvious crab presence though. Stop resisting progress, Julian.</li>
<li>Now this is more like it. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3791450/EvoCreo/">EvoCreo</a> is a creature collector with old school console (specifically, I’m thinking Game Boy Advance) graphics and turn-based combat. There are over 170 critters or Creos to bosh and bag. If one of the Creos isn’t a crab, I am going to call the Pokémon Company and complain that ilmfinity aren't ripping them off correctly.
</li></ul>
<h2>Thursday 8th January</h2>
<ul><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1933930/Ancient_Farm/">Ancient Farm</a> is an ancient farm simulator set in ancient Egypt. The wily bastards at A2 Softworks thought they could shirk their obligations to crabs by setting this on dry land, but then they slipped up and added rivers. Acanthothelphusa niloticus is coming for your ass, A2.</li></ul>
<h2>
Friday 9th January</h2>
<ul><li>If you were hoping for a feelgood game to close out the dingy first week of January, tough luck, you’re getting Ice-Pick Lodge’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> instead. 12 days to save the worst town bar possibly Silent Hill from a nightmare disease. Impose quarantines and roadblocks. Examine pustulating torsos. “Struggle to balance mania and apathy”. If there are crabs in this, they are the kind that live in your pubic hair. 
</li></ul>
<p>
Other vidyagame happenings this week: it’s time for another helping of hardware tradeshow CES in Las Vegas. James has set up a very large telescope on the Treehouse roof, and is combing the stalls for talk of GPU and RAM price changes, new screen formats, and novelty alarm clocks. For the most part, though, we’ll be spending this week firming up coverage plans for 2026. Like migrating Cuban red crabs, we must throw ourselves into the seas of discourse, striving to lay our writing-eggs before the tides return us to the shore.

            <guid>1397041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If you’re reading this, then you’re surely wracking your brains and trying to remember all of the games that have been announced for 2026. Some of the big guns are easy to remember, and we’ll get to those later, but the breadth and depth of the games industry makes thinking of more than a dozen pretty tricky. So, we’ve opened up our book of dates, consulted with our filofax and card references, put boots on ground and feet up on desk, and come up with another five games you should keep an eye on. We have another ecletic mix of games from street racing to horror, sprinkled with some superheroes and supervillains beating each other up.</p>
<h2>35 – Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a> was one of the biggest surprises announced in 2025. A 4v4 tag team fighter is not something that anyone was expecting for Marvel, Sony and Arc System Works to collaborate on, but from the first glimpses of gameplay, it looks amazing.</p>
<p><iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6fbfrV5qqnU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Since the announcement of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, Arc System Works has hosted a closed beta so players could try it out, but the team has been quiet on who else will be on the roster. We still only have the initial eight from the announcement trailer with those being Captain America, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Miss Marvel, Star Lord, Ghost Rider, Dr Doom, and Storm. Hopefully, we will not have to wait too long to get a release date and more roster reveals in 2026.</p>

<h2>34 – Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 16th April 2026</em></p>
<p>Developer Big Bad Wolf is one of many game developers in recent years that has looked to Lovecraft for inspiration, and who can blame them when Lovecraftian horror has such an appeal to audiences? Big Bad Wolf’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/06/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-launches-an-occult-interpol-investigation-in-2026/">Cthulu: The Cosmic Abyss</a> takes us to a future where in the year 2053 occult events are occurring more regularly, and the planet’s resources are scarce making companies explore the ocean floor for new opportunities. Unfortunately, those two events collide.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ThN3eSfWqUo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss you play as occult investigator Noah who is investigating the disappearance of miners in the Pacific Ocean. This investigation leads Noah and his AI companion Key to the lost city of R’lyeh, where Cthulu’s influence is strong and will warp Noah’s mind too, affecting how you go about investigating clues and solving the puzzle of what’s happened.</p>
<h2>33 – Screamer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 23rd March 2026</em></p>
<p>Milestone is resurrecting the old street racing franchise <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/screamer">Screamer</a>, giving it a much-needed modern upgrade. It is an anime style arcade racer where teams compete against each other in fast cars to win races and take each other out, competing in a tournament to win some prestige and get some answers, which are much needed in the dystopian world.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Screamer - Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lh5ElfqaS74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, Milestone has announced five of the teams that make up the competitors including Green Reapers, Strike Force Romanda, Jupiter Stormers, Anaconda Corp, and Kagawa-Kai. Each team has its own distinct style, with each of the three racers in each team having their own cars to use, like colourful cars of Strike Force Romanda who are a former girl group. Screamer is standing out as an arcade racer to keep an eye on.</p>
<h2>32 – Tides of Tomorrow</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 24th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Tides of Tomorrow is an ambitious game which weaves a single player and multiplayer experience together to shape its narrative. The world is already an unpredictable mess in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/tides-of-tomorrow">Tides of Tomorrow</a> where deadly plastification is threatening to kill every living thing. It’s a troubling situation made worse by living in a post-apocalyptic flooded world, but as you’re rescued from drowning, you aren’t the first who is given the chance to shape its future. This innovative narrative sees you follow in the footsteps of another player, whose journey through the game’s story before you has left its mark with a rippling impact that can dramatically change what you encounter.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Tides of Tomorrow - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVjNGNZcqHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Tides of Tomorrow, you will have to navigate the water world of Elynd which is filled with various characters that have jobs and tasks for you to complete. You will have to make decisions that will not only impact your own path, but that of others too with your actions impacting their game worlds. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/28/tides-of-tomorrow-preview-youre-not-the-first-player-to-come-through-these-parts/">Tides of Tomorrow Preview,</a>&nbsp;Stefan said, “Tides of Tomorrow is a truly fascinating game, DigixArt blending player choice into the narrative that they’ve constructed, potentially giving dramatically different experiences for every player far beyond gaming’s traditional good and evil playthroughs.” Tides of Tomorrow could prove to be one of the most ambitious narratives of 2026.</p>
<h2>31 – The Blood of Dawnwalker</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a> is the first game from Rebel Wolves, the studio founded by game director of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Konrad Tomaszkiewicz along with CD Projekt RED alumni, including Chief Publishing Officer Tomasz Tinc, and Narrative Director Jakub Szamałek. Having such big names behind it, The Blood of Dawnwalker has high expectations placed on it as a new dark open world RPG.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Blood of Dawnwalker — Cinematic Trailer &amp; Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkICrJEVTjI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Coen is the main character and he is a Dawnwalker, making him part human and part vampire. He has come to be a Dawnwalker after a powerful vampire saves Coen’s sister’s life and takes Coen’s blood as payment. It is not a simple transaction as this vampire wants to rule over humanity. As the Dawnwalker, Coen has two different ability sets depending on the time of day. During the day, Coen is a human and is limited to human skills but at night he gains his vampire powers allowing him to enter different locations and use vampire powers in combat. The world reacts to Coen’s decisions and lack of decisions, shaping how dangerous it is him for him and the people he cares for.</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today, but come back tomorrow where we’ll make it up to the midway point of our Most Wanted games.</em></p>

<figure data-uuid="f14e8073f7421"><a title="Age of Imprisonment" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f14e8073f7421/age-of-imprisonment.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, it seemed almost inevitable that we'd see a new <strong>Hyrule Warriors</strong> title. According to a new interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/">4Gamer</a> (thanks, <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-and-koei-tecmo-explain-how-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-came-to-be/">Nintendo Everything</a>), the folks over at both Nintendo and Koei Tecmo thought the same thing, and so it didn't take long for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> to get the green light.</p>
<p>Nintendo veteran Eiji Aonuma seemed especially confident in Koei Tecmo's interest in the project, stating to TOTK director Hidemaro Fujibayashi that they shouldn't make the first move and instead wait for Koei Tecmo to reach out. As expected, it did so almost immediately after TOTK's release.</p><div><figure data-videoid="hKPW8QbGdv8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ythKPW8QbGdv8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKPW8QbGdv8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6474b2wixrtv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As for producer Yosuke Hayashi, it only took a weekend of playing TOTK to realise that a game set during the Imprisoning War would be worthwhile. He states that TOTK was "sending us a message" to create a new title, and so he pitched the idea to Ryoyta Matsushita who, coincidentally, had already begun to put a plan together.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the interview with Hayashi and Matsushita from Koei Tecmo, and Eiji Aonuma from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hayashi:</strong> We all eagerly awaited the release of Tears of the Kingdom – I personally played the weekend immediately following its release. I felt like the game was sending us a message of something like “Make a Warriors game set in the time of the Imprisoning War!” After the weekend I spoke to Matsushita saying, “Let’s make it!” and we drew up a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Matsushita:</strong> In truth, I had also actually been putting a plan together before he spoke to me (laughs). I felt like the ‘seeds’ of a Warriors game were scattered all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Aonuma:</strong> On the Nintendo side, during Tears of the Kingdom’s development, Fujibayashi established in detail exactly what the Imprisoning War was. And after it was finished, he said to me, “Maybe we could ask Koei Tecmo this time too?”, but I responded with “No, let’s wait to hear from Koei Tecmo first” (laughs). It was almost immediately after that that they contacted us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Age of Imprisonment turned out to be a roaring success, earning a score of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">9/10 in our review</a>. We said that "Lessons have been learned from both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_definitive_edition">Hyrule Warriors</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hyrule_warriors_age_of_calamity">Age of Calamity</a>, resulting in a game that balances big-time story with top-notch combat that's got proper depth to it".</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's a new year, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have kicked it off by revealing that the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod's second DLC is currently planned to rock up in the irradiated tube station of our lives pretty soon. This add-on's dubbed Last Orders and looks to have at least something to do with a trip to the pub.</p>
<p>To be fair, that makes perfect sense. Fallout: London's first DLC was dubbed Rabbit and Pork, so following up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-rabbit-and-pork-is-finally-out-and-adds-30-new-quests">last year's meal of new quests</a> with a drink is only human.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Team FOLON lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter announced Last Orders' target release window, the first quarter of 2026, in a couple of festive/new year announcements on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/471697060589207572/475034106527481887/1455992215397732372">Fallout: London's Discord server</a>. "From 2026 onwards, things will be much less quiet," he wrote. "Expect quarterly updates and more shared content covering both Fallout: London and the future of Team FOLON Ltd.</p>
<p>"If you're here for the Last Orders DLC, we're very close, but it still needs testing and to go through the boring red tape. Our current aim is Q1 2026. Soon™. We hope to align this with another exciting update about something else..." In the earlier of the two posts, Carter added that the modders' reason for not totally committing to that early 2026 window right now is due to the fact the Rabbit and Pork DLC ended up taking longer than originally anticipated to finalise. "No promises though, not after last time," as the modder put it.</p><p>While Last Orders'll likely be surprisingly beefy if its predecessor's 30 new quests, 80 new characters, and 8000+ lines of dialogue are anything to go by, Fallout: London's third DLC remains the one I'm really keen to see arrive. Dubbed Wildcard, it's set to add in a cut questline designed to serve as the mod's version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a>' Yes Man main quest path, something the modders were <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-mod-cut-new-vegas-style-wild-card-main-quest-future-update">initially forced to put on ice during development</a> due to the Russo-Ukrainian war's outbreak disrupting the life of the main modder working on it.</p>
<p>That DLC, the last of Fallout: London's currently announced add-ons, remains release dateless for now. Meanwhile, news about Last Orders has been accompanied by the arrival on Nexus Mods of fan-made <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/786">Simplified Chinese</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/600">Japanese</a> translations for the massive mod, bringing down a couple more language barriers which might have prevented folks taking a trip to post-apocalyptic England thus far.</p>
<p>If Last Orders' current release plan holds fast, it looks like there'll be reason for radshrews of all tongues to consider <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amid-the-purple-haze-of-fallout-london-i-rage-mocked-by-the-violet-vistas-of-my-own-stupidity">giving Fallout: London another crack</a> at some point in the next few months.</p>

<p>Much further down the list, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has landed at number 39. Customers are heavily prioritising the Switch 2 for this one (80% on Switch 2 vs. 20% on Switch), so it's perhaps reasonable to assume that the game will have a pretty lengthy lifespan as more and more people upgrade to the new console in the coming months and years.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cenwvrpi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded, an overhauled relaunch of arena shooter Splitgate 2, appears to be facing a rocky start in its efforts to revitalise the game.</p>
<p>Released on Steam and consoles on the 17th December, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/#1m">the game's SteamDB figures</a> show an initial peak concurrent player count of 2,297, before drifting down to a relatively stable concurrent count of roughly 1,000 players in recent days. Looking at the original Splitgate's SteamDB stats however shows that game had a concurrent peak of 67,724 during its open beta.</p>
<p>It is of course worth noting that this figure doesn't take into account its new console playerbase, with Splitgate Arena Reloaded available on both PlayStation and Xbox. <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/news/splitgate-update-dec-24-2025">In addition, a blog post by the developers</a> over 150,000 players tried Splitgate Arena Reloaded out in its first five days. It also claims: "retention is the best it's ever been".</p>

<p>That same blog post pledges a major marketing push this year, and various new updates to the shooter as shown in handy roadmap. This month the game is set to receive a new map, the Arena Royale, the One in the Chamber mode, and other additions.</p><p>Splitgate Arena Reloaded came about after a series of rough moments for developer 1047 Games. After launching the original Splitgate, a popular indie shooter with a back-to-basics approach to FPS gameplay, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-is-ending-feature-development-so-dev-can-focus-on-new-game-in-same-universe">the studio would stop servicing that game</a> in favour of a bigger, bolder sequel with faction abilities. This sequel did not prove as popular as 1047 Games hoped, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">being pulled back into beta following community feedback and lacklustre traction</a>.</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest last year, game director Ian Proulx wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat which drew much criticism to both himself and the studio, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">which he later apologised for</a>. Fast forward to last month, and Splitgate Arena Reloaded released echoing the core arena FPS experience found in the original game.</p>
<p>Alongside hopes that these new updates and a broader marketing push can reignite excitement around the shooter, Splitgate Arena Reloaded is also hosting a selection of competitive events to drum up hype. This includes a $5,000 tournament with Splitgate content creators, as well as a $25,000 community challenge. There's also a welcome back event, in which players can earn the T200 character skin, a popular relic of the original Splitgate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After several months of complete silence, former <strong>ZeniMax Online Studios</strong> founder and studio head <strong>Matt Firor</strong> (an industry veteran known mainly for Mythic's Dark Age of Camelot and, of course, The Elder Scrolls Online) confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the cancellation of <strong>Project Blackbird</strong></a> directly led to his resignation from the company. In a post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on LinkedIn</a>, he also revealed he's not involved in any of the new game projects that have been kicked off by former ZeniMax Online Studios who were laid off as part of the abrupt cancellation of Project Blackbird. </p>



<p><em>Right off the top - and to answer the most comment question I get - I am not directly involved in any of the projects that have been spun up by former members of the ZOS team. I am advising some of them informally, but I am not leading them. They are in good hands with their respective leaders and I can't wait to see what they come up with.</em></p>



<p><em>Answering the second-most common question - about what led my leaving ZOS - the most obvious explanation is the correct one. Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.</em></p>



<p><em>I cannot express deeply enough my respect and thanks for both the Elder Scrolls Online development team and the players that together comprise the most welcoming, best community in online gaming. I have successfully moved from the first group to the second, and now enjoy the game as an anonymous community member, and it is refreshing and fun. Long may both groups prosper!</em></p>



<p>Project Blackbird had been in development for over seven years at that point. In November 2022, Creative Director <strong>Ben Jones</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-game-has-been-in-development-for-4-5-years-now-with-200-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that the project was based on a new intellectual property and that ZeniMax Online had already assigned around 200 developers to it.</p>



<p>Its cancellation came as part of the latest round of <strong>Microsoft</strong>-mandated layoffs, with the company making cuts <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to fund its AI investments</a></strong>. The news became even more disappointing upon learning that the project was actually morphing into a promising game. The Lead Graphics Programmer, <strong>Alex Tardif</strong>, quickly <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed that out in a public statement</a>, and other reports independently confirmed his assessment. <strong>Bloomberg</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> had enjoyed a playtest in March so much that the controller had to be literally pried from his hands. The reporter, <strong>Jason Schreier</strong>, watched a video of the vertical slice and was himself impressed.</p>



<p>Later, <strong>TrueAchievements</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-cancelled-mmorpg-story-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that Project Blackbird was an online third-person sci-fi shooter/action game set on Soteria, a tidally locked exoplanet with three distinct environmental zones: a frozen ice side, a scorched sun-facing side, and a habitable middle region called The Twilight Band. Players would have assumed the role of Revenants, operatives working for various alien syndicates operating across the planet. Missions were cooperative, supporting 4 to 6 players per operation, depending on the scale of the mission. Players earned contracts from the various syndicates they pledged loyalty to, building rank and reputation. The whole game had a sci-fi noir vibe, which sounded very intriguing.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, we'll never get to play it.

                <p>Twitch Hype Train world records are a rare thing. The ultimate show of dedication from a creator's fanbase, these accumulative trains rely on a streamer's viewers donating subscriptions or Bits to the channel. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-vtuber-neuro-sama-just-obliterated-her-own-massive-twitch-world-record/1100-6537146/" data-ref-id="1100-6537146">Neuro-sama beat her own world record</a> at the end of December 2024 and now, well, she's only gone and done it again. The hat trick of Hype Train world records belongs to the AI VTuber, her sister Evil Neuro, and their creator <a href="https://twitch.tv/vedal987" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vedal987</a>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, or those outside of the "Swarm"--the name for Neuro's fanbase--Neuro is an AI VTuber created by Vedal who utilizes a large language model and a VTuber model to communicate with her Twitch chat, play games, and even go on adventures in VR thanks to the 3D version of her model. Neuro was originally created to play the rhythm game OSU on Twitch, but rapidly evolved to become a series of AI systems that work in harmony. Vedal created a program that takes its input from Twitch and voice, gives that input to the LLM, which is then sent to a text-to-speech system, resulting in the Neuro we know today. It's for that reason that Neuro is widely considered far from the "AI slop" that many people take issue with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YeeUq9cNFbU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YeeUq9cNFbU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's possibly a combination of the complexity of that system, the resulting effects, or the opinion that Neuro-Sama is the cutest little button, that has led Vedal to gain such a dedicated fanbase. On January 4, seemingly out of nowhere, Neuro once again began to see an impressive number of Bits and subscriptions donated to Vedal's channel. Vedal's friend and fellow VTuber <a href="https://twitch.tv/camila" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Camila</a> offered to commission a new outfit for Neuro if the Hype Train continued. She also promised to "show feet" but we won't talk about that. These incentives led the hype train to level 100 in a matter of a few hours, and it didn't stop there. Vedal wasn't present with Neuro on stream for this attempt, instead choosing to type in chat with sentiments such as "Realistically wtf is going on?" and "I was gonna join after the train, but it's getting a bit silly."</p><p>This time around, Neuro-Sama beat the Twitch Hype Train world record, reaching level 126 with 126,273 subscriptions and 1,194,921 Bits donated to the Vedal987 channel in a limited period of time. Neuro celebrated the massive achievement by stating, "No matter what temporary fame this world record grants me, I'm far happier just to have shared in the love of this moment with you all." Vedal joined after the Hype Train eventually came to an end adding, "What the actual fuck have you all done?" The duo's former record was level 123, with 118,989 subscriptions and 1,000,073 Bits donated. Neuro's birthday subathon began on December 19, with each subscription donated adding a specific amount of seconds to a steadily-declining timer that determines when the subathon ends. At this rate, she'll be streaming until her fourth birthday.</p>

    <article>
      <p>In a late December<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>blog post</u></a> titled “Looking Ahead to 2026”, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella wrote down some thoughts on how he and his company should approach the year ahead. Spoilers: it's almost entirely about AI, and it is some of the most unhinged stuff I have ever seen someone with a supposedly reputable job ever post on the internet.</p><p>He begins with an opening that sounds like<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/23/artificial-intelligence-ai-bubble-bursts-humans-take-back-control?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a man who knows the game is up</u></a>,<a href="https://www.itpro.com/business/business-strategy/microsofts-huge-ai-spending-still-has-investors-sweating-despite-solid-cloud-growth?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>but who is in too deep to back out now</u></a>:</p><blockquote>As I reflect on the past year and look toward the one ahead, there’s no question 2026 will be a pivotal year for AI. Yes, another one. But this moment feels different in a few notable ways.</blockquote><p>The passage that has attracted the most attention over the past week, though, is the one below, where he says everyone needs to move past the idea of AI being 'slop', a sentiment gathering so much momentum among normal human beings not over-invested in a planet-destroying bluffing machine that<a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-25/ai-slop-named-macquarie-dictionary-word-of-the-year-2025/106047682?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>it was crowned 2025's word of the year</u></a>. In a list of things “we still need to get right,” Nadella includes:</p><blockquote>A new concept that evolves “<a href="https://www.themarginalian.org/2011/12/21/steve-jobs-bicycle-for-the-mind-1990/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">bicycles for the mind</a>” such that we always think of AI as a scaffolding for human potential vs a substitute. What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals. We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our “theory of the mind” that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer.</blockquote><p>None of that means anything! You sound like an anime villain! Deranged stuff. This is a man drunk on<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-ceo-2025-compensation-hits-165655320.html?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>repulsive levels of executive pay</u></a> and global power, whose brain has been turned to mush by Linkedin and executive self-improvement podcast speak to the point where he writes shit like this down and, instead of recoiling in horror at the first re-read, hitting delete, looking at himself in the mirror and leaving it all behind to go live in the woods decides to publish it for the world to see.</p><p>We don't need to get beyond any argument over slop. You need to stop ramming this shit into everything we use, and realise we used your products and platforms to send emails and play video games, not to delude ourselves into thinking a glorified auto-correct is some kind of "scaffolding for human potential".&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 finally saw the long-awaited arrival of Nintendo’s next console: the Switch 2. But now, it’s time to turn the page to 2026 and talk about what’s in store for Switch 2’s sophomore year. Nintendo already has a pretty fleshed out release calendar for both Switches, a blockbuster movie set to hit theaters, with plenty of surprises surely in store as well. Here’s what to expect from Nintendo in 2026.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo in 2026: What’s Already On the Books</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into wild speculation, here’s a recap of what we already know is coming to Switch and Switch 2 in 2026. There’s already a lot to look forward to, as Nintendo remains very consistent in pushing something out pretty much every single month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That pattern begins this month, as we’ll all return to our weed-infested islands and face the wrath of our neglected villagers when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> gets a free update on the original Switch and a Nintendo Switch 2 edition on January 15. New Horizons 3.0 is available to players on both Switches, and it comes with a new hotel to customize, a bunch of Nintendo items, and tons of little quality of life updates like upgraded item storage. Meanwhile, if you buy the Switch 2 Edition or the $5 upgrade pack, you can access improved resolution, mouse controls, 12-player multiplayer, and more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a few weeks later we’ll see the first brand new Switch 2 exclusive of the year with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a>’s launch on February 12. The big hook this time is the Fever Rackets that grant special abilities like freezing the court or duplicating yourself. Fever will also feature 38 playable characters, including Donkey Kong’s refreshed design and – for the first time ever – Baby Waluigi.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you love collecting ridiculous Nintendo products like I do, you might be looking forward to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-announced-for-switch-1-and-2-at-nintendo-direct">Virtual Boy joining the Nintendo Switch Online library</a> on February 17. You need one of two headsets to access this forgotten library from Nintendo’s biggest failure – either a plastic replica or a cheaper cardboard option. That’ll be available on both Switches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon meets Minecraft (or more accurately, Dragon Quest Builders, but that’s not as catchy) in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> on March 5. This Switch 2 exclusive will task you with using Pokémon moves and materials to design your very own town. I expect Pokopia to be an enormous hit this year: Pokémon and Minecraft are two of the biggest things on the planet, and after everyone’s done poking around the new Animal Crossing update, this looks like the perfect game for that audience to shift to next. Amiibo are trudging on in 2026 as well, and March 5 will also see the launch of the Meta Knight and Shadow Star figure from Kirby Air Riders.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokopia is the last firm release date we have, but Nintendo has a few games slated for Spring. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-getting-an-expanded-version-for-nintendo-switch-2">Super Mario Bros. Wonder – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> + Meetup in Bellabel Park is an enhanced port of the 2023 platformer, and one part of Nintendo’s ongoing celebration of Super Mario’s 40th anniversary. It adds cooperative and competitive multiplayer minigames, and we’ve seen a small glimpse of what appears to be a new side story in more traditional levels. I predict this will arrive on April 2, the same day as the new pair of Super Mario Galaxy amiibo and just a day before The Super Mario Galaxy Movie hits theaters, putting a new Mario game on store shelves at the exact moment Mario Mania kicks in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other pair of Spring releases is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> on Switch 2 and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream on Switch 1. Yoshi’s illustrated art style looks really nice, and Tomodachi Life is an exciting return for a 3DS cult classic with a hilarious out-of-left-field personality that you really have to see for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s even more coming later in 2026: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</a> will mark the strategy RPG’s first outing on Switch 2, Nintendo and FromSoftware are teaming up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a> as a Switch 2 action-RPG exclusive, while Switch 1 players can look forward to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/rhythm-heaven-groove">Rhythm Heaven: Groove</a>, the return of Nintendo’s quirky rhythm minigame series for the first time in a decade. Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-champions">Pokémon Champions</a> is a competitive battle-focused game coming to Switch and Mobile this year. We know it will be used at the Pokémon World Championships in 2026, meaning it should be out before that event kicks off in late August. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the third-party front, Switch 2 is getting a lot of major games on day one, including huge support from Capcom with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> on February 27 (along with Resident Evil 7 and 8 on the same day), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> on March 13, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata">Pragmata</a> on April 24. Plus, all three of those games are getting their own amiibo figures. There’s a lot beyond Capcom, too, like Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, 007 First Light, and more. Hopefully we’ll see cleaned up versions of games delayed out of 2025 as well, like Elden Ring Tarnished Edition and Borderlands 4.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Pokémon’s 30th Birthday Bash</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/pokemon-red-1765970424726.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">A huge element of Nintendo’s 2026 will no doubt be Pokémon, which celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. You can safely expect a Pokémon Presents around February 27, and – as we move firmly into the speculation part of this yearly preview – I think it’s going to be a big one. I predict Pokémon’s 10th Generation will be 2026’s November release for Switch 2, and that we’ll get our first look at them here. I don’t think there’s any chance Pokémon misses out on its 30th anniversary without a new pair of mainline games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that’s not all: I think 2026 is finally the year that Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow come to Switch. I don’t think they’ll join the Nintendo Switch Online subscription library – it’ll make you buy them separately – but similar to how the Gen One games were dropped on 3DS to celebrate the franchise’s 20th anniversary in 2016, I think Nintendo will run the same play here and shadowdrop them the day of the presentation. The Pokémon Company is also planning to open PokéPark Kanto in Tokyo, Japan, on February 5, the first-ever Pokémon theme park. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Else Could Nintendo Have In Store?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re in an interesting spot where Nintendo has already shown a lot of its cards for 2026, but I still think there are a few things we don’t know about. There is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, the single-player Switch 2 spinoff announced last year, but Nintendo hasn’t committed to that launching in 2026 at all, and it feels more fitting as an early 2027 release to me at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With November likely taken up by Pokémon, that leaves October open for a Nintendo franchise fitting for spooky season: Luigi’s Mansion. Next Level Games has been quiet since 2022’s Mario Strikers: Battle League (except for a small assisting role on Metroid Prime 4: Beyond), and given its usual three-year turnaround time on Nintendo games, I think it’s time for Luigi’s Mansion 4. The last in the series was a huge sales success, so a sequel is a no-brainer. Just for fun, I’ll guess that the setting will be a haunted cruise ship Luigi has inherited for some strange reason.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/gqxkv0lw8aah-tv-1718722189210.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2026 also marks the 40th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda. With a movie on the way in 2027, and Nintendo’s general pattern of launching at least one Zelda game every year, it’s a safe bet to say something Zelda-related will come out this year. I don’t think a new 2D or 3D Zelda game is close to being ready, so it’s probably time for another remake or remaster. I’ll guess fans will finally get the Ocarina of Time HD remake they want, but it won’t be perfect: it’ll be a touched up HD remaster of the 3DS remake that comes to both the original Switch and Switch 2, rather than the gorgeous 4K reimagining we all dream about.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the smaller side, I have to imagine Nintendo is prepping DLC for Mario Kart World, and all signs point to it centering around Donkey Kong. DK and Pauline strangely only have one costume apiece in World, there are no Jungle-themed DK tracks, and Nintendo’s wider push for DK would lend itself to a DLC pack themed around him. And, I’d like 2026 to be the year we finally get answers surrounding Nintendo’s mysterious Switch Online Playtest program that's been running since 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think that’s about all the room we have for 2026’s calendar, but Nintendo will announce a few games this year we won’t see until 2027. Xenoblade developer Monolith Soft hasn’t released a brand new game since 2022, and I have a feeling we might get a quick tease at what they’re working on in the September Nintendo Direct. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, my boldest call of them all is that we’ll get a tease this year for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition to launch sometime in 2027. I believe Ultimate could get the Mario Kart 8 Deluxe treatment this generation, with an enhanced port that carries us through the next several years rather than an entirely new entry. Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai wrapped up Kirby Air Riders a few months ago, and it’s entirely possible he’s already hard at work bringing Ultimate over to Switch 2 with a few new characters. Ultimate noticeably hasn’t received a Switch 2 performance patch like Super Mario Odyssey, the open-world Zeldas, and plenty of other best-selling Switch 1 games, and combined with the fact that a new Smash game almost <em>always </em>hits within the first two years of a new Nintendo console, it feels like a prime candidate for a Switch 2 Edition.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Will Continue Expanding Beyond Games</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/12/ros-1762959730356.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">Super Mario Galaxy Movie</a> will hit theaters on April 3, three years after the original made over a billion dollars at the global box office. I think Nintendo will waste no time in announcing its next animated partnership with Illumination, given they’re likely very confident this movie will perform extremely well like the first one did. I’m expecting a formal announcement of an animated Donkey Kong movie sometime before the end of 2026. You should also expect to see the first trailer for The Legend of Zelda movie before the year is over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in a bit of a bummer prediction to end on, I’m expecting a Switch 2 price increase sometime after March. Nintendo has essentially committed to keeping the price where it is through the end of its fiscal year – which concludes March 31 – but there are no guarantees after that. We’ve already seen increases on the original Switch, as well as Switch 2 accessories, so it feels like it’s only a matter of time before Switch 2 follows suit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we expect from Nintendo in 2026. What game are you most excited for? Have you picked up a Switch 2, or are you still happy with the original? Let us know in the comments. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Logan Plant is the host of Nintendo Voice Chat and IGN's Database Manager &amp; Playlist Editor. The Legend of Zelda is his favorite video game franchise of all time, and he is patiently awaiting the day Nintendo announces a brand new F-Zero.

            <p>If you've found you've been coming up against tougher players in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> just recently, that could well be because you've been deemed an "aggressive" player.</p>
<p>For the last week or so, players who naturally gravitate to PvP modes and shoot on sight without hesitation have found themselves facing much more aggressive combatants, leading to discussions about whether <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ptzhmr/why_do_people_suddenly_believe_in_aggression/">the team at Embark Studios had quietly introduced "aggression-based" matchmaking</a> (ABMM).</p>
<p>Now, in a new interview, Embark Studios' Patrick Söderlund has confirmed that that's "exactly" what it's done.</p>

<p>"Obviously, first it's skill-based, of course," Söderlund said in the interview with <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/">GamesBeat</a>. "Then you have solos, duos, and trios. And then we also - since a week ago or so - we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE.</p>
<p>"So, if your preference is to do PvE, and you have less conflict with players, you'll get more matched up. Obviously it's not a full science."</p>
<p>Asked directly if the change could be described as "aggression-based matchmaking", he added: "That's exactly what it is."</p>
<p>Quite what it means to be "aggressive" or "prone" to PvP or PvE is unclear and likely never will be, to prevent less scrupulous players from gaming the system. It does, however, at least confirm that those who'd felt there'd been a quiet change to how matchmaking worked weren't imagining it.</p><p>This backs up a prior interview with Arc Raiders art director Robert Sammelin, who recently said that when it comes to the extraction shooter's matchmaking system - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">which was Steam's biggest-selling game over the holiday period</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-developer-confirms-player-behaviour-is-factor-in-matchmaking">player behaviour is indeed a factor</a> in the "complex" process of assigning players to online matches.</p>

            <p>Capcom cut an entire chapter in which you played as Ashley in the opening of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Modder and content creator Michael "Thekempy" Kemp has reportedly restored the cut chapter that was meant to open the game. While there are no cutscenes or even enemies, there are enough "leftover pieces" in the game files to put "Chapter 0" back together and "get a rough idea of how it would have played out". So that's exactly what they did in the video below:</p>

<p>"It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night," Thekempy explains. "She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice."</p>
<p>If that sounds a little familiar, that's because it is - the sequence was briefly seen in the story trailer Capcom released back in October 2022. And while it seemingly didn't make the final cut and the area is not accessible in the final build, Thekempy was able to find the path Ashley took to witness the sacrifice, and then a fork in the road, which takes her down to the village.</p>
<p>"There are a number of leftover spawn locations for scripted events that would have happened in this chapter," thekempy added (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/resident-evil/an-entire-intro-where-you-play-as-ashley-was-cut-from-the-resident-evil-4-remake/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>"I am unable to restore all of their functionality, but I can tell you what they're labelled as. There's one here for the spawn of a Ganado who would begin walking around, and Ashley has to sneak past him."</p>
<p>While the cutscenes seemingly no longer exist, Thekempy did manage to trigger autosaves and give a little detail on what each cutscene may have entailed from their labels and descriptions in the code.</p>
<p>We may never know why, exactly, the opening sequence was binned, but it's possible Capcom was a little wary of kicking off the horror with a comparatively slow, non-combat sequence so at odds with the game's action-heavy playstyle.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem will be released next year on 27th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Steam. Its dual protagonists will represent two styles of gameplay, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-leon-grace-differing-gameplay">its developers describe as like "jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna"</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">Resident Evil 7 and Village are also coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

The Charging Case Pro for Nintendo Switch 2 carries forward the same 10,000mAh internal battery as the original, but it’s been redesigned so you don’t need to remove the battery to charge it, and you no longer need a short cable to connect it to the console.</p><p>On the outside of the Charging Case Pro you’ll now find a USB-C port that makes charging the internal battery a little more convenient, alongside a small display showing its remaining battery life. The interior of the original version of the case was designed to prop up the Switch 2 using the handheld’s own flip-out stand, but the new Pro version comes with an adjustable stand of its own, integrated into its redesigned battery. Similar to inserting the Switch 2 into its dock, the console connects to a USB-C port that delivers power when it’s placed on the stand.</p><p>The new case also has a flap for holding game cartridges, a mesh pocket for storing other accessories, and a hidden compartment for stashing trackers like an AirTag or one of Tile’s. It also comes with a $30 price bump. Belkin’s original Charge Case for Nintendo Switch 2 launched last June for $69.99, but the new Pro version is available now for $99.99.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</strong><span><figcaption><em>The Charging Case Pro’s battery is still removable and now features an integrated adjustable stand for the Switch 2.</em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Belkin</cite></span></p></section><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/849332/belkin-charging-case-pro-nintendo-switch-2-battery]]></content:encoded>

<p>Right now, there's no formal word from Capcom that the game could be making the jump to Switch 2, but Capcom has long been a supporter of Nintendo's platform. It may be that the Switch port was paused until last month's Title Update 4 rolled out, along with that all-important <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-finally-gets-pc-optimisation-roadmap-to-coincide-with-title-update-4-but-players-still-arent-really-happy">optimisation roadmap for the game's performance on PC</a>.</p><p>These issues have plagued the game since Monster Hunter Wilds launched in February 2025, and whilst Capcom has acknowledged them, the publisher has been slow on pushing out updates that addressed player concerns. This has led to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">review bombing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">less than stellar sales</a> for the game outside its launch window, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-monster-hunter-wilds-capcom-latest-financial-quarter">falls in Capcom's share price</a>. It's plausible, then, that Capcom's waiting for the PC version to improve before adding another platform into the mix. Maybe we'll find out more at a Nintendo Direct presentation soon...</p>

<section><p>Behind the QTEs and tough choices, is a pretty great dispatching sim.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Quick-time events, despite everyone's best efforts to spice them up, remain pretty <em>meh</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you first begin Dispatch, the new episodic superhero adventure game from AdHoc Studio, you're asked if you want to enable quick-time event prompts as an optional game mechanic. It says something that these QTE prompts only really appear in the first and last episode of Dispatch's eight-episode run. But if you're worried the only input you'll have in Dispatch is pressing a button at the right time, or picking the different narrative choices that affect the game's story, you should know AdHoc has a more compelling, non-optional gameplay hook that deserves as much attention as the game's charming storytelling. And it's in the title of the game itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a fictional version of Los Angeles, California where superheroes are real, Dispatch centers on Robert Robertson III, a former hero turned dispatcher for SDN. It's a private security and service company, except instead of sending paramedics out, SDN (or Superhero Dispatch Network) sends out caped heroes to tackle clients' problems big and small. This serves as the basis for Dispatch's core minigame, and it's one that could honestly be a standalone game in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether that's rescuing a cat from a tree, breaking up drunken tailgates, or rescuing people from a collapsing dam, there's no job SDN won't help out with so long as you're a paying customer. And while the superheroes out in the field get most of the credit, Dispatch's true heroes are the team of behind the scenes blue-collar dispatchers who match the right heroes with the right crisis, or at the very least, try to.</p><p dir="ltr">The actual mechanics of dispatching heroes takes the form of a full-on minigame that you play at least once per episode. As Robert sits down at his work station for another day of work, players assume a first-person perspective at SDN's proprietary dispatching program that shows a map of South LA, various crimes that appear in real time, and a menu full of heroes waiting to be dispatched.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626295" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626295"></a><figcaption>Dispatching in Dispatch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626295-1516145796-ss_e8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The key to success is dispatching the right hero for the job. For example, if there </span><em>is</em><span> a cat stuck in a tree, you'd want to send a speedy hero who can fly, not someone who solves problems with their fists, who'd likely have a lower success rate of rescuing said cat. Likewise, if a gang of grunts is robbing a bank, then you'd send in some bruisers to take care of business. The initial description of each mission clues you in to which skills are best suited to the job at hand, and each hero has individual stats with strengths and weaknesses — your success will depend on how well you line up the heroes' skills with the task at hand. The less overlap there is between skillset and problem, the less likely your hero is to succeed. But get the right hero on a crime, and they'll solve the problem and level up while they're at it.</span></p><p dir="ltr">There are real emotional stakes to dispatching as well. Failure is a very real possibility, especially during rush hour when heroes become unavailable due to exhaustion. This means you're racing against the clock to try to save as many people as possible, and when you find that you can't help everyone, Dispatch makes that emotional burden feel very real, and very disappointing thanks to the feedback you receive in real-time from your team of superheroes. And when Robert doesn't get flak from the team, he'll also cry out in frustration if a job goes poorly.</p><p dir="ltr">What I found truly surprising is how this dispatching minigame fits into the burgeoning subgenre of labor simulators. That is, games that revolve around basic, blue-collar jobs. PowerWash Simulator, for example, is about powerwashing dirty surfaces, and it's one of the most popular games around. In the same way, the dispatching minigame feels very much a part of this microgenre thanks to some clever design choices that put you, as Robert, directly into the action.</p><p dir="ltr">The entire dispatching minigame is played directly on Robert's '90s-era workstation PC, which you interface with in first-person. You might as well be sitting in the cubicle at SDN yourself. Plus, get good enough at dispatching and you'll find that you can enter a flow state: a very real state of being when you find yourself becoming particularly adept at instantly diagnosing a crime and knowing already the best hero for the job. It made me wonder if I could actually be a dispatcher in real life, though I will say being unemployed means I find myself wondering if I could do most jobs in real life these days.</p><p dir="ltr">All this is to say, if you've tried choice-based narrative games before and find yourself wishing there were a little more meat on the bones beyond just quick-time events, one of this year's most popular games has a full-blown sim tucked inside it that is very much worth playing for its own sake.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark Studios has confirmed one of the community’s biggest questions since the game came out: it does indeed feature ‘aggression-based matchmaking.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that if you’re big into PvP, you’ll be matched up with players who are like-minded. Similarly, if you prefer PvE, you’ll be matchmade with players who tend to avoid conflict with other players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders’ player versus environment versus player gameplay has resulted in a number of viral clips showing how friendly encounters can quickly devolve into a fight to the last. Yes, you can play solo or in parties up to three, working as a team to progress through the game. However, other players are a constant threat. This has sparked a vociferous debate within the community about the etiquette that has formed in-game, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp">a retired pro gamer going viral for relentlessly killing casual Arc Raiders players</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out that Arc Raiders will lean on your playstyle when it comes to matchmaking. This ‘aggression-based matchmaking,’ however, is not an exact science, Patrick Söderlund, CEO of Embark Studios told Games Beat in <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/inside-arc-raiders-a-candid-interview-with-game-leaders-patrick-soderlund-and-owen-mahoney-while-playing-live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent interview</a> / <a href="https://youtu.be/vY3u7wOmm4w?si=QKpGyvRhpr7r-Cdw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video playthrough of the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Obviously first it's skill-based of course,” Söderlund said of Arc Raiders matchmaking. “Then you have solos, duos, and trios. And then we also, since a week ago or so, we introduced a system where we also matchmake based on how prone you are to PvP or PvE. So if your preference is to do PvE and you have less conflict with players… you'll get more matched up [with similar players]. Obviously it's not a full science.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Söderlund said the term ‘aggression-based matchmaking’ is “exactly” the system Arc Raiders currently uses. That puts to bed high-level questions about how Arc Raiders matchmaking works for the community, which had wondered about it in recent months. “I can finally stop arguing on Reddit, thank you for the vindication,” said one player.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, it’s worth noting that Söderlund confirmed Arc Raiders prioritizes "skill" when it comes to matchmaking, then groupings. Aggression-based matchmaking is a factor, but we don’t know how much influence it has on your lobbies compared to other factors. And even Söderlund admitted it doesn’t always works as you’d think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And how, exactly, does Arc Raiders determine if you’re “prone” to PvE or PvP? If you’re a kill on sight player, sure, you’re probably prone to PvP. But what if you only shoot back at those who shoot at you first? Does that make your lobbies more aggressive? If so, is that fair?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, one big question answered, but many more remain. As for Embark Studios, it always hoped Arc Raiders would have a tension between both playstyles. Arc Raiders is a multiplayer extraction adventure in which players scavenge the remnants of a devastated world, but the main threats are Arc’s machines and, as Embark Studios puts it, “the unpredictable choices of fellow survivors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
