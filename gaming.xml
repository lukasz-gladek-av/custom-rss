		<p>The first trailer for A Minecraft Movie has dropped, giving us a glimpse of the blocky film adaptation of one of the biggest video games of all time. A Minecraft Movie will be in cinemas from 4th April 2025, for your next dose of video game movie Jack Black.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Minecraft Movie | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PE2YZhcC4NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot of things going on this reveal trailer, with four regular world humans pulled into the blocky Minecraft universe. Jason Momoa is the biggest name on the ticket, but there’s also Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), and Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”) who’s definitely channelling some young Paul Rudd, if you ask me.</p>
<p>The four of them will have to figure out how this world works, protect themselves from armies of Piglins and Zombies, get over the weirdly squared-off sheep, and just how high res and detailed all the blocks and lighting are.</p>

<p>But hold on a second. Four people pulled into a twisted video game world? Jumanji called – the newer ones and not the original – and it wants its plot back, please! It would also like one of its acting stars back as well, because Jack Black is back to do more Jack Black things in the role of Steve, an expert crafter who’s presumably been stuck in this world for decades. Come on, film execs. You’re making a movie about using your imagination, and the best you could come up with for you video game movie was to cast an actor who’s literally&nbsp;<em>just</em> been in&nbsp;<em>two other video game movies?!</em></p>
<p>Looking at the early comments on YouTube, and snap judgment are not especially kind to the film. In particular, there’s a lot of comments about having real actors within the very heavily stylised, over-saturated game world, and comparisons to “Minecraft vs Real Life” videos that were common in the mid 2010s. What do you think?</p>
<p>All involved will be hoping to replicate the rampaging successes of other video game movies – not <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/the-first-borderlands-movie-reviews-are-in-and-they-dont-hold-back/">Borderlands</a>, though. The gold rush was started in earnest by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/13/detective-pikachu-film-movie-review/">Detective Pikachu</a>, which garnered a whopping $450 million, before the first Sonic the Hedgehog enjoyed a $320 million worldwide gross and its sequel $404 million. Everything has now been dwarfed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/10/the-final-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-looks-like-mad-max-rainbow-fury-road/">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which has a worldwide gross of $1.3 billion. So, of course you’re going to try and adapt Minecraft, which is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 350 million copies sold.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-developer-diary-for-a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is an upcoming horror game set in the same haunting universe as A Quiet Place. The game is set for release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/">17 October 2024</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This game is being created by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive. Today, a new developer diary was released, talking about the importance of sound design and how it was utilized in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Design in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUMKpw_-4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For context, A Quiet Place is all about staying as quiet as humanly possible, otherwise you will be captured and killed by horrifying creatures. In this game, you play Alex, someone with asthma, while fighting for her life alongside her boyfriend, Martin. The creatures you are fighting against are completely blind, but have hypersensitive hearing and can hear the smallest of noises. You have to try to stay as quiet as you can while navigating a world full of obstacles and various objects that have the potential to make noise in any capacity.</p>
<p>This developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcases some of the objects you'll have to interact with despite the fact that they can be incredibly noisy and give away your position. This includes rusty gates, cupboards, and even just walking through the city.&nbsp; In the developer diary, Diego Sambataro, the Sound Designer at Stormind Games, takes you through the importance of sound in this game, and how it can make or break your survival.</p>
<p>"The world that we've built mirrors our real world, where different materials not only create different types of noise, but that sound occurs at different loudness." Sambataro says, going on to explain different materials and how they may affect the gameplay: "If you're walking on sand, sound is diffused into the ground and results in quiet footsteps. Walking on compacted dirt may be a little louder. And rusty metal... well, you're going to want to move slowly to keep your volume levels low."</p>
<p>Diego Sambataro explains that every move you make should be deliberate and precise, as the sounds all have different volumes. In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, you don't know when they're going to scare you the most and throw you off balance. The developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is just under three minutes long but showcases some of the gameplay elements you can expect to interact with during your time in the game and how the sound will affect you and your survival.</p>
<p>As he goes on to explain, it isn't just surface-level noise you need to be worried about. "Leaves, water, glass, and other materials may be scattered across surfaces, each having their own loudness, which might attract the attention of creatures." It's not only walking that you have to be worried about, though. Even acts like opening doors and trying to scavenge for loot can end your life in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>"Every formerly mundane movement is now a danger to your life. Want to open a door or a drawer? You had better do it carefully and quietly." Unfortunately, you can't get away with not opening things, either. Some of them will be necessary to interact with on your journey through A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, as explained by Diego Sambataro in the developer diary.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be available on October 14, 2024, for $29.99<span>.&nbsp;<a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pre-orders are</a></span><a href="https://aquietplace.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;available today</a>, which gives you some extra supplies to bolster your journey through the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/earthion-preview-new-game-for-sega-genesis</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earthion-preview-a-new-game-for-the-sega-genesis.971868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/earthion-preview-new-game-for-sega-genesis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one is talking about <em>Earthion</em>, but I'm going to do my best to throw it into your line of sight. Consider this: a brand new <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/shoot-em-up">shoot 'em up</a> (SHUMP) is releasing for the SEGA Gensis, a console that debuted over three decades ago. This SHUMP is retro to the core, rad as hell, and I can't wait to see more: Remember the name <em>Earthion</em>.</p>
<p>Developed by Japanese studio Ancient and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/limited-run-games-showcase-gex-more">Limited Run Games</a>, you'll be able to boot up this banger on a physical cartridge and enjoy it the way God intended on that dusty old SEGA Genesis sitting in your closet. Well, it's time to give that bad boy a dusting so you can see why <em>Earthion</em> is so special.</p>
<p>From the show floor of PAX West, we checked out <em>Earthion</em>, so read on to learn more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=v4eDI8ri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=JAsvDUTs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro. <em>Earthion </em>as seen running on his CRT screen.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Earthion</em>'s a New Game Running on Old Hardware</h2>
<p>Brand new games running on cartridges designed for long-dead consoles is nothing new; outside of fan-made creations, Limited Run has released certain games with this idea in mind. Knowing this, <em>Earthion</em> has to contend with the limitations of old hardware, but that doesn't stop it from going hard.</p>
<p>SHUMPs put me in an adrenaline-fueled frenzy, and <em>Earthion</em> is no different in that regard. It's about as authentic as it gets, from the visuals and audio down to the gameplay. Its gameplay is simple but elegant and refined, making for a fantastic time.</p>
<p>Take control of a spaceship and blast through space with your standard lasers, or various secondary weapons. You can arm this ship with rockets, extra machine guns, or even a flamethrower. Dodge and weave your way through enemies and avoid getting hit, else you'll lose a precious life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=Q7HUrMXG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=FD24UQSI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Sounds like most other SHUMPs, but again, it does exactly what it needs to do. Visually, though, it's outstanding and richly detailed. The spritework is animated to perfection and colors pop, creating one of the best looking SEGA Genesis games (which might be unfair to say as a game coming out in ~2025).</p>
<p>I played the demo twice since it was pretty short, but it was fun enough that it merited even more plays. During the one level I played, a giant ship flies into the screen, presumably an ally, and explodes. This creates a debris field players then need to dodge around as enemy ships come flying in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=ObL6WQO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=JzoEzZ4O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Soon enough, I arrive at the boss, this strange, robotic ship. It exposes its weak point after shooting some perilous projectiles at me. Shooting this weak spot requires some precision, especially when contending with the projectiles it shoots at you, so it's the perfect challenge for what is presumably an early level of <em>Earthion</em>. Be sure to use the rockets or extra machine guns for extra oomph!</p>
<p>There's only so much one can say about a demo that lasts roughly 5 minutes, but it was enough time for me to know I'm going to love the hell out of <em>Earthion</em> when it releases. For a brand new SHUMP with an undeniably old-school feel, <em>Earthion</em> is one you're going to want to keep an eye on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-reveals-wacky-50s-courier-game-deliver-at-all-costs.971865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer Far Out Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, a "thrilling action game" based around delivering "highly unconventional cargo" in a wacky late-1950s world.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1880610/view/4597699678395658839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its announcement post</a>, Far Out Games describes&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>as taking place in a world ruled by rock'n'roll, polka dot fashion, and "the fear of nuclear apocalypse". How delightful.</p>
<p>It's this world you'll be exploring as Winston Green, a courier with the requisite "shady past" all noir-adjacent protagonists need. You'll be delivering packages in a destructible world, driving a variety of different vehicles, and undertaking "bizarre and perilous deliveries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=iIPMsyZ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=v87v4s_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>takes place in a wacky 1950s world full of objects to destroy.</figcaption></figure><p>Deliveries range from "a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of an atomic bomb "teetering on the edge of explosion", so it's safe to say you won't just be ferrying mundane packages around in&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' world.</p>
<p>While the world will be chaotic and reactive,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>does also have a story, and it's one of "mystery and intrigue", according to the devs. You'll meet a cast of "distinct and memorable characters" and watch Winston spiral down into insanity, which feels like an appropriate response to the 1950s.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which gives a sense of what kind of madcap antics the game will let you take part in, right here.</p>

<p>Although it seemingly won't feature any licensed music, <i>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</i>will offer an original soundtrack to immerse you in the period, as well as 50s-inspired design elements, radio ads, and user interface aesthetics.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>looks rather like what would happen if&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia</a>&nbsp;</em>met&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>&nbsp;</em>by way of <i>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</i>, so if that sounds like your cup of tea, then you should be keeping this one on your radar.</p>
<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S, although there's no release date for the game yet. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After nearly four decades of Zelda games across a ton of different platforms and perspectives, it’s truly hard to predict where Nintendo will take this beloved series. They’ve done open world and end of the world. They’ve had touch controls and motion controls. They’ve been single player and multiplayer. The latest installment, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, is already shaping up to feel like a classic Zelda adventure, and in classic Nintendo form, also features some really cool and unique twists. It’s also the first Zelda game where Zelda is fully playable through the entire story and with that she’s brought a whole new way to experience it.</p><p>By learning “echoes” Zelda is able to quickly build up a collection of objects, creatures, and more that she can use to traverse the world, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies. After some routine world shattering chaos which Zelda is unfortunately blamed for, Echoes of Wisdom opens with a post-jailbreak stealth sequence that plays a bit like the part in Ocarina of Time where Link first sneaks into Hyrule Castle. However, while you might be able to have Zelda brute force this section by just running and hiding, I realized it was immediately much more fun to make the castle guards think they accidentally captured an insane demonic witch who could summon furniture at a whim and torment them with magically materialized objects falling from the sky. Now, I didn’t need to play like this, but hey, it was much funnier that way. A guard tried chasing me down and, in a moment of panic, I summoned a wooden table behind me to block and distract him and probably make him think he was losing his mind or that the place was haunted. I then proceeded to learn more echoes for my permanent collection: a wooden crate, the traditional ceramic pot that Link has destroyed tens of millions of, and more. It immediately made me wonder just how many of these things would become part of Zelda’s repertoire and if I’d be in possession of an entire IKEA catalog by the end of the game. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And that’s where Nintendo’s vision for the next era of top down 2D Zelda games really clicked for me. It’s been eleven years since the excellent The Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds was released for the 3DS, a game that notoriously took the rather formulaic and predictable flow of traditional 2D Zelda games and made it much more freeform, allowing players to collect items and defeat dungeons in pretty much any order of their choosing. Since then Nintendo has also completely reinvented the 3D Zelda series. Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom not only gave players a massive open world sandbox to explore at their own pace, they also gave us a seemingly infinite toolset to tackle them. Tears of the Kingdom especially relied on these mechanics, nudging players to build elaborate (or janky) vehicles and contraptions to make their way across the lands and skies of Hyrule. And between Breath of the Wild and Tears, Nintendo gave us The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, a gorgeously reimagined take on their excellent and uniquely weird 1993 Game Boy game, now with a toyetic and claymation inspired art style. It was about as traditional as 2D Zelda can get and I adored it, but it was also a remake of a game I’d played countless times before, so it didn’t exactly give us a clear vision of where the future of top down Zelda games was heading. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. </p></div><p>The obvious answer at the time was to remake the Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons games in the same art style since they originally looked and played like Link’s Awakening did on Game Boy. But one of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. Just you when you think they’ll do the most obvious thing, they hit you with a surprise out of nowhere. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom takes everything they’ve learned from decades of 2D Zelda games, throws in some of the freeform creativity and problem solving from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, and puts it all together in the beautiful Link’s Awakening remake art style. It’s also solving one of the biggest gripes players have with modern 3D Zelda games by bringing back the traditional dungeons, a key ingredient of this cherished recipe that’s been sorely missing recently. It’s taking all of the best things that the 2D and 3D Zelda games have done and fusing them together to create the future of the series, and so far it’s really working for me. Seemingly every screen in Echoes of Wisdom provided me with an opportunity to approach it in a unique way while still feeling like I was playing an old-school top-down Zelda game. Initially, my impulse was to just slash everything with a sword like I’ve made Link do for most of my life, and I was admittedly a bit frustrated that I couldn’t. It takes a bit to get used to Zelda’s abilities here, but once you find your groove, things start to get really fun and interesting. You could throw rocks at enemies to kill them like some sort of brute savage, but wouldn’t it be funnier to swarm them to death with bats, summon moblins to target them with spears, or my personal favorite: bowling ball them to death with a small army of adorable but dangerous Caramadillos? God, I love these weird little guys. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Zelda does eventually get a sword in Echoes of Wisdom - sort of - by defeating an evil imposter version of Link, taking control of his iconic weapon set, and learning swordfighter form. This form also lets you jump higher and perform spin attacks, but it’s not without its caveats. Zelda’s sword power is on a limited energy budget and once it’s been depleted, she’ll need to replenish it to use it again. It seems like you’ll be able to expand your sword’s energy reserves as you progress through the game, but at the start it can only be used for a brief time before it runs out – at least until you find some more energy again. Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games, and you’ll likely be utilizing her Tri-Rod and its bottomless bag of summonable objects much more often, with her sword being used sparingly and for key moments and conflicts. After all, if you’ve got an ax-wielding Darknut warrior in your back pocket you’re less likely to miss your trusty blade in the moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games.</p></div><p>Those Darknuts were particularly effective at defeating evil Link, almost to the point where I felt bad doing it. That’s Link! I love that dude! Cornering him with one psychotically possessed Darknut echo, looping around behind him, and spawning another one to catch him off guard proved to be a quick way to confuse and surprise him and deal a bunch of damage, but again, that was by no means the only way to take him down. I probably could’ve bludgeoned him to death with furniture or some other comically horrific way to kill one of my favorite guys. Do whatever you feel you need to do. There’s a limit to what you can summon with your Tri-Rod, with some things costing one point (meaning you can summon several of them) and others using several. I’m hoping you’ll be able to expand your Tri-Rod’s power later in the game, because summoning a small entourage of enemies to roll with you at any time would be really awesome. Or covering half of a screen with pots just because you can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the highlights of my preview demo was passing the controller back and forth with my fellow IGN Nintendo nerd, Zelda obsessive, and good buddy Logan Plant and seeing how he’d get through puzzles and battles in his own way. We each had unique solutions for problems, and personal favorite things we’d summon and watching somebody else think frantically and react on the fly was so much fun. Things like spiders (complete with climbable webs) and fire items added a chaotic and hilariously unexpected layer to each scenario. A thing you summon won’t attack you or deal you damage, but if it happens to say, light something else on fire, that fire could come back to hurt you. There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity. There was rarely a truly wrong way to solve something here in the same way you could technically cut a loaf of bread with a spoon, but there’s probably a smarter way to make a sandwich. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity.</p></div><p>The Suthorn Ruins dungeon was the perfect proving ground to test all of these toys out. It’s a traditional Zelda dungeon through and through and it looks and feels fantastic. It was truly exciting to finally be back in one of these again. But instead of relying on one newly discovered item or weapon to beat it like you would in an older Zelda dungeon, you’re learning how to summon new things every other minute. You’ve got an entire arsenal to play with, and each room feels rife for experimentation and playfulness. Some puzzles had a clear and obvious answer while others demanded some creativity, and seeing how different people solved them in different ways was a total joy. The speedrunning and sequence-breaking communities out there are gonna have a blast with this game.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Traversing the Still World Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>This ever-growing library of tools and toys work wonderfully in the overworld, too, which seems absolutely massive by 2D Zelda standards. I am so excited to uncover every single secret on this map. Using your echoes you’ll be able to climb over walls and trees and other obstacles that used to keep you locked to specific paths and routes in the older Zelda games. I’m interested to see how they’ll manage to keep players from rushing to the final dungeon or boss, since as of now it seems like you can climb up and over nearly everything, whether you’re using a spider web or a crude staircase you made out of dirty old beds, which, by the way, will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing. I’ve got a lot of questions around how these options will play out in the full game. The final boss battles in most Zelda games are epic and awesome and also generally require a specific sword stab or light arrow for the final blow. Will you be able to kill Ganon by dropping a coffee table on his head in Echoes of Wisdom? Well, who knows, but I’m excited to see players try these kinds of things out. One apprehension I do have is just how you’ll organize your gigantic collection of Echoes as the game progresses. There are a few decent options for selecting items to summon at a whim (like “most used”) but no favorites list as far as I can tell, meaning you’ll often find yourself scrolling through a ton of different objects, creatures, and other assorted nonsense that you might need at any given moment. It’s not necessarily tedious and the gameplay pauses to allow you to find what you need at the moment, but I could see it being a bit cumbersome once you’ve unlocked a few dozen different things in your library. And with nearly every enemy and object in the world seemingly being scannable, you’ll likely have a ton to sort through by the end of the game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Beds will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing.</p></div><p>Echoes of Wisdom is generally incredibly pretty to look at, which is no surprise since it’s using the very charming Link’s Awakening remake art style. The world is teeming with life, quirky characters, and animations, and the town I visited was lovely and I couldn’t wait to meet everyone and snoop around their houses. That said, the Link’s Awakening remake was notoriously taxing on the Nintendo Switch hardware with noticeable framerate dips frequently appearing in the overworld, and while Echoes of Wisdom feels much smoother on that front, there are still moments where it hiccups a bit. It’s not a dealbreaker or anything but it’s worth pointing out. Hey Nintendo, whenever you’re ready to release that Nintendo Switch successor you keep hinting at, we’ll take it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All in all, Echoes of Wisdom feels like an earnest and clever return to the Zelda games I grew up playing. Challenging, inventive, fresh, and genuinely just really fun. Every new puzzle and conflict is a blank canvas for experimentation, but it’s all wrapped in that distinctively familiar and challenging Zelda game vibe that made me fall in love with these games to begin with. It’s vintage Zelda mixed with the playful and creativity based gameplay that younger audiences are used to building their own stories with these days. It’s not pushing that side of things as far as games like Minecraft, Roblox, or even Tears of the Kingdom does, but it’s also not rigid and specific with the way it makes you approach it. Attempting to juggle several of the core tenets of what makes the Zelda games so special to so many people across so many generations and make them all happy is an extremely tall order. The longer any franchise thrives, the more difficult it becomes to please everyone that approaches it with specific expectations. Every fan has a different reason why Zelda is special to them. But so far, Echoes of Wisdom feels like it’s taking the best elements of the most beloved modern and vintage Zelda games and making them work together in a pretty clever synchronicity. Whether they’ll get along for the whole trip remains to be seen, but right now it feels like a smart move and a truly exciting way to push the classic side of the franchise towards the future.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Borderlands players are no strangers to cracking codes and uncovering secrets in the game franchise, but the latest round of community sleuthing has proven to be especially lucrative. Thanks to a seemingly ordinary card given out at the recent PAX West convention, Borderlands players have received what is arguably the best Shift code in existence, and all it took was a solid grasp of binary language.</p><p>The card in question (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/the-borderlands-series-most-valuable-shift-code-ever-is-now-available-for-everyone-all-thanks-to-genius-fans-cracking-a-secret-code-that-im-baffled-was-solved-so-fast/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>) featured a D20 die in the center, and the tabletop icon was flanked by an inconspicuous pattern.

After debuting to dismal sales just under two weeks ago, Sony made the call to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">pull the plug on Concord</a> and delist the title. But in the limited time that the game has left, players are trying to get a rare Platinum trophy by repeatedly killing their own characters in Concord's Rivalry matches.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Rivalry was intended to give two teams of five players a best-of-seven contest to determine the winner. But since both teams get experience points for participating, players have taken to immediately jumping off platforms to their demise. It gives the rival team a win, but it also helps level up the losers as well.</p><p>In theory, developer Firewalk Studios could have added adjustments to Concord that would have made the team-suicide tactic less appealing to players by taking away the benefit. But since the title is only going to be online for an additional two days, it's extremely unlikely that issue will be addressed at all. The real question is whether players have enough time to grind their way to that Platinum trophy before Concord is pulled.</p><p>Sony clearly had grand ambitions for Concord, and the company even lent out the potential franchise to an episode of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-director-making-a-video-game-tv-series-and-its-not-what-you-think/1100-6525800/" data-ref-id="1100-6525800">Secret Level</a>, Prime Video's upcoming video game anthology series that will premiere in December. Since the game itself will have been offline for months by that time, Concord's spotlight episode will get to be the last reminder of what could have been... at least for the people who aren't chasing that trophy.</p><p>Concord will be taken offline by Sony on September 6. It remains to be seen if it will return, and what form that would take.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-a-mighty-good-time.971832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mighty-morphin-power-rangers-ritas-rewind-preview-mighty-good-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a child, I quit playing soccer to become a Power Ranger. My dream did not come true.</p>
<p>That's the harsh reality of the world, but it looks like I might have another chance at achieving a childhood goal with the upcoming beat 'em up, <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind</em>. We got to check this game out on the show floor of PAX West 2024, so read below for our thoughts!</p>

<h2>Grab Some Friends for <em>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Rita</em>'<em>s</em> <em>Rewind</em></h2>
<p>The show floor of a convention is chaotic and loud, but the screams of joy from those playing <em>Rita's Rewind</em> could be heard across the entire building. I do not exaggerate when I say the folks playing this title were among the happiest in the crowd. A mix of nostalgia and rock solid, well-designed beat 'em up gameplay make <em>Rita's Rewind</em> an upcoming hit.</p>
<p>After actually playing <em>Rita's Rewind </em>for myself, the crowd's excitement is certainly understandable. The appeal of playing a beat 'em up with friends never dulls, and its entertainment value shoots up just a bit more with the bombastic, tokusatsu nature of <em>Power Rangers</em>.</p>
<p>In my demo, I played across two levels in the role of Blue Ranger, the very character I so wished to be as a child. Me and three other players button mashed to victory as our Power Rangers punched, grabbed, and jump-kicked across the stage, taking out goons unfortunate enough to be in our way.</p>

<p><em>Rita's Rewind</em> tends to err on the side of easy, at least for these two levels, but it's certainly a fun time. It does exactly what it needs to do and provides for a great outlet to unwind and beat up enemies. Your character's attacks aren't complicated to pull off, and thus, you get to do cool things. Dopamine is off the charts when you're brawling through the streets as a colorful group of badasses.</p>
<p>Brawling across a rooftop and fighting off the avian Tenga Warriors, we arrive in front of Goldar, which fans of the series will immediately recognize. We brawl away, avoiding (or soaking) attacks and eventually defeat him. But, in a surprise twist, Goldar enlarges and becomes the size of a skyscraper! That's when the demo ends, so clearly surprises are in store.</p>
<p>One point I want to heavily emphasize is the fantastic CRT filter Digital Eclipse created for <em>Rita's Rewind</em>. This filter isn't present in current screenshots, so it can be toggled. Just know that this is perhaps the most authentic CRT filter I've seen in a game.</p>

<p>The signature look of the CRT screen was authentically recreated on the demo floor's large, flat screen TV. It even replicated the slightly curved surface of the CRT, near the edges of the screen. <em>Rita's Rewind</em> will look great, filter or not, but this filter just brings it to the next level.</p>
<p>What else can I say about <em>Rita's Rewind</em>? It was a very quick demo, around 15 minutes in total, so I only got a short time with it, but it was a blast all the same. I just know I'll be grabbing a few friends so we can play this together, like any good beat 'em up deserves.</p>

<p>This time around, though, Hello Games' ambitions are a little more small-scale, at least from a player perspective. The big new addition in Aquarius is the ability to fish; you can now grab your fishing rod and kick back, either alongside your buddies or solo, catching some weird space fish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-fish-traps.jpg?itok=bWy5AZ5d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-aquarius-update-fish-traps.jpg?itok=a_6yo2it 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knows what alien creatures could be contained within those fish traps?</figcaption></figure><p>Fish you can catch in the Aquarius update range from "common minnow-like fish" through to "huge alien marine mammals", according to Hello Games, and there are plenty to find, so get out there and get fishin'.</p>
<p>To help you in your fishing endeavors, you'll have access to a deployable Exo-Skiff, which can float over water and hold its own cold storage inventory. It's ideal for keeping fish once you've caught them.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to build automated fish traps to help you catch fish while you're off doing other things. Once you've caught your fish - however you've done it - you can then use them in new cooking recipes and ingredient combinations.</p>
<p>Naturally, you'll also find a new page in the Wonders Catalogue, which lets you document all of the weird space fish you've caught and where you found them.</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff to discover in the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Aquarius update besides fishing, too. You can read a full rundown of everything that's in the update <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here on the game's official website</a>.</p>
<p><em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and so is the Aquarius update. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-first-minecraft-movie-trailer-is-out-and-it-kinda-sucks.971826/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros has released the very first teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, showing off what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, and it looks...well, pretty bad, to be honest.</p>
<p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, for 'tis its name, will star Jason Momoa, Jack Black, and Jennifer Coolidge, as well as&nbsp;<em>Wednesday</em>'s Emma Myers,&nbsp;<em>The Color Purple</em>'s Danielle Brooks, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen of&nbsp;<em>Just Mercy&nbsp;</em>fame.</p>
<p>Momoa, Hansen, Myers, and Brooks play people from the real world who find themselves transported into a magical cubic world where creativity is king. Together with Black's Steve, they must journey through this world, protect it from monsters like Piglins and Zombies, and "reconnect" with their creative qualities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=MGVE9B1D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-movie-trailer-jason-momoa.jpg?itok=WCJnwNh7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will star Jason Momoa and Jack Black.</figcaption></figure><p>The movie is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Nacho Libre&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Napoleon Dynamite&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess, and the music comes courtesy of Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, who also wrote the soundtracks for&nbsp;<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lego Movie</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>(together with Wataru Hokoyama in the latter case).</p>
<p>Honestly, if you ask me, the trailer's looking pretty rough. Sure, it's visually impressive on a surface level, but the aesthetic looks off for&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>; it's too high-fidelity, too polished, too clean.</p>
<p>That's to say nothing of the writing, which, to me, feels like your bog-standard bland Hollywood "well, that happened"-level snarky comedy. The day the Marvel Cinematic Universe stops infecting the writing approach of every other light-hearted franchise-minded movie out there will be a happy day indeed.</p>
<p>Should you wish to, you can see the first trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>

<p>If you feel as I do about the trailer, then you can take solace in the fact that&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>isn't the only&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>adaptation we're getting; an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix">animated series is also in the works</a> over at Netflix.</p>
<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>arrives in theaters on April 2nd. I look forward to it taking roughly all the money in the world regardless of its quality.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6.971823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
If somebody grabs you from behind and turns you into a human shield in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, they can drag you around for about five seconds before you die, assuming they don't execute you early. Here are 12 things you can do in those five seconds:
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
1) Lean back in your chair, throw your arms up and luxuriously stretch out your shoulder muscles, while gazing through the window opposite at the sun and clouds and savouring anew the wonder and strangeness of being alive, on this particular day in this particular place on this particular ball of rock, in a vast and empty cosmos
</p>
<p>
2) Switch windows and complete a move order in the excellent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arco">Arco</a>, a tactics RPG with freeze-time combat, set in a fantastical version of South America
</p>
<p>
3) Be the bigger person and congratulate your captor over the game's proximity chat. Say something like: "Oh my heavens, what an excellent flanking manoeuvre! You certainly called <em>my</em> duty."
</p>
<p>
4) Explain to your captor that they have blundered right into your trap. How could they have fallen for such an obvious ruse? Truly, it would be laughable if it weren't so <em>pathetic</em>.
</p>
<p>
5) Seize the opportunity to appraise the battle in pop-out third-person view. This is your chance to make note of future cover positions, and check out everybody else's usage of the new omnimovement system, without having to worry about hitting them. Generally, when I'm fighting somebody who knows how to omnimove in Blops 6 it feels like shooting at spiders. Very large spiders with assault rifles.
</p>
<p>
6) Ingest and chew exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle
</p>
<p>
7) Spit out exactly one mouthful of regular-flavoured Pot Noodle, because that shit has been on your desk since Friday, you really need to give the room a once-over before your folks get home - oh god, what time is it, how is it already 4pm
</p>
<p>
8) Unleash your patented nonsensical catchphrase. "There goes the barnyard, and you can tell 'em I said so!" "Snoot's as good as a slap to a whistle on Wednesday, Reverend!"
</p>
<p>
9) Don't just monologue over proximity chat - rediscover the lost art of conversation. Perhaps your captor is experiencing tough times and could benefit from a kind word from a passing stranger. Be sure to prepare some brief, supportive quotes in advance. For example: "The heart is the toughest part of the body - tenderness is in the hands" (Carolyn Forché).
</p>
<p>
10) Loudly and derisively compare the meatshield mechanic in Blops 6 to meatshielding in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a> series and especially Gears Of War 3, which was superior in terms of both visual flair and intricacy of execution. Kids today wouldn't know a meatshield from a cover-mantle. You can't even turn me into a human bomb, you <em>poseur</em>.
</p>
<p>
11) Try to pass yourself off as the in-game match commentator. We're losing A!
</p>
<p>
12) Take a few seconds to drink in the spectacle of your character being abducted. Nod approvingly at your surgical choice of cosmetics, the perfection of your skin-and-camo accessorisation. Not many people can look fabulous while being hauled around like a mattress, but once again, you've managed it.
</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/five-questions-about-gamings-future-with-a-video-game-analyst/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>One of my favorite follows <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella?ref=remapradio.com"><u>on the cursed social network formerly known as Twitter is Mat Piscatella</u></a>, executive director and video game industry advisor at Circana, a company that analyzes and tracks consumer behavior. In other words, they track video game sales and trends, and try to figure out where the industry’s been, where it’s at, and where it’s going.</p><p>For old heads, you might remember Circana as the NPD Group. Back when there used to be semi-public access to video game sales information, the NPD Group’s monthly data drops were legendary. It was the “Steam concurrents” of the Obama era, a small but informative glimpse into understanding whether a game you were hoping might get a sequel had actually sold well.</p><p>Like I said, Piscatella is a great follow because he isn’t afraid to often spit back at the many, many weirdos who confront him for the sin of sharing context about how video games are doing.</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Dear Enthusiast Gaming Forum,</p><p>If you're gonna discount the success of Switch sales because it's a conncected/portable hybrid device, please discount the success of PS2 being a gaming/DVD player hybrid device.</p><p>Or, better yet, don't discount the success of either idk.</p></div>— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1822648179600576882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=remapradio.com">August 11, 2024</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Consider this a potential setup for a podcast appearance, but I had an opportunity to run a few questions by him <a href="https://www.circana.com/intelligence/press-releases/2024/u-s-video-game-market-to-decline-in-2024-but-circana-forecasts-2025-rebound/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>because Circana released its “Future of Video Game Report”</u></a> that looks at 2024’s troubles—sluggish hardware, a continued post-COVID bump sales hangover, a distinct lack of Switch 2 or Grand Theft Auto VI—and why, with some luck, 2025 might be different.&nbsp;</p><p>Given how much we’ve talked on Remap Radio about the seemingly never ending layoffs and the “survive to 2025” mentality that’s gathered amongst developers, I wanted to call in an expert.</p><p>What are the reasons for optimism? And where might it all go wrong?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Please, lord, give me an updated Steam Deck and a new Switch.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Your report suggests the video game industry is looking at a “rebound” in 2025 because of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and the expectation that Nintendo will release new hardware. I keep hearing that phrase “survive until ‘25,” aka just hold on until 2025. What does a “rebound” look like, though? Fewer layoffs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In this case, it would be mid to high single-digit percentage growth in consumer spending, and a return of some players that have lapsed following the peak of video game engagement seen in 2021. The challenge is that the market is shifting even more into winners and everyone else—meaning overall spending growth is expected in 2025, but the big winners of this growth are likely to be Take-Two Interactive and Nintendo.</p><p>However, not all developers or publishers will benefit equally. What may happen is a return of investment into other areas of game development helped by the growth in overall spending, which could theoretically ease the pressure we've seen over the past couple of years that has resulted in so many layoffs and closures—this is not guaranteed.</p><p>The video game market continues to be challenged by the “forever games” like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and Call of Duty, which continue to dominate player count and engagement. These games have fostered deep connections with the player base through continual updates and social hooks.&nbsp;</p><p>While in the past, a new game would have to compete mainly against other new games in its release window, now the biggest competitor to any new game entering the market is <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p><strong>If 2025 is a rebound year, how would you characterize 2024? I feel like I'm drowning in a lot of good games to play, and yet layoffs are regular and enormous.</strong></p><p>Spending on video game products is up slightly in 2024 year-to-date compared to last year. However, this small gain has been mainly driven by mobile, with<em> Monopoly Go </em>doing most of the heavy lifting. There are great new games, sure, but engagement (and spending) is tending to pool at the very high end of the market, with the biggest games (particularly games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and other forever games) taking more and more of the overall pie.&nbsp;</p><p>Finding breakout success for a new title is more like winning the lottery now. It's not enough to have a good game—it requires a lot of hard work, perfect timing, and more than a little luck. </p><figure><figcaption><span>A deep source of pain for many parents—and many video game companies chasing its profits.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>People expected both<em> Grand Theft Auto VI </em>and new Nintendo hardware this year. It's hard to imagine it slips out of 2025, but <em>Grand Theft Auto VI c</em>ertainly could. What happens if one, or both, don't arrive in 2025?</strong></p><p>It's likely to be the difference between mid-to-high single-digit percentage increases in consumer spending on video games and mid-to-high single-digit percentage declines in 2025. We're on the downside of the PlayStation 5/Xbox Series generation, and the Switch is very late in its cycle. We still have the pressures of higher prices in everyday spending categories like food and more desire from consumers to spend on experiences, such as travel.&nbsp;</p><p>The mass market consumer needs a push to spend more on gaming, especially if they can play <em>Fortnite </em>or a free-to-play mobile game to scratch the gaming itch. <em>EA Sports College Football 2</em>5 did exactly this, bringing a significant number of lapsed players back to the console space, generating sales of not just the game but also of hardware and accessories. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> and a Switch successor are likely to do the same, but to an even bigger extent.</p><p><strong>In the report, you noted the decline of physical media. Do you think we'll even have physical media with the next generation of consoles? For game companies, what does physical media represent? Why is it still important to them, if it is at all?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I'm expecting one more generation of physical media for PlayStation, perhaps two more for Nintendo, but Xbox Series may be the last Xbox generation with physical media—we'll have to wait and see on that one. Some players certainly prefer physical media, especially collectors and families. There is also a convenience factor for those with limited or spotty internet access.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at purchasing behavior, more and more consumers are choosing the digital route, with this adoption rate increasing over time. Physical media is much more nice-to-have than need-to-have at the moment, although there are certainly benefits to having a physical release.</p><p>However, I don't expect the digital adoption trend to slow down.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uE0XFJSVZA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Fortnite Battle Royale Chapter 5 Season 4 - Absolute Doom | Official Season Trailer"></iframe></figure><p><strong>Part of the problem the last few years has been a change in spending habits from COVID-19. Was any of that real? Can the industry realistically try to capture that kind of attention, interest, and spending again, or was it all completely a mirage?</strong></p><p>Everyone who ever dreamed of spending more time playing video games did so during 2020-21. We know the ceiling for both the percentage of people who want to play video games and how many hours they'd like to play if they could play all they wished. Are we going to reach the same levels of player count and engagement again when there are so many other draws on their attention and time compared to 2020 or 2021? Not anytime soon, if we ever do.&nbsp;</p><p>As I see it, the video game market went from a growth market to mature practically overnight. Meaning, since <em>Pong</em>, the video game market has continued to grow as more and more people have discovered gaming over time. But in 2020-21, a huge influx of players and time found their way to the video game market and many of them liked it and stuck around. Others have again left gaming, having been pulled away by other things. So now, it's more about optimization of the player base rather than pursuing more organic growth by finding new players.&nbsp;</p><p>This has been a painful transition in thinking for many in the industry, especially those who assumed that player growth would continue forever, especially after the boom seen in 2020-21.&nbsp;</p>

I did the same last night and had mixed luck, with half the team’s offing themselves at the start while the others kept playing.

That’s clearly something that’s meant to be achieved over weeks if not months, since new weekly and seasonal jobs net you tons of bonus XP that speed things up. Otherwise just grinding round after round is a real slog, which is what Real Radec discovered. “I’ve been doing this shit for an hour and only went from Level 44 to 45,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/realradec/status/1831054519167529019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> in a follow-up. “I am NOT getting this Platinum bro.”</p><p>The Platinum trophy currently has a rating of “ultra rare” on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://psnprofiles.com/trophies/28912-concord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSN Profiles</a></span>, suggesting that less than .1 percent of <em>Concord </em>players tracked have unlocked it. Considering how low the hero shooter’s play count appears to have been to begin with, with some estimates <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">placing it around 25,000 players or less</a></span>, that’s a rarified group to be in, and we know how much PS5 fans love their exclusivity. </p><p>I’m mostly bummed because I was enjoying chasing the<em> Concord </em>Platinum at my own pace, with the game growing on me the more I progressed. I figured it would become a testament to a dead game at some point, but not this fast. And unfortunately, unlike some other players, I don’t have 48 hours to spend holding back on the analog stick. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Hello Games has just revealed what’s coming next to No Man’s Sky – <strong>fishing</strong>. In the Aquarius update, users will see a plethora of changes following on from the new water ecosystem introduced in Worlds Part I in July. Today, you can install this update and take advantage of new fishing mechanics, as well as deep-sea diving, boat-based exploration, new recipes, quests, and much more.</p>



<p>It’s another super-sized No Man’s Sky update.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-on-delivering">Keep On Delivering</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">next free update in No Man’s Sky</a> has been revealed as ‘Aquarius’, and those with a passion for water-based activities will be enamoured by it. Instead of digging through the vast expanse of an infinite universe, you can now land on a planet, get your rod out, and start fishing, either alone or with friends.</p>



<p>Hello Games has added a wealth of marine creatures to the game, as well as new recipes and fresh ways to explore the gargantuan world. Users can now build and deploy an ‘Exo-Skiff’, a platform that floats over water and has on-board storage.</p>



<p>It has much more depth than just a bait-and-catch mechanic, though. Players can seek out fresh challenges and find long-lost secrets by reeling in relics and messages in bottles, which adds a little spice to the feature that some might think is mundane.</p>



<p>With the new ocean elements comes deep-sea exploration, and to succeed at that activity, players can now craft and upgrade diving equipment, allowing them to dig deeper into the trillions of planets in No Man’s Sky than ever before. And of course, No Man’s Sky: Aquarius, which is technically known as Patch 5.10, features stacks of upgrades, improvements, and quality-of-life tweaks.</p>



<p>It’s another stunning – and free – update from Hello Games.</p>

    <p><span>Name-changing update out now for PC.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><em>Bulwark: Falconeer Chronicles</em> has become <em><a title="Games > Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bulwark-evolution-falconeer-chronicles">Bulwark Evolution: Falconeer Chronicles</a></em>, publisher <a title="Companies > Wired Productions [83 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/wired-productions">Wired Productions</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Tomas Sala [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/tomas-sala">Tomas Sala</a> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/290100/view/4587567213536502598" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-912488"></span></p><p>The name-changing update is available now for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,151 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> and is coming to consoles soon. Here is an overview of the new content, via Wired Productions:</p><blockquote><p>Indie solo developer, Tomas Sala once again expands the horizons of “The Great Ursee.” and truly evolves it beyond the already unique and innovative city builder it was.</p><p>Following extensive feedback from players, Bulwark: Evolution now features three distinct ways to play with each mode providing a unique experience:</p><ul><li><strong>The Original <em>Bulwark</em> <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a></strong> – Players will explore the Great Ursee as they build their grand civilization, scavenge for resources, create trade routes, and form alliances with other factions scattered across the waves.</li><li><strong>Free Build Mode</strong> – Create without consequence in this cozy mode, free from the conflict and challenges of standard play, where players can experiment and build without limits.</li><li><strong>Total Conquest</strong> – The beacons are lit, and the fires of war are here! In this challenging new mode, players start <em>Bulwark</em> at war with every faction. There’s no diplomacy and the frequency and scale of raids is like nothing they’ve ever seen before. Building alone won’t suffice— players will need grit, determination, and strategic expertise to survive the onslaught of the Great Ursee.</li></ul><p>On top of this, the game has doubled its open-world content, added clearer progression, more strategic options and tons of new mechanics, including new fortresses for players to unlock, as well the ability to sail the high seas in their own ocean-going flagship as they into battle against enemies who are now are more capable and deadly than ever before.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>And here is a full breakdown of the update, via Tomas Sala:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Evolution</strong></p><p>You cannot get someone like me to run an Early Access campaign, I don’t even know at launch where the game is gonna end up in six months, it’d be a disaster.</p><p>And here we are five months after launch and I’m still working away as if every week is a new launch. The driver for this is community engagement. Folks coming in and fantasizing what the game could and should be, or sharing their frustration where the game doesn’t mix their expectations. This has been a learning experience for me. Ever since my days modding (<em>Moonpath to Elsweyr</em>), I’ve been looking at a way to get back to a more communal form of development. I don’t like premade systems and settled expectations, thus first the evolving demo and now Bulwark Evolution came about. My own way of creating a workable relationship with my audience and community, something modern, flexible and rapidly evolving, where updates come daily not monthly and communication is direct and without intermediates. Bulwark Evolution isn’t the endgame; for me, it marks what I consider as close to a 1.0 version as I can deliver, but it’s just another jumping-off point.</p><p>So yeah, I have learned a lot better to listen to what all of you were saying… And you have all said a lot! Plus, I’ve worked a lot to evolve the game, so lets keep doing that going forward!</p><p>Thank you all so much for providing feedback, leaving reviews, engaging on discord or here, it’s been a pleasure and if I stumbled or failed along the way, I apologize and hope all this work proves the best intent to be the best game developer I can be, albeit as experimental and unconventional as always.</p><p>Cheers.</p><p>—Tomas Sala</p><p><strong>Total Conquest Mode</strong></p><ul><li>You start at war with the other factions except your starting faction and freehouse.</li><li>You gain one

            <p>
UK high street chain GAME has acknowledged customers awaiting pre-orders are currently facing "issues" accessing their accounts online, as they wait for delayed deliveries to arrive. 
</p>
<p>
GAME customers with items they had pre-ordered and already paid for told Eurogamer they had received no advance notice of any issue, and have been unable to check the status of their orders online. The issues follow Eurogamer's reporting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders">GAME was ending in-store pre-orders</a>.
</p>
<p>
"The GAME website is currently undergoing upgrades, and as a result, we are aware that some customers are experiencing issues accessing their GAME accounts and order details," a spokesperson for parent company Frasers Group said. 
</p>
<p>
"We are working to have these resolved quickly and encourage customers to get in touch with our customer service team if they are experiencing issues. We apologise for any inconvenience this has caused." 
</p>
<p>
However, one customer reported to Eurogamer they had contacted GAME's customer service only to be told there was no estimate for their item's delayed dispatch - and a refund could not be offered as order was "processing".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer understands the current GAME website maintenance is another part of the chain's integration with Frasers Group systems, and follows the end of the GAME Wallet functionality last month - something Eurogamer originally reported on in July. 
</p>
<p>
At the time, Eurogamer also reported that GAME would be ending in-store pre-orders. This year has seen the chain <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">end the ability to trade-in products and buy pre-owned games</a>, ceding that corner of the high street market to CEX. It has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">wound down its GAME Reward program</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-dropping-xbox-all-access-offering-later-this-month">halted support for Xbox All Access</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-stop-selling-physical-games-other-than-fulfilling-pre-orders-report">GAME denied a report online that claimed it would stop selling physical games outright</a>.

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/236850/view/4599951478208420913" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>, the studio says that four "essential" DLCs for the game will be bundled into the base game starting from October 17th. All current and future players will receive these DLCs for free, and you "won't even need to do anything to receive them".</p>
<p>Three of the DLCs in question were originally part of the game's Starter Edition, and the fourth has been added to "enrich the core experience of&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>even more".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/europa-universalis-iv-free-dlc-map.jpg?itok=9h230ZNF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/europa-universalis-iv-free-dlc-map.jpg?itok=GDjuC6bJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>player, some free goodies could be heading your way.</figcaption></figure><p>The four DLCs you'll be able to get for free are as follows.</p>

</ul><p>These DLCs add features like new religious gameplay elements, new leader personality traits, and new models and pictures for certain units and faiths, plus lots more.</p>
<p>If you already happen to own these DLCs, Paradox says it'll be introducing a brand new Starter Edition of&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>when this initiative begins, and also that the price of the Ultimate Bundle will be lowered.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't look like you'll get any kind of freebie or extra goodies if you do already own these DLCs, but if you don't, then this feels like a pretty great opportunity to get back into&nbsp;<em>Europa Universalis IV</em>.</p>

You'll watch your nation grow and change from just before the Renaissance up to the Age of Revolutions.</p>
<p>As you'd expect from a Paradox game, you'll have minute control over everything from trade strategy through to diplomacy and warfare, so how your nation evolves really is up to you.</p>
<p><em>Europa Universalis IV&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam</a>. Just make sure you don't buy any of the four DLCs listed above before October 17th, eh?</p>

<p>A Minecraft Movie has just received a teaser and a 2025 release window.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Minecraft Movie is an upcoming live-action adaptation by Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary P, and Jared Hess directs it. The cast features Jason Momoa, Jack Black, Emma Myers, Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen, and Jennifer Coolidge. Check out the latest teaser below.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The movie’s teaser takes us to a Minecraft-themed world with hyper-realistic visuals. Everything is square, as it should be; however, the level of texture on the blocks is very close to reality. Fans get to see how the flora and fauna of this world will appear as the cast takes on various kinds of deadly mobs like Piglins and Zombies. The teaser also showcases the iconic crafting table in action and how you can build anything you can imagine.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-plot">A Minecraft Movie’s Plot</h2>



<p>The teaser’s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE2YZhcC4NY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">description</a> gives players an idea of A Minecraft Movie’s plot. It seems that the cast will find themselves struggling in the real world before they are suddenly warped to a “cubic wonderland” through a mysterious portal. To return home, the characters will have to master this world and also protect it from evil as they set foot on a quest given to them by expert crafter Steve. Also, Jack Black will not be turning into a block to play the role.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>The next free update for No Man's Sky has arrived, and it introduces a feature that developer Hello Games has wanted to bring to the game for a long time: fishing.</p><p>The Aquarius update, which arrives alongside the 5.10 patch, adds fishing as a core new feature. "Players can now explore the universe to find their perfect waterside spot, hopping with fish. Sit and relax alone with your thoughts, or stand alongside fellow Travellers as you look out over alien vistas waiting for a bite," reads a line from the expansion's description.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky - Aquarius Update Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Players are now able to add a fishing rig to the multi-tool that allows them to fish in bodies of water. There are more than 160 varieties of fish in the game, spread throughout the game's many planets. Certain types of fish only appear at set times of day and during specific weather conditions. Players can fish from shore or trek out into the water in an Exo-Skiff to fish for critters in deeper waters.</p><p>Players can use normal bait to catch standard fish or craft special bait to attract rare fish, including "legendary" fish types. Players may also hook onto messages in a bottle that contain information about players who have fished in certain spots before.</p><p>The fish that players catch can be cooked and eaten, and the Aquarius update introduces a variety of new recipes to choose from. Additionally, the game's Wonders Catalogue now contains a section dedicated to fishing achievements, detailing things like fish types caught, their weight, and how to catch specific types of fish.</p><p>The Aquarius update also allows players to deploy autonomous floating fish farms to collect fish while they're off-world doing other things. There is a new event called the Aquarius expedition, which begins today, September 4, and challenges players to catch fish from across the galaxy over a period of six weeks. Players who complete the expedition will unlock special customization parts for their boat, along with an underwater jetpack and a nice fishing rod called the Lost Angler.</p><p>Be sure to <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2024/09/aquarius-update/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">read the full blog post</a> on the Aquarius update to get all the essential information about what's new for fishing and more in this update. The full patch notes follow below.</p><h2><strong>No Man's Sky 5.10 patch notes</strong></h2><ul><li>Players can now install a Fishing Rig in their Multi-Tool, enabling them to cast their line into any body of water and begin fishing. Purchase Fishing Rig blueprints aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li>Over 160 varieties of fish are available to catch. Finding each fish will require exploration of different planets, fishing at different times of day and during different weather conditions, and trawling across a wide range of depths.</li><li>Your catch history, including weight records, is recorded in the new Fishing section of the Wonders catalogue.</li></ul><ul><li>Craft specialist bait and apply it to your Fishing Rig to lure in specific fish.</li><li>In addition, any edible item can be deployed as bait. Experiment with different cooked products to find the most effective bait for your fishing feeds.</li><li>A large range of new seafood recipes have been added for the Nutrient Processor.</li><li>Those who do not wish to consume or sell their catch may release their fish back into the water.</li></ul><ul><li>Occasionally, inanimate objects may be retrieved from the water instead of fish. Such objects include procedurally generated messages in bottles and water-damaged technology upgrades.</li></ul><ul><li>Automated Traps are available to research in the Space Anomaly. These self-sustaining units are an alternative to manual angling, and will attract fish as appropriate for the water conditions in which they are placed.</li></ul><ul><li>The Exo-Skiff is a new piece of deployable technology, summoned from the Quick Menu after its interface is installed in the Exosuit. Research the appropriate blueprints aboard the Space Anomaly.</li><li>The Exo-Skiff hovers just above the surface of the water and reacts to wave movement to create the perfect deep-sea fishing platform for those looking for deep-water fish.</li><li>The skiff comes with a dedicated Cold Storage inventory, allowing players to conveniently store their catches.</li><li>The Exo-Skiff can be recoloured via its own internal customisation interface.</li></ul><ul><li>Fishing is fully compatible with first and third person play, and has unique casting mechanics for VR players.</li><li>New music tracks have been added to accompany the fishing experience.</li></ul><ul><li>Expedition Fifteen, Aquarius, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li><li>Rewards include new posters, decals and titles; a deep-sea diving suit customisation set; the unique Lost Angler’s Rig fishing rod; and the exclusive Aquarius Flightpack.</li></ul><ul><li>Water reflections are now enabled for PSVR2.</li><li>PCVR now supports reflections on the water while running with reflections set to Ultra.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could make it difficult to interact with some space station objects while in VR.</li></ul><ul><li>The jetpack effects used while underwater have been improved.</li><li>Fixed a number of rendering artefacts related to water.</li><li>Fixed a number of issues that could allow ships to spawn with the wrong landing-gear state.</li><li>Fixed a visual issue with icons when switching pages in the Catalogue.</li><li>Fixed a minor visual issue with the Liquidator mech.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a rare issue that could cause items to be transferred to a deprecated inventory when Quick Transferring to a full Exosuit inventory.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause mineable objects to incorrectly display a STEEL label.</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented the Left / Right Handedness option from being immediately applied to the third person camera.</li><li>Allowed the Multi-Tool to remain unholstered when in Photo Mode in a multiplayer game.</li><li>Removed the deprecated Shutter Door base part from the Catalogue.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a number of water rendering issues with some specific base parts.</li><li>Fixed a number of water-smearing issues when playing in VR.</li><li>Fixed an Xbox-specific texture rendering issue.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause black speckling in depth-of-field effects while playing with screen-space shadows enabled.</li><li>Fixed a rendering corruption issue with starship cockpit screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause graininess on PS4.</li><li>Fixed an issue that could cause ship juddering during warp.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a crash related to dialogue interactions.</li><li>Fixed a PS4-specific memory crash.</li><li>Fixed a PS5-specific crash related to shader loading.</li><li>Fixed a crash related to explosion effects.</li><li>Fixed a number of issues related to the loading of freighters and frigates.</li><li>The messaging around some Vulkan-based GPU compatibility issues has been improved.</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed a stall/hitch when switching between inventory pages.</li><li>Introduced a number of optimisations while accessing the inventory.</li><li>Introduced a minor planetary rendering optimisation.</li></ul>

            <p>If you, like me, have been wondering just how Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures were going to approach a live-action Minecraft movie, I have good news for you. We now have our first good look at the upcoming adaptation, known simply as A Minecraft Movie, thanks to a new trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer, which you can see below, introduces us to Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jack-black-minecraft-movie-images-leak-days-after-tenacious-d-controversy">Jack Black's Steve</a>. There are also some cuboid sheep and Piglins marching around the place, because Minecraft.</p>
<p>In addition to Momoa and Black, the upcoming film also stars Wednesday's Emma Myers, Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks, Sebastian Eugene Hansen and Stifler's mum. I mean, Jennifer Coolidge, who has also starred in the likes of The White Lotus and the Legally Blonde films. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>"Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival," reads the official blurb. "Four misfits - Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks) - find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination.</p>
<p>"To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black).  Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative... the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is currently set to make its debut in theatres next year, on 4th April.</p>

<p>Away from the big screen, an animated Minecraft series was also announced for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> back in May. Netflix will produce the project alongside Minecraft developer Mojang Studios, while WildBrain Studios - the studio behind Sonic Prime - will handle the development.</p>
<p>While further details are thin on the ground, it is said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">upcoming show will "feature an original story with new characters</a>, showing the world of 'Minecraft' in a new light".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
