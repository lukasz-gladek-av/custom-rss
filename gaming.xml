<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/87dab74b79173/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Switch 2 has been a huge deal since it launched, and at last night's Japan Game Awards, the console was recognised for its monumental achievements so far.</p>
<p>Nintendo's latest hardware took home the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Award at the 2025 ceremony. It's a long and somewhat confusing title, but the basic gist is that it's an award given to an individual, production team, organisation or project that has notably contributed to the games industry in recent years.</p>
<p>For reference, the award was previously picked up by the likes of the PlayStation in 2024 and FromSoftware's Hidetaka Miyazaki in 2022. Nintendo has also seen its fair share of these awards in the past, with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/09/the-famicom-just-won-an-award-at-the-tokyo-game-awards-2023">Famicom</a> collecting the prize in 2023, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">New Horizons</a> team nabbing it in 2020, and the Switch dev team picking it up in 2018.</p>
<p>Switch 2 producers Kouichi Kawamoto, Takuhiro Dohta, and Tetsuya Sasaki (who you'll recognise from the console's reveal Direct) were on hand to accept the award — not dressed in their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/random-did-you-notice-this-snazzy-switch-2-reference-in-the-devs-direct-outfits">subtle Switch 2 suits</a> this time, unfortunately. You can find the footage of them collecting the award in the stream below, starting around the 9:30 mark.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the 2025 ceremony, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>'s Kepler Interactive picked up the Breakthrough Award, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> took home the Movement Award, and the likes of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">Hundred Line</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Fantasy Life i</a> nabbed Awards for Excellence. Masahiro Sakurai also popped up to present <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/indika">Indika</a> the Game Designers Award, and Metaphor was awarded the Grand Award.</p>
<p>We wonder what Switch 2 games we'll see in the running next year, eh?</p>

              <p>Anti-piracy measures, as a rule, suck. But when they’re funny, they get a pass. That appears to be the case for the Nintendo 64’s <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, which as revealed by Supper Mario Broth (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/super-smash-bros/if-you-play-a-pirated-super-smash-bros-exactly-69-times-on-n64-nintendos-sneaky-anti-piracy-measure-will-lull-the-illegitimate-user-into-a-false-sense-of-security-and-trap-you-as-mario-forever/"><em>GamesRadar</em></a>) will lock you in to being able to play only a single character, but only after you’ve played the game 69 times. Dude.</p> <p>I’m so adorably naive that I didn’t even realize pirating N64 games was an option back in the day. Of course, in 1996 when dial-up internet was a new-born baby, this wasn’t a case of downloading ROMs from the internet, but rather buying knock-off N64 cartridges from that dodgy-looking stall at the mall. As a rule, when the game’s name was written on the cartridge in Sharpie, or it featured a black-and-white version of the sticker but with the writing in German, it probably wasn’t wholly legit. And it seems that if that’s the version of&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> you bought in ’99, it was trapped.</p> <p>As Supper Mario Broth puts it, the anti-piracy measure here was “delayed action,” allowing the player to boot the game an enormous 68 times before anything would happen. Then, on the 69th time of playing, you’d suddenly find yourself locked in to only being able to play as Mario. Anything else would, the social media account reports, erase all your save data.</p>   <p>It truly is the most mild of punishments. If you loved that game enough to play it almost 70 times, you’d eventually be stuck, er, still able to play the game in two-player, and limited to one character for single-player matches.</p>

 <p>Funnily enough, Nintendo’s devilish trick here gets close to one of the very few actually effective anti-piracy measures to have been used: when a game lets you play it for so long before popping up a message saying, “Hey, you pirated this! We hope you enjoyed it so far, and if you want to carry on, buy a copy here.” Treating pirates as potential customers has proven lucrative for many indie projects over the years, while draconian systems based on hardware locks, disc requirements, and game-slowing software used by AAA publishers have only ever punished legitimate purchasers, all such restrictions inevitably removed from the pirated versions.</p> <p>And yes, it’s very unlikely Nintendo picked 69 for comedy reasons, but I still like to believe.</p>

                <p>As part of the Beyond the Strand event celebrating 10 years of Kojima Productions, the Japanese developer and the original creator of Pokemon Go announced a "new technology partnership" that aims to "redefine immersive entertainment."</p><p>Like with Kojima's Death Stranding series, much remains shrouded in mystery about this new project.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKyj6CDUH64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oKyj6CDUH64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"For Kojima Productions, it's a bold expansion into new forms of media beyond traditional gaming. For Niantic Spatial, it underlines the potential of geospatial AI technology to transform how people and machines understand and interact with the physical world," reads a line from the announcement.</p><p>Niantic Spatial is the new name of the Pokemon Go creator, which is now focusing more directly on AI and geospacial technology. The Pokemon Go development team and the game itself, meanwhile, were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-developer-in-talks-to-sell-games-division-to-saudi-arabias-savvy-for-3-5-billion-report/1100-6529586/" data-ref-id="1100-6529586">sold to Saudi Arabia.</a></p><p>Kojima said his games today "exist on screens" but working with Niantic will allow the studio to "unleash those experiences into real-world experiences."</p><p>"I'm excited to collaborate on creating experiences where you can climb real mountains while finding entertainment there, and connecting with real friends. I'm excited that we can create these new experiences together," Kojima said.</p><p>During Beyond the Strand, Kojima said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/kojima-productions-and-niantic-spatial-are-working-on-an-ar-walking-game/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>) that this new experience will be "like the real Death Stranding, in the real world, where you can connect with people or connect with the actual environment there in your city."</p><p>Niantic boss John Hanke, meanwhile, said the company is now working on a "living model of the world that people and machines can talk to." This could allow for a "new canvas for real-world storytelling and interaction," Hanke said.</p><p>To promote whatever this new experience is, Kojima Productions commissioned a live-action video called "A New Dawn" that stars actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9582703/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zane Haney</a> and was written and directed by Ei Uehara and Corey Finn.</p><p>Also during the Beyond the Strand event, Kojima Productions released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-od-gives-us-p-t-vibes-in-new-preview/1100-6534933/" data-ref-id="1100-6534933">new teasers for the Xbox-published game OD</a> and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/physint-first-look-at-hideo-kojima-new-project-teases-stealth-and-feelings/1100-6534932/" data-ref-id="1100-6534932">Sony-published game Physint.</a> Kojima also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-next-announcement-is-a-credit-card/1100-6534937/" data-ref-id="1100-6534937">announced a credit card.</a></p>

<p>When the Switch got its first entry in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_18">FIFA 18</a>, this very reviewer pointed out that it was essentially a port of the Legacy Edition on Xbox 360 and PS3 at the time, which is why it was missing all the modes from the current-gen versions. Still, EA had ditched Nintendo consoles since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/fifa_13">FIFA 13</a> on the Wii U, so many of us were at least happy to see it on Switch in the first place, and hoped EA would build on it in the years to follow.</p>
<p>Infuriatingly, EA would instead proceed to release basically the exact same game on Switch – new kits and rosters aside – for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_19">FIFA 19</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_20">20</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_21">21</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_22">22</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fifa_23">23</a>, meaning no fewer than six near-identical annual games all based on that Xbox 360 Legacy Edition of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/fifa_17">FIFA 17</a>. It was already out of date in FIFA 18, so by the time it reached 23 (with Switch now on its fifth Legacy Edition of a Legacy Edition) it had gone beyond a joke, hence my somewhat contentious 2/10 review <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/fifa-23">on this very site</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, work your way through all those reviews — all written by me, as some sort of annual Nintendo Life punishment ritual — and you’ll see the spiral of a man initially happy that EA football had returned to a Nintendo system but eventually plunging into despair and anger when it became clear it was just churning out the bare minimum each year.</p>
<p>Remarkably, this changed when the FIFA series changed its name to EA Sports FC. With a new title came a new beginning, and — for the first time since the GameCube era — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_24">EA Sports FC 24</a> (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ea_sports_fc_25">25</a> the following year) finally gave Nintendo players full feature parity with their Xbox and PlayStation counterparts. It had come too late in the console’s life to undo some damage — Ultimate Team was a ghost town after years of neglect — but it was finally ‘proper’ FIFA. Sorry, I mean proper EA FC.</p>
<p>Now it’s time for the series to make the jump to Switch 2, bringing with it the ultimate question. Has EA opted to do the same as it did on Wii U and Switch and give early adopters a bare bones experience again, or has it finally learned the lessons of the past and delivered a fully-featured football game at the first time of asking? Mercifully, it’s the latter.</p>

<p>EA Sports FC 26 on Switch 2 has every mode you’ll find in the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions of the game. That means every new feature, from the two new gameplay presets — Authentic for more realistic football and Competitive for faster passing and smarter keepers — to the improved Manager Career mode with its live challenges and unlockable Icon players.</p>
<p>The latter is a brilliant new addition, because until now Manager Career has usually involved picking your favourite team and just putting them through league after league, getting stagnant after a while. The new Live option gives you a bunch of shorter scenarios to choose from — such as starting with a 20-point deduction and having to escape relegation while making $20 million in transfers before a set date — which gives you an excuse to keep coming back and trying out new situations.</p>
<p>It also means the perennially popular Ultimate Team mode gets all the new features this year too, including the return of Tournaments and the new Gauntlet mode, where you play through a series of matches but aren’t allowed to use the same player twice, meaning squad depth comes into play.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 4 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s on the pitch where the most divisive decision can be found, so let’s get it out of the way first. When EA moved from FIFA to EA Sports FC and finally updated the game on Switch, it also shifted over from that ancient Xbox 360 engine to the Frostbite engine. The result of this was the Switch version dropping from 60 frames per second to 30, to accommodate the new engine’s update in visual quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ea-sports-fc-25">Last year’s review</a> of EA Sports FC 25 on Switch hoped that by making the jump to Switch 2 this would be fixed, bringing the game up to a full 60fps on Nintendo’s new console. Alas, that hasn’t happened yet, meaning this new Switch 2 offering still only runs at 30fps.</p>
<p>I know this will be a dealbreaker for some, and if you’re one such player, then I suppose this is where your review ends. For those still with me, it’s worth pointing out that the drop from 60 to 30 for the Switch 2 version may obviously affect the visuals but doesn’t really affect the gameplay. EA FC has never really relied on twitch controls because momentum is taken into account, meaning every pass, shot, and turn has always taken place after the button is pressed anyway.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 5 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159070/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As someone who puts hundreds of hours into the Xbox Series X version of the series every year, the game doesn’t appear any less responsive on Switch 2 than it is on Microsoft’s console. Of course it doesn’t look as smooth because it’s running at half the frame rate, but I can still play it just as well on Switch 2</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s those who regularly play the series on PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, and are likely to jump between those versions and the Switch 2 version, who’ll notice the frame rate more. If you’ve been playing on 60 and you’re suddenly forced to drop to 30, the difference will be jarring. It really does only take a couple of matches to get used to, however, and the generally slower pace of a football game — as opposed to, say, a racing game — means the frame rate may be disappointing but it’s certainly not disastrous.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons for the frame rate drop is to keep the game stable while maintaining visual quality, which it definitely does. Put it side by side with the other consoles and you’ll obviously see they’re not like-for-like, though Switch 2 really does a good job of maintaining visual detail. Player faces are great, the kits are nice and sharp when you zoom in on them, and all the pre-match animations (including fans arriving outside the stadium and the manager giving the team talk in the dressing room) are here too.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 6 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159075/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are even some smaller details in there that EA could have been forgiven for ditching to keep things running smoothly, but still manages to include. The most obvious example is mascots, which are new to this year’s game on other formats and are present and accounted for here. It could have been easy for EA to drop this frankly unnecessary addition and claim the Switch 2 version could have done without it, but play as Celtic in Celtic Park and you will indeed see the glorious sight of Hoopy the Huddle Hound prancing around at the side of the park, getting in the way of the supporters sitting in the front row.</p>
<p>More concerning is the menu system, which is really starting to creak and strain. After years of having more and more new features dumped on it, these menus are already janky on more powerful consoles, but on Switch 2 the Ultimate Team UI is so clunky that it froze up a few times during my initial team set-up and I had to reboot the game. I’m hopeful that this will be addressed in a future patch, but until then be warned that while responsiveness isn’t an issue off the pitch, it’s certainly lacking off it.</p>
<p>Other limitations aren’t directly EA’s fault this year, though they may still be the result of the previous years of neglect Switch owners got when the series was known as FIFA. Ultimate Team, while wonderfully fully featured on Switch 2, simply doesn’t have the community it does on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 7 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159073/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is most obviously felt when trying to find a match online on Switch 2. Because the gameplay engine isn’t identical on Nintendo’s console, crossplay understandably isn’t possible, but whereas it’s easy to find a match within a split second on other consoles, I had to wait a minute or so to find another Switch 2 player. This will hopefully get better when the Standard Edition launches, but it’ll still be a vastly smaller player pool than the Xbox, PlayStation, and PC crossplay community.</p>
<p>One thing that theoretically should be possible but isn’t yet is a fully shared transfer market on Ultimate Team. PlayStation and Xbox users have a shared transfer market which means there are often tens of millions of players and cosmetic items listed for transfer. Once again this year, Nintendo players are left with their own separate transfer market, which at the time of writing only has 13,550 items for sale, meaning far less choice and — due to the lack of multiple listings meaning less need for competitive pricing — the need to spend more coins on specific players.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 8 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159071/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It would be even more of a dream to allow for cross-save, meaning you could play your Ultimate Team or Manager Career on PlayStation or Xbox at home (to take advantage of the better visuals), then load it up on Switch 2 and continue it on the go. Instead, each version of the game is its own standalone thing, meaning you have to start from scratch and have a completely different campaign running on each console.</p>
<p>Take all of this into account and the bottom line is still that EA Sports FC 26 is the new best ever Nintendo football game (don’t worry though, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/iss_64">ISS 64</a>, you’ll always be my main love). The wishlist of improvements for next year is clear: if EA can offer some sort of performance mode which allows for 60fps gameplay, and find a way to tap Switch 2 users into the same shared Ultimate Team transfer market used on other consoles, you’d be looking at a near-flawless Nintendo version of the game.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, it’s still a fantastic football game with hundreds of hours of gameplay to be found across its numerous modes, unmatched authenticity, and engaging control on the pitch. Once you’re used to the frame rate, it’s an absolute joy to play on handheld, and while the game engine isn’t 100% identical to other formats, it’s far and away the closest thing we’ve had yet to getting ‘proper’ EA FC on the move.</p>
<figure><a title="EA SPORTS FC 26 Review - Screenshot 9 of 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159078/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, there isn’t much competition on Switch 2 yet anyway — Konami’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/efootball">eFootball</a> continues to be conspicuous by its absence — so EA Sports FC 26 was always going to be the default choice regardless of its quality. It’s a relief, then, that EA didn’t take advantage of this fact by phoning in a half-hearted port like it did so many times on Switch, and has instead started as it hopefully means to go on this time with a fully-featured version from the get-go that gives Nintendo owners the respect they deserve.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>EA's Switch 2 football debut is a night-and-day difference from its half-hearted Switch one, setting a great precedent for the future of the series. EA Sports FC 26 delivers a fully-featured version of the game, and while it only runs at 30fps and has a gated-off Ultimate Team mode which doesn't tap into the series' larger crossplay community, it still plays a fantastic game of football and offers more game modes than you'll ever know what to do with.</p></section>

              <p>Hideo Kojima’s&nbsp;<em>OD</em> finally has its first trailer, and yes, of course, it’s entirely cutscene, but oh my word, what a cutscene. You’ll oscillate between “Good grief, I can’t believe this is the Unreal Engine and not real life, and “Oh god, what the fuck is that?” throughout its three minutes.</p> <p>During Kojima Productions’ tenth anniversary celebrations, Hideo Kojima finally revealed some moving images of his forthcoming horror game&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, a project he’s co-creating with horror maestro Jordan Peele. What we get is an incredibly tense scene in which the perfectly rendered hands of Sophia Lillis (<em>It</em>,&nbsp;<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>) attempt to light a whole mess of candles. It’s tense because of far too many sounds, from Lillis’s own terrified breathing, the ambient sounds of adjacent apartments, and that infernal knocking at the door.</p>  <p>By the end, whoever was knocking clearly ran out of patience and let themselves in. We see the sinister, shadowy figure over Lissis’s shoulder (and note the face-shaped scars all over her own face), its thudding footsteps unnervingly slow, as it whispers demonically. Then, in case you were wondering if everything was going to be OK, it grabs for her and she screams. After the titles we cut back to see vast, grey hands clutching Lissis’s face in a truly iconic image.</p>

 <p>Which is all lovely and scary! It, of course, tells us precisely nothing whatsoever about the game, other than that it’ll feature baby-shaped candles and be dreadfully frightening. There are so many horror elements taking place at once here, from the worms crawling out of a candle in writhing bundles to the awful image of the cartoonish baby-faced candle melting to reveal its wick, accompanied by the noises of a real baby screaming nearby. Oh, and the tall, awful demon-thing—I’m yet to be convinced he’s a goodie.</p> <p>At the live event, there was all sorts of empty bluster about how the game will change the very fabric of reality, perhaps requiring that humanity once again reset the yearly clock to a new&nbsp;<em>After OD</em> era, while not actually saying anything at all about what happens in the game. Microsoft’s Phil Spencer declared it “truly visionary” while Kojima, modest as ever, added “this is totally different, even as a system.” But best was Kojima’s declaration that as he travels all around the world scanning spooky locations for the photorealistic game, “I want to scan a ghost for the first time, and I want to get an award for that.” Good luck with that.</p> <p>Still, the trailer is freaking cool.</p>

<p>Arriving on Switch next month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to the early days of the Switch eShop, before the storefront was swamped by slop and rip-offs, you might recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_chef_brigade">Battle Chef Brigade</a> — a weird fusion of cooking sim and action RPG all wrapped up in a sweet anime-inspired art style. It was a lovely little game from developer Trinket Studios, and what do you know, the team is back with something that looks equally intriguing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/battle_suit_aces">Battle Suit Aces</a> is a sci-fi RPG that mixes the bold visuals of old-school mech anime with some particularly deep-looking card combat. It boasts the same visual style as its predecessor and another interesting mash-up of gameplay styles</p>
<p>Arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th October</strong>, Battle Suit Aces will see you assemble a rag-tag team of space explorers and set out into the stars in search of 'Relic Suits' — those big mech-like guys promised by the title. There's a certain visual-novel-ness to how the story unfolds, and you can catch up with your team between missions by preparing meals or hanging in communal areas — hello? <strong>Persona</strong>? — but the missions themselves look to be the big selling point.</p>
<p>The game's card-based combat appears to be full of tactical potential, as you put together a frontline of mech pilots, each with their own abilities and goals. Cards can be moved around to target more foes or swapped out for different objectives, and you'll build up your deck with even more hunky anime action heroes as you progress through the story.</p>
<p>Here's a handful of screenshots from developer Trinket Studios:</p>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is currently listed on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/battle-suit-aces-switch/">North American eShop</a> for <strong>$24.99</strong>. It'll be arriving at a particularly stacked time for Switch releases, but may end up being one to watch for those after a slice of something different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">a solid Soulslike with some interesting gameplay mechanics</a>, but performance issues at launch made it difficult for many - including myself - to enjoy the game at its best. Thankfully, developer Lenzee Games has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-acknowledges-performance-issues-patch-coming/">actively addressing these issues</a>, with the latest 1.06 patch introducing major VRAM optimization and performance improvements on PC.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/500584162306031816?l=english">1.06 patch</a>, which is around 5.3 GB big, adds the Deluxe Edition Expansion Content in all versions of the game while fixing several PC-specific issues, such as an issue that caused the visuals to be extremely blurry using NVIDIA DLSS Ultra Performance mode at certain screen resolutions. In addition, the new patch further optimizes VRAM usage, improving both performance and stability. This is an extremely important improvement, as it will allow those running GPUs with low VRAM capacities to have a much better experience. Even those with more powerful GPUs with more VRAM will notice the performance improvement, which are estimated to be up to 12% better than in the launch version on a midrange system powered by an AMD Ryzen 5600x CPU and an RTX 3070 GPU in the video below shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@S2GamesBench">S2Games Bench</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers - Patch 1.6 - VRAM usage reduced and 12% fps increase over launch version" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWpsfYBjSjw?start=7&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Performance issues are not unique to WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers, as it is one of the many recent games powered by Unreal Engine 5 suffering from performance issues. While Borderlands 4 enjoyed <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">a successful launch</a>, it is heavily impacted by poor performance, requiring players to <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-optimized-settings-40-performance-imrpovement/">adjust graphics settings</a> even on high-end systems for better performance before Gearbox delivers the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">promised improvements</a>. Silent Hill f, by contrast, is a rare example of a UE5 title running smoothly (albeit at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-720p-360p-ps5/">low internal resolution on PS5</a>), with only minor stutters that do not impact what <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-f-review-a-beautiful-nightmare/">I consider one of the finest survival-horror games released this year.</a></p>



<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developers Pocketpair have revealed Palfarm, a new farming spin-off whose cheeky compound title implies the possibility of countless other Palspin-offs, from Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/train-simulator">train Simulator</a> to Pal<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pvkk-from-the-dome-keeper-devs-is-papers-please-but-you-get-a-huge-planetary-defence-cannon">netenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>.
</p>
<p>
It appears to be a Palworld version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, with players alternating between tending crops, mining the caves, battling wildlife, and bonding with the local NPCs. As in vanilla Palworld, you can capture Pals with different abilities and set them to work on tasks like sowing and watering. Here's a trailer.

<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-farming-spin-off-revealed-just-11-days-after-nintendo-announced-pokemon-equivalent-pokopia">Eurogamer</a> note, all this follows swiftly after the reveal of Nintendo's new Pokémon spin-off Pokopia, which also involves farming. Nintendo are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/here-are-the-patents-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-about-according-to-pocketpair">suing Pocket Pair for alleged patent infringement regarding the Pokémon series</a>, which makes the announcement of Palfarm a bit like playfully tweaking the genitals of an enraged Pyroar while it's trying to bite your head off.
</p><p>
You can read more about Palfarm on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It appears to be retaining Palworld's viral blend of whimsy and parodic cruelty. "On this island with its changing seasons, a relaxing farm life with Pals awaits!" chirrups the description. "Of course, eating your own Pals is absolutely out of the question!" 
</p>
<p>
Later, there is mention of killing off Pals in the wilderness, because "after all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way" and "sometimes what you reap might be red". Congratulations, Pocketpair, you have triangulated the secret callousness of the videogame concept of "farming".
</p>
<p>
There's multiplayer, and a town with a commercial area and a hidden black market. The black market appears to be run by a pipe-smoking blaggard with a very large revolver. You can play Russian roulette with him, seemingly. You can also push snowballs to make them bigger, and get married. No release date yet.

                <p>The console wars have reached a point where it's no longer uncommon for some of the biggest Xbox games to get a cross-platform release on PS5. A small handful of PlayStation 5 titles have also gone to Xbox Series X|S. But if you were hoping that meant games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> were next in line for Xbox releases then you might be disappointed.</p><p>A user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/horizon_zero_dawn_coming_to_xbox/?share_id=FOpL6AxDrIyGryTk06DAx&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> found a listing for Horizon Zero Dawn on the German Xbox Store. And it's not the only Sony title to appear there. Unfortunately, as pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nmmvlt/comment/nfeiai3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">by other Reddit users</a>, this appears to be an indexing mistake by Google rather than Microsoft. Even some Nintendo games are listed on the Xbox Store because of that error.</p><p>Regardless, porting games from PS5 to Xbox Series X|S may not be a bad idea. It's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">worked wonders for Helldivers 2</a>, and dramatically driven up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-putting-up-some-huge-numbers-today/1100-6534275/" data-ref-id="1100-6534275">the number of players in the game</a>. In short, it made Helldivers 2 an even bigger hit. Sony also shares <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-comments-on-deal-to-bring-mlb-the-show-21-to-xbox-and-game-pass/1100-6489820/" data-ref-id="1100-6489820">MLB The Show</a> with other platforms thanks to agreements made with Major League Baseball. However, Sony is under no such obligation to bring any of its top franchises to the competition.</p><p>Meanwhile, Xbox Studios has seemingly opened the flood gates for games that were formerly exclusive titles. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-coming-this-august-to-xbox-playstation-and-pc/1100-6531314/" data-ref-id="1100-6531314">Gears of War: Reloaded</a> was recently released on PS5, following in the footsteps of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Sea of Thieves, and Forza Horizon 5. Microsoft hasn't put all of its AAA games on PS5 yet, but it's no longer out of the question for franchises like Halo to eventually make the leap as well.</p>

    <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra has criticised Microsoft's recent price hike of Xbox consoles in the US, stating "console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues".</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">Microsoft announced the price increase</a> and blamed "changes in the macroeconomic environment", though didn't mention tariffs specifically.</p>
<p>Still, Ybarra - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-corporate-vice-president-mike-ybarra-announces-departure-from-microsoft-after-20-years">left his position as corporate vice president of Microsoft's gaming division in 2019</a> - responded to the assumption in a post on social media, adding "the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse."</p>
<p>In a later response, Ybarra added the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">previous price increase in May</a> was justified due to the rise in tariffs at the time, but that's not the case with this new rise.</p>
<p>"An excuse to continue raising prices, with no new increase in tariffs, is simply a different problem," he said, "and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>This price hike only affects consumers in the US, which is why tariffs have been seen by some as the primary reason.</p>
<p>Now, an Xbox Series X costs $649.99 (or $599.99 for the digital version), while a Series S costs $399.99 for the 512MB model and $449.99 for the 1TB model.</p>
<p>Despite the "changes in the macroeconomic environment", Microsoft reported an 18 percent boost in revenue at its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-hits-almost-5bn-in-annual-revenue-and-microsoft-profits-grow-despite-thousands-laid-off">latest earnings call</a>, with Xbox Game Pass making almost $5bn in annual revenue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-price-of-ps5-ps5-digital-and-ps5-pro-in-the-us">Sony also announced a price hike for its PS5 consoles in the US</a> back in August, with the base PS5 costing $549.99, the digital edition costing $499.99, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> costing $749.99.</p>

            <p>Over the weekend, Epic launched its new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Delulu mode with proximity voice chat, but already "thousands" have been banned for toxicity and hate speech.</p>
<p>The new mode sees players starting out solo, but able to join squads by chatting with nearby players. Players will need to have voice chat set to "Everybody" and won't be able to hide their display name while playing.</p>
<p>In theory, Delulu is a fun twist on the no-build battle royale formula, but in practice it's fuelled bad behaviour that's resulted in "thousands" being banned over the weekend, according to the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908">official Fortnite Status social media account</a>.</p>

<p>Indeed, Epic seems to have expected this, with the account's pinned post detailing how players can report in-game conversations.</p>
<p>The mode has resulted in some amusing and heartwarming interactions. Here's one pacifist player strumming a guitar in an attempt to make in-game friends.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nnx5py/playing_guitar_in_delulu_last_night/">Playing guitar in Delulu last night</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/asymmetricalsoul/">u/asymmetricalsoul</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Yet a thread titled "My fellow ladies: How’s Delulu" details the experiences of women in the new mode (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-banned-thousands-this-weekend-as-proximity-voice-chat-mode-delulu-launches-to-big-player-numbers-but-widespread-reports-of-griefing-and-abuse">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>It includes misogyny, hateful speech, and women being purposefully targeted by men. "It's been terrible for me so far," wrote one player. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game."</p>
<p>Some posts are recommending female players don't speak, which is unfair and defeats the purpose of the mode.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmom8n/my_fellow_ladies_hows_delulu/">My fellow ladies: How’s Delulu</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Kilr_Queen75Xx/">u/Kilr_Queen75Xx</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/">FortNiteBR</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>Sadly, this is often the experience when women play games online with voice chat. A report from September last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-thirds-of-female-players-still-report-being-harassed-when-playing-online">claimed two-thirds of female players report being harassed when playing online</a>. And when Call of Duty added proximity chat to its online modes, reports of misogyny were rampant.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/look-out-for-number-1-in-fortnite-delulu?lang=en-US">Fortnite Delulu will return</a> this weekend, from 26th September until 29th September. It's unclear if it's set to become a permanent addition to Fortnite, but is there more Epic could be doing to protect players?</p>
<p>Yesterday, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-launches-new-daft-punk-experience-but-no-the-duo-arent-getting-back-together">Daft Punk music experience was announced for Fortnite</a>.</p>

<p>Here be <a href="https://forums.fatsharkgames.com/t/bound-by-duty-free-update-out-now/112661">patch notes</a>, and a more general (i.e. less stat-soaked) <a href="https://www.playdarktide.com/news/bound-by-duty-update">overview</a>. I’ve just had a quick look at the new trees in-game and they do appear to be structured more openly, at least at the lower levels, so you may not need to commit to a playstyle – tanky berserker versus swift dagger stabbist on Zealot, for example – quite so early on.</p>
<p>As for specific skill buffs, I can’t judge yet who the big winners and losers of this patch are, but by far the <em>funniest</em> talent rework has to go to the Psyker’s Crystalline Will. It still prevents you from downing yourself if you overload on psychic sauce, but a massive buff to the accompanying warp eruption sounds like it could make for a serious offensive tool. Expect mic’d up Psykers to change their tune from "Oh no, I’m exploding" to "Oh <em>yes</em>, I’m exploding".</p>
<p>Less fortunate are the space rozzers of the Adeptus Arbites, who’ve been made squishier following their arrival (accompanied by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/darktides-new-arbites-class-is-overrunning-the-far-future-with-exploding-immortal-dogs">packs of EMP dogbombs</a>) earlier this year. They and the three reworked classes have all had full skill point refunds, so make sure to reinvest them before deploying.</p><p>Mortis Trials, meanwhile, gets a frigid new arena, plus a handful of new perks to unlock as you survive successive waves of Nurgle’s lads. Veterans, those lucky devils, also get a class-exclusive Power Falchion sword, and those who spec as ranged specialists should get even more of a kick out of the new Boltgun and Bolt Pistol variants. These, the Bolt Pistol Mk VI Godwyn‑Branx and Boltgun Mk III Locke, are tuned to make their exploding bullets more explodey – evidently, between these, that tweaked Psyker skill, and the Arbites’ remote-detonated pets, someone at Fatshark just really likes seeing things go boom.</p>
<p>As a piece of Imperium cannon fodder who typically prefers the flow of conventional missions to the more static defence play of Mortis Trials, I’m slightly saddened that Bound by Duty doesn’t offer a fresh taste of the former. Not least because almost all of the post-launch missions have been excellent, with more ambitious set-pieces and more intriguing, lore-massaging vox banter. But then, I barely played anyone besides Ogryn after his own rework in March, so maybe another round of skill touch-ups can have a similarly rejuvenating effect. I’ll be playing this week to find out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> came out, developer Gearbox has released a PC-focused patch that tackles crashes, among a few other things. But players are wondering what the studio intends to do about the looter shooter’s balance, especially at a time when builds that let you one-shot bosses are doing the rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has now indicated that in the short-term, it plans to buff underperforming gear and skills rather than nerf overpowered builds. Indeed, those instakill builds you've seen online are safe, for now. But, Gearbox insisted, they will get nerfed eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Confirmation comes from Borderlands 4 creative director Graeme Timmins, who <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1970315557460398462" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a> to acknowledge the debate about what he called “builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>“We’ve seen the discourse about builds that use unintended interactions and/or the knife. We’re not going to act on those immediately, instead, we’re looking at our first round of buffs. Those will get addressed but we’re going to start with underperforming gear/skills first.”</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s all this talk about a knife? As IGN has reported, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/abuse-it-while-you-can-borderlands-4-has-an-infinite-damage-build-so-broken-it-kills-bosses-in-seconds">Borderlands 4 players have discovered an infinite damage build so broken it kills bosses in seconds — even on the hardest difficulty levels</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To make this build work you need the Vampiric Vivisecting Throwing Knife with the Penetrator Augment. Land a hit with this knife and subsequent damage to the target are automatic critical hits for five seconds. Add bleed stacking and each tick of the bleed effect registers as a critical hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have come up with eye-catching builds around the knife that essentially makes a Borderlands 4 boss fight a trivial experience, and thus farming for the game’s best loot a lot easier. For example, <a href="https://maxroll.gg/borderlands-4/build-guides/vex-leveling-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Vex</u></a>’s Bloodletter passive makes your gun and skill critical hits have a chance to apply bleed, which counts as gun damage and is based on the initial damage dealt. Add Vex's Contamination passive, which causes critical hits to increase status effect application chance up to 100% and thus ensuring the bleed re-procs infinitely, and you’ve got exponential damage. So, throw the knife, land one big shot on the boss, and watch the numbers get bigger and bigger as the bleed ticks it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news that Gearbox is focusing on buffs over nerfs right now is being celebrated by the community. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1970370340640498072" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borderlands 4 content creator Moxsy</a> called it “such a huge W.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Massive nerfs hitting Wonderlands &amp; BL3 on launch caused huge outrage and frustration in the community. Love to see this direction,” Moxsy said in a post on social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The question now is what steps Gearbox will take to nerf the knife. Will it change how it works completely, or apply slight changes to tone it down?</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no timeframe for Borderlands 4’s next patch, but we know some more of what the studio is working on. PC performance improvements are a “top priority,” the studio has said. A Field of View (FOV) slider is on the way to the console versions, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 console players are also keen for a patch to address <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-tech-experts-say-resetting-the-game-every-hour-should-really-not-be-an-expected-solution-for-players-patch-cannot-come-soon-enough"><u>some glaring technical problems</u></a>. Last week, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry</u></a> confirmed a gradual worsening of framerate with continuous playtime, even on PlayStation 5 Pro and Xbox Series X. As revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/kRWW6qwjFBA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a new video published to YouTube</u></a>, Digital Foundry found performance starts dipping after around 30 minutes to an hour, which it called "too intrusive on the overall experience, too regular an interruption." Even after a completely fresh boot, the game is still prone to framerate drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox development chief Randy Pitchford has acknowledged the problem on social media, promising incoming improvements. As a workaround, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-performance-gets-worse-the-longer-you-play-on-console-randy-pitchford-suggests-quitting-the-game-and-restarting-as-a-workaround"><u>Pitchford suggested console players quit Borderlands 4 and restart</u></a>. Digital Foundry’s Tom Morgan confirmed this does restore performance, but criticized the situation, saying “resetting the game every hour should really not be an expected solution for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-cricket-jumping-lets-players-skip-huge-chunks-of-the-map-gearbox-dev-says-ive-got-my-eye-on-this">Timmins has said he’s got his eye on “cricket jumping,”</a> which lets Borderlands 4 players leap across huge chunks of the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are delving into Borderlands 4, don't go without updated hourly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/borderlands-4/Borderlands_4_SHiFT_Codes"><u>SHiFT codes list</u></a>.

                <p>Nearly two years ago, Hideo Kojima and director Jordan Peele revealed their upcoming horror game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>. Since then, Kojima was largely focused on finishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. Now, Kojima Productions has shared a fresh look at OD during the Beyond the Strand event. And from the preview, it looks like Kojima is evoking <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/p-t-game-revealed-on-ps4-is-actually-next-silent-h/1100-6421683/" data-ref-id="1100-6421683">P.T.</a>, the playable trailer for his canceled game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hills/" data-ref-id="5000-306236">Silent Hills</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHCqxLtwy5g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eHCqxLtwy5g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The new video redacts some of the backstory text that sets up the game, which makes it difficult to understand what's supposed to be happening. Stephen King's It star Sophia Lillis plays the game's leading character, but most of the action takes place from a first-person perspective. Near the beginning of the clip, Lillis' character receives a card through the door with enigmatic instructions.</p><p>Lillis' character goes on to light a few candles, and that's where the creep factor rapidly expands. By the time someone--or something--enters the room behind Lillis' character, she's too frightened to run before it lays its hands upon her.</p><p>Udo Kier and Hunter Schafer will co-star in the game alongside Lillis, but details about their characters have yet to be disclosed. However, <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1970349454239957011" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kojima Productions did confirm</a> that the hyper-realistic character models and the game itself were created with Unreal Engine.</p><p>OD doesn't currently have a release date, but it will be published by Xbox Game Studios. While that doesn't necessarily rule out a PS5 release, that is yet to be confirmed. Resident Evil 2 and Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya recently shared his wish for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-2-director-wants-hideo-kojima-to-make-new-p-t-like-game/1100-6534599/" data-ref-id="1100-6534599">Kojima to make a P.T.-like game</a>, and it appears that he got his wish.</p>

To tease just how advanced the visuals will be, Kojima showed off Hamabe's CG-rendered character facial model, which revealed an impressive amount of realistic detail.</p><p>Just don't expect Physint to be out for a long time, as the game is currently still in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-physint-is-still-in-conceptual-stage/1100-6533807/">conceptual stage of development</a>. With Kojima Productions primarily focused on OD--which was also shown off during the livestream with a creepy trailer--and Kojima has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-stealth-action-game-physint-isnt-coming-any-time-soon/1100-6531630/">it may be "five or six years" away</a>.</p><p>In addition to the work he's doing on these games, Kojima is also busy expanding the world of Death Stranding through multimedia projects, like an upcoming live-action movie and a <a href="http://https//www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-anime-trailer-shows-off-brutal-stylized-violence-in-kojimas-world/1100-6534931/" rel="nofollow ">Death Stranding anime</a>.</p>

<figure><a title="ShadowCast 3 / Covert Dock 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f10fb3758b790/shadowcast-3-covert-dock-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Genki - Human Things</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Genki (which got into a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-and-accessory-maker-genki-reach-settlement-in-switch-2-lawsuit">wee bit of trouble with Nintendo</a> recently) has teased two upcoming products: the <strong>ShadowCast 3</strong> and the <strong>Covert Dock 3</strong>.</p>
<p>The ShadowCast 3 is the next iteration of – you guessed it – the <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast-2?_pos=1&amp;_sid=d19e4fee4&amp;_ss=r">ShadowCast 2</a>, which allowed users to connect their Switch to a laptop or iPad for accessible gaming and capture on the go. It came with its limitations, with a recommended capture quality of 1080p60 for the best results. As such, while we can't confirm for definite right now, it seems reasonable to assume the ShadowCast 3 will allow for 4K capture at 60fps – perfect for the Switch 2, then.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Covert Dock 3 is the new iteration of... oh, <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/covert-dock-2?_pos=3&amp;_sid=6f92cbe00&amp;_ss=r">you get it</a>. This thing is pretty nifty and would essentially bundle a 4K HDMI dock into a portable console charger, allowing you to connect your Switch in its handheld configuration to a TV without the need for a full-size dock. Sadly, the second version isn't compatible with the Switch 2, so that's presumably where the Covert Dock 3 comes into play.</p>

<p>Genki has released a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanthings/trilogy">Kickstarter</a> page for the two products which will go live within days at this point. Price has not yet been confirmed, but an initial image at least gives us a good glimpse at what each product will look like. The Covert Dock 3 is on the left and looks remarkably similar to the Dock 2, albeit with a new colour scheme, while the ShadowCast 3 on the right is a pretty significant departure from the previous version.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye out for more details on these new products and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Less than two months after the launch of Mafia: The Old Country, a major member of that game's cast has confirmed to have heard that publisher Take-Two Interactive has greenlit a new installment. </p>



<p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JN-0baTto-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> by YouTuber Mafia Game Videos, actress Carina Conti, who played Enzo Favara's beloved Isabella Torrisi in the recently released game, said as much <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/7doMj5TEtMA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a recent livestream with Bubbly Nuggets</a>. Of course, we should take the news with a grain of salt, but it is possible she may know about it.</p>



<p>Mafia: The Old Country had a seemingly successful launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-sold-over-800k-copies-in-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling over 800K units in its first week on the market</a>. Sure, it did not make big waves, but it also did not need to. The game was developed over just three years as a linear, smaller, and less costly title that retailed at $49.99. This tells us it shouldn't take long for the game to break even and become profitable; we should know more after the next Take-Two quarterly financial report, which will be shared in November. </p>



<p>I largely enjoyed my time with Mafia: The Old Country, albeit with some reservations, as you can read <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-the-old-country-a-fine-sicilian-mafia-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in my review</a>:</p>



<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country aims squarely at being a narrative experience, and largely succeeds in that while also providing solid gameplay. It is a bit of a shame that we don't get to explore Sicily in this game, but if you're into Mafia narratives, this is among the best you can find in games, and the price isn't so high to boot.</em></p>



<p>Did you buy the game yet? If so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments section below. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> continues to make a noise in China, this time through a nationwide McDonald's collaboration designed to coincide with this year's Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>On the elaborate and specially designed menu are, according to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DO6aKmMEojo/?img_index=2">China Insider</a> and <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20250919-Wukong">the McDonald's China website</a>, a huge black double beef "mooncake" (the Mid-Autumn Festival is also sometimes called the Mooncake Festival), a crispy chicken burger "mooncake", shrimp nuggets, which sound weird, curly fries and themed McFlurries. There's even a weird black-cased dessert thing, with a gooey yellow and white filling. Apparently this is a sesame lava pie, whatever that is, but to me it looks like a crusted, elongated Cadbury's Creme Egg. </p>

<p>But better yet! There will also be coinciding merch pop-ups in the biggest Chinese cities where people can buy exclusive Black Myth: Wukong x McDonald's merch. The most elaborate of these pieces is a dressing gown (it might be a wearable fleece thing - it's a bit unclear) which is black with ornate Wukong-related design-work and comes with a matching headband, which, admittedly, I rather like. There's a horrid white dressing gown with McDonald's logos and burgers on, too.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The collaboration starts today in China, so hurry on over, and runs in thousands of restaurants until 21st October. And I know what you're thinking: lucky bastards - why do they get black burgers and dressing gowns and not us, in the West? Well we can't have it because we didn't give Black Myth: Wukong Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2024, that's why. Don't, Bertie, don't.</p><p>Maybe a better question is why, a year after release, Black Myth: Wukong is still being celebrated in China. Well don't forget there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">a follow-up game called Black Myth: Zhong Koi</a> in development, which like Wukong, takes another iconic figure from Chinese folklore - the evil spirit-killing deity Zhong Koi - and spins a game around him.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-gameplay-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ananta-really-looks-like-anime-gta-in-new-gameplay-trailer-from-tgs-2025.1305117/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For TGS 2025, NetEase Games and Naked Rain (a studio with offices in Hangzhou and Montreal) have shared a new gameplay trailer of ANANTA, an intriguing and very much anime GTA-looking open world game.</p>



<p>In development as a free-to-play game for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices, ANANTA aims to immerse players in a living, breathing metropolis where every alleyway is filled with stories waiting to be discovered. The map is dotted with interactive hotspots where players can trigger events such as petting cats in parks and gang clashes. Players can snoop on passersby's phones or defy traffic laws with reckless street racing. Naked Rain also promises 'intelligent and lifelike behavior' from the NPCs that populate the city. Interiors will be accessible across three vertical layers: rooftops, mid-levels, and ground floors.</p>



<p>To move around the city, players may use public transportation, such as subways and buses, as well as cars, taxis, and helicopters. There are also special traversal techniques like 'swinging' (which sounds a lot like Spider-Man's signature traversal method) to get around quickly. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ANANTA | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uYejjuRrLzw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>ANANTA features plenty of combat, too. Naked Rain said that there is a high degree of environmental interactivity, allowing players to use items like golf clubs or trash bins as weapons to defeat enemies. In addition to their own gear, players can take enemy weapons during battle to experience different combat styles. Combat itself includes action staples like dodging and blocking.</p>



<p>In terms of narrative, players will step into the role of the new captain of a special task force, navigate city streets, forge alliances, and unravel mysterious threats to daily life. By seamlessly switching between diverse roles, they'll experience multifaceted urban lives—each with unique personal stories. They will get to protect justice as a cop, infiltrate the Internet as a hacker, race through alleys as a delivery man, or chase fame as a live-streamer.</p>



<p>There's no word yet on any release window, but we'll make sure to report the info once available. Meanwhile, you can pre-register on the <a href="https://www.anantagame.com/501/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>.</p>

            <p>
Dear Hideo Kojima, you'd better give us a proper update on your new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-creator-hideo-kojima-is-working-on-a-brand-new-action-espionage-game-that-is-also-a-movie">action-espionage game-movie</a> wotsit <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/physint">Physint</a> soon, because for every hour that passes, I think of another unbearable title pun. </p>
<p>I'm not very Physinterested in Physint right now, a game defined by what it Physisn't. Perhaps I'd be more Physinto it if Kojima Productions would share a proper outline and explore the Physintricacies. But this is Hideo Kojima, a man of *grunts, strains* Sphysint-like enigma. Still, at least we now know that Don Lee from Train To Busan is in the stealthy film-o-game, together with Charlee Fraser from Furiosa and Minami Hamabe from Godzilla Minus One.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a livestream last night, Kojima discussed working with 3Lateral to model each performer's face. He shared some early renders of Hamabe in-engine. Yep, sure looks like a face.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
He also shared some concept art from Physint, which certainly underlines the Metal Gear connections. There is a man in a flapping coat with a high collar. Or half a flapping coat, anyway. I can't work out where the coat ends and his utility belt ends. He's got a lot of weird harness wrapped around his right shoulder. Doubtless, this is Tactical.
</p>

<p>
Also, a rifle with a scope and a stock and a silencer. We can expect a mix of sneaky and open firefights, I expect. Behind the man there are tall forbidding buildings with a lonely bird visible against slate clouds. Hang on, the lonely bird is just a stray coffee grain on my laptop screen. Let me wipe it away. Ah, now I feel sad about the missing bird.
</p>
<p>
Is this sadness the Feeling referred to by the caption "Here Comes the Feeling"? Probably not. When will the Feeling actually arrive? Maybe in "another five or six years", Kojima <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojimas-next-espionage-game-physint-wont-be-out-for-a-few-years-yet">commented in May</a>.</p>
<p>Physint is actually "in development", now, following the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a> on console. Kojima decided to make a new game in the vein of Metal Gear following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kojima-says-he-decided-to-make-physint-for-metal-gear-fans-after-illness-in-2020">recent illness</a>. Here's hoping the next trailer or livestream at least features more legible Tactical apparel. Physint, reveal thyself!

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair has revealed a new farming spin-off game, titled (of course) Palfarm.</p>
<p>As you'd expect, the game will see players teaming up with their Pals to sew seeds, mine for ore, and befriend townsfolk. And it looks like there's a spot of romance too.</p>
<p>There's also combat, as evil Pals can raid your farm - defeat them to obtain further resources. "After all, combat is a form of harvesting in its own way," reads the Steam page. Gruesome.</p>

<p>It's mostly a spin on the popular gameplay seen in the likes of Stardew Valley, which has proven exceptionally popular over the past decade.</p>
<p>Yet this reveal comes just shortly after Nintendo's latest Direct where it revealed its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ever-wanted-to-play-a-pokemon-animal-crossing-meets-minecraft-pokemon-pokopia-might-be-just-that-game">new Pokémon life sim game Pokopia</a> in which players join 'mon to farm crops and gradually build an attractive little environment.</p>
<p>Both games are part of a long-established genre, but the timing doesn't help to shake the feeling Pocketpair is once again following in the footsteps of Nintendo.</p>
<p>Palfarm is yet to receive a release date, but is available to wishlist now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4031890/Palworld_Palfarm/">Steam</a>. It's unclear if it will also be released on console.</p>
<p>Nintendo's lawsuit against Pocketpair for copyright infringement remains ongoing, as Nintendo was recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted a new patent around summoning monsters</a>. It's also argued that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-argues-mods-dont-count-as-proper-games-as-pokemon-v-palworld-lawsuit-continues">mods don't count as proper games</a>, countering Pocketpair's defence.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pocketpair-to-fix-jank-in-hugely-successful-pokemon-alike-palworld-as-it-pushes-past-nintendos-controversial-lawsuit-towards-full-10-release-in-2026">continuing development of Palworld towards a 1.0 release</a> next year, fixing "jank" it wishes to properly address to set the full release up for success.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kojima-productions/">Hideo Kojima</a> is a busy man, Death Stranding 2 is hardly out of the door,&nbsp; he’s working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/23/kojima-productions-new-od-knock-teaser-is-pretty-creepy/">OD, which is currently an Xbox exclusive</a>, and also Physint, which is currently a PlayStation exclusive. However, that doesn’t really mean these days and both titles may eventually end up on both formats.</p>
<p>Physint, a “next-generation action espionage game”, was announced in 2024. Kojima said it would go into full production after Death Stranding 2, but it is a long way off with Kojima <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-says-in-an-interview-with-a-french-magazine-that-the-death-stranding-movie-is-planned-for-2027-and-that-physint-will-take-him-5-or-6-years.1192278/">stating in May this year t</a>hat “It’ll take me another five or six years.”</p>


<p>Physint presumably means “Physical Interaction” but the logo is a little odd, the Y is clearly separate from the rest of the text. Kojima never does anything without a purpose, so it will be interesting to see what theories fans can come up with.</p>
<p>During a Kojima Productions 10th Anniversary livestream, which you can watch below, key artwork for Physint was revealed along with the first actors. Charlee Fraser, Ma Dong-seok and Minami Hamabe are all confirmed for the game, and I would suggest Ma Dong-seok, aka Don Lee, is the most recognisable, having starred in The Eternals, Train to Busan, and gamers will have met him as Samson in Death Stranding 2.</p>
<p>The SAG-AFTRA strike affected casting, so the main character has yet to be revealed, although that is “coming soon”.&nbsp; Looking at the artwork, some have suggested it might be Robert Patterson, but it looks rather more like Eddie Redmayne to me.</p>



<p>When the title was announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/31/hideo-kojima-is-making-a-new-action-espionage-game-after-death-stranding-2/">Kojima said</a> “I cannot tell you so much now… but we plan to bring together cutting-edge technology and talent from around the world to create it. Of course, it is an interactive game, but it is also a movie at the same time in terms of look, story, theme, cast, acting, fashion and sound. With this title, we hope to transcend the barriers between film and video games.”</p>
<p>It has been revealed that 3Lateral are creating new technology to capture the likeness of the actors.</p>
<p>So, only six years to wait and I guess we’re all going to have to buy a new console to play it on as the PS6 should be out by then.</p>
