That’s great, but I just wish it didn’t come at the cost of <em>fishing</em>, a mechanic that was introduced during the Season of the Deep, and brought me tremendous zen when I grew tired of shooting things ad nauseam in <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p><p>Fishing is, for all intents and purposes, a pretty pointless activity. I don’t want to suggest it didn’t have depth, but it was hardly the optimal way to earn anything during the Season of the Deep. It would net you seasonal reputation and captured fishes (which ranged in rarity akin to weapons and gear) could be deposited into a tank for further rewards, which was a nice touch. You could even begin an exotic quest line while fishing, but that was the most it ever mattered. Otherwise, fishing holes simply popped into existence on several of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s worlds for folks to kick back, cast a line, and catch a break. Saving the galaxy from being torn apart by the warring factions of the Light and Darkness is hard work. Guardians deserved the break.</p><p>Fishing was a fun idle activity, but it also reminded me of how important distractions like it are to MMOs like <em>Destiny 2</em>. I was just talking to a friend about how they went fishing in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online--1"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a></span><em> </em>a few weeks ago, and they were so excited to tell me about it and what they got from participating. Fishing is a banal activity, but it helps people feel connected to their environment and the people around them. Why do you think certain father-son relationships are predicated on partaking in fishing trips? Why do you think so many MMOs—which thrive on fostering worlds that draw players in and incentivize them to stay—so frequently have fishing minigames? It extends beyond MMOs too! Folks love fishing in games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and they often plumb the depths of these pretty simple features just to spend time in these games and worlds.</p><p><em>Destiny 2</em> has never hurt for activities. If anything it has too many of them, and they often boil down to the same loop of shooting things, defending objectives, and moving on to the next target. These activities are fun because <em>Destiny 2 </em>remains one of the best-feeling FPS games on the market, not because they are inherently novel ways to pass the time. That’s why fishing felt like such an odd but welcome addition. It was <em>actually</em> something different, and even if it was ultimately pretty shallow, I preferred it to the similar combat gauntlets <em>Destiny 2 </em>has recycled and remixed for years. That’s why fishing’s removal is such a bummer.</p><p>The removal of content is something Bungie is still figuring out, and it remains a thorn in the side of its community. Many of the larger aspects of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-into-the-light-final-shape-excited-1851384918">recent <em>Into the Light </em>update</a></span>, such as the raid boss gauntlet Pantheon and a social hub with its own reward track, are already getting gutted from the game. Bungie has already said it’s looking for ways to reintegrate systems introduced via <em>Into the Light </em>into the main game, which raises questions about why they’re being removed in the first place. On the other hand, it does suggest there could be ways to reimplement features like fishing, meaning all hope isn’t completely lost.</p><p>The eternal problem with <em>Destiny 2 </em>is that it’s a huge game with a lot of technical debt: it currently comes in at more than 100 GBs of memory across its several platforms, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-file-size-preload-1851510165&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-file-size-preload-1851510165">number will only grow higher</a></span> with the inclusion of <em>The Final Shape</em>. It’s why whole campaigns were removed from the game in the first place. Moving forward, Bungie’s got to be smarter about what it adds, especially if it’s going to keep taking things away from its players. Why is the game constantly growing only to continue shrinking? It doesn’t seem feasible or fair to either the developers or the players that vast swaths of <em>Destiny </em>will continue to disappear.</p><p>The hope is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-leak-sequel-bungie-payback-1851403208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-3-leak-sequel-bungie-payback-1851403208">whatever shape the <em>Destiny </em>franchise takes after</a></span> this expansion accounts for these problems. It’s imperative to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-destiny-2-sony-final-shape-playstation-1851077097"><em>Destiny </em>and Bungie’s long-term health</a></span> that <em>The Final Shape </em>not only succeeds, but transforms the game into a more manageable one whose development <em>doesn’t </em>constantly cause fires like this. As a player, it’d just be great to have all the chunks of the game that I support every year stick around. For me at least, that begins by carving out a place for fishing, the most completely mundane part of <em>Destiny 2 </em>that I will miss so dearly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24167443/indika-video-game-movies-cinematic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nwMpOV">For two decades, the words “cinematic” and “blockbuster” have been, for most game directors, synonymous. During this window, which stretches back to the original <em>God of War</em> and <em>Halo</em>, we’ve enjoyed (or, for others, endured) big-budget video game creators aspiring to emulate their blockbuster film counterparts. </p>
<p id="M82jej">If — somehow — you’ve never seen the films of Steven Spielberg or Michael Mann, you’ve nonetheless experienced them via contact highs from Uncharted, Grand Theft Auto, and practically every other Big Game released this millennium. </p>
<p id="fBIFu7">But <em>Indika</em>, a game that sounds like a weed strain and plays like being stoned and scrolling through the Criterion Channel, has me hopeful that we’re approaching, with narrative video games, a turning point for what it means for a game to be “cinematic.” </p>
<p id="HEuHEu">What fuels that hope is <em>Indika</em>’s creative similarities to a micro-budget indie horror film from the ’90s.</p>

<h3 id="uxgRaU"><strong>The Blair Witch effect</strong></h3>
<p id="yKyEMU">Is it possible for one game to change the look of an entire medium? And why would it be <em>Indika</em>, a game most readers haven’t played, or even heard of?</p>
<p id="81EvNJ">25 years ago, <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> inspired countless parodies with a single shot. You know the one. You can see it in the trailer, the poster, or at the top of this story. The lead actress-slash-camera operator holds a cheap camcorder inches from her face. Tears well in her eyes, and a flashlight casts hard shadows across her dry skin. </p>
<p id="gAwxOx">She’s terrified. She’s a mess. She’s barely in focus or even in frame.</p>
<p id="jJr6YJ">At that time, few commercial directors would film a shot so crudely, nor would a celebrity offer the audience such an intimate look inside their nostrils. Filmgoers expected movies to conform to a certain look, sound, and feel. But <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> didn’t resemble anything in theaters; it looked like a cheap documentary you’d find on the local PBS station. It looked real.</p>

<p id="1J14RY">With that emphasis on “realism” above all else, the amateur camerawork accomplished its goal — scare the shit out of people — better than any expensive shot on an industry-grade camera could.  </p>
<p id="Xz6HR8">The filmmakers had taken the empathic visual language of the documentary form and weaponized it. Look again at the shot. You don’t see an actress staring into the camcorder; you see a person. And so, as happens when you look someone in the eyes, a connection forms. This person, you think, could be you. Alone. In the woods. Something unknown stalking through the branches. </p>
<p id="l1Hsa3">The camerawork of <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> wasn’t cinematic, not in the classical sense. But in time, what audiences expected film and TV to look like would change to meet that image. Do we have the sprawling found-footage horror genre without it? Or the mega-popular docu-sitcoms like <em>The Office</em> and <em>Modern Family</em>?</p>
<p id="ihyD8f">The creators of <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, because of their limitations (no money! No sets! No actors!) looked for inspiration where others didn’t have to, and wouldn’t choose to. The film’s success then gave future creators big and small permission to follow its lead, forever changing what a Hollywood movie could look and feel like.</p>

<h3 id="Oq7302">
<strong>Indika and the film school games</strong> </h3>
<p id="vp7x9s"><em>Indika</em>, the fantastic new adventure game from Odd Meter, tells the story of a young nun who loses her grip on reality in an alternate-history version of 19th-century Russia. Tortured by a voice in her head that may or may not be a demon, Indika partners with a sickly man who may or may not be divinely chosen by God. Together, they embark on a perilous road trip through beautiful forests, abandoned towns, and literalizations of biblical allegory. </p>
<p id="cppAoi"><em>Indika</em> is the latest — and one of the most impressive — examples of a sea change in the look and feel of cinematic games. </p>
<p id="JaEZ5V">You don’t have to play <em>Indika </em>to see what I mean (though, hey, you really should). In the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23921305/odd-meter-11-bit-studios-indika-announcement">announcement trailer</a>, the game’s creators borrow liberally from filmmakers rarely associated with games. These directors, who can’t afford the spectacle and scale of big-budget filmmaking, rely on more audacious (and affordable) craft to distinguish their work. </p>
<p id="R7lRxe">“We tried to use a standard limited set of [virtual camera] lenses to depict the limitations of inexpensive auteur cinema,” <em>Indika</em> game director Dmitry Svetlow told Polygon over email. He cited<em> Poor Things</em> director Yorgos Lanthimos, Russian filmmaker and slow cinema pioneer Andrei Tarkovsky, and former Monty Python member and infamous weirdo auteur Terry Gilliam as inspiration. </p>

</p>
<p id="5svlZB">In <em>Indika</em>, the stark exterior landscapes and cold architecture resemble the striking but antiseptic sets of Lanthimos. In the game’s nunnery, a SnorriCam shot — in which the camera is strapped onto the actor and aimed at their face — recalls <em>Blair Witch</em>, of course, but also the works of ’90s music video director turned ’00s filmmaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awoTylLBF9I&amp;t=1s">Spike Jonze</a> and Robert Webb’s comedy sketch series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lnusc9Rlx6w"><em>Sir Digby Chicken Caesar</em></a>. </p>
<p id="FWWL7H">Where <em>Blair Witch</em> borrowed the documentary aesthetic to force audiences to straighten their backs and pay attention, Svetlow and company are reaching into the toolbox of low-budget filmmaking to do something similar with games.</p>
<p id="mm1572">Or, to put it crassly, <em>Indika </em>doesn’t just look like art films but feels like them. The story opens with the player inhabiting the habit of the titular young nun and fetching a pail of water from a well, then doing it again. And again. And again and again. Her steps up and down a grimy, snow-crunched slope in the abbey echo Tarkosvky’s long shots (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3Dp6EdFRHo">like this one</a> of a man carrying a candle for seven minutes) that were intentionally tedious, forcing us to feel time passing not just in a movie or a game, but in our life as we experience them. </p>
<div id="HdS3Q0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O3Dp6EdFRHo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="oIuGmq">To make the game more cinematic, Svetlow wrote the team needed a “greater focus on dramaturgy, on the quality and depth of characters, as well as the necessary level of presentation of events.” </p>
<p id="dY5eRb">In <em>Indika</em>, you don’t save the world or nail sick headshots. You accumulate poorly hidden collectibles and earn points, though they’re worth nothing and, by the standards of other games, a waste of time — something the game’s loading screens emphasize any chance they get. (“Don’t waste time collecting points, they are pointless.”) Sometimes Indika comes across a bench, and if you direct her to sit down on it, the game hands over the “film editing” to the player, allowing them to swap between different camera angles, some of which Indika doesn’t even appear in. </p>
<p id="PYPFNa">You could move on, directing Indika to stand back up and continue about her business. Or you could let the camera rest, your mind wandering as your eyes lock onto a field of mud and snow. In a medium full of realistic 3D worlds rife with kinetic empowerment, <em>Indika </em>encourages you to indulge in a moment of peace and ceding of control.</p>
<div id="CcsQnh"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wZZ63QYbwPk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<h3 id="skv4lS"><strong>Change happens slowly and then all at once</strong></h3>
<p id="zEPJjI">Can we be certain games like <em>Indika </em>will influence their big-budget peers? They already have. </p>
<p id="o7mQrn">Here’s just one example: In 2009, Naughty Dog released <em>Uncharted 2</em>, a game rife with some of the most iconic blockbuster moments in the history of video games. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVNxI86vLKI">Its opening</a>, in which the hero climbs up a train that dangles off a cliff, may have inspired the latest Mission: Impossible, which ends with Tom Cruise doing something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQn9hrj0byk">very, <em>very </em>similar</a>.</p>
<p id="b40caj">But tucked into<em> Uncharted 2</em> is a sequence meant to contrast with these sorts of set-pieces. Around the midpoint, Nathan Drake hikes through a Tibetan village. He doesn’t climb any deadly cliffs. Nothing blows up. Nobody gets shot. This was, in its time, unusual — a moment in which the player could exist in a beautiful 3D environment without being required to destroy the village or its population.</p>
<p id="fcozpE">The Tibetan village sequence (and I swear this was acknowledged publicly, though now I struggle to find any quote) was cribbed from 2008’s <em>The Graveyard</em>, a short art game from the now-defunct micro studio Tale of Tales. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZZ63QYbwPk">In the game</a>, an elderly woman walks the path of a graveyard, sits on a bench, reflects, and then returns from where she came. To younger readers, this will sound tedious. But to game critics at the time, this scene dropped into our minds like a new drug — a total shock to the system.</p>

</p>
<p id="XTyiHo">With <em>The Graveyard</em> and <em>Uncharted 2 </em>and many other (mostly indie) games of that time period, the video game industry witnessed a surge in what would be dubbed “walking simulators,” a somewhat derisive term for a powerful idea: You make a beautiful, rich virtual space, then afford your players some time to exist within them.</p>
<p id="VWk2Oz">If The <em>Graveyard </em>could reshape the assumptions of cinematic video games, then why shouldn’t <em>Indika </em>help to bring the style of low-budget and arthouse filmmaking to <em>Indika</em>’s many peers? </p>
<p id="ySijkQ">That’s the magic of this moment in video games: <em>Indika</em> isn’t alone in its ambitions to challenge our assumptions of what makes a game cinematic. Indie developers have been steadily pushing against the confines of what games look and feel like for over a decade. <em>To the Moon</em>. <em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em>. <em>Disco Elysium</em>. I could double my word count with nothing more than titles.</p>
<p id="BABkZj">But what’s different now, and what <em>Indika</em> reflects, is the independent games scene accelerating up an exponential hockey stick of creative output.</p>

<p id="zMesGS">Much like <em>The Blair Witch Project</em> (and countless other indie films since its release) was made possible by the first boom of consumer-level cameras and filmmaking tools, <em>Indika </em>and its ilk reflect a new era of game production where a small team — thanks to cost-effective and ultra-powerful dev tools — can take a risk on a personal project. In fact, with modern game engines, indie game developers can accomplish visual feats indie filmmakers could only imagine.</p>
<p id="rrZBar">“We recreated a non-existent fairy-tale world; to do this for cinema would have cost an order of magnitude more,” Svetlow told Polygon.</p>
<p id="AeMQlA">Since I finished <em>Indika</em>, I’ve played three more oddly “cinematic” games — <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>, and <em>Crow Country —</em> and it feels like every week another new game appears, its creators taking a bat to the expectations of what a game should look and feel like. Now and then the bat is bound to connect and pop open this medium, releasing an entirely new style that artists will pounce on, like kids grabbing candy from a smashed piñata.</p>
<p id="LzgMxc">Perhaps <em>Indika</em>, in time, will reveal itself to be one of these special games. The <em>Blair Witch</em> of video games, launching a thousand projects that build on the arthouse aesthetic. Or perhaps this abundance of creativity will — not with one bold release or one inspirational aesthetic — radically change the idea of what makes a game “cinematic” to the point that we’re less worried about how a game can look like a film, and these interactive narrative experiences that we’d previously compare to great films can have a look that’s recognizably and thrillingly their own.</p>
<p id="Bojxxp">I hope we get there. In the meantime, I’ll be grateful to play games that aspire to match ambitious and inventive directors, rather than playing yet another video game that could be mistaken for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22611267/free-guy-review"><em>Free Guy</em></a>. </p>

		<p>Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power is the next expansion for the grand strategy game, Paradox Interactive has revealed, and it will be available from September 24th. This new expansion, which is part of Crusader King III’s Chapter 3 expansion pass, adds new ways of vying for power in this ruthless medieval world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power - Available September 24!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PxamTWMq1M0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Roads to Power will add two new ways to play Crusader Kings III. The first is that of a Landless Adventurer who starts with nothing and builds their reputation through mercenary work. Get powerful enough and you could challenge the power structure of a kingdom, and take over. The second pathway is set in the Byzantine Empire, which is a non feudal system. Here players will need to scheme as noble in the imperial court against other families in attempt to grab power, and place allies in the strongest positions.</p>
<p>Paradox Interactive has outlined the features players can expect in Crusader Kings III: Roads to Power:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Administrative Government: Experience medieval rule outside of the feudal system with a new style of empire management. A web of Governors jockeys for position in the empire with intrigue and power, sometimes rewarding merit and sometimes rewarding perfidy. Only a truly skilled Emperor can keep these squabbling forces in line.</em></li>
<li><em>The Family Estate: Run and manage a powerful Family Estate, the seat of your House’s power, even when you hold no other land. Construct new buildings and improvements to further your power and influence within an administrative empire.</em></li>
<li><em>Influence System: Build up a character’s influence within an administrative empire to climb the rungs of bureaucracy. Raise your status in the realm and gather more power for yourself. Start as a landless noble on an estate, and compete for valuable provinces to govern before making your bid for the Purple.</em></li>
<li><em>&nbsp;A Life of Adventure: Freely roam the map, untied to any realm or holding, going wherever the winds of fortune blow you. Fulfil contracts as a landless adventurer, even through the generations, building up a reputation of your own. Earn gold, prestige and fame travelling the globe until you decide to settle down and claim land you have earned through merit.</em></li>
<li><em>Choose Successor or Caesar: Spend the influence you have gathered to determine the course of the Empire and get the successor you want, whether a royal family member, a powerful noble, a martial hero, or any other candidate you can rally the people behind. The Emperor can even opt to co-rule if the burden of the throne is too much for one person.</em></li>
<li><em>New Byzantine Flavour Content: New events, monuments and activities built around the Byzantine theme, including chariot racing.</em></li>
<li><em>Cosmetic Additions: A Byzantine-themed UI skin and new court fashions for your characters, new 2D event art, new on-map monuments of the Byzantine world, new on-map holding designs, and a Byzantine throne room for Royal Court sessions, among other aesthetic improvements. New music inspired by Orthodox holy chants is also included.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshots of some of the new content were also shared.</p>

  <p id="yugZzI">It’s quiet in here — almost <em>too </em>quiet. Consider this the calm before the storm; with June kicking off, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164051/best-new-tv-summer-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series">we’ll be knee-deep in a treasure trove of new shows</a>, and that pace keeps up, more or less, the whole summer. </p>
<p id="tV8L27">Still, there’s a lot of fun stuff to dig into. <em>Clipped</em>, starring Laurence Fishburne, details the events that led to Donald Sterling’s lifetime ban from the NBA; <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Disney Plus Star Wars show, is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23931403">the first time the High Republic era has been on screen</a>. All that and <em>Doctor Who</em> is still going, and <em>Top Chef</em> no longer has <em>Last Chance Kitchen </em>to catch its fallen soldiers. Things are heating up all over the place!</p>

For one, the hero shooter genre has been oversaturated for almost a decade thanks to games like <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>, so games like <em>Concord </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-release-date-pc-roster-heroes-1851369240&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-trailer-release-date-pc-roster-heroes-1851369240"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em> </em>can feel years late to a trend well past its prime if they don’t do enough to distinguish themselves. With <em>Concord </em>failing to communicate a clear hook that makes it memorable in an oversaturated live-service market, some folks are already dismissive of it, seeing it as another game to add to the pile of genre contenders that will likely launch, flop, and possibly put people in game development out of a job. The comment section on <em>Concord</em>’s two trailers is scathing.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Just call it ‘Modern Audience: The Game’” - @rile_up</p><p>“So many people are gonna lose their jobs over this game....” - @patrickwilliams7582</p><p>“Is this seriously what Sony thinks people want?” - @mrnatak-ic6lj</p><p>“The most shocking thing about the trailer was that Sony left the comments open” - @T.O.Wallee</p></blockquote><p>Once it was established that everyone was going open season on <em>Concord</em>, criticisms were directed at it from every angle. Pushing away with all our might the fact that there is a reactionary group mad the game features a diverse cast, let’s instead focus on the actually worthwhile conversation points sprouting up around the game. The cinematic trailer came under fire for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg&amp;lc=UgxVWpGJ3FTdhKwsUM94AaABAg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg&amp;lc=UgxVWpGJ3FTdhKwsUM94AaABAg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">portraying <em>Concord </em>as something with a narrative throughline</a></span>. Then it became clear it was a competitive shooter with external “vignettes” that would tell the story. After games like <em>Overwatch </em>have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">pushed narrative to the side</a></span> in favor of a live-service competitive game that diminishes its setting, fans are wary of a game that could repeat the failures of its clear inspirations. The format has become tiresome, though we’ve seen so little of <em>Concord</em>’s story elements that there’s a possibility it may integrate those ideas more successfully. </p><p>Some also took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1d4ylfi/concord_might_have_the_ugliest_characters_designs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1d4ylfi/concord_might_have_the_ugliest_characters_designs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jabs at its character design</a></span>, which lacks the same recognizable spark of its hero shooter contemporaries. Others criticized what’s widely seen as its derivative nature, stating that it clearly drew inspiration from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1796301790121533550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1796301790121533550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">properties like <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a></span><em> </em>but lacks the charm. If you’re coming in years late to the hero shooter trend and don’t offer anything new, exciting, or even remotely memorable, it’s going to feel like a disingenuous cash-in.</p><p>Some of the disdain may be rooted in backlash toward Sony’s recent pivots and business decisions. PlayStation had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">company-wide layoffs</a></span> in February and completely shut down <em>Singstar </em>developer London Studio. This came after a concentrated push for more live-service games despite Sony’s efforts in that area having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-delayed-tlou-factions-1851007495">frequent troubles in development</a></span>, including delays and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434">cancelations</a></span>. </p><p>If <em>Concord</em> and all the parts of it people take issue with are the end result of Sony putting millions of dollars into live-service games over the beloved single-player games and IP that have long been synonymous with PlayStation, it’s the video game equivalent of a hapless cashier getting reamed for company policy determined way above her pay grade. Perhaps that’s why the reveal of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-game-playstation-5-ps5-playroom-sequel-1851510119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-game-playstation-5-ps5-playroom-sequel-1851510119"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>went over so well, comparatively. The platformer is a sequel to a beloved game that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">pays tribute to the best parts of PlayStation history</a></span>, rather than something that portends to a more generic, mass-appeal future for the brand.</p><p>Ultimately, <em>Concord </em>may be better than this State of Play communicates. Marketing is just as capable of undermining a video game as it is generating hype. But unless Sony and Firewalk Studios are able to make a better second impression, this viciousness will likely follow it until it launches on PlayStation 5 and PC on August 23. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[How YouTube’s New Gaming Leak Culture Actually Works]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-youtube%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-leak-culture-actually-works.888480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-youtube-leaks-work/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, which has allegedly obtained an internal Google database tracking six years of potential privacy and security issues, one employee has been responsible for several leaked Nintendo announcements in the past. But according to our sources, that’s just the tip of the iceberg in this new Google/YouTube leak culture. First, it should be stressed that 404 Media’s report is based on information spanning from 2013 – 2018, but is clearly still an issue today.</p>



<p>A couple of days ago, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1796298547647635940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">I tweeted </a>that YouTube had investigated two occasions (that I know of) when employees breached their contractual agreements by accessing data on the backend. While only one of these investigations was purely gaming-related due to leaking announcements, it’s important to dive into the first instance and how it caused a substantial internal investigation that caused some people to lose their jobs.</p>



<p>The first investigation happened towards the latter end of 2022. The catalyst? A ‘Try not to make me laugh’ video by popular content creator KSI. Back then, KSI would do a weekly YouTube series called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUFJmtWx-E&amp;ab_channel=JJOlatunji" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">‘Try not to make me laugh’</a> in which if he laughed, he would display an Amazon Gift Card on screen for one of his viewers to redeem. At first, he started at $100 per gift card per laugh and incrementally got higher and higher with each video. In the final video, KSI offered up $1000 per laugh, with the grand total of all the cards exceeding $10,000+ for his fans to redeem. The catch? They were all redeemed before the video went public. </p>



<div><p>The scandal resulted in KSI and his team pressing YouTube, which resulted in Google conducting an internal investigation. According to our sources, who wished to stay anonymous as they were not authorized to talk about the company’s internal processes, the investigation led to some people being fired, even some not privy to the scandal. “Your videos are not just watched for monetization approval,” said one source. “They are watched by employees all the time,” they continued. This included anything private, scheduled, or unlisted: showcases, game announcements, and other footage not intended to see the light of day.</p><p>Of the two I’m aware of, YouTube’s second investigation happened soon after the GTA 6 leak, which, admittingly, could have just been a wild coincidence. After all, it has now become common knowledge among those in the industry that many gaming leaks do come from unlisted, scheduled, or private YouTube videos – and maybe the investigation was already ongoing at this time. Nonetheless, the result probably resulted in disciplinary action for one or more people.</p></div>



<div><p>Whatever the case, though, these investigations have seemingly done nothing to stop it from happening again.</p><p>Sony’s recent State of Play was a big eye-opener for me and the most recent example I can give about how widespread this new YouTube leak culture is. Within around 18 hours of the State of Play being scheduled on YouTube, I had four different individuals send me the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-play-leaked-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">complete game list</a>. Some game names were slightly different from others, likely because of different regions and the rush to jot everything down to be the first, but they were all generally spot on. One such individual even told me that the information was sold to an undisclosed person for a small three-figure amount, who then told him to spread it to more people for validity. </p></div>



<div><p>It is unclear how this will be resolved. Still, repeat investigations are clearly not working, and simply not uploading the content to YouTube before an announcement is a marketing nightmare for publishers. For instance, it’s not ideal for your first glimpse of a game to be in 360p because of YouTube’s shoddy processing times. Then, there are other marketing needs, such as sending the content to marketing partners, content creators, the media, and more.</p><p>But yes, there you have it. That’s how a lot of information is leaked before a reveal, at least to my understanding anyway. After all, it isn’t a coincidence that precise bits of information leak before being revealed in the way that they have been. </p></div>



<p>Why people are simply not being fired for breaking the rules is also a mystery, but perhaps there are so many people who watch this behind-the-scenes content, that it could be impractical to lay that many people off.</p>



<p><em><strong>Datamining and searching for trademarks are also common ways for people to obtain information, and I can discuss them further in the future if requested. But I also want to point readers to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1c1fo93/schreier_an_explanation_of_rumorsreportingsourcing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit post from Jason Schreier</a>, which explains a lot of other ways of sourcing in detail. </strong></em></p>

Pre-loads are available, but be wary of its hefty storage space of more than 100 GB. Considering the size, it’s best to prepare during the downtime, just so you’re ready for launch.</p>

While the SBC is well worth its price in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em>, the stats on the new Flashback card could have been better. </p>

		<p>Retailer GAME has confirmed that it is ceasing its GAME Rewards and GAME Elite programmes from July 31st. This means after this date those who are part of the Rewards or Elite scheme will lose all points accrued, and will not be able to earn anymore points. Up until July 15th, points can still be earned by Rewards customers. Points will be redeemable up until July 31st.</p>
<p>In an email sent to customers, GAME wrote, <em>“As of 31 July 2024 (“Closure Date”) the GAME ‘Reward’ Programme (“GAME Reward”) and the GAME Elite Membership Scheme shall come to an end, after which GAME Reward and GAME Elite members will no longer be able to earn GAME Reward points on purchases made in GAME stores or online at game.co.uk or redeem any GAME Reward or GAME Elite points ( please see the GAME Reward and Elite closure FAQ’s at https://www.game.co.uk/reward for further information ) remaining on your GAME Reward account.</em></p>


<p><em>You will still be entitled to receive GAME Reward Points as per the terms and conditions on eligible purchases in GAME stores and online at GAME.co.uk but only until 23.59 on 15 July 2024 after which date purchases will not earn you any GAME Reward Points, but you can redeem any GAME Reward Points until the closure date. </em><em>We would strongly urge you to redeem your GAME Reward Points prior to the closure date on purchases in GAME stores or online to avoid disappointment. </em><em>After the closure date the GAME Reward Points will be reset to zero and the GAME Reward account will be closed. You will no longer be able to access it and you will no longer be able to redeem your GAME Reward Points.</em></p>
<p><em>The closure of GAME Elite will also mean the closure of monthly GAME Elite offers and also prize draws and promotions that Elite Members are eligible to enter.</em></p>

<p>This announcement follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/17/game-trade-in-end/">GAME ending video game trade ins earlier this year</a>, marking a massive shift for the once dominant retailer. Over the years, GAME’s fortunes have taken hit after hit. In 2018, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/13/game-is-halving-the-rate-at-which-you-can-earn-reward-points/">Game halved the rate at which you could earn Reward Points</a>. Fraser Group took over the company, shuttering many of the stores and moving GAME retail spaces into Sports Direct stores.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/is-league-of-legends-on-xbox-game-pass-riots-way-of-fighting-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the games that were added to Xbox Game Pass in 2022, it would probably be safe to say that&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, and <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;stand out the most. While you can point to virtually any other game in the Game Pass catalog and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review">conceive of a target audience</a>, the target audience for&nbsp;<em>Valorant </em>or <em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>on Xbox Game Pass is much less obvious. After all, as affordable as Xbox Game Pass may be, it's still never going to be cheaper than a game that is literally free. This brings up the question of why Riot Games is putting their games on Game Pass to begin with as it seems like a rather redundant move on their part.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>has had a respectable following for more than a decade.&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>&nbsp;has been out for more than two years. Generally speaking, Riot's games aren't particularly hardware intensive either as you can play <em>Legends of Runeterra </em>and <em>Teamfight Tactics&nbsp;</em>on your phone. All of these games are free to play too, so the barrier to entry is effectively limited to how much time you have (and how much you are willing to spend on microtransactions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If anything, it would appear as though Riot is getting the short end of the stick by putting their games on Xbox Game Pass. For example, if you were to play&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>through Xbox Game Pass, you get access to every single champion that is currently in the game as well as day-one access to any upcoming new champions.</p>

<p>Considering that there are at least <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">160 champions currently in&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_champions">League of Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the cheapest paid champion costs about $2.25 USD, you are looking over $300 worth of champions for the cost of a single $15 monthly subscription. The caveat is that if you want to <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/11124399294867">buy a skin for a champion, you would need to buy the champion first</a>. Granted, these are all digital goods, so Riot isn't exactly spending any money by giving away these champions.</p>

<p>Of course, Microsoft could've simply offered Riot a mountain of money for all these perks. It's no secret that Microsoft's current goal is to grow the Xbox Game Pass subscriber base and this is the perfect way to gobble up a part of Riot's sizable audience. As for Riot, they might be getting more than cold hard cash, intentionally or otherwise. Sure, some new and returning players might spend some money on skins here and there, but the real benefit for Riot in this partnership with Xbox Game Pass is essentially brand loyalty. Think of it as a form of insurance against any would-be competitors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a look at <em>Valorant's </em>Xbox Game Pass perks. Once again, you get access to all existing Agents. The key takeaway though is that you also get day-one access to every new Agent as they're released and a 20% XP boost. <em>League of Legends'&nbsp;</em>perks has the same pattern. The same kind of perks are given for Teamfight Tactics,&nbsp;where you get access to four skins until April, at which point they are replaced by a monthly rotating skin.&nbsp;<em>Legends of Runeterra&nbsp;</em>is the odd one out in that no future content is being granted through Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=lnQkT_l5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant.jpg?itok=pHYKRRL5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Let people play as <em>Valorant's </em>Agents to get them to care about <em>Valorant's </em>story, simple as that.</figcaption></figure><p>This would imply that Riot sees the way the wind is blowing when it comes to gaming subscription services in general, especially now that $70 games are the new norm. It's much easier to sell a free-to-play game if you frame it in terms of being able to save money and more importantly, time. Would the average gamer be willing to jump ship to a similar game if they have to grind away for unlocks or pay anything more than $15 per month? Maybe, but they might be less willing. Even if players do leave, Riot can try and pull them back with a new character, making every big update a potential threat to the competition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seeing as how virtually every major free-to-play game uses an identical progression system, it would be unsurprising if other games offered their own bonuses on Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus. Hypothetically, let's say that Respawn sees that people quit <em>Apex Legends</em>&nbsp;because it's too much of an effort to unlock Legends. While there's a portion of their audience who is willing to spend real money to unlock Legends, people who quit because they want to spend their time elsewhere likely aren't coming back, which means they aren't going to spend money on the microtransactions that add up, namely cosmetics. Give them the cool stuff for "free" though, and they might form enough of an attachment to the actual game that they'll buy a skin here or there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In any case, it would be interesting to see what comes of this partnership. The question is will other free-to-play game developers and publishers feel the same way. After all, Riot is indisputably one of the largest and thus most influential entities in the industry and if they think jumping on the game subscription service bandwagon is a good idea then that might very well be the case. Plus it's hard to complain about people getting more game in their game at an affordable price.</p>

There’s photo evidence — and today, <a href="https://modretro.com/blogs/blog/the-future-is-retro">he’s revealing</a> his own take on the ultimate cartridge-playing Nintendo Game Boy, one that you can actually buy for $199.</p><p>Shipping this holiday, <a href="https://modretro.com/">the ModRetro Chromatic</a> sounds incredible: magnesium alloy case, sapphire crystal cover glass, PBT buttons, a pixel-perfect IPS screen at the same size, resolution, and pixel structure as the original Game Boy and Game Boy Color, color-matched to the Game Boy Color screen — and with “well over a thousand” nits of brightness so you can play out in the sunlight. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->12</p><p><figcaption><em>Hardware gallery: Luckey says all of these are real pictures because “renders are for losers.”</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Not only does it have an FPGA inside (like the lauded <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22831589/analogue-pocket-review">Analogue Pocket</a>) to play genuine Game Boy and Game Boy Color carts as if you’re playing them on the Nintendo original, Luckey says it will come with a genuine copy of <em>Tetris </em>like the 1989 original famously did in most countries. It’s <a href="https://modretro.com/products/tetris">a new, fully licensed <em>Tetris</em> game</a> internally developed by Luckey’s team, which features “reimagined versions of the iconic Tetris theme song” and genuine Link Cable multiplayer. </p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->7</p><div><figcaption><em>Actual macro photos of a Chromatic screen.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Images: ModRetro</cite></p></div></div><p>Because yes, the Chromatic has a Link Cable port as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack and USB-C for “lagless” video out. It lasts 24 hours on three standard AA batteries, Luckey tells me. While it’ll probably ship with alkalines, there’ll be an optional lithium-ion pack, too — and he tells me you can even recharge your NiMH AA batteries over USB-C! </p><p>Speaker audio is mono, like the original Game Boys, with a “custom ultra-loud speaker module,” and ModRetro has also partnered with Koss to ship <a href="https://modretro.com/products/porta-pro?variant=47662601765166">color-matched retro Porta Pro headphones</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Palmer Luckey, age 16, with modded GB Pocket.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Speaking of custom, Luckey tells me the whole design is in-house, including the custom screen — which is so bright because it’s based on displays used in aviation. He says ModRetro isn’t doing anything quite so exotic as manufacturing its own chips but that, in general, the team went all out instead of making business savvy decisions. “None of it makes any business sense at all.”</p><p>Compared to the Analogue Pocket, says Luckey, “we are actually authentic”:</p><div><blockquote><p>The color temps are actually right, the clock rate isn’t slightly off, the pixel structure isn’t totally wrong in a way that ruins subpixel aware sprites, etc.</p></blockquote></div><p>He sent me this image to illustrate:</p><div><figcaption><em>”Here is an example - notice how Lapras is garish yellow on Analogue instead of actually matching the GBC color temps, which we did with an all custom display,” writes Luckey.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Palmer Luckey</cite></p></div><p>The handheld isn’t the only thing the ModRetro team will be selling: you can buy original “Chromatic” cartridges with new games, too. Luckey’s <a href="https://modretro.com/blogs/blog/the-future-is-retro">promising a lot there</a>: “all-physical re-releases and remasters of classic Game Boy titles, entirely new IP from incredible indie developers, first-time launches of Game Boy games that were canceled before release, and even some titles that were canceled before the public ever found out about them.”</p><p>The Chromatic handheld doesn’t use ROMs, by the way, not even in a roundabout fashion like the Analogue Pocket. It’s cartridge only, says Luckey, unless you supply your own flashcart.</p><div><figcaption><em>Some of the games on offer.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: ModRetro</cite></p></div><p>Luckey says he’s not sure how long he’ll fund hardware manufacturing, hinting that quantities will be limited — though GameStop will carry an unknown number of them as well. “I am going to make as many as I need to fulfill preorders,” he tells me. “But this thing is too crazy to make forever.” </p><p>“I don’t see this as a way to make money, I see it as the way to make the world’s best tribute to the Game Boy, something that I’ll be proud of for a very long time.”</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">You know me</a>: I’m getting one.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> has had a rather troubled development cycle, but it seems like Ubisoft is gathering its resources to finally get the project done. Announced back in 2020, the game was originally being developed by former support studios Ubisoft Mumbai and Ubisoft Pune, but reactions to early trailers weren’t exactly positive. It seems Ubisoft brass weren’t impressed either, because the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handed back to Ubisoft Montreal</a> and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">completely rebooted</a>.</p>
<p>There have been recent hints that the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-not-far-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may actually be progressing</a>, and today it was announced that a new studio is joining the project – Ubisoft Toronto, a team best known for heading up all the recent entries in the Far Cry and Watch Dogs franchises.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time!</p>

<p><em>“Ubisoft Toronto is joining the development of the remake of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time! We’re excited to rewind time and bring our studio’s creativity, expertise and updated tech to refresh this beloved classic with our partners at Ubisoft Montreal.”</em></p>
<p>While Ubisoft Toronto typically focuses on open-world games, it seems unlikely that Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time will take that route. That said, according to recent insider reports, the new Sands of Time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being rebuilt from the ground up</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Fans should forget everything they have heard or seen from the reveal trailer from years ago as the remake is being built completely from scratch. This means that the remake has been rewritten, recaptured in mocap, and more. Although stated otherwise earlier, previous work from Ubisoft Mumbai and Pune isn't being used for the rebooted remake.</em></p>
<p><em>Also, the remake's overhaul is said to offer a more "realistic approach", compared to what was shown in the announcement trailer. Aside from a complete graphical overhaul, animations, combat mechanics and parkour have also been overhauled for the rebooted Sands of Time Remake. Another interesting detail is that Yuri Lowenthal - the actor portraying the prince in the original trilogy and the initial remake - won't be reprising his role in the remake.”</em></p>
<p>Ubisoft has yet to specify a release date or platforms for the new Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Hopefully, more information is revealed before too long. The franchise has been on the rise recently with the release of the acclaimed Metroidvania, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a>, and the early access launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>

  <p id="wR3HAC">Heads up, Chooms! The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24151491/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit-cyberpunk-red-announcement">Cyberpunk Edgerunners Mission Kit</a>, the next expansion for Cyberpunk Red, is now available to pre-order. The expansion, inspired by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23349865/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-2077">popular anime</a>, is set to launch on June 24, and can be reserved as either a $14.99 PDF from <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/482282/preorder-cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit?affiliate_id=3095954" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DriveThruRPG</a> or <a href="https://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/bundle/31687/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">Roll20 digital kit</a>, or a $34.99 physical release pre-order from <a href="https://talsorianstore.com/collections/cyberpunk/products/cyberpunk-edgerunners-mission-kit">R. Talsorian Games</a>.</p>
<p id="Z4X8gn">The Mission Kit includes the Edgerunners Handbook, a lore book detailing the history of Night City, and biographies of the original Edgerunner crew from the anime. You’ll also find an abridged Rulebook and quickstart guide in addition to <em>The Jacket, </em>a one-shot adventure designed to get your crew right into the action. </p>
<p id="GbaIY6">Both versions of the Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Mission Kit include everything you need to play, including tokens and maps; however, the physical version also comes with a collection of six Edgerunners-themed dice, in addition to printed standees, maps, and tokens to supplement gameplay.</p>

<p id="seyEGg">While the <em>Edgerunners </em>rulebook contains everything you need to make your own characters, the Mission Kit also includes a collection of seven eclectic, pre-generated Edgerunners, complete with full illustrations by Hiroyuki Imaishi, director for the <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> anime.</p>

<p>Were you lucky enough to score a free copy of Content Warning during its launch promotion? If you were, then you managed to land one of this year’s most interesting multiplayer horror games without paying a single dime. It offers a ton of content, more than a few laughs, and many possibilities moving forward. But is Content Warning coming to PS5 and Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-content-warning-coming-to-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Is Content Warning Coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>Landfall Games, the publisher behind Content Warning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-sells-2-2-million-copies-console-release-possibly-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently revealed</a> that the indie horror game sold a staggering 2.2 million copies and accumulated over 8.8 million players, meaning a lot of free copies went out on day one. In the same thread, they didn’t outright confirm a console release, but they allude to one.</p>



<p>When asked about Content Warning on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, the studio said, “Never say never,” and left the eyes emoji to those asking about a console release. Again, this isn’t a guarantee. But the publisher and developers seem to want to launch their multiplayer horror game on consoles!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-more-views-in-content-warning">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/content-warning-how-to-get-more-views-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get More Views in Content Warning</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-many-people-can-play-content-warning">How Many People Can Play Content Warning?</h2>



<p>If you’re playing vanilla Content Warning—with zero mods installed—then you can have four people per game session playing and recording the horrors of the Old World. However, many user-made mods are available that increase the player count exponentially.</p>



<p>I’ve played in servers with twenty people, which led to absolute chaos. We were the monsters invading the underground, not the humans trying to survive. But it was also one of the most fun experiences I’ve had in the game.</p>



<p>That said, it’s unlikely that Content Warning mods will make their way to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s likely too much of a hassle for an indie studio.</p>

This is the third collaboration Hyperkin has done with Microsoft to make officially licensed controllers for modern platforms, as the gaming peripheral company previously made replicas of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-duke-xbox-controller-20th-anniversary">original Xbox Duke controller</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyperkin-xenon-xbox-360-controller-microsoft-xbox-series-x-s">Xbox 360 controller</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Hyperkin DuchesS: New Product Images</h3></div></output><p>The Hperkin DuchesS, as the name and imagery imply, looks a lot like the Xbox Controller S, but with some modern features such as Hall Effect thumbsticks, modern ergonomics, precision impulse triggers, and a Share Button. Unfortunately, despite what was previously stated by the company, Hyperkin revealed that the Duchess would not include Hall Effect triggers, citing "form factor constraints" as the reason for including drift-free triggers. </p><p>"With the launch of DuchesS, you'll be able to use a version of every generation of Xbox controller ever created on a modern console with the trio of Hyperkin official replicas," Hyperkin's lead developer and licensing director Slade Dude Suzuki said. "That itself is a pretty cool feat!"</p><p>Hyperkin DuchesS will be compatible with the Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Windows 10 and 11 PCs. Pre-ordering is slated to begin on July 15, with HyperKin's official website and Amazon confirming that the two retailers' customers can purchase the gamepad.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>2024 marks the 35th anniversary of Nintendo's Game Boy, and it remains one of the most influential and popular handhelds of all time. In 2021, the Analogue Pocket was launched as a way to give modern gamers a new option to play their Game Boy games as well as games from other discontinued handhelds. Now, Analogue Pocket has a new competitor in the form of ModRetro's Chromatic, and it may be even more enticing to Game Boy fans.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ModRetroHub/status/1797663109341229152" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Meet: The Chromatic.<br>A handheld game console designed with modern tech, but with retro soul. Compatible with all classic Game Boy®. and Game Boy®. Color cartridges. <br>First-edition handhelds are available for pre-order. Bundled with Tetris®. for Chromatic in the box. <br>First… <a href="https://t.co/1fT8pqZwX8" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/1fT8pqZwX8</a></p>  — ModRetro (@ModRetroHub) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModRetroHub/status/1797663109341229152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The original Game Boy was bundled with Tetris at its launch, so it's only fitting that the Chromatic will also be launching with Tetris included. Tetris is just one of the new Chromatic Game Boy carts launching alongside the handheld. Though the carts are designed with the Chromatic in mind, they will work with original Game Boy hardware. Additionally, all original Game Boy and GBC cartridges are supported.</p><p>ModRetro went out of its way to pay tribute to the original Game Boy and its successor with a custom IPS screen that matches the size (2.6 inches) and resolution (160x144p) of the GBC. The Chromatic is FPGA-based, which means it replicates original hardware all the way down to pixel structure and color accuracy. The sapphire crystal glass screen has anti-glare technology to improve playability in direct sunlight and is "super scatch-resistant," according to ModRetro.</p><p>The Chromatic utilizes PBT buttons and is housed in a magnesium-alloy shell that will be available in six different colors. It's fitted with a USB-C charging port, but you can also power it with three AA batteries (included). The USB-C port can be used for "lagless video out" as well, which is a neat perk. To complete the authentic experience, the Chromatic has a Link Cable port that allows you to connect to original Game Boy hardware for multiplayer as well as an IR sensor. Dozens of Game Boy Color games made use of the infrared port, including Pokemon Gold and Silver for sending/receiving mystery gifts.</p><p>Preorders are already <a href="https://modretro.com/products/chromatic-tetris-bundle" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">live on ModRetro's official site</a>, and the price of the handheld is $199.</p><p>More <a href="https://modretro.com/collections/games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Chromatic carts are available to purchase separately</a>, including an updated version of the Game Boy Color classic Toki Tori and several indie games from contemporary Game Boy developers.</p><p>Additionally, ModRetro announced that GameStop will be the official retail partner for the Chromatic, which will launch during the holiday season later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/disney-lorcana-booster-boxes-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disney-lorcana-booster-boxes-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="323" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Disney Lorcana</em> is an excellent TCG for veterans of the genre to introduce their friends and family members into the hobby. With an IP that is familiar to people of all ages, beginners can focus on learning basic TCG mechanics and spend less time figuring out how to pronounce an ancient demon warlord’s middle name.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">Your first <em>Lorcana</em> purchase typically comes down to two options. Purchasing a starter deck allows you to jump into a game with a predetermined strategy and decklist. But if <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-disney-lorcana-starter-deck-ranked/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=every-disney-lorcana-starter-deck-ranked">the starter decks available</a> don’t resonate with you, you can <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">buy a booster box</a> and immediately have access to a large collection to build your own deck with. This guide will focus on booster boxes and tell you everything you need to know about this product.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-s-in-a-disney-lorcana-booster-box" data-injectable="false">What’s in a <em>Disney Lorcana</em> booster box?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ravensburger</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Each <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Disney Lorcana</em> booster box</a> contains 24 booster packs. Since each booster pack is filled with 12 cards, that amounts to 288 cards in each booster box.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">So far, every<em> Lorcana</em> set has introduced a little over 200 cards. This means that after rarities are taken into account, a booster box will likely contain over half of the entire set’s collection. If you’re lucky, you may even pull an Enchanted card, the rarest and most valuable type of card in <em>Lorcana</em>.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Booster Box vs. Booster Pack value</h2> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="814" data-injectable="true">Booster boxes are an excellent way to jumpstart your collection. Regardless of the set, booster boxes are always priced in a way that they are cheaper than buying 24 booster packs outright. Boxes sit comfortably around $117 on TCG Market and Retail, while booster packs are found slightly under $6 each. <a href="https://geni.us/5jncxdG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Buying a booster box</a> instead of 24 individual booster packs could save you over $20. Cracking open packs is one of the most fun aspects of TCGs, and doing so at a slight discount makes it even better.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">All of <em>Disney Lorcana’s</em> sealed products (booster packs, boxes, starter decks) can be found in Local Game Stores, retail stores such as Walmart and Target, or online at TCG Market. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-disney-lorcana-set-ever-released-in-order/">Each <em>Lorcana</em> set releases</a> with different characters and themes so if you’re chasing a particular card, make sure you purchase the booster box from its corresponding set.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Encore’s ability to deal monstrous amounts of damage —especially after activating Cosmos Rave— sets her apart as the best Fusion main DPS in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. But given the specifics of her kit, she can also be considered one of the game’s trickiest characters to build. </p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="163" data-injectable="false">So that you can unlock all of her potential and teach all on your path to stop judging a book by its cover, here’s the best Encore build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Encore</h2> <figure data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">The best weapon for Encore in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> is the 5-star <strong>Cosmic Ripples</strong>. The rectifier shines, given its high ATK and ability to buff her Energy Regen by 12.8%. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true">Cosmic Ripples also allows her to boost her Basic Attack damage by 3.2% after hitting enemies with them. The buff can stack five times for a 16% DMG increase. Stacks can be triggered within 0.5-second intervals and will last eight seconds each. All of the values showcased above are referent to the weapon at Rank 1.</p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">Once the weapon debuts as part of the second wave of Version 1.0 banners, Yinlin’s signature weapon, <strong>Stringmaster</strong>, will become the best for Encore. The weapon will offer a massive amount of Crit Rate (36% at level 90). While in the field, Stringmaster will also offer her a 12% increase in Fusion DMG and a 24% boost in ATK after she performs her Skill twice. </p> <h3 id="h-best-4-star-and-fp2-alternatives" data-injectable="false">Best 4-star and FP2 alternatives</h3> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">The Battle Pass-exclusive<strong> Augment</strong> is my main 4-star pick for Encore. The rectifier is the only 4-star in the game with a Crit Rate substat and will provide her with a 15% ATK boost after she casts her Resonance Liberation. This is huge, as it will boost her damage while in Cosmos Rave. </p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">If the above is not an option for you, the best alternative and F2P pick for Encore is the also 4-star <strong>Jinzhou Keeper</strong>. At level 90, the weapon will provide her with a high amount of attack through its 387 base value and 36.4% ATK substat. While equipped with it, Encore will also be able to get an 8% ATK and 10% HP buff by using her Intro Skill (R1). </p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Best-4-star-Weapons-for-Encore-in-Wuthering-Waves.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1920&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;1080&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Encore</h2> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">Like all Fusion DPSs, the best Sonata for Encore is a <strong>5-piece Molten Rift set</strong>. The Sonata will offer a 10% increase in Fusion DMG and will allow Encore to increase the buff to 40% by simply performing her Resonance Skill. The 30% Fusion buff will last for 15 seconds. Echo-wise, I recommend that you go with the<strong> Inferno Rider</strong> as your main thanks to his 12% Fusion and Basic Attack DMG buff. For the remaining spots, go with the usual formation of two Elites and two Common echoes. </p>

For substats, I recommend prioritizing Crit Rate, Crit DMG, Energy Regen, ATK, and Basic ATK DMG Bonus. Don’t overlook ER, as you will need at the very least 120% of it to make her Liberation available at the start of every rotation. </p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">Thanks to her fast attack speed, it’s vital that you also raise Encore’s Crit Rate to at least 50 to 60%. Remember, being able to produce big numbers will only matter if you can constantly replicate the feat.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best teams for Encore in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her reliance on Basic Attacks while in her Resonance Liberation state, the best team for Encore will feature her as its main DPS and Sanhua as its main support. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanhua </a>excels here giving her ability to provide Encore with a 38% increase in Basic Attack DMG Deepen after performing her Outro Skill. She is also able to effortlessly fill her concerto gauge and it’s at her best when in fast rotations. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">For the healer spot, Verina is my main pick. Considered the game’s best, she will offer a constant amount of off-the-field healing, the ability to revive, and a handy universal DMG Deepen buff. If you don’t have our top picks, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortefi</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhi</a> would be my main picks respectively. </p>

"You" being the players who completed the metagame's last Major Order and successfully pumped the Terminid supercolony of Meridia full of an experimental "Dark Fluid" - which Super-Earth, incidentally, pinched from the Illuminate faction during the First Galactic War, aka Helldivers 1.</p>
<p>Now, Meridia has imploded and become a radiant, wailing, purple-fringed disc of pure nothingness, with triumphant players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6l1px/this_is_what_happened_if_you_were_in_orbit_around/">rudely ejected from orbit</a> via emergency hyperspace jump, but subsequently allowed to return and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d6rk3h/nearly_three_minutes_listening_to_the_void_these/">gaze into the dark heart of their victory</a>. Great work, Inferno-plungers. I'm sure the consequences of this will be neither cosmic nor horrible.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The Supercolony has been destroyed," reads a Super-Earth broadcast in the wake of Meridia's liberation from the everyday laws of physics. "In its place, a beautiful black hole remains, drawing in every Terminid spore within several billion kilometres. Interstellar spore levels have already sharply decreased in every system. The destruction of Meridia came not a moment too soon ... Containment is now once again possible."</p>
<p>As we know, Super-Earth broadcasts are sometimes so Super in their patriotism that they are forgiveably... expansive with the truth, in much the same way that airstriking a whole valley is a perfectly acceptable way of smashing that one Automaton you can't seem to headshot. But it's credible that we'll have fewer bug monsters to fight in the near-future, because look, Super-Earth has spawned itself a planet-sized hoover. On the other hand, we might have to deal with the sudden arrival of a fleet of highly advanced cthulhoid aliens. Swings and roundabouts, eh!</p>
<p>The Illuminate are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-updates-could-bring-back-the-first-games-sneaky-teleporting-illuminate-faction">already much-tipped to return in Helldivers 2</a>. There's a big gap on the Galactic Map ready and waiting for them, and let's face it, no developer worth their salt is going to add a visitable black hole to a game only to leave it sitting there like a lawn ornament. Mark my words, young divers. Something is going to come out of that hole, and I'm pretty sure it won't be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-once-had-a-portable-hole-but-swen-vincke-says-it-would-have-been-a-crime-against-humanity">all your leftover junk from Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p>

		<p>Last year, Summer Game Fest directly overlapped with the launch of <em>Remap</em>, which is why I wasn't even on the first podcast lol. But it made sense for me to attend, because it felt like a way of legitimizing the whole endeavor. We had lost our jobs, yes, but we'd just launched this new thing, it seemed successful, and attending an industry event, with a badge and everything, felt <em>official</em>. It was also a lot a fun to see friends and colleagues, when increasingly, so much of our work happens remotely these days. So on Friday, I'll be heading to the airport to spend a few days in Los Angeles. I'll be playing games, talking to developers, drinking beers, and showing up on a <em>Giant Bomb</em> live show. It'll be fun, and I'll certainly have lots to share in the days and weeks ahead, because, yes, I'll be bringing a microphone.</p><p>-pk, who also has to travel two other times this month, bleh!!!!</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>MONDAY:</strong> Our collaboration with LudoNarraCon comes to an end, with a final panel hosted by me.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-armored-core-6-lore-video-is-the-best-mecha-movie-of-2024.888393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170549/amored-core-6-lore-video-best-mecha-movie-2024-vaatividya<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="5MyfBl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23842706/armored-core-6-review-fromsoftware"><em>Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon</em></a> was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">one of last year’s best games</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81PpudVySmw&amp;ab_channel=Polygon">a fitting return for the franchise after a decades-long hiatus</a>. It’s a game you should enjoy yourself for its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23846137/armored-core-6-smart-cleaner-boss-fight-good">lightning fast mecha combat</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23849203/armored-core-6-best-boss-fight-strategy">bottomless level of customization</a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23864578/armored-core-6-rusty-steel-haze">meticulously plotted sci-fi story</a>. But if you just want to skip all that gameplay and ingest a captivating FromSoft science fiction tale, then I’ve got just the video for you!</p>
<p id="m8cQ2K">“<a href="https://youtu.be/4n9eakXNsIQ?si=GDD8gmDp6LKuwc9I">The Entire Story of Armored Core 6</a>” is a completely comprehensive, five-and-a-half-hour video from legendary FromSoftware lore chronicler <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@VaatiVidya">VaatiVidya</a>. Known for his Dark Souls boss deep dives and epic Elden Ring story breakdowns, this time Vaati gets to share in his love for one of FromSoftware’s oldest franchises and it <em>might</em> be his best video yet. </p>
<p id="y0yrcG">Not only does it take into account every voiceover line, part description, and combat log to weave together all three of <em>Armored Core 6</em>’s timelines into one sweeping epic, but Vaati and his collaborators uncover cut dialogue tracks, animate still images from the game, and record audio tracks for characters who don’t have a voice in the game proper. In between Vaati’s gracefully narrated sections of lore are immaculately captured sequences of gameplay that <a href="https://github.com/vswarte/ac6-freecam">required a custom built free-camera capture mod</a>.</p>
<p id="gqeoDs">Even someone as<em> AC6 </em>obsessed as me (it was my personal GOTY) learned so much from watching this video. For example, I’d originally enjoyed Iguazu’s storyline as the classic Gundam rival archetype — basically, someone who is constantly big mad that the main character is so awesome all the time, but also someone the main character doesn’t really think about. So I thought it was hilarious when Iguazu turned out to be in cahoots with the final boss of the game’s NG++ ending. This time, when my extremely angry rival gave his big speech about how long he’s been planning to take his vengeance <em>blah blah blah</em>, I genuinely thought “Igua-who?” before remembering him as the whiny punk I’d thrice beaten before. It felt a bit like an in-joke reward for beating the game three times.</p>
<p id="JnCLaT"><em>Now</em> I understand that his being a 4th gen augmentation and one of Allmind’s chosen makes him a mirror image of my character. The fact that my coral ghost ally, Aer, actually causes him physical pain any time I’m present. The way he’s constantly made a pawn by pretty much everyone. Just under the surface of his nearly comical revenge tale is a classic FromSoftware tragedy. Based on cut dialogue and part descriptions, it’s implied his rage and envy are powering his armored core. Which actually makes him even <em>more</em> like a Gundam character, just not in the way I realized.</p>
<p id="5BSVRc">Watching this video gave me an even greater appreciation for one of my all-time favorite games. If you enjoyed <em>Armored Core 6</em>, it’s a must-watch. You can even break it up into smaller pieces with the video’s chapter markers if the long runtime intimidates you. </p>

That person then reported the incident internally. </p><p> According to an internal interview by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-streaming-failing-shutdown-report-stream-1848487185&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/google-stadia-streaming-failing-shutdown-report-stream-1848487185">Google</a></span>, this incident was determined to be “non-intentional.” Below you can watch the trailer that was leaked early by a contractor.

When an employee submits the flag they suggest the priority level to the reviewer. </p><p>The reports obtained by <em>404 </em>are from over six years ago and are examples of these flags—every one was reviewed and resolved at that time. In some cases, these employee flags turned out not to be issues at all or were issues that employees found in third party services.</p></blockquote><p>Individually, most of these issues are minor and were, to Google’s credit, fixed quickly. However, it’s not comforting that one of the largest tech companies in the world—which monitors and collects millions of people’s data every minute—is seemingly capable of doing such a shitty job at managing private information and content safely and securely.</p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the immense success of the live-action television series and the critical and fan acclaim of the two games in the franchise, many find themselves eagerly awaiting a third entry. We want to finally learn more about Ellie and Abby and see where the story unfolds from here. But do we know The Last of Us Part 3’s release date yet?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-last-of-us-part-3-coming-out">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Coming Out?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking about the studio</a>, its future, and The Last of Us as a whole, Neil Druckmann said that Naughty Dog won’t always be The Last of Us studio forever. He wants to pursue other projects, unique storylines and single-player adventures, which means stepping away from the post-apocalyptic storyline altogether.</p>



<p>Does that mean they’re entirely done with the franchise? It’s unlikely. Again, following the incredible success of the television series starring Pedro Pascal, it would likely be foolish to toss the franchise aside now. There are still more stories within the world.</p>



<p>But we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 release date. It’s not happening yet, but it is coming. Druckmann already said the team’s process for the third game is the same as the second game, focusing on a compelling story and message about love. But he also said that if the team can’t develop something, the ending in The Last of Us Part 2 was quite strong overall.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-the-last-of-us-part-3-star-ellie">Will The Last of Us Part 3 Star Ellie?</h2>



<p>While we know very little about The Last of Us Part 3 overall, including whether it’s officially happening, we can speculate that Ellie will play an integral role in its storyline. Whether it’s a short-lived appearance remains to be seen, but we know from firsthand experience that Naughty Dog has zero qualms about tossing out beloved mainline characters early on.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of story left to tell, from Ellie’s and Abby’s perspectives, but there’s also a world of survivors and tales within The Last of Us to explore!</p>

The front of the chair is emblazoned with the game's iconic logo and crystalline detailing, while the back sports a large decal of the Crystal Ecarch's Ocular--a location FFXIV players will be very familiar with. You can also customize the chair with magnetic interchangeable patches featuring the DPS, healer, and tank role icons that attach to the left shoulder padding. All three patches are included with the chair.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4311388-ffsecretlabhead.jpg"

                <p>A Google employee reportedly accessed private videos on Nintendo's YouTube account and then leaked that information ahead of planned announcements. That's according to a new report from <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-leak-reveals-thousands-of-privacy-incidents/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a> based on a copy of an internal Google database that tracked six years of self-reported privacy and security issues.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't have many details on the incident, the report states that Google's internal review of the incident concluded that it was "non-intentional"--it's not clear what that actually means in this case. The report mentions dozens of other instances of Google violating its own privacy policies (usually by accident), including one where Google Street View was transcribing a large number of license plate numbers and another where a Google speech service mistakenly logged speech data (including that of "1,000 children") for about an hour. The tech giant told 404 in a statement that all data related to these incidents has been purged.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this incident is relatively minor in the grand scheme of gaming leaks, it's a good example of how tech companies have practical access to a staggering amount of information that could be leaked--accidentally or not. The copy of the database was sent to 404 Media by an "anonymous tipster," and Google confirmed "aspects of its contents," per the report.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo is an extremely litigious company, though it's unclear what actions it has taken, if any, in this instance. In the past, Nintendo went after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-hacker-gary-bowser-released-from-prison-but-he-still-owes-a-lot-of-money/1100-6513332/" data-ref-id="1100-6513332">Bowser himself</a> for involvement in a hacking group.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/strategy-games-like-against-the-storm-let-us-think-about-the-bigger-picture-of-cooking<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you live in a tiny apartment and grew up without proper instruction on properly seasoning your food, fictional cooking in video games can look far more appealing than spending a half-hour in your own kitchen. As Cooking Week rolls on here at Game Developer, I've had to yank myself away from drooling at the magnificent creations offered up in games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Loathe as I am to pick up the pot and pan (don't worry, I throw a lot of food in my air fryer to ensure I'm not only eating processed meals), I still catch myself thinking about cooking in the world of game design. When we began looking at games to feature this week, my eye drifted away from the more obvious titles and into the realm of strategy games and citybuilders that I've loved since childhood.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After all, a civilization is nothing without mass-produced food. We simulate the passing of the ages in the Civilization series by researching innovations like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/key-components-civilization/">irrigation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/domestication/">domestication</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Armies in the Total War series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/06/18/414614705/appetite-for-war-what-napoleon-and-his-men-ate-on-the-march">march on their stomachs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, as any army would. And if you're building a game with different factions and many cultures, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stacker.com/food-drink/signature-dishes-50-countries-around-world">preferences of your people's diets</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can shape what resources you prioritize in trade and harvest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To discuss how these topics can fit into your next game, let's take a closer look at Eremite Games' roguelike city-builder </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The building blocks of settling the land">The building blocks of settling the land</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s cooking system is one thread of a large tapestry of game balance meant to support the game's roguelike nature. Lead designer Michał Ogłoziński explained in his 2024 Game Developers Conference postmortem of Against the Storm that this system ensures every settlement (or spree of settlements) feels different every run.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eremite Games shuffles a number of variables like unit races, resource availability, and tasks set by the Queen to offer different challenges and guide them down different paths. These variables are introduced the minute a new settlement is established—but as Ogłoziński pointed out, a number of consistent traits are in place to make sure every run is winnable, and that players don't feel screwed from the jump.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the beginning of each fun, players are assigned up to three races of villagers among their starting units. Each race has a set of unique skills and a series of "needs" that will maintain or boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players also start each run with a modest stockpile of food and access to raw ingredients like meat, eggs, vegetables, or fruit in their starting vale. Because these ingredients will inevitably expire, they're incentivized to cut into new zones to make sure their people don't starve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Villagers can feed on raw ingredients, but without more complex foods, their people may be demoralized and won't gain buffs that will help with other urgent tasks. Feeding only on raw ingredients also becomes less efficient as a settlement's population grows. These varying systems—and challenges sent down by the Queen that can push them to victory—incentivize the building of facilities that can produce bread, skewers, pies, etc.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As intricate as this food system is, it exists side-by-side with the process of producing other goods like clothing, bricks, and oils. This means at the most abstract level a delicious meal doesn't fulfill a different gameplay purpose than a comforting cloak.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Both are tools to chase certain gameplay objectives, and both are manufactured using similar processes. The downside of this system is that it can't fully express what makes cooking unique from other forms of production, but the upside is it places a greater priority on diversifying food sources in a way other games can't.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But, credit to Eremite Games, this system does support an important idea about depicting food in civilizational-level video games: that food isn't just a meter to be ticked up and down, it's a system that can express how people thrive and come together when food can be more than the bare essentials.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs">Complex food can also be a resource for social and economic needs</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers familiar with psychology regularly reference Abraham Maslow's "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow's_hierarchy_of_needs">Hierarchy of Needs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">" theory first published in 1945, which explores the notion of human motivation evolving to achieve different goals as basic needs for sustenance and survival give way for the need for community, a sense of belonging, self-esteem, and spiritual transcendence.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In survival games that have grown popular of late, it's a useful shorthand to express the player's journey of scrounging for essentials to building complex structures in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or massive fleets of spaceships in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>No Man's Sky</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a similar design logic exists in how the player will prioritize the aesthetics of their settlement as they become more sustainable. It also uses this theory to build out the game's fictional world and show how food fits into a civilization struggling with a neverending magical storm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key design choice here is that complex foods beloved by different races aren't just an output of the many logistical equations, but also an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>input </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">as well. The most basic system they play into is producing "Reputation," the resource needed to win a settlement run. When different races of villagers have their needs yet by goods such as complex foods, they produce Reputation, and the player inches closer and closer to victory.</span></p><p>Image via Eremite Games/Hooded Horse.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If that were the only purpose complex foods served, the player's objective would be to mainline facilities producing them and just pump out infinite amounts of it. But because of varying other needs from villagers, complex foods become a tool for other systems as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance "foods" like wine, beer, and tea are ingredients needed to operate "service buildings" like Taverns, Guild Houses, and Monasteries. These buildings offer global buffs that support other tasks and generate traits like "Religion," "Luxury," and "Leisure," which are craved by villagers and will boost their resolve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Foods both raw and complex also fit into the game's trading system. Individual items can be bought and sold to individual traders and other settlements, but the most efficient way to make money off them is to package them in goods like "Packs of Crops," "Packs of Provisions," or "Packs of Luxury Goods."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food-related items like Flour and Waterskins may also be packed into "Packs of Trade Goods" as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These systems balance the psychological benefits of good food against the commercial benefits. Players struggling against debuffs that make Resolve-based victories harder can still rely on food to win via commerce-related objectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With these high-level design choices, Eremite's philosophy of incentivizing different win conditions by increasing or decreasing certain variables is wide enough to support the many ways food fits into our society.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where can cooking go next in strategy games?">Where can cooking go next in strategy games?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes for a great case study in how the "higher-level" needs met by complex food still belong in survival-themed games where players are tasked with surviving in harsh elements. It's a great way to scrutinize the need for luxuries in hard times and ask players to evaluate if they're worth pursuing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers on other strategy games may rightly point out that this particular resource management loop isn't right for their genre. But there's still inspiration that belongs in other games!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Strategy games about conventional warfare can explore how the physical act of moving food from A to B can be a lifeblood for armies or cities under siege. Business or city simulators could explore how different types of food are craved—and can evolve—in cities with multicultural populations. And games leaning into trade and negotiation could explore how supply and demand for food or ingredients goes beyond monetary value and into the social needs a person or society has for a particular flavor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Food is such a key lifeblood for any society. And with the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Against the Storm</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developers working on games thinking about the nature of society and civilization should feel emboldened to explore why we value food once we step beyond individual kitchens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa Tech</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
