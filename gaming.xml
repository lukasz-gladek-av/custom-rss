			<p>A new look at the yet-to-be-officially revealed Nintendo Switch 2 has come today, thanks to the renders put together by a well-known tech leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnLeaks</a>, who has previously put together accurate renders for tech products before their official reveal, created these new renders on behalf of <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a> which are based on new data, including the supposed dimensions of the real console. A 360-degree video, which can be watched below, provides another great look at the system, the U-shaped kickstand, and the Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 | First Look | 360 Degree Video | Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides the new look at the console's design provided by OnLeaks' renders and 360-degree video, today we have learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 may indeed use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/">microSD Express format</a> as <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/">previously rumored</a>. This new standard can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards, whose read speed is capped at 200 MB/s. The console adopting this new standard is hardly surprising, considering how multiplatform games are nowadays developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S SSDs.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with leaks coming in daily, there's no doubt that the reveal is imminent. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> is in development. Now, voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer she'd love to be part of it and believes the original cast should be involved too.</p>
<p>"You will always get a yes vote from me on Shepard coming back in any form," said Hale. "That was such a gift, and it's a gift I will always be extremely joyful to receive."</p>
<p>Of course, developing such a choice-driven narrative into a singular TV series would have consequences. For starters, would Shepard be male or female?</p>

<p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do," said Hale. "The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!"</p>
<p>Hale confirmed she'd prefer FemShep to be canon in the show (obviously!), but she's also keen for the rest of the game's cast to join in some capacity.</p>
<p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p><p>She continued: "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p>
<p>What's more, there's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game in development that's set to continue the story of the original trilogy, with at least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">one fan-favourite character returning</a>. But would Hale like to see Shepard also return?</p>
<p>"I have no idea [what to expect]," she said, "except I'd love to be there. That's all I'm gonna say. Hey, team, hey, team, wherever you are in any capacity, I'd love to be there!"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-4k-improved-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds footage was shared online, providing a new look at the upcoming entry in the series, which will launch next month on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new 4K resolution footage, which was shared online by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, focuses on Ajarakan and Rompopolo, which will be found in the Oilwell Basin, an area that was previously announced but that was never shown in any previous footage. Besides highlighting how these two monsters will challenge players, the new footage also shows considerably improved performance over the open beta conducted last October, although it hasn't been specified which version of the game was used to capture the footage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the performance improvements showcased in the new Monster Hunter Wilds footage will not be present in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-test-soon/"> second open beta</a>, which will be held in two rounds in the first two weeks of February. This new testing version will essentially be identical to the first one, with the addition of some content, such as the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th. You can learn more about one of the most promising games launching this year in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 1 is about to begin, adding the Fantastic Four to the free-to-play hero shooter’s roster so that they can beat up Dracula, who has swamped the Earth in eternal night. It launches January 10th at 1 am PT / 4 am ET / 9 am GMT, and developers NetEase are paving the way in the traditional manner by rebalancing the character line-up so as to simultaneously win the adoration of certain player groups, while plunging others into apoplectic fury.</p>
<p>Do you like running rampage as Hela, goddess of death? Was that <em>you</em> who shot me full of crows on Klyntar last night? Well, how does 25 points off your base health suit you? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Screw you too.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hela is one of many who’ve succumbed to the nerf. NetEase’s Thanos-style fingersnap has also made the Incredible Hulk less incredible: according to the full patch notes, it drops the Indestructible Guard gamma shield value for Hero Hulk from 250 to 200. Somewhat counter-intuitively, HawkEye has undergone a rework to make him less effective with a bow - “decreasing the medium-long range damage capability, reducing the threatening combat radius, and slightly improving the close combat resistance for the avenging archer”.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>’s survivability has also been cut: the patch reduces “the additional health provided to self after refreshing Vibranium Marks with Spirit Rend from 40 to 30, and the upper limit of additional health provided from 120 to 75.”</p>
<p>For every loser there is at least one winner, naturally. Black Widow “was very much in need of optimization when evaluating the release experience of her abilities as well as a slightly increase to the threat of her ultimate ability.” Her Edge Dancer, Fleet Foot and Electro-Plasma Explosion abilities have all been juiced up.</p><p>In other news, Sea king Namor is better at throwing eggs, and Squirrel Girl’s Squirrel Tsunami has undergone a sinister evolution. The tsunami’s component squirrels will now “rush towards the nearest enemy after bouncing instead of bouncing randomly”, though the tsunami’s overall health has been halved. No longer shall the laws of chance save you from being set upon by berserking nutcrackers. These are dreadful times indeed. </p>
<p>You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">here</a>. Again, all this is a warm-up for Season 1, which introduces noble stretchyman Mr Fantastic, see-through lady Invisible Woman, prancing fireboy Human Torch, and grouchy rockdude The Thing. They’ll arrive as part of a season storyline in which Dr Doom and Dracula have conspired to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjdMYyjnmks">switch off the sun</a>, Mr Burns presumably being unavailable for recruitment at the time. Leaks further suggest that robonemesis Ultron is on the way to the line-up too.</p>
<p>Here’s a press release rundown:</p>
<blockquote><p>Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon’s orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures. With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals! </p></blockquote>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to steam up Steam, ranking at 6th most played at the time of this article's publication. Our Ed Thorn was ambivalent in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">his season 0 launch review</a>, summarising it as “like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, if Overwatch was overcomplex and frequented Comic Con”. He found much to like about the abilities and presentation, but argued that the spread of somewhat interchangeable hero designs transformed matches into “slightly formless blenders”. Are you still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the Christmas break, I took a brief hiatus from reporting on every time a Total War developer breathes or spills tea on their shirt. The year ended, the world did not, and no Thanquol DLC was announced, but I did miss what I reckon is the strongest hint they’ve yet freely given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 is both real and due an announcement very soon.

<p>(I want to use the phrase "here’s the skinny" more. I also want one of those little hats with the band for the card that says ‘press’ on it. These aren’t the same as ‘pressman’s hats’, which were made out of folded newspaper to protect print workers from detritus. <a href="https://deafprinters.com/files/fullsize/8f474c90d0294a96c4c9eb1efb1f11ee.jpg">Here’s some instructions on how to make one</a>. I wonder what the online media equivalent is? Tinfoil lined with redundancy letters, probably. Speaking of tinfoil…)</p>
<blockquote><p>If a future Total War game, thematically, requires blood then we will include it within the base game without the need for a separate purchase. This might mean an increase in our age ratings for future titles and how we potentially market our games, but we want the franchise to be as thrilling, immersive and authentic as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>For context, Total War games have long shipped without blood effects, dismemberment, and other such violences, instead selling optional DLC ‘blood packs’ for a few pounds or dollars. The company line on this has always been that it’s to ensure a lower age rating, although much of the community has maintained it’s a case of squeezing out some extra revenue. Personally, I’ve always been torn. Extra animation work is naturally development work, but the line between what development work counts as ‘extra’ enough to merit charging separately seems mainly a matter of good faith: a case of ‘we’ll know where the line is when someone crosses it’.</p><p>Anyway, the blog statement feels to me about as close as you can get to saying “We’re making 40k” without actually saying it, although I understand how that might sound spurious if you don’t follow the company closely. The first thing I’d point to is that if CA have made the decision to potentially lose customers or otherwise limit sales by accepting a higher age rating, then they’ve likely got a game on their hands they’re confident will sell gangbusters regardless. Between the comparatively mainstream success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Henry Cavill’s 40k project with Amazon</a>, 40k currently feels like a safer, more culturally relevant bet, more so than even Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars - settings largely coasting on nostalgia rather than recent successes, outliers like Andor aside.</p>
<p>To me, CA dangling the prospect of bloodier Total War games that are marketed to an older audience is about as close as you can get to saying "We’re making 40k" without actually saying it. Historical Total Wars can reasonably exist in a sort of sterile quasi-documentary framing, suitable for hogging good, Christian CPUs and basing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Commanders">old British game shows</a> around. But the idea of a game <em>thematically requiring</em> blood feels like a strong hint. It doesn’t rule out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">Total Star Wars</a> as the next fantasy offering, but I don’t think it's referring to Star Wars either, a setting largely able to get by on laser burns and characters dramatically falling off things. Lord Of The Rings gets by on characters dramatically climbing up things, and also needs a good dose of gore if they go with Peter Jackson’s lingering splatter tendencies. But I’d say the only setting that is both a likely contender for an entry at all, and absolutely requires gore to even be recognisable, is 40k.</p>
<p>Not that the blog would be enough to go on in isolation, but it does feel significant in the context of CA’s increasingly collaborative relationship with Games Workshop. The Khorne section of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC marked the first appearance of units from Warhammer Fantasy’s End Times period in the series, but even as far back as the the Vampire Coast DLC, we got an original character - not to mention Kislev and Grand Cathay. I think it’s fair to say that GW view CA’s work as not just an interpretation of their own worlds, but an extension, and that they'd trust this developer with the keys to the 41st Millennium - not that they've been incredibly picky in the past.</p>
<p>Also, Total Warhammer 40k will make all the money in the world. I’m not a business analyst but I did get out a tenner from the cash machine several months ago for emergencies and it’s still in my wallet, so I think I know a thing or two about finance. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyenas">Hyenas</a>, I reckon Creative Assembly would quite like all the money in the world.</p><p>So that’s the making of the thing, how about the timeline? Well, it does sound like we’ll see a couple of bigger announcements this year. "We hope to unveil some new projects too - we’ll share more when we’re ready at the tail-end of next year," reads the blog.</p>
<p>So, there’s my reasoning, pick it apart at your leisure. Elsewhere in the blog, vice president of Total War (banger title) Roger Collum also announces that Shadows Of Change will be getting divided into three parts to match the subsequent expansions, and that Total War will be ditching the launcher. This last point sounds superfluous or maybe even just a bad idea, since it works well as a mod manager, but this does follow the trend of companies like Ubisoft no longer pushing their own storefronts and such in favour of offering a seamless, Steam-ful experience. Oh, and there’s a bloody Kislev rework coming too. Huzzah!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine wanted developer Irrational Games to continue, and didn't expect publisher Take-Two to shut it down.</p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">Levine announced he was "winding down" the studio</a> to focus on a "different kind of game", meaning all but 15 Irrational employees were laid off.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Edge Magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/bioshock-infinite-may-not-have-been-the-thing-i-wanted-but-that-doesnt-necessarily-mean-it-wasnt-the-thing-the-audience-wanted-ken-levine-talks-edge-through-his-collected-works/">GamesRadar</a>), Levine has stated his intention was for Irrational to continue but the decision to close was "made at a corporate level".</p>

<p>Levine discussed his time at Irrational following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> and how this led to him parting ways with the studio.</p>
<p>"The closure of Irrational was complicated," he said. "I felt out of my depth in the role. You're this creative person, and all of a sudden, as your vision increases of what you want to do, you have to become a manager, in a way that you don't necessarily have any training or skill in. My mental health was a mess during Infinite. I was stressed out, a lot of personal things were going on in my life at the time, and then my parents both died. I just couldn't do it any more, and I didn't think I had the team's confidence."</p>
<p>That's when he left, leaving the studio in the hands of Take-Two.</p>
<p>"So my intention was to go and say, 'Look, I just need to go start a new thing, and Irrational should continue'," he said. "That's why I didn't maintain the name Irrational. I thought they were going to continue. But it wasn't my company - I sold the company, so I worked for Take-Two, and the studio was theirs.</p><p>"The decision was made at a corporate level that they didn't think they should continue with the studio as a going concern. My feeling was that it probably would have made sense. Take-Two did a BioShock remaster - that would have been a good title for Irrational to get their head around, build a new creative director structure, and then build off of that once they had the confidence to do the next BioShock game. I don't think I was in any state to be a good leader for the team."</p>
<p>Levine described trying to make the studio closure "the least painful layoff we could possibly do", but he didn't feel comfortable leading the team when his next project would have a long period of research and development. "The problem is - and you see this problem with big studios - what do you do with 300 people when you're going to have a multiple-year R&amp;D project?" he said.</p>
<p>Still, a "good chunk" of laid off developers returned to work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">yet-to-be-revealed next BioShock game</a>.</p>
<p>Levine, meanwhile, will this year release Judas with his new studio Ghost Story Games, which he previously described as being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">built from "narrative Lego"</a>.</p>
<p>Levine also discussed with Edge the development of BioShock Infinite, which he pushed to make more action-oriented. That led to the Sky-Lines - something he would have developed further in a potential sequel.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the Sky-Lines were so expensive to build that we couldn't build enough space to support the feature," he said. "The team did a great job of bringing that feature to life - there was just not enough of it in the game for it to really land.</p><p>"If we had done a sequel to Infinite, I think I would have spent more time on that. That thing was built on Unreal Engine 3, which is not an outdoor engine. Sky-Lines were a lot of spit and chewing gum and prayers. Players would be surprised how much of games are put together with spit and chewing gum - even the best ones that have worked really well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">Judas was last seen at Sony's PlayStation State of Play this time last year</a> and is yet to receive a firm release date beyond 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the daily Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill is focused on a screenshot reportedly grabbed by a GameStop employee from the internal list of upcoming product releases. The screen grab, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a few hours ago on the Switch subreddit, shows a JoyCon Charger Grip for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The most interesting tidbit is, however, the confirmation that the new console will use Samsung's microSD Express format. As you can see in the screenshot, the internal SKU list shows Switch 2 microSD cards of 256GB and 512GB cuts, priced at $49.99 and $84.99, respectively.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">Switch 2 SKU’s found in system today!!</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Opposite-Chemistry96/">u/Opposite-Chemistry96</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/">Switch</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We first&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in February 2024</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 might use the microSD Express format. Back then, Samsung boasted that this was an industry-first product whose development resulted from</span> a collaboration with a mysterious 'customer' to create a custom product. That product might very well be the Nintendo Switch 2 game cards.</p>
<p>Hangu Sohn, Vice President of the Memory Brand Product Biz Team at Samsung Electronics, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>With our two new microSD cards, Samsung has provided effective solutions to address the growing demands of mobile computing and on-device AI. Despite their tiny size, these memory cards deliver powerful SSD-like performance and capacity to help users get more out of demanding modern and future applications.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Samsung's microSD Express cards can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, or 1.4 times faster than SATA SSDs (which can reach up to 560 MB/s) and more than four times faster compared to traditional UHS-1 memory cards (capped at 200 MB/s).</p>
<p>Nowadays, games require an SSD, whether on consoles or PCs, due to the high data streaming needs of large virtual worlds. While the Nintendo Switch 2 won't focus on high-end technical advancements, it couldn't be left behind if it wanted to get as many ports as possible from third-party developers.</p>
<p>It's another small piece in the Switch 2 puzzle. Nintendo is still holding off on the official reveal, but they promised it will happen within this quarter.</p>

            <p>
Disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have shut down production across Hollywood, impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects.
</p>
<p>
Five people have so far been confirmed to have died and more than 130,000 have been evacuated as the city's worst ever wildfires continue to spread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5y81zyp1ext">BBC News</a> reported today that the famous Sunset Boulevard now lies "in ruins", as flames approach the city's iconic Hollywood sign.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/la-fires-halt-production-fallout-greys-anatomy-1236269978/">Variety</a> reported on the impact of the fires on LA's production industry, with all major studios suspending work. 
</p>
<p>
Amazon's Fallout season 2 had been due to film within the Santa Clarita area this week.
</p>
<p>
NBCUniversal, CBS, Disney and Warner Bros. have also shut down their studios, impacting the filming of other shows such as Hacks, Ted, Suits: LA, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy and the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
</p>
<p>
While in most cases there is no immediate threat to the studios themselves, the LA Fire Department has revoked all filming permits due to air quality being deemed dangerous to health, and the need to keep roads open for emergency vehicles. 
</p>
<p>
This week's disaster has prompted criticism of LA's mayor Karen Bass, who recent cut the city's fire department budget, and renewed calls for a greater focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-were-turning-our-attention-to-gaming-and-the-climate-crisis">impacts of climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November</a>, and was due to resume this week after a filming break over Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
Fallout's first season was a huge hit when it aired last year, with more than 65 million viewers in its first 16 days - Amazon's second-biggest launch ever, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. A week after its debut, Amazon quickly announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">the series would return for more episodes</a>.

            <p>Someone deep in the bowels of the internet once betwittered that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> was "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-summer-car">My Summer Car</a> of RPGs". The joke stuck with me enough to try the car mechanic sim when it was released into early access <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/my-summer-car-early-access-review">back in 2016</a>. I didn't know it would take another nine years to bring this ambitiously hostile Finnish life simulator to a full release. But here it is. If you want a deeply confounding game about putting an old banger together piece by excruciating piece, while periodically sweating the grime off your body in a cramped sauna, then I can think of no better time waster. My Summer Car 1.0 came out yesterday, and a new trailer came with it.</p>

<p>It's a wonderfully leery game. You have a button to piss, and another button dedicated to giving people the middle finger. You can get into rally races and mess up everything in the car you've spent the last few hours fixing. If you are emotionally broken and fall instantly in love with games that do not care about you as a person, then you will probably be head-over-heels for this.</p>
<p>Yet it is at least <em>slightly</em> more forgiving compared to its original release. You start with more food than a single pack of sausages, for example, and car parts no longer wear down over time but last forever. There's also a bus to prevent you getting stranded in the middle of nowhere when you run out of fuel - something that happened to me at least once in early access. </p><p>Other stuff has changed. There's a stress meter now, a moped to drive, and many new neighbours, farms, and factories to visit throughout the map. This includes at least one dude who'll gamble with you over a card game. I'm getting all this from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDQBYcWoLEA">a handy video</a> which lists all the differences, great and small. I haven't actually played the latest version. I am too afraid. Reviewing this scrappy monster is a task I both dread and crave. </p>
<p>Developers AmisTech Games once <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/2220784205327276971?l=english">quietly mentioned</a> plans for a snowy sequel called My Winter Car. Getting the battered old summer beaut out the door was the priority, but the dev has recently confirmed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/516750/view/514071031546120457?snr=1_5_9_">an update post</a> that the sequel is still in "active development". If you're really impatient, there's <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/2563">a wintry mod that jumped the gun</a>, adding snowy weather and other cold elements to the game. </p>
<p>If you're still wondering if this sim is as unusual as it seems from that trailer, you can get a taste of its bleak wackiness from various patch notes over the last nine years. Here are some of the best:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>You might now die from urinating into wrong places</li>
<li>Grandma might now want to get a ride to the church</li>
<li>Grandma now pays less if you have a prison tattoo</li>
<li>If Player passes out from drunkenness while having active Jail sentence he is transported back to Jail</li>
<li>Added TV to Jail</li>
<li>Cousin might now end up as your cellmate</li>
<li>Hangover is now best to be dealt with drinking alcohol</li>
<li>Jumping up from lowest crouch position is now an exercise method</li>
<li>Added lottery</li>
<li>Urine now accumulates if player keeps urinating on the house floor</li>
<li>Added Teletext to TV, use remote control to operate</li>
<li>You can now grill food on top of a hot Satsuma engine</li>
<li>Moose meat can be eaten after it has been grilled, similarly to fish</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>And if you're still not convinced, marvel at <a href="http://www.amistech.com/msc/">the developer's website</a>. It is a thing of horrific beauty.</p></div>

<p>Balatro’s best Seeds allow you to experience the exhilarating moments of high-scoring hands more frequently. They are broken, overpowered Seeds with the potential to rack up ridiculous scores. Plus, you can conquer the later stages of Balatro’s insanely tough Endurance Mode with the right setup.</p>



<p>I find the first Blind to be the calm before the storm. It’s you, a default stack of 52 equally distributed cards (depending on your chosen deck), and a small points total to hit. You can throw out a couple of Flushes, one-shot the Blind with a Straight, or begin with a Royal Flush. Then, the Shop throws one random assortment of goodies after another at you. This is how a conventional run of Balatro is.</p>



<p>In a Seeded run, everything is different, so let’s delve into the awesomeness of a Seeded run and why they’re so fun in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-of-2024-best-new-indie-games-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best indie game of 2024</a>.</p>

<p>Ignore my measly efforts above, below are some of the <strong>best Balatro Seeds in the world</strong>. They are tried and tested and can produce scintillating results taking you into stupidly high Antes and Round totals. You’ve come to the right place if you want scores to break the game.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-a-seeded-run-in-balatro">What is a Seeded Run in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>A Seeded Run allows you to replicate a previously played game of Balatro by following the exact moves as the Seeded run’s initial playthrough.</strong></p>



<p>Why would you do this I hear you ask? Because it’s <em>fun</em>, and certain runs are filed under “Seen only to be believed.” Meaning, the set of Jokers and circumstances during a run were almost miraculous. Excessive Chip tallies, outrageous Multipliers, and enough fire beneath the points values to melt the North Pole in seconds.</p>



<p>Your entire run is predetermined if you follow the steps of the player who registered the initial run. Doing this is difficult if you don’t have the precise steps though. You are bound to deviate, but a dreamy run lies dormant if you play your cards right.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-seeded-run-in-balatro">How to Play Seeded Run in Balatro</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The Ante gets out of hand very quickly. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Enter a correct Seed Code on Balatro’s “Enter Seed” screen and press to begin the game.</strong></p>



<p>It’s simple to do, and I’ve broken down the process with an easy step-by-step guide below:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Balatro’s home screen.</li>



<li>Click <strong>Play</strong>.</li>



<li>Select <strong>New Run</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on the <strong>Seeded Run</strong> circle next to “Play.”</li>



<li>If it now has a Red Tick, click <strong>Enter Seed</strong>.</li>



<li>Correctly enter a Seed—such as the nine I gave you above.</li>



<li>Hit <strong>Play </strong>to begin.</li>
</ol>

<p>Breaking Balatro is one of the joys offered by developer LocalThunk. Share your best runs below, and if possible, throw in some more Seeds, explain what you did, and they might end up in our guide in a future update!</p>

            <p>
The ongoing deluge of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks continues today with purported retail listings for Switch 2 MicroSD Express cards, a report that Nintendo's new console won't be compatible with the Switch 1 dock, and speculation over the new handheld's mysterious optical sensor.
</p>
<p>
Let's begin with those MicroSD Express listings, which look to be have been spotted by a GameStop employee and posted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">reddit</a>. These include Switch 2-branded MicroSD Express card variants in the already-existing <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORwmO">256GB</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YLvk">512GB</a> sizes, which sell for around £40 and £50 respectively. 
</p>
<p>
SD Express is a newer standard for SD cards with much faster transfer speeds, enabling performance not dissimilar to SSDs. If the Switch 2 is indeed adopting this standard, it'll be interesting to see how the console performs with multiplatform games versus current gen consoles with SSD memory.
</p>
<p>
Moving on to word of compatibility with the Switch 1 dock, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-didnt-expect-this-much-media-attention-we-saw-genkis-ces-nintendo-switch-2-mockup-heres-what-they-had-to-say">IGN</a> has been told by Switch 2 accessories manufacturer Genki that Nintendo's new console won't fit the older base.
</p>
<p>
While the Switch 2 itself can physically fit within the Switch 1 dock, "indentations" in its design have been added to ensure users don't actually plug it in. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">The Verge</a> has been told by Genki CEO Eddie Tsai that the Switch 2's mysterious new optical sensor - located on its Joy-Con - could offer mouse-like functionality when paired with another attachment. The concept sounds similar to Lenovo's Legion Go handheld, which also features Joy-Con like controllers.
</p>
<p>
When paired with a base, the Legion Go controllers can stand upright and act like a vertically-aligned mouse - almost akin to a joystick. 
</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The Lenovo Legion Go, with vertical Joy-Con-style controller, right. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Lenovo</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Nintendo has so far kept schtum on all of its Switch 2 plans, other than stating the new console will be backwards compatible with Switch 1 games and will be fully unveiled before 31st March. 
</p>
<p>
The company has not responded to comment on the now-rampant Switch 2 leaks - many of which have been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-leaks-turn-into-deluge-as-dummy-units-shown-at-ces">fuelled by third-party accessory manufacturers who claim to have access to the console's final design</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-tactics">Gears Tactics</a> and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory developers Splash Damage have cancelled Transformers: Reactivate, the Hasbro action game they announced in 2022. They will also be "scaling down to refocus our efforts on other projects", and "a number of roles across the studio are now potentially at risk of redundancy".</p><!--more-->
<p>All that's from a <a href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485">TwiX post</a> in which Splash Damage describe Hasbro as "an incredible and supportive partner", and offer some, by now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">sadly overfamiliar</a> sentiments about this not being a decision they took "lightly". The post doesn't give any reason for the cancellation, beyond this being a "difficult time" for the studio.</p>
<p>There's been little to share about Transformers: Reactivate since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gears-tactics-studio-splash-damage-are-making-a-transformers-action-game">reveal</a>, but the first cinematic trailer (below) paints the picture of a more soulful and seemingly, first-person action game in which the Autobots (good guy Transformers) fight a "Legion" of invading aliens. It would have supported co-op and yes, you would have been able to switch between bot and vehicular forms.</p>

<p>The trailer vibe suggests a grimmer experience than you'd generally get from Transformers, with apocalyptic urban scenes filmed at pedestrian level, and in-game technology that reminds me of Gears Of War. Speaking as a fan of Splash Damage's adaptation work with Gears Tactics, I approve of all this. Shortly after announcement, a social media user <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/transformers-reactivate-leak-playable-characters-starscream-soundwave-2014669/">leaked screens of a 2018 development build</a> which include several possible playable characters, straddling the Autobot and Decepticon (bad guy Transformers) divide: Starscream, Slipstream, Hotrod, Soundwave, Sunstreaker, Ironhide and Windblade.</p><p>Alongside the game's announcement back in 2022, Splash Damage revealed the acquisition of Derby-based developers Bulkhead, creators of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battalion-1944">Battalion 1944</a> and The Turing Test. Bulkhead have been working on the Transformers game alongside Wardogs, a combined-arms FPS with strategy game elements. I interviewed members of Bulkhead many moons ago, and thought they were a good bunch. </p>
<p>Transformers aside, Splash Damage are currently known to be working on <a href="https://www.splashdamage.com/news/announcing-project-astrid/">Project Astrid</a>, an open world survival shooter set in an original universe, with input from streamers Sacriel and shroud.</p>
<p>It's possible the layoffs have to do with wider restructuring at Splash Damage's overall parent company Tencent, who were recently <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-rebukes-layoff-and-restructuring-rumours-but-admits-changes-at-the-top-of-the-company">rumoured</a> to be making significant reductions across their organisation. Tencent announced <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/">layoffs at Sumo Group in June last year</a> followed by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-confirms-layoffs-at-sharkmob-london">layoffs at Sharkmob London in November</a>.</p>
<p>A few game developers have reacted to the Transformers: Reactivate cancellation on social media. "I enjoyed my time working on this, my heart goes out to all the talented Devs at splash &amp; bulkhead working on this," <a href="https://x.com/IdreeceHadi/status/1877048039262634179">wrote</a> Idreece Hadi, Cloud Imperium level designer and former Bulkhead game designer. "I hope you all get something in this troubling time, hopefully soon the industry gets some positive news this is terrible."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>On the cusp of the top ten, we have a selection of games that mix the known quantities – where we’ve had hands ons, are seeing sequels, and have firm release dates – and the less known projects, where the air of intrigue goes someway to ramping up our anticipation for what they might bring.</p>
<p>You know what you’re getting with the next game from Hazelight and Josef Fares, for example, and Split Fiction is coming out soon, but when the last we saw of Marvel 1943 was a cinematics heavy story trailer last summer, can we really trust that the game will hit in 2025? Well, that’s half the fun of these lists, isn’t it?</p>
<h2>15 – Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 4th February 2025</em></p>


<p>It’s been a good seven years since the original Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and fans of this historical RPG have &nbsp;been waiting a long, long time for Henry and Sir Hans’ journey to continue. There’s less than a month to wait, you’ll be glad to hear, with our duo journeying through medieval Bohemia in the early 1400s to deliver a message at the start of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>

<p>Things…. don’t quite go to plan, and they’re swept up in the problems of kings and wars that are increasingly affecting the region. This grand sequel will feature two main areas, with the Bohemian paradise of the opening juxtaposed with the city of Kuttenberg and all of the political intrigue that that can bring. Don’t worry if you don’t remember or haven’t played the original, as Warhorse promise this will be a good starting point, even if it’s a direct narrative continuation.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">We got to go hands on Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> last summer, experiencing the game’s opening and a snippet of the action once Henry reached the big city.</p>
<h2>14 – Mafia: The Old Country</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – Summer 2025</em></p>
<p>The Mafia series is going back to where it all began, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> tracing its narrative steps back to the early 1900s and before the crime families of Sicily saw their influence spread through the emigration of Italians to the United States.</p>

<p>You’ll be cast as Enzo Favara, having to prove their worth to the Cosa Nostra, fighting to survive through the brutal underworld of organised crime. Enzo’s already survived labor in the sulphur mines, and now has a chance (in a twisted way) to find a better life for himself by working for Don Torrisi’s crime family, doing whatever it takes to gain and retain favour along the way.</p>
<p>The game looks fantastic from the snippets of action that we’ve seen, and this is absolutely one to keep an eye on in 2025.</p>
<h2>13 – The Outer Worlds 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> has <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-outer-worlds-2-is-coming-to-ps5-as-well-as-pc-and-xbox-in-2025/">chucked Xbox exclusivity out the airlock</a>, about as ceremoniously as you could yeet yourself into the nearest star in the original. The sequel promises to do all the usual sequelly things with more action, more weapons, more possibilities, and more better graphics.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Outer Worlds 2: First Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I_rvTE-3S4c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will very much follow in the tone and style of the original, but promises to go bigger and broader on pretty much every level. There’s the new colony to explore in Arcadia, which is the home of skip drive technology, and which you explore as a new Earth Directorate agent trying to figure out if it’s responsible for all the big and scary rifts that are threatening the whole galaxy.</p>
<h2>12 – Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</h2>
<p><em>Platforms TBC – 2025</em></p>
<p>With a story penned by Amy Hennig (best known for her time at Naughty Dog with the PS3 Uncharted trilogy), and an intriguing time period, a lot of people are looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</a>. That said, it’s been quite a while since we last heard something about this title. Heck, we don’t even have a formal confirmation of platforms yet!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra | Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lb2wwEx6DVw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With switching perspectives between Captain America, Black Panther, Nanali, and Gabriel Jones as they look to thwart Hydra’s plans at the heights of WW2, you can expect the gameplay and tone to switch as you jump between characters. We’ll hopefully see the game in action soon, if it’s still coming out later this year.</p>

<p>Split Fiction sees Mio and Zoe – named after Fares two daughters – as two aspiring writers who are seemingly conned into feeding their stories into an evil AI machine. While AI stealing human beings content is worryingly close to reality, the game sees Mio and Zoe pulled into the machine, and their two stories, one fantasy and one sci-fi mixed and merged, with the duo jumping between the two from level to level. Each level will introduce new mechanics, blending fantasy and sci-fi tropes together in some intriguing ways. We can’t wait!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-over-%E2%80%93-we-know-who-launched-the-first-nukes-in-fallout.1077774/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-first-nukes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><strong>(Originally covered October 2023)</strong></p>



<p>It’s one of the longest-standing points of debate in the history of the franchise. In Fallout, who launched the first nuke? There have been many theories that surfaced over the years, but owing to the nature of the war and how it all unfolded in the Fallout universe, a definitive answer was never provided to who shot first in Fallout.</p>



<p>Now, the co-creator of Fallout – Tim Cain – has made it clear during an interview who was responsible for kick-starting The Great War by firing off those first missiles.</p>



<p>So, who dropped the bombs first in Fallout? Let’s find out what Tim said.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-and-the-first-nuke-launched-in-fallout-was-by">And The First Nuke Launched in Fallout Was By…</h2>



<p>Fallout’s lore is incredibly dense and probably more extensive than almost any game that exists today. There is a twenty-five-year history wrapped up in the franchise that spans several main releases, each of which has served to expand the game’s lore immeasurably. From factions to locations and key events to inventions, the backstory to Fallout is nothing short of monumental. </p>



<p>And now, one of the biggest mysteries of the Fallout universe has been settled.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17EqWDn7gyc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In an interview</a>, Tim Cain spoke about all things Fallout, and for a brief moment, he touched upon the very origins of The Great War. He said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The reason we got nuked is: bio-weapons were illegal and somehow China found out we were doing FEV. And they were like, ‘You have to stop it.’ And we went, ‘Okay’. But all we did is move it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the Fallout world, the FEV is the Forced Evolutionary Virus, a concoction that was once supposed to be a medical marvel but ultimately resulted in the creation of horrifically mutated creatures. </p>



<p>That’s the confirmation from the horse’s mouth – the creator himself. It was China that shot first in the Fallout universe because America was creating bio-weapons and refused to stop when asked even when geopolitical tensions were as rocky as they could have ever been.</p>



<p>Can we put that to bed now? Who dropped the first bombs in Fallout? It was <strong>China</strong>.</p>



<p>But should I mention that the Fallout TV show, which premiered in April 2024, seems to be headed down a contradictory path, suggesting that it was Vault-Tec that fired first? That’s yet to be confirmed, but it was <strong>heavily </strong>alluded to in the show’s first season.</p>



<p>What do you think?</p>

            <p>Marvel Rivals Season 1 launches later this week and will bring significant balance changes.</p>
<p>The online hero shooter has been in Season 0 since its release last month, and despite a perceived dominance of certain characters, NetEase's analysis reveals "significant shifts in team compositions" and "a vibrant diversity of lineups".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">patch notes</a> continue: "However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield."</p>

<p>As such, Season 1 will bring various balance changes to ensure a "richer, more engaging, and diverse" experience, although there will be no extensive changes to Team-Up abilities - redesigns and adjustments will arrive in Season 2.</p>
<p>The new season brings nerfs to some particularly dominant characters: Hulk's Indestructible Guard shield value has been reduced; Hawkeye's medium-long range damage has been decreased; and Hela has had her base health reduced.</p>
<p>At the other end of the spectrum, Black Widow has been buffed with increased range of her ultimate ability, Namor's egg-throwing will be more accurate, and Storm has received an overall increase to her damage capability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, NetEase has released a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/">Hero Hot List</a> to show the most frequently chosen heroes across PC and console in both Quickplay and Competitive modes.</p>
<p>In Quickplay, Jeff the Land Shark tops both lists surprising nobody - he was even the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-winter-celebration-features-splatoon-esque-arcade-mode-starring-jeff-the-land-shark">star of a Splatoon-style arcade mode over Christmas</a>.</p>
<p>In Competitive mode, Luna Snow is top for PC players while Cloak &amp; Dagger is top for console players. Black Widow and Storm are the least popular, hence the incoming buffs.</p>
<p>Season 1 will be released on Friday, 10th January.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-fantastic-four-arrive-in-marvel-rivals-this-week-as-part-of-vampiric-first-season">new season will bring the Fantastic Four as playable heroes</a>, although players are concerned the design of the Invisible Woman (Sue Storm) is too similar to Dagger, making them hard to tell apart in the heat of battle. Skins will likely be used to make them stand out.</p>

			<p>Shadow of the Colossus is a name we haven't heard in a long time. The PlayStation 2 action/adventure masterpiece originally developed by Team Ico was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/shadow-of-the-colossus-a-classic-remade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remade for the PlayStation 4 in 2018 by Bluepoint</a>, but beyond that, the PlayStation IP has lied dormant. Team Ico is no more; Lead Game Designer Fumito Ueda left after The Last Guardian to found genDESIGN, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-ico-director-fumito-ueda-new-unnamed-project-revealed-with-a-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased their new project</a> at The Game Awards 2024.</p>
<p>Not many of you may remember that a film adaptation was announced all the way back in April 2009 by Sony Pictures. In 2012, news broke that Josh Trank would direct the movie, but that changed in September 2014, when it was shared that 'Mom' director Andrés Muschietti would direct the film instead.</p>
<p>For over ten years, there's been no news at all, leading many to assume the Shadow of the Colossus adaptation was essentially dead. However, Muschietti has finally provided an update in an interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tugk5mzMHqM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with Argentinian YouTube Channel Radio TU</a>.</p>
<p>The director, who has since released the acclaimed horror movies It/It Chapter Two and the way less successful The Flash, said he loves the franchise and is still working on the project. Muschetti also confirmed there's a script he likes and did not hide the reality that the budget still needs to be secured. He'd like to get a big budget to make the Shadow of the Colossus movie as immersive as possible, but a film production studio needs to be convinced first. Here's the full translated quote:</p>
<p><em>Well, Shadow of the Colossus is a game that I absolutely loved when it came out, and I played it several times. Plus, it's one of those things that I keep going back to. I'm not really a big gamer, especially since I started working, you know? The free time you have shrinks, so there have been only a few games that I've really gotten into since then.</em></p>
<p><em>I started making movies, but Shadow of the Colossus feels like a masterpiece. It's a project we've been developing for over 10 years. After 'Mom,' I kept busy too, you know? It wasn't a film that came out right away because of everything going on in Hollywood. Basically, you start developing a project, and for some reason, it gets delayed, or something pops up in the middle. It's like juggling plates to stay afloat in that industry; you have to keep a few spinning at once.</em></p>
<p><em>People don't really see it that way because they get hooked right away when they hear it. They think, "Oh, it's coming soon!" But actually, going public with a story like this has more to do with the whole vibe around the movie's release than with the actual chance of it getting made. So yeah, it's in development, and in the meantime, I did some stuff.</em></p>
<p><em>It's a project that's been in the works for years, and now there's finally a chance to make it happen. It's still in development, but I really love this movie. There's a script I really like, and we'll see if it ends up being the next project. It's definitely not abandoned; it's still alive and kicking. Plus, you have to keep things in perspective, you know? The realism of a project really depends on how much money a studio can give me to make this movie. Unfortunately, there are factors that aren’t about your passion or desire to make it; it’s about how many people are going to watch this film and how popular a property like this is today. </em></p>
<p><em>Sure, Shadow of the Colossus is definitely a cult classic, but to make a good movie, there’s a studio that looks at the numbers and says... Well, how much interest is there in making a movie like this to give the director 200 million dollars or 150 or 100? There are different versions of this film. Personally, I want 200; I'll make it right! But that's just one of the factors to consider, and it's something that keeps fluctuating and being tested. It's still in development, and I'd love to work on it.</em></p>
<p>As we've been covering, gaming IPs are a prime target for both movie and TV adaptations. Sony itself, owner of the Shadow of the Colossus franchise, is leading the charge; earlier this week, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-to-adapt-horizon-and-helldivers-to-film-the-last-of-us-tv-season-2-launches-in-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two new films based on Horizon and Helldivers. However, those are hot intellectual properties that have just received new games; the world crafted by Team Ico, on the other hand, hasn't had a new installment since twenty years ago. As such, Sony might not be willing to bet big on it, which is why Muschietti is still having challenges with securing the budget for his vision.</p>
<p>We'll definitely keep an eye on any potential updates on the project, though. Stay tuned.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> has submitted a lengthy defence in response to lawsuits filed last year in which the families of those killed in the 2022 Uvalde school shooting accused the publisher of "grooming" the 18-year-old perpetrator through Call of Dury.
</p>
<p>
19 children and two teachers were killed in the attack on Robb Elementary School in May 2022, while 17 others were injured. Families of those killed during the tragedy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uvalde-school-shooting-victims-sue-activision-claiming-its-the-most-prolific-marketer-of-weapons-in-the-us">later filed lawsuits in Texas and California</a> against Activision (after it emerged the shooter had played Call of Duty), alongside Instagram owner Meta and gun manufacturer Daniel Defense.
</p>
<p>
"This three-headed monster," the lawsuit alleged, "knowingly exposed [the perpetrator] to the weapon, conditioned him to see it as a tool to solve his problems and trained him to use it." At the time of last May's filing, Activision called the shooting "horrendous and heartbreaking", but noted "millions of people around the world enjoy video games without turning to horrific acts".
</p>
<p>
Now though, as reported by journalist Stephen Totilo in his <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, Activision has formally submitted its initial defence, spanning nearly 150 pages of legal documentation filed last December. In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813228593/Activision-s-direct-legal-reply-to-the-Uvalde-families-lawsuit-via-Game-File">six-page direct response to the California lawsuit</a>, the publisher has denied "each and every allegation contained in the Complaint", claiming, among other things, a lack of causation between Call of Duty and the shooting. Totilo notes the publisher has also asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis of California's anti-SLAPP laws, which are designed to prevent the abuse of the legal system against a defendant's free speech.
</p><p>
"Call of Duty tells complex stories that explore the real-world combat scenarios that soldiers face in modern warfare," Activision wrote in a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813227428/Activision-s-defense-in-Call-of-Duty-Uvalde-lawsuit-via-Game-File">separate 35-page filing</a>. "There can be no doubt Call of Duty is expressive and fully protected by the First Amendment... By bringing a laundry list of causes of action against Activision premised on allegedly dangerous 'hyper-realistic content' in the Call of Duty video games played by the perpetrator who committed heinous acts of violence, the Complaint runs headfirst into this overriding constitutional principle."
</p>
<p>
Activision's submissions also include a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813230017/Declaration-of-Matthew-Thomas-Payne-in-Mata-et-al-vs-Meta-Activision-Microsoft-via-Game-File">35-page declaration from Notre Dame media studies professor Matthew Thomas Payne</a>, arguing the Call of Duty series "flows from the same military realism tradition that has been explored for decades in critically acclaimed war movies and television shows" - and is thus far from the "training camp for mass shooters" in which "teenage boys learn to kill with frightening skill and ease" described in the Uvalde families' lawsuit.
</p>
<p>
The publisher's defence is also supported by a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/813229303/Call-of-Duty-s-chief-Patrick-Kelly-s-declaration-for-Mata-vs-Activision-via-Game-File">38-page submission from Call of Duty head of creative Patrick Kelly</a>, which goes into significant detail regarding the design and creation of the series. This is the same document that revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-cost-an-eye-popping-700m-to-make">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's eye-popping $700m budget</a>, and includes a wealth of information Activision's lawyers could potentially use to counter the various claims made in the Uvalde families' legal filing.
</p>
<p>
For instance, while the claimant's suit alleges the Uvalde shooter learned about the gun he used from the loading screen of 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, Kelly highlights two key points. Firstly, he says the generic assault rifle depicted in the image had been deliberately anonymised to ensure it did not feature identifiers that could link it to any particular firearm manufacturer. Secondly, he notes that by the time the perpetrator played the game in November 2021, the loading screen had been changed and would likely not have been seen.
</p><p>
There's plenty more detail in Activision's submitted documentation, and Totilo has a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/activision-uvalde-call-of-duty-defense">considerably expanded breakdown of the publisher's arguments</a> in his paywalled newsletter. The Uvalde families have until late February to respond to Activision's filings, and the publisher can then reply in April. As Totilo notes, if the case goes to trial, it likely won't be for a long time.
