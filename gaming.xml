			<p>Previously, Shenmue III's publishing rights were Deep Silver's, a company that has previously published titles such as Dead Island: Riptide, Metro Redux, and most recently, Metro Awakening.&nbsp; Shenmue III was first released for PlayStation 4 and PC via Epic Games Store in 2019, with a Steam and GOG release following a year later. Now, the publishing rights have transferred from Deep Silver over to <a href="https://www.iningames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ININ Games</a>, a publisher known for bridging the gap between Japanese media and the West. They have published titles such as Air Twister, Parasol Stars, and Rainbow Cotton.</p>
<p>"Following the previous collaboration on Air Twister, this will deepen the relationship with the legendary creator Yu Suzuki and his team. Known for our commitment to celebrating beloved titles and bringing them to new platforms, ININ Games is excited to shepherd Shenmue III into its next phase," says the announcement from ININ Games. The transfer of publishing rights coincides with two milestones within the Shenmue franchise. The transfer took place during the 25th anniversary of the Shenmue franchise and the fifth anniversary of Shenmue III.</p>
<p>"We at ININ Games are honored to carry the Shenmue torch forward during such a significant moment in the series' history. As we reflect on two decades of innovation and passion, we remain dedicated to preserving and sharing the journey of Ryo Hazuki with both long-time fans and newcomers."</p>
<p>At the moment, there haven't been any announcements as to what the plans are with Shenmue III or the overall franchise as a whole, but the transfer is still relatively fresh, meaning they need time to plan out their announcements and plans for the game going forward. However, they have promised that there will be upcoming announcements, as they signed off on their announcement.</p>
<p>"With this transfer, the story of Shenmue is far from over. We have exciting plans to celebrate these anniversaries, ensuring that this beloved series continues to thrive and inspire. Keep an eye out for upcoming announcements as we unveil our vision for the next phase of Shenmue's legacy."</p>
<p>Currently, the title is only available on PC and PlayStation 4. However, with the transfer of the rights, it's possible that this game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iv-still-in-planning-phase-needs-a-partner-to-be-made-ue5-remakes-of-first-two-games-might-be-fun/">any future titles</a> within the franchise will be seen on other platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S and maybe the Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-immersion-of-playing-retro-games-in-nature-the-scenic-gamer-interview.1041759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/scenic-gamer-interview-playing-retro-games-in-nature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past four decades, video games have owed so much of their success to their ability to immerse players. As industry enthusiasts, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/firewatch-outdoors-grief-loss" rel="nofollow">we talk about immersion a lot</a>, and we're always seeking new ways to improve on that: better graphics, dynamic mechanics, more intelligent NPCs, and realistic enemy AI.</p>

<p>All of these updates look to the future, but how do we get immersed in the past? That's what Noah Enright of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thescenicgamerofficial" rel="nofollow">The Scenic Gamer</a> aims to do.&nbsp;We had the chance to sit down with Enright&nbsp;and talk a bit about The Scenic Gamer TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram channels, as well as his success streaming on Twitch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The concept is simple enough: bring a CRT television out into the world and play games where they're set, such as <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> on a sandy beach or <em>Super Mario Baseball</em> above the MLB playoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//E8bVvw6yvLg"></iframe></p>

<p>When I discovered Enright's content on TikTok, it resonated with me immediately. I love getting immersed in the stories I'm experiencing, whether that's downloading&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em>&nbsp;onto my Switch to play while on a camping trip or enjoying&nbsp;<em>Sea of Thieves</em>&nbsp;by a local beach. Modern gaming has made these moments easier to obtain, but there's still a rather large roadblock to bringing these moments to retro games: the hardware and lack of portability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emulation is one answer to this problem, but Enright goes the extra mile to bring out a retro TV and console to different locations so that he can enjoy these games on original hardware while appreciating the sights and sounds of nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been a life-long gamer, and I've always wanted to do something with that besides just gaming," Enright&nbsp;said. "I play retro games in the most scenic and amazing places, and places the games are based on. I came up with the idea when I was at a garage sale one day and decided to buy an old retro TV for a dollar."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though Enright&nbsp;launched The Scenic Gamer accounts just a couple months ago, he has already amassed over <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thescenicgamerofficial" rel="nofollow">36,000 followers on Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer" rel="nofollow">16,000 followers on TikTok</a>.</p>

<p>In tandem with his brother, who works as his manager and editor, he has been able to grow the channel at an incredible rate.&nbsp;When asked about preparing his setup, I found his answer relatable to many millennial gamers like myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I've been a collector for quite some time," he said. "So I already had all the retro game stuff."&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-marioi-kart.jpg?itok=SWJJvyoP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-marioi-kart.jpg?itok=7JUnuylK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><h2>What Games Has The Scenic Gamer Brought Into the World So Far?&nbsp;</h2>

<p>So where exactly did Enright's<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>travels bring him?&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I've been to some pretty amazing places so far playing some pretty cool games." —Noah Enright, The Scenic Gamer&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An avid baseball fan, Enright knew he had to celebrate the Dodgers making it to the playoffs and the World Series in true gaming fashion, making some new friends along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was playing <em>Mario Baseball</em> above Dodgers stadium. This family came up to me and asked if they could play with me. So I was playing with these kids above a playoff game and enjoying <em>Mario Baseball</em>! You kind of have to get out of your shell to play these games in public." &nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/noah-and-his-scenic-gamer-setup.jpg?itok=LGEwsBJk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/noah-and-his-scenic-gamer-setup.jpg?itok=qzLvI6LM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><p>Local to Los Angeles, Noah has plenty of great scenery nearby to work with, but these projects have motivated him to travel to other exotic locations.&nbsp;From a local Wendy's to far-away national parks, this adventure has motivated Enright to step out of his comfort zone and explore incredible places around the country.</p>

<p>"The farthest I've been has been spots in Utah, that's three states away, and we went to Zion National Park," Noah said.&nbsp;"We got a campsite and set up the TV and GameCube by a valley and some mountains and made the perfect backdrop for some of those games. We played <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em></a> – that opening was absolutely beautiful. And we streamed <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga" rel="nofollow"><em>LEGO Star Wars</em></a> under the stars."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noah told me how growing up, he and his brother would play <em>LEGO Star Wars </em>games together, so having the opportunity to do that in the scenery of Zion National Park was amazing. This particular trip took place on Enright's&nbsp;birthday weekend, making for an extra-special memory to celebrate another trip around the sun.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-setup-outdoors.jpg?itok=1BW1rFPh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-scenic-gamer-setup-outdoors.jpg?itok=HNqvMNxK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Celebrating a birthday playing retro games at Zion National Park.&nbsp;Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><h2>Power &amp; Portability: Behind the Scenes with The Scenic Gamer</h2>

<p>One of the most common questions for The Scenic Gamer is how does he power his setup? A portable battery covers his power needs, but getting to the different locations is still a challenge. He loads everything he needs into a big wagon—TV, console, controllers, recording equipment, snacks—and hauls them to where he needs to get to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Pulling the wagon through the sand is tough," he said. "I've been to some mountains where I've had to pull it through weeds and all sorts of hills."&nbsp;</p>

<p>As one might expect, the natural world isn't always forgiving when it comes to the retro tech he's carrying around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was at the beach streaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-3d-all-stars" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></a> and it got really windy and sand blew everywhere. It got into my GameCube; these are the unspoken things you don't see that are behind the camera that we need to deal with."</p>

<p>The GameCube Enright&nbsp;uses is the one he's had since childhood. Unfortunately, the sand blowing into it did create some technical problems, but he's in the process of taking the GameCube apart to see if he can fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wind-waker-on-the-beach.jpg?itok=YfBp3158 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wind-waker-on-the-beach.jpg?itok=lxXLhhit 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Image courtesy of Noah Enright</figcaption></figure><p>I hope he's successful, because there are a lot of other journeys for him to take as he continues to pursue these dreams.</p>

<h2>The Scenic Gamer Looks to the Future&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When asked of future plans, he&nbsp;very excitedly told me about some of the places he hopes to get to someday.</p>

<p>"I would love to travel across the United States and do a tour of different games in different spots," he said. "And out of the country – Japan is top of my list of places to go. A lot of the games I'm playing originated there. I would love to just get out there to some of the big Japanese cities and in the countryside to play games there."&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you'd like to follow Enright's journey and cheer him on along the way, you can check out any of his social media channels. Most recently, he traveled around Los Angeles playing&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>in the real-life locations from the game.&nbsp;</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Much has been made about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/avowed/" data-ref-id="5000-516154">Avowed</a>'s approach to its setting, the Living Lands, and the fact that it is not an open-world game. Instead, Avowed's world is made up of "open zones"--large geographical areas that are interconnected with other large areas, much like a previous game from developer Obsidian, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds/" data-ref-id="5000-490219">The Outer Worlds</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">At least in the first of Avowed's areas, that means that Obsidian has put a focus on making sure that the entire space provides interesting adventures. Whether you're chasing side quests handed out by random characters populating the Living Lands' biggest city, Paradis, or just rambling through the area to see what's there, there are plenty of rewards for exploration. There are bandit camps, ruins, half-destroyed hovels, and groups of dead soldiers surrounding the corpses of huge bears. The Living Lands is a place dense with stories and thick with secrets to uncover, and even wandering aimlessly through the wilderness feels like an adventure unto itself.</p><p dir="ltr">"We have these open zones, and they're expansive, they have a lot of breadth of them, but they're manageable enough for our team size to be able to handcraft every part of them and to fill them to the adequate amount of density that we want in that environment," said region director Berto Ritger in an interview with GameSpot. "So we don't want big, big, long expanses, of just grass, that has nothing going on. There are moments of serenity and calm in the environment, but there's always a little bit of something. And we try to have enough variety as well with those things where you're not finding the same corpse of the potion in his hand over and over."</p><p dir="ltr">We recently played the first two hours of Avowed during a preview event at Obsidian, which provided a sense of the way your path through the game's world begins to unfold. Notably, it's not long before you wind up with more or less complete freedom about what to do and how to do it, and even in the early going, Avowed provides you with a ton of freedom about how you want to approach the game, its story, and its combat systems.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403052" data-ratio="0.5627931214174" data-width="1919" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403052"></a><figcaption>Avowed has a bunch of open zones instead of one giant open world.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403052-ss_f8b3cc0098a149d3a59cfdbe57fbe979d5b94cb2.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After delving into Avowed's expansive character creator, you're thrown into the world. Obsidian has previously detailed the setup for the story: You play a character named the Envoy, traveling to the Living Lands by the orders of the leader of a major nation of humans and elves, the Aedyr Empire. The empire has interest in the Living Lands, a somewhat isolated island known for its harsh wilderness and harsher denizens. The place has a sort of Wild West frontier vibe--people head there when they are searching for a better life, or when they want to disappear. It's not a completely uncivilized place, but plenty of the people who've made the Living Lands their home are the kind of rough-and-tumble folks you wouldn't want to tangle with.</p><p dir="ltr">Into this individualistic, slightly lawless society comes the Aedyr Empire, establishing a foothold in the Living Lands that the locals view suspiciously as the first steps of colonization and the establishment of order. As the emperor's Envoy, most people immediately view you with anything ranging from mild distrust to outright hostility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403053"></a><figcaption>You don't pick a class that determines your fighting style--you're free to fight as you please.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403053-ss_c012446d8a0b30d9d7763a5089614799d0423284.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the Living Lands also have a major problem: the Dream Scourge, a "soul plague" that's infecting people, wildlife, and the island itself. Essentially, those afflicted succumb to madness and fungal growths, and with no indication as to what it even is, much less how to stop it, the emperor has dispatched you to conduct an investigation and find a way to deal with the problem. The Dream Scourge is a major threat to life in the Living Lands, and you get a first-hand look at the effects of the madness it inflicts when the Aedyran outpost--filled with your allies--fires its cannons on your approaching Aedyran ship. You survive the wreck and find another crewmate on the beach, and together head to the outpost to find a way to continue your journey to the Living Lands.</p><p dir="ltr">This early tutorial section is mostly about fights with Xaurip lizard people who've taken up residence in the outpost after all the soldiers seem to have lost their minds and murdered each other. Right from the start, Avowed emphasizes its open class approach to combat. Part of character creation is picking your backstory as the Envoy, with options like setting yourself as a war hero or arcane scholar, and what you pick determines your starting weapon. You're not locked into that choice, however, and as soon as you start finding other options, like spears, pistols, swords, shields, and spell-slinging grimoires, you can wield them with no prerequisites or requirements.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403054"></a><figcaption>The demo I played saw me deal with a quite a few of Avowed's lizard-like Xaurip.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403054-ss_3a8669c117eb89ec45e1f0ab7bbe05ce24c80696.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I previously got to try Avowed's combat during an hour-long preview at a Los Angeles Gamescom event, but that demo provided a shorter and more focused look at fighting within the game, with character builds that were set ahead of time by developers. Starting from scratch, things felt a lot more open. I quickly tossed aside my starting dagger for a sword and grimoire, so I was able to slice through enemies or blast them with a flamethrower from my hand, watching their health tick away as they smoldered and charred.</p><p dir="ltr">Fighting enemies is snappy, fluid, and cinematic. As Obsidian worked out how to do first-person combat that felt good, while also utilizing elements from its top-down Pillars of Eternity games (Avowed and the Pillars series are set in the same world), developers found that getting the right feel for combat meant tuning the timings of attacks so they became quicker, making the whole system feel more responsive.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because we started with [a] first-person [perspective], first-person almost necessitates a little bit of brevity in what you do, because if it's third-person, you can see everything that's happening," said senior combat designer Max Matzenbacher in an interview with GameSpot. "With a limited perspective, there's your hands, and there's only so much that you can do there. If you lose control of your character because they're recovering for a long time, that's a major forcing function of just making it feel responsive."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403055" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403055"></a><figcaption>Each of the game's many zones are quite distinct.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403055-ss_1ce7a3cf720bdb29e2c6bf46e3610257c419b2ec.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a lot of options for any given fight, too. You can store two weapon loadouts at a time and swap between them instantly, even mid-attack combo, which means it's easy to alternate between two completely different setups. Hitting enemies damages their health while also pushing up a meter that tracks their stamina; when it maxes out, your opponent will be stunned, leaving them open for a weapon-specific special move that triggers automatically for a ton of damage. Stealth is also always an option--enemies often won't detect you right away and you can sneak up and clobber them from behind by moving through tall grass or avoiding their sightlines. And there are environmental elements you can utilize to help you out as well, like fiery berries you can shoot with a bow to start a blaze.</p><p dir="ltr">In both previews I've played, I've vibed pretty well with Avowed's combat--although even in the tutorial area, it can be tough. The moment-to-moment thrust is in managing a stamina meter that dictates your attacks and, more critically, your quick, agile dodges that can get you out of harm's way. Some enemies come at you with unblockable attacks, leaving you no option but to get clear, and staying alive means a lot of sidestepping to slip past a blow and land one of your own. Most attacks land quickly so you can strike back and then get clear or block an incoming attack, although you can also gamble with stronger charged-up blows using most weapons. Everything is quick and fluid, though, and the ability to constantly dual-wield weapons, whether two of the same blade or a main weapon like a spear and an off-hand weapon like a pistol or grimoire, means it always feels like you have something up your sleeve.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403056"></a><figcaption>Creepy crawlies of all shapes and sizes populate Avowed's world.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403056-ss_b881e3b01586fdccabfae170af7d12b9e09d58e1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While you're given a lot of freedom in how you want to engage with enemies, the leveling system is more structured. You can spend skill points in any of several skill trees, each named for a different character class, like Fighter or Ranger. That makes it a little easier to get a sense of how you're building your character along traditional lines, without Avowed locking you into a particular class. You also unlock special abilities that run on cooldown timers, and these give you easy ways to mix together the capabilities of different disciplines without really worrying about the skill tree at all. For instance, you can get the Fighter's dash-tackle ability, which you can use to wallop enemies for a big stun, or the Ranger's entangling magic vines that temporarily root enemies to a specific spot.</p><p dir="ltr">Uncovering the mystery of what happened in the outpost quickly brings you to your first major RPG choice in Avowed. You discover a local resident of the Living Lands locked inside with a dead soldier. As a representative of the Aedyr Empire, she's immediately distrustful of you and gives you a sense of how the residents of the island see outsiders. Your crewmate doesn't think it's a great idea to let the smuggler out, but you need a boat to reach the Living Lands proper. Whether you choose to trust the smuggler or leave her to rot, however, is up to you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403057" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403057"></a><figcaption>The fungal-like disease spreading through the world is an ongoing problem for your character.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403057-ss_024c5d99b7a9e0af7e0b125594a9309a16fc3b99.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">With the smuggler in tow and some more sneaking around and assassinating Xaurips, we eventually made it to Paradis. After parting with your crewmate pal and reluctant smuggler buddy, your journey in Avowed gets its real start, and almost immediately, you're let off the leash to do as you will. Landing at the Paradis docks, you're met by a local militia representative, a put-upon guard captain who makes it sarcastically clear she's not thrilled to see you, and Kai, a guy who's looking for the "clavager"--essentially Paradis's mayor, such as there is one. It turns out that the Aedyran ambassador, who you need to speak to, has headed out to investigate some possible Dream Scourge-related weirdness with the clavager, so Kai decides to join you in going to track them down.</p><p dir="ltr">Paradis is a big place, but for the main point of civilization in the Living Lands, it immediately gives a strange impression. It's both a bustling city full of people and a place that looks like it's half-collapsing, combining new structures and crumbling ruins.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the things that I was trying to say, the story I was trying to tell, was that this is a really, truly untamed, untamable place," said lead environment artist Dennis Presnell. "There have been numerous civilizations that have tried to stake their claim, and they have come and gone, and you see evidence of that at the start of the game. When you get to the docks, you see it's new built on old. But even the new looks like it's old, and it's trying to weather the storm, but it's barely holding on. And when you get to Paradis, you see the same thing. It's new built on old, and it's a collection of different cultures that are all trying to make their way in what is probably the safest and most secure place in all of the Living Lands, and yet, it's not."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403059-ss_429bef4d49d33166174e2e9c66619b15c1b1f89d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403059" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403059-ss_429bef4d49d33166174e2e9c66619b15c1b1f89d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4403059"></a><figcaption>The people of the Living Lands don't like the protagonist very much. Not at first anyway.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4403059-ss_429bef4d49d33166174e2e9c66619b15c1b1f89d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">You're ostensibly sent to find the ambassador to advance the plot, but once you have Kai with you, you're free to wander off the beaten path. As you set out, you start to get a sense of what the Living Lands are really like. Presnell described the location as more of a living organism than a location, and part of Avowed's personality is how it treats the Living Lands as something of a strange place that's not easily understood.</p><p dir="ltr">"Treating the environment itself as a character is so helpful, and that's true for any component of the game, because you're trying to empathize with a piece of land or a particular tree or whatever, but kind of putting yourself in the position of, 'Okay, if I was this tree and I was mad that I had new neighbors and I had the agency to do something about it, how would I go about that?'" art director Matt Hansen said. "And so there's a lot of that that's going into it, as far as how to push that sense of a weird and wondrous frontier."</p><p dir="ltr">Side quests are available immediately--I ran into a woman not far from the docks who needed a hand with Xaurips invading her house on some nearby sea cliffs. After clearing them out, I found a strange mural they'd painted in her living room. When I confronted the woman about it, she told the story of how she has dreams about the Xaurip and is worried that, more or less, the Xaurip is her literal soulmate. I offered her some useless words of encouragement, took my reward, and wandered off, wondering what the hell that could have been all about. (I asked developers about that quest, and apparently there's more to the tale of the Xaurip soulmate.)</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1099842154" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

"Companions will react to those things in real time. Those choices will also heavily impact individual characters, groups of characters, and entire settlements, factions of people, and the states of the regions that you go through. They will also impact the choices that are even available to you. Later in the game, you'll be locked or locked out of or presented with new choices based on the choices you made much earlier in the game."</p><p dir="ltr">Even on the short walk to the next location for the main story, though, there was plenty to see. The area around Paradis is objectively not <em>huge</em>, as I discovered wandering around it, but it's not especially small, either. Importantly, though, it feels bigger than it is, thanks to how much interesting stuff Obsidian has packed into it. Cutting to one side of the area, I stumbled on a tall ruined building or tower of some kind. It wasn't marked by an icon or any other clues, but just looked interesting. Climbing in, I found tripwires that triggered huge swinging blades, a set of barely working traps designed to keep people out that were now exposed to sunlight and easy to dodge. Further on, I was attacked by phantoms, which look like spectral, smokey ghosts, and killing them allowed me to reach a chest filled with a high-quality piece of armor. The entire affair took around 10 minutes and was totally optional, but exploring that little tower was a rewarding diversion that gave a little more of a sense of the Living Lands.</p><div

I found a decrepit, abandoned house not far away on the river, where journals told me about the struggles of the farmer who used to live there. A little way down the stream was another set of ruins where bandits had set up camp. They promptly killed me as Kai yelled in the background to warn me my weak starting armor couldn't handle their much better weapons. And that was all just stuff I happened across on my way back to town.</p><p dir="ltr">The two-hour demo we played also included some early bits of Avowed's story--you track down the ambassador, have a weird encounter with a voiceless entity that seems to be the spirit of the Living Lands, and kill a huge bear afflicted with the Dream Scourge that's angry and covered in beautiful, horrific mushrooms.</p><p dir="ltr">Those points are compelling, but maybe even more so are the little things that Obsidian has seeded throughout the Living Lands that you might miss, like that ailing farmhouse or those weird ruins. That also goes for the time you can spend with your companions; it's possible to set up camp at certain places where you can tend to things like improving your gear, and during those moments, you can also talk to your pals about whatever's going on in the plot, their backstories, and more. Even 10 steps off the dock, I was surprised at how deep and expansive my camp conversations with Kai could be. There's a ton of story material in these moments, but it's all optional, allowing you to dig as deeply into the narrative and characters as you want.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ultimately, what we want is for the player to make the experience that they want to have, and that means being able to dig really deep into conversations if they want to, or to minimally engage with them," said narrative designer Kate Dollarhyde. "And that does, you know, create some design challenges. But ultimately, I think having content that's missable or skippable or that can be done out of order is ultimately better than the best, most polished linear presentation, because at the end of the day, it just feels more personal. And to me as an RPG player, that is almost always more important to me than a really linear experience."</p><p dir="ltr">Though we still have only seen a small portion of Avowed, it's the freedom to explore and the density of things to find, whether in combat, out in the world, or in conversations, that has me most intrigued. Avowed feels packed with things to discover for yourself, whether you're following the story or making your own way through the world. What we've seen of the Living Lands is full of life, and Obsidian's willingness to give you so much to discover that you'll miss some makes Avowed seem like the kind of game it'll be great to get lost in.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3840097/george-a-romeros-resident-evil-documentary-releasing-in-january-2025-exclusive/">Bloody Disgusting</a>, the documentary has been directed and co-written by Brandon Salisbury. It takes us back to 1998, when Constantin Film set out to bring Resident Evil to the big screen with the help of Romero. On its release, the documentary will include archival footage, as well as interviews with those who were involved in the unreleased film, going into the reasons why it was never made.</p>
<p>"George Romero gave birth to modern horror, the modern zombie, and ultimately Resident Evil," said Salisbury. "I am honoured to bring fans the untold story of his most important unmade project, to celebrate the legacy of the man that inspired me to pursue filmmaking as a career.

			<p>Five years after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> of The Outer Worlds, I've finally got my hands on Obsidian's next roleplaying game, Avowed. Microsoft reached out earlier this month with the opportunity of a digital preview event for the press, where we had the opportunity to play a small slice of the game, around two to three hours, starting from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Which, as is often the case with games, begins with a shipwreck. The player character, who can be customized through a fairly in-depth character creation process, is the personal envoy of the Aedyran Emperor, sent to investigate the so-called Dreamscourge plague in the Living Lands, a sizable island located north of the Empire. Players can choose to be either humans or elves (the main races of the Aedyr Empire) and male or female. They're also defined to be Godlike, which means they were touched before birth by one of the gods of Eora, giving them mysterious powers and abilities. Godlike also receive unique facial features that can be customized or even removed, although even if you do remove them completely, the non-player characters will comment on them anyway.</p>
<p>Moreover, players can tweak their attributes from the start, immediately revealing the game's strong RPG roots. Pumping up Might or Intellect isn't just a choice related to combat, either, as you'll often find dialogue options opening up depending on certain attributes. For example, having enough Might could scare away thugs who try to strong-arm you, whereas high Intellect can provide insightful dialogue response options. It's something I have always loved in roleplaying games, and I'm happy to see it appear here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Avowed_DAWNSHORE_DOCKS_KAI-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of dialogues, they're rather dynamic in that choosing one option might advance the conversation and lock you out of the others, whereas most games allow the player to simply go back and try every option. Facial animations aren't great, though. I don't know if they're final, but they might be, considering there's less than three months before Avowed launches.</p>
<p>Going back to the story, the shipwreck occurs because the ship the envoy is on suddenly gets bombarded by a nearby fort. Only the envoy and the ship's captain make it out alive and have to find out why exactly a fort of Aedyran soldiers would fire on them. Unsurprisingly, the reason is that the soldiers were infected by the Dreamscourge themselves, slowly turning on each other as chronicled in several notes. Eventually, the player finds the soldier's leader still alive but completely mad; he's effectively the first boss fight in Avowed, and the encounter made me hopeful that Obsidian heeded at least some of the criticism on The Outer Worlds.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint with that game was the underwhelming combat and boss fights. Here, though, both seem thoroughly improved. Combat is definitely more satisfying, both due to improved hit feedback and smoother animations, and it's more challenging, too, at least when played on Hard difficulty. It also features a Skyrim-like dual wielding option that lets you freely mix and match most weapon types, each featuring different damage and stun properties as well as different stamina costs.</p>
<p>In the demo, I checked out greatswords, warhammers, greataxes, dagger and shield, sword and shield, mace and shield, wand and shield, sword and grimoire, and wand and grimoire. Each felt its own thing, and some options are undoubtedly better than others depending on the enemy you're facing. I do, however, have a reservation about grimoires. Whereas wands function more like magic versions of bows with quick or charged zaps, their attacks based on stamina like melee weapons and bows, Grimoire abilities are powered by Essence, the game's version of mana.</p>
<p>This puts it at a distinct disadvantage compared to the other weapons because Essence does not appear to recharge itself over time, like in most RPGs. You'll instead have to chug potions, of which there is not an infinite amount. To compensate, the Grimoire spells should be extremely powerful, but that didn't look the case, at least in this build.</p>

<p>I was also happy to find out that, unlike The Outer Worlds where you had to raise your Inspiration stat to manually use your companion's abilities, this is available right away in Avowed. The only companion in the demo is Kai, an aumaua who deserted from the Rauataian navy and sought a new home in the Living Lands. It's too early to tell, of course, but he's already shaping up to be an interesting character, and his tanking abilities make him useful right away in combat. He's not at all afraid to chime in during dialogues, too, and he's voice-acted by Brandon Keener, who played the beloved Garrus in BioWare's Mass Effect series. One-to-one conversations with companions will only happen in camps, which can be set at specific spots. Camps also feature crafting and enchanting stations to upgrade gear.</p>
<p>Following that boss fight, the envoy makes it back to the main island, accessing the area of Dawnshore. This is where I could explore a bit more freely, and the exploration is highly reminiscent of The Outer Worlds. Don't expect this to be a sprawling open world game by any means, though there will be a few secrets to find here and there. By the way, I would recommend playing in first-person view, as the third-person option felt clunky. You can toggle them via the menu, not in real time as in Bethesda games.</p>
<p>Graphically, for an Unreal Engine 5 game, Avowed looks good but not great, even with all the graphics settings pushed to the max and ray tracing turned on. There seems to be something off about the lighting at times, and the art is also a bit of a mixed bag, though it might grow on the player after some time. The performance is already fairly solid, however, and NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation have already been implemented.</p>
<p>Overall, this hands-on experience definitely left me hopeful and eager for the final version. It's unlikely to be a big success on the scale of Skyrim or Baldur's Gate 3, but it looks like another fun and engaging role-playing game from Obsidian that improves on their previous first-person title. All the worldbuilding work done for the Pillars of Eternity games will certainly pay off, too, both for returning fans of the isometric cRPGs who get to enter Eora from a wholly different perspective and for newcomers who will feel the depth and uniqueness of this fantasy setting.</p>
<p>Avowed launches on February 18, 2025 for PC (Steam, Xbox app, Battle.net, PC Game Pass), Xbox Series S|X (and Xbox Game Pass), and Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/avowed-preview-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Over the past few days, I’ve had the opportunity to explore the opening hours of <em>Avowed</em>, the upcoming fantasy RPG from Obsidian Entertainment, a developer best known for 2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and its series of excellent turn-based RPGs in the <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> universe. <em>Avowed</em> arrives early next year on Xbox and PC, and despite the existence of <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, this one more closely follows in the footsteps of 2019’s<em> The Outer Worlds</em>, a modest open world-ish sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-personal-story-behind-parvati-the-surprise-star-of-the-outer-worlds/?utm_source=wptwitterus"><u>that punched above its weight largely due to excellent writing.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>Microsoft told me playing through the opening area of <em>Avowed</em> would take about two hours, but taking my time and poking about, my time in the Living Lands was closer to four or five hours. I talk extensively about my time with <em>Avowed</em> on this week’s Remap Radio, but that publishes tomorrow, and in the meantime, I wanted to jot down a couple of quick thoughts with the game.</p><hr><ul><li><strong>Reset your expectations. The game is what you think it is.</strong></li></ul><p>Since it was unveiled, <em>Avowed</em> has felt…<em>off</em>. I can’t put my finger on it. I am the target demo for a game like this <em>and</em> I found <em>The Outer Worlds </em>flawed but worthwhile and charming; <em>Avowed</em> should’ve been a slamdunk pitch. Instead, playing <em>Avowed</em> has affirmed my caution, because the combat is clunky, the world is a little lifeless, and seems, at least at first, to lack the kinds of compelling characters that took <em>The Outer Worlds </em>over the finish line. It’s impossible to make a complete judgment about an RPG based on a few hours with its introductory area, but you gotta start somewhere.</p><ul><li><strong>Crafting the opening to an RPG must be hard, but this one doesn’t work.</strong></li></ul><p>The opening to <em>Skyrim</em> is a meme because it’s <em>awesome</em>, and tosses you into the world in the coolest way possible. I’m not a fantasy person but <em>Skyrim</em> had me by the collar from the jump, and I rushed to start poking and prodding at the world. I’m sympathetic to the notion that an RPG has a difficult job, because it needs to bring you into the world when you’re at your weakest as a character and know very little about the journey ahead. You’re not powerful, you’re not interesting, and you don’t know what you want to do. That could be an opportunity for good writing and clever quests to do the lifting, but I wasn’t able to find them. Instead I spent four hours desperately seeking things to do in the Living Lands’ opening hours that didn’t involve struggling to not die as a magic user, or engaging in shocking amounts of awkward platforming. A world, even one that’s only big-<em>ish</em> like in <em>Avowed</em>, needs to point you towards The Good Stuff.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Stiff and awkward combat can work if the world, story, and characters make up for it.</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>A potentially fatal flaw: quests without consequence, quests without motivation.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><em>Avowed</em> quite obviously does not have the budget or scope of a <em>Skyrim</em>, but again, part of the reason <em>The Outer Worlds</em> worked was because the combat was (arguably) serviceable, while everything else fell into the writing’s lap. I pushed through because the writing compelled me.</p><p>Truth be told, <em>Avowed</em> starts promisingly, with a strangely touching quest where you learn that, in this world, it’s possible to be born with half a soul. You meet such a person, an individual who’s spent their life desperately searching for the other half, but when they do, it turns out their “other half” is a lizard creature whose species has a penchant for violence.&nbsp;</p><p>You’re tasked with clearing (aka killing) the smaller enemies out of her home, before stumbling upon a larger variant trying to communicate with you. You <em>can</em> kill them, but my companion pointed out that maybe this was the (half) soulmate our quest giver was speaking of. Upon reporting back, I firmly suggested that, as odd as this situation might be, they should make the best of it.</p><p>Touched and deeply amused, I fast traveled back to their home, hoping to witness a lovely but awkward conclusion to this story. Instead, nothing happened. That was the end of the quest. All setup, no punchline.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a theme that repeated while exploring <em>Avowed</em>. Once, I cleared a cave of spiders preventing nearby fisherman from doing their jobs, but when the creepy crawlies were dead, no one came to fish. There was no one to thank me. All I had was a little more loot. Where's my impact on the world?</p><p>Or when I stumbled into a rickety shantytown on the outskirts of a great and rich city, figuring I could get up to some mischief—or at least an interesting side quest commenting on the game’s class divides? Instead, a soldier asked me to find four medallions that were hiding nearby. Alas.</p><ul><li><strong>We do not live in a world of RPG scarcity. What itch is <em>Avowed</em> scratching?</strong></li></ul><p>“Launching a game in today's world is as challenging and big an effort as it's ever been,” said Xbox head honcho Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?ref=remapradio.com"><u>in a recent interview with <em>Game File</em></u></a>. You can do everything “right,” by which I mean craft a seemingly objectively good game and spend time, money, and effort telling people about it. And it still might fail. There are no guarantees with video games these days, but step one is crafting an identity. Part of my early tepid reaction to <em>Avowed</em> was trying to puzzle out whether my reaction was purely because “hey, it’s not for me.” But upon playing it, I now wonder: is <em>Avowed</em> for anyone?</p><p><em>Avowed</em> would not be the first video game to really get going hours later than it should. It’s a chronic problem with RPGs. I’ll be returning to the Living Lands in 2025. The only difference is that I’ll be walking through the door, digital wand in hand, with a little more skepticism this time.</p>

I am, however improper it might be, going to ignore this principle on this occasion, because after spending at least six hours with the opening section of a preview build of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/gawj9hqojtabo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/gawj9hqojtabo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>, <em>I already absolutely adore this game</em>.</p><p>It’s quite normal for PR companies to spin fantasies around the game they’re sending you, and Microsoft unquestionably did this when sharing this build of <em>Avowed</em> and saying it should last about two hours. I mean, perhaps if someone knew where they were going and refused to deviate on the way, that could be true. I’ve been playing three times that long, still have large sections of the available map in fog, incomplete sidequests, and tough battles I’m determined to win. Beside the main plot, I’ve explored elaborate, labyrinthine spider caves, fought three boss fights, helped a wayward soul find her twin, burgled a dozen houses in a sprawling dockside town, leapt from rooftop to rooftop in pursuit of gull-stolen trinkets, and battled hordes of xaurip beasts for the hell of it. That includes none of the 27 stages of the two main quests. Two hours!</p><figure id="" data-id="0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-recommend-id="image://0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-recommend-id="image://0753902f7ebac9d614e9652b964f67a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A scene of Dawnshore's port, with large wooden ships and stone buildings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em> is Obsidian’s action-adventure RPG follow-up to its wonderful third-person <em>Pillars of Eternity</em> games. Set a couple of years later, it whisks us off to a new region of Eora called The Living Lands, a rough, pirate-ridden region whose people have heard rumor of the events that took place in the Eastern Reach, but know only snippets of what occurred in the Deadfire. In this way, <em>Avowed</em> is a game that’s rich with background detail for those who played the two isometric RPGs, but extremely welcoming to newcomers for whom all those references are just expository color.</p><p>There is a new plague spreading the lands, called the Dreamscourge. The infected begin to experience terrible dreams which, after a while, bleed into their waking lives, leaving them unable to discern reality, and becoming unintelligible and violent. It also causes fungi to start growing all over their bodies. This is afflicting people, animals, even vegetation, and the leaders of the oh-so civilized Aedyran Empire have sent you, a Godlike (people who are touched by the gods at birth, giving them unique abilities), to the Living Lands as an envoy, to find out more.</p><p>On your journey to an area called Dawnshore, you’re shipwrecked and lose all your crew but for one person, Garryck, a furry blue guy who’s adept with a sword. Washing up on the beach of a small island (let’s call it Tutorial Island), you aim for a stronghold that should be on your side, but seemed to be responsible for the ruining of your ship. On arrival, all you find is carnage, a bloodbath of dead bodies, as if they all turned on each other. Through exploring and engaging with those still alive, you eventually find a way to reach the port of Dawnshore, with an eventual goal of entering the town of Paradis. But before you do, you need to find the ambassador you were meant to meet, who’s gone missing somewhere in the wilds.</p><figure id="" data-id="40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-recommend-id="image://40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-recommend-id="image://40f3237ce74b22d2cfaf156b4b353e49" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Battling a skeleton with blue glowing eyes, using a spear." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Aedyr is unseen (at least so far—this preview is limited to the game’s first main area, Dawnshore) but quickly becomes apparent as analogous for various Earthly empires that believed their civilization superior to those abroad, sending people out to attempt to establish colonies and spread their enlightened ways. (The letter given to you by the Emperor reads, in part, “We grant you the privilege and immunity to dispense our laws as you see fit and to remove all obstacles by any means.”) You, as an Aedyran, and also a Godlike, are therefore quite understandably met with suspicion and sometimes intolerance, as you explore the not-actually-lawless lands. And, this being an Obsidian game, you can lean into your reputation, try to defy it, or just outright not give a shit either way.</p><p>The two companions you meet and explore with on Tutorial Island are very abruptly taken from you on arrival in Dawnshore (both for good narrative reasons), and you’re immediately paired up with Kai, a former soldier from the Rauataian Empire, a rugged and weather-beaten land of blue, scaled people with a (mostly untrue) reputation for being mercenaries. Kai just happens to be a mercenary, but an extremely calm and gentle one, voiced by the mellifluous Brandon Keener—Garrus from the <em>Mass Effect</em> games.</p><figure id="" data-id="9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-recommend-id="image://9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-recommend-id="image://9f3cfa07c229e65e859ce695bf7c1f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A generic female character battles a lizardy beast that's wearing very silly armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is all viewed from a first or third-person perspective (and surprisingly, both feel right), in a game that feels <em>chunky</em> in a way RPGs haven’t for too long. It brings back memories of <em>Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic</em> and <em>Arx Fatalis</em>, but in a far more elaborately hewn universe. The world around you feels delicately crafted, with you as a powerful force within it. Any fears (or hopes, I suppose) that this might be an Obsidian attempt at a <em>Skyrim</em> can be put aside—<em>Avowed</em> is far more concentrated, less wildly open, a much more focused game.</p><p>However, there’s still a great sense of freedom. This most immediately stood out to me with its classless approach. At the start of the game, there’s a solid (although shamed by <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>’s) character creator that lets you design your Godlike envoy (not that the screenshots here were supplied by Obsidian, and I made someone far more interesting than the generic character shown!), and pick a background archetype that leans into a class (hinting at rogues, wizards, fighters, etc), but this choice actually has far more impact on your conversations than your aptitudes. Instead, as you gather different weapon types, you can experiment as you see fit, dual-wielding most types, and you’re encouraged to have two completely different setups, which you can swap between on the fly. I began with an axe, tried grimoire spellcasting, tested heavy weaponry, and eventually settled on a combination of axe and wand in one loadout, and bow and arrow in the other. You can then plug ability points into these weapon types as you level up, and respec for just a small in-game currency cost.</p><p>It’s also rather pertinent to return to that opening point: perhaps I could have finished this in two hours, but there felt no reason to. I was able to head off in multiple directions, seek out entirely off-script areas, have in-depth chats with characters who play major roles in the plot, and even after finding where the demo build ends, reload and find whole other sections I’d missed. It’s not that overwhelming agoraphobia of an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game, but nor is it a linear experience by any means.</p><p>On arrival at Dawnshore, I realized that while there was a quest marker somewhere in the far distance, I wasn’t being pointed in any other specific directions. Instead, given the enormous map and vast blank space waiting to be filled in between me and my goal, I was being deliberately left free to explore. I felt liberated to poke about the towns, find routes onto rooftops to see if I could sneak into buildings, and then climb a huge, dilapidated lighthouse Kai pointed out, just because it was there.</p><figure id="" data-id="91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-recommend-id="image://91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-recommend-id="image://91b955e5f0f68ed8af98a47073281fcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sunset view of Dawnshore, with cliffs in the foreground and the lighthouse in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Despite this, perhaps even because of it, the gorgeous world sometimes feels oddly inert around you. You’re equipped with hefty weapons, but unless marked as breakable, wooden crates and all plant life resists your blows. It occasionally has that feeling of an old 1930s cartoon, where anything that was going to move was painted differently than the static backgrounds, except here delineated with glowy markers. Wooden obstacles blocking doors are inexplicably indestructible, and while you can wield fire magic, you can only set something on fire if it’s marked as such.</p><p>Still, you can set fire to all the enemies, and that’s not nothing. Combat is very much what you choose to make of it, I discovered, with options to carefully combine Godlike abilities, pause the action to issue commands to Kai, and then meticulously fire off incapacitating spells before rushing in with a sword. Or, you know, just spam the wand button and glug health potions. Weapon builds really do significantly affect how fights play out, and it’s very much about discovering what works for you, what sort of action-adventure battling you prefer.</p><p>I was also rather delighted by the game’s willingness to let you run away. Even boss encounters, like an onslaught of spider minions before their big mommy comes out, don’t lock you in the cave where they occur. If it’s too much, turn and sprint away! Or use this to your advantage, funnel them to a narrow corridor and pelt them with arrows, shepherd them so you can set fire to as many at once as possible. It really does seem to encourage experimentation, and not fuss about whether you might cheese something if they don’t bolt all the doors.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-recommend-id="image://eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-recommend-id="image://eb8d8a1df71027bdbc6b79df8756de99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cat-like character is about to fire an arrow from a bow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s too early to make any calls on the storytelling. This is very much the establishing moments of what’s clearly going to be a large and unfolding tale, and so these opening hours have a lot of heavy lifting to do in terms of getting you up to speed. All the writing is as good as you’d hope from this studio, although at the same time, I can’t say I met any characters I’d regard as especially memorable. Again, this is all set before you even enter the game’s first main city, and Kai—largely by having Garrus’s voice, admittedly—is immediately charming.</p><p>My only real point of concern was what felt like the narrative rushing too quickly to bestow me with the accolades of being so utterly unique, so special and chosen, that are de rigueur for RPG games. I am a Godlike, and as such have cool toadstools growing out of my face—but so do all the plague victims, so that’s not enormously special. Instead, the only action that triggered the solemnly delivered platitudes about my magnitude was telling my early companions I’d heard a voice after touching a stone. I feel like this should earn perhaps a raised eyebrow, maybe even concern, rather than seeing me immediately declared as having Christlike significance. Things calmed down after arriving in Dawnshore, however, where people were more likely to assume me an asshole than their savior. But still, it felt a touch ham-fisted.</p><p>But really, honestly, the only thing that matters is how much I just want to keep playing. I don’t want to be done yet! So much so that even though I’ve technically “finished” this build, cruelly cut off as I entered the city of Paradis, I’ve gone back to explore what’s left. I found a whole new cave dungeon that I’d missed before! I discovered I’d gathered enough items to improve my armor, and am only a couple of one particular plant away from being able to upgrade my wand a second time! I’m determined to squeeze out every last drop of this snippet of the game, and am now infuriated that I have to wait until February 18 to be able to play any further.</p><p><em>Avowed</em> feels rock solid, deep, and hugely cared for. This has “labor of love” oozing out all over, and if it can deliver a story as strong as those in the <em>Pillars of Eternity </em>games, we could have an all-time classic on our hands.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There's been a question mark over this one for years, but it seems BioWare did once plan to let you import your Hero of Ferelden, your Grey Warden protagonist from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-origins">Dragon Age: Origins</a>, into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>. It was only at the last minute that the studio cut the feature and swapped a Grey Warden character called Stroud in their place.</p>
<p>In Inquisition, there's a pivotal mission near the end - Here Lies the Abyss - where you get a chance to meet protagonists from previous games. You meet your Hawke from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a>, and then you get the chance to meet one of three Grey Warden characters from Dragon Age: Origins - and it's here the game was supposed to let you meet your Hero of Ferelden. But it didn't - this is where Stroud was swapped in instead.</p>
<p>"Here's the thing about honouring previous game choices from a design perspective: it's a sucker's game," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lbfwpwi6ns22">wrote Gaider on Bluesky</a>. "What many fans picture, when you mention it, is divergent *plot* - the story changes path based on those major choices. How exciting!</p>
<p>"But you will never be able to deliver divergent plot."</p>

<p>"It's a question of resources, and there's never enough to go around.</p>
<p>"Here Lies the Abyss in DAI was about as good as it gets," he added, "and even that was a far cry from how I originally pictured it (hello last-minute insert of Stroud when a DAO Warden import got cut)."</p><p>Gaider's Bluesky thread came about as an addendum, of sorts, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-developer-cast-farscape-star-as-morrigan-after-hearing-her-beat-poet-rendition-of-noughties-rap-banger">yesterday's story about the origins of Morrigan's character</a> and the voice actor cast to play her. The primary focus of the addendum concerns Morrigan's child in the game, Kieran, AKA the Old God Baby. He does appear in Inquisition but this was another choice from Dragon Age: Origins that gave Gaider a headache.</p>

<p>Remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">BioWare didn't know there would be a Dragon Age 2 when it was making Dragon Age: Origins</a>, let alone a Dragon Age 3 (Inquisition), so it didn't plan these things in advance. It did a bunch of things in Origins it turns out were incredibly hard to fulfil later on.</p>
<p>The Old God Baby is a big deal... <em>if</em> it happened in your game. The soul of the Archdemon you defeat - a corrupted Old God - is transferred into the baby that you and Morrigan, or Morrigan and another character, conceive on the eve of the final battle. Already, then, there are permutations in who the father could be, so who should canon-Kieran look like?</p><p>"It was a decision from *two games ago* that only a small minority (hello telemetry) would even choose," said Gaider. "To the rest, they probably neither knew about it nor cared... so how many resources could you invest? To do what? Set up an even bigger divergence for the NEXT game?"</p>
<p>The solution came when Gaider made the scene more about Morrigan and less about Kieran, a character the players didn't know. "Thus began a feverish three days where I wrote probably the most complicated scene of my career: Morrigan's reckoning with Flemeth in DAI and the fallout after," he said. "Three different versions (OGB Kieran, non-OGB Kieran, and no Kieran), each with branching for other choices (like the Well of Sorrows)."</p>
<p>It was a scene that resonated with Morrigan actor Claudia Black, who'd had a child of her own not long after Dragon Age: Origins had come out. In fact, she would later have her own child play the role of Kieran in the scene. "Claudia was in the booth, gently coaching him through his lines," Gaider said, "and I think that was the first moment I felt I'd done the right thing."</p>
<p>Gaider, incidentally, did not work on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> at all - a game that sidesteps a lot of the issues Inquisition faced by letting you customise an Inquisitor during character creation, and then outlining only three of the biggest choices they made. It does not - as previous Dragon Ages did - use the web-based Dragon Age Keep database, which tracked a multitude of decisions from the older games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-mods-already-give-unlimited-carry-weight-and-no-weapon-durability-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In my STALKER 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>, I mentioned how the game's balance is currently causing frustration for the player:</p>
<p><em>When you're hit in STALKER 2, there's a decent chance you'll not only lose health (which does not regenerate on its own), but you'll also start bleeding. While medkits restore health, you need bandages to stem the bleeding. Similarly, you need to bring food and drinks, anti-rads, and enough ammunition whenever you venture out of the safe zones. You'll want to stock up on all these things because there is no fast travel in this game, and there's no telling when you might need them while roaming the ever-dangerous Zone. However, everything has its own weight; even quest items have weight, and the more you carry, the quicker the stamina drops.</em></p>
<p><em>While that is perfectly understandable within the context of the game's design, I feel that it is absolutely overtuned and ends up being too penalizing. Even when the inventory's weight is in the green range, it only takes a little sprint to deplete the stamina, leading to fairly slow and long treks to travel across the map. I literally wished there was some kind of auto-run functionality, as you're just pushing the forward button for minutes at a time on certain occasions with nothing else to do. A modular approach to difficulty, which is becoming more common in recent game releases, would have been preferable to set the challenge level of combat, travel, injuries and survival separately depending on the player's preferences.</em></p>
<p><em>There's more. The equipment's durability depletes over time, as you'd expect given the realistic theme. Tech NPCs can repair them in the safe zones, provided you've got enough coupons to spare. The problem is that, in some cases, the cost is simply outrageous. I had found an extremely effective armor suit that was worth over 20K coupons. However, when I went to repair it, I was appalled by the NPC requesting 70K coupons - far more than I had available. When repairing something costs over three times its worth, you know something's wrong. I also believe that the side missions could be more rewarding at handing coupons; you don't loot coupons from fallen foes, as they are transmitted digitally to your PDA. You could gather items and then sell them, but there's the little problem mentioned above with taking on too much weight. In short, the economy needs a balance pass, too.</em></p>
<p>Later in the review, I mentioned that either GSC Game World or modders would have to take care of the problem. It looks like the modders already did, albeit in a perhaps excessive fashion. Mere hours after the launch, Nexus Mods user Ronon_Dex_6 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">uploaded</a> a mod that provides unlimited carry weight for the player. This works through Cheat Engine, so it's essentially a hack, and it certainly kind of undermines the harsh journey the player is meant to go through. However, it is a temporary solution for those who cannot bear the system as-is, while a better fix can be provided by the developers or by a more elegant mod.</p>
<p>There's also another <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mod</a> that removes weapon durability loss. This is achieved by manually tweaking the durabilitydamagepershot value to 0.0 in the PlayerWeaponSettingsPrototypes.cfg file. Many more mods will undoubtedly be released for STALKER 2. The development team <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plans</a> to release official tools that will allow fans to create cross-platform mods that work on consoles, too. We'll keep you informed of all the most interesting mods as they appear.</p>

<p>Starting December 1, the price of the Fortnite Battle Royale Battle Pass will increase to 1,000 V-Bucks, up from 950 V-Bucks. However, the real money cost of V-Bucks will stay the same. Players can still earn V-Bucks by progressing through the Battle Pass tiers. In addition, the price of the 25 Battle Pass Reward Bundle has been reduced from 1,850 V-Bucks to 1,800 V-Bucks.</p>



<p>Fortnite is making <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several changes</a> to its Crew Subscription, along with increasing the Battle Pass price. Starting December 1, the Fortnite Crew will include the Music Pass and LEGO Pass at no additional cost, along with the existing benefits (Battle Royale Battle Pass, 1,000 V-Bucks, monthly Crew Pack outfits, and the bonus benefits of Crew Pack outfit styles, Rocket League’s Rocket Pass Premium). New Passes like the Fortnite OG Pass will also be added to the Crew Subscription.</p>



<p>Players who cancel their Fortnite Crew subscription can still claim premium rewards from the Battle Pass until the end of their billing cycle, but not for the remainder of the Battle Pass duration. Those who remain actively subscribed will not notice any changes in the system. Additionally, players who purchase the Battle Pass, LEGO Pass, or Music Pass separately from Fortnite Crew will still have the opportunity to unlock and claim premium rewards.</p>

                <p>One year after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">Netflix brought Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy</a> to its growing mobile-gaming library, two of those games are set to leave the service. Netflix has warned users that they will only have until December 13 to play Grand Theft Auto 3 - The Definitive Edition and Grand Theft Auto: Vice City - The Definitive Edition.</p><p>While GTA 3 and Vice City are both set to leave the service, it seems like San Andreas is staying on Netflix for a while longer, with the game not displaying the same "Leaving Soon" card as the other two. According to <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/leaving-soon/grand-theft-auto-iii-and-vice-city-leaving-netflix-games-in-december-2024/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">What's On Netflix</a>, the GTA games were some of the most downloaded in Netflix's library, with San Andreas easily the most popular of the three.</p><p>The GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-now-available-free-through-netflix/1100-6519956/" data-ref-id="1100-6519956">exclusive Netflix mobile release</a> was based on Grove Street Games' remasters for console and PC, but included a number of extra quality-of-life improvements, including a popular "Classic Lighting" mode. Their removal from Netflix comes just after the console and PC remasters received a major update, which added the Classic Lighting mode and other improvements from the mobile editions.</p><p>Netflix subscribers who want to continue playing the mobile versions of GTA 3 and Vice City after December 13 will have to purchase the games outright from the Google Play Store or iOS App Store.</p><p>While movie and TV titles cycle on and off Netflix all the time, this is the first major removal for Netflix's game catalogue, and suggests that not all the titles in the gaming library are there to stay. "Just like with series and film, games will be removed from Netflix as licenses expire," a Netflix representative confirmed. "Players will notice a 'Leaving Soon' badge and be notified by the app itself well in advance of removal."</p>

The ranked competition will reward exclusive cosmetic items to those who reach certain milestones, including an exclusive champion skin that will be awarded only to the player who comes out on top at the end of the season.</p><p>Separate to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-season-1-rank-reset-explained/1100-6527765/" data-ref-id="1100-6527765">Black Ops 6's Prestige ranks</a>, Ranked Play is designed for the most dedicated players who want to play multiplayer matches with the same settings, maps, modes, and weapon restrictions as COD's official esports league. In order to qualify for Ranked Play, players first have to log 50 wins in match-made multiplayer games to unlock access to the ultra-competitive mode. All wins logged since the game was released count towards this, even if the games were played before the start of Season 1.</p><p>Ranked Play has changed a little from previous COD titles, with the ranking system being simplified. In Black Ops 6, players will work through eight ranks: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250. Progress through the ranks can be made by earning Skill Rating (SR), which can also be lost by losing a match.</p><p>The rewards on offer for Ranked players include a number of Ranked Skins for the Competitor operator, which are unlocked starting at Gold rank. These skins will be unlocked as soon as you achieve a new rank, rather than being rewarded at the end of the season--with the exception of the Top 250 and overall Champion skins. The peak reward, which is set to be one of the most exclusive skins in Black Ops 6, is the Champion skin, resembling a flaming, crowned, skull-headed operator.</p><p>Other rewards can be unlocked by reaching certain milestones in Ranked Play, and include the Ranked Competitor Skin, Knife Blueprint, a Frag Grenade Skin, a win-tracking Gunscreen, and more. Each season will also come with its own set of unique seasonal rewards that will only be available to earn during that season.</p><p>Cross-play is mandatory for Ranked Play, meaning console players have the potential to be matched against PC players in all matches. This decision hasn't been popular with fans, with many requesting the option to disable cross-play for the hyper-competitive mode.</p><p>If you're looking at getting competitive in Black Ops 6, check out our guide to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-mp-weapon-loadouts/2900-5960/" data-ref-id="2900-5960">best MP weapon loadouts</a> for Season 1.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> has a new type of cosmetic option for its characters - Kicks - which are, in a nutshell, shoes. 
</p>
<p>
The first pair of Kicks has been viewable within Fortnite since the start of its current Chapter 2 Remix season - a pair of Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG 'Black Toe Reimagined' trainers, which you can unlock as part of the current battle pass. 
</p>
<p>
As of today, however, Kicks are now equippable by (many, though not all) Fortnite character skins. A range of other shoes - sorry, Kicks - are also available to buy. 
</p>
<p>
Starting today, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Nike Cortez Leather OG - 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Air Foamposite One 'Galaxy' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Nike Shox R4 'Comet Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Chomp Stompers - 600 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>
And from tomorrow, you can buy:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Jordan 3 Retro 'Palomino'- 800 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 3 'Black Cement-Gray' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 11 'Black/Gym Red' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
<li>Air Jordan 4 Retro 'Manila' - 1000 V-Bucks</li>
</ul>

<p>I really like the Chomp Stompers - those shark slippers which only cost 600 V-Bucks (around £3-ish?) As a Fortnite-original design, these are cheaper than the other options. There's no way I'm paying 1000 V-Bucks - the price of a battle pass - for anything else.</p>
<p>
Fortnite maker Epic Games says Kicks are currently compatible with over 500 Fortnite skins, with 95 percent of the game's skin library set to be compatible by the spring of next year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/please-square-enix-five-games-that-need-the-hd-2d-treatment/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We shouldn’t be surprised to discover that a good game from the past is still a good game today, but with the huge success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a>, there’s further proof of concept that the corporate heads over at Squeenix will be paying attention to. While we’ve seen wonderful remakes of games like Star Ocean and Live A Live in the past couple of years, there’s still plenty of grist to this digital mill, so, we’ve had a good think, and come up with five other games that are begging for the HD-2D treatment.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VI</h2>
<p>With the producer of Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake saying that he’d love to do this one next, it feels as though this is a thing waiting to happen. Final Fantasy VI is one of the most important releases in the franchise, its release on the SNES paving the way for many gamer’s induction into the series’ fandom, and putting in place some of the series most iconic characters, including the villainous Kefka,</p>



<p>VI was the last Final Fantasy to use a pixel art-style, but it benefits from the improvement in mechanics and storytelling over its predecessors. Sure, we’ve just had the pixel remasters to help preserve this in its original form, but surely this will be the next HD-2D game.</p>
<h2>Final Fantasy Tactics</h2>
<p>Given that Square Enix ‘own’ the idea of the HD-2D remake, it makes sense to plough the Final Fantasy furrow further, and where better to take it than with Final Fantasy Tactics? In a sense, we’ve seen something of what it could look like in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/04/triangle-strategy-review-nintendo-switch/">Triangle Strategy</a>, but Final Fantasy Tactics has sat weirdly dormant amongst the catalogue despite being one of the most iconic and important releases in the Final Fantasy canon.</p>


<p>This strategy game’s in-depth job system, amazing tactical gameplay and memorable characters should surely set it out for a remake or remaster, and HD-2D seems like the perfect way to do that. There are already <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1de4kcu/the_recent_midori_leak_about_visions_of_mana/l8aa74v/">reports and rumours of a remake in the works</a>…</p>
<h2>Chrono Trigger</h2>
<p>Chrono Trigger was the first release in the Chrono series, and though it’s lain mostly dormant since the late 90s, Square Enix have rolled out steady re-releases of this game – heck, I can play it on my Apple TV. Its continued to garner interest because it remains an incredible JRPG, and features the work of a dream team of iconic Japanese creators, Hironobu Sakaguchi, creator of the Final Fantasy series, Yuji Horii, creator of the Dragon Quest series and Akira Toriyama, character designer for Dragon Quest and author of both Dragon Ball and Sand Land. Add to that Takashi Tokita, Kazuhiko Aoki and Masato Kato, and this game’s development team was absolutely stacked.</p>

<p>It’s a literal powerhouse of a design team, and Chrono Trigger bears the hallmarks of all their input, with fantastic storytelling, enjoyable gameplay mechanics, and instantly recognisable characters. Much like Final Fantasy Tactics, it’s a series that’s mostly lain dormant, and is thoroughly ready for a return to our screens, not least because Live A Live had the HD-2D treatment a couple years ago.</p>
<h2>Xenogears</h2>
<p>This would be the pinnacle of HD-2D remakes, at least for me, as the foundation stone in the Xenosaga and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/05/27/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-review-future-connected-switch/">Xenoblade Chronicles</a> series. Originally released in 1998 on PlayStation, it’s strange that its never been returned to as it sits well within the canon of Square’s JRPG heyday.</p>

<p>There’s Active Time Battles, mecha suits, a storyline that draws on both Star Wars and the Bible, and an amazing soundtrack from Yasunori Mitsuda, and its just an incredible piece of RPG history. The fact that it already mixes 2D and 3D visuals means that, structurally at least, it would need less reworking than some of the other suggestions in this list.</p>
<p>It never reached Europe, so that lack of localisation is rumoured to play a major part in why it hasn’t returned. Surely though, the time is now, particularly with the Xenoblade Chronicles series riding high, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-removes-one-more-reason-to-keep-your-wii-u-in-march/">Chronicles X finding its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2025</a>.</p>
<h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
<p>OK, we’re breaking out of Square Enix land for this one, but Nintendo has been one of their most reliable partners, the Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> founding the HD-2D style. Nintendo has traditionally been incredibly protective of their IP, but they’re less averse to partnering with other developers these days, and Square were the founding partners for Super Mario RPG and everything that came since. Sure, they went on a break over some CDs, but that’s ancient history now.</p>

<p>Alongside many other games on this list, The original The Legend of Zelda has been re-released across multiple generations of console, but it’s never been remade or remastered. Now, that could be because Nintendo feels its showing its age as a game, or that they just couldn’t settle on the right way to bring it back up to date. They could give it to Grezzo for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> treatment, but Square Enix’s HD-2D style feels like it would be a perfect match for the earliest Legend of Zelda game and its 8-bit visuals, and it could form an ideal window into the history of the series, while bringing it bang up-to-date.</p>
<h2>Anything from the Squeenix back catalogue</h2>
<p>Square Enix are always looking for an angle – &nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/03/square-enix-confirm-multiple-block-chain-games-in-development-rather-quieter-on-nfts/">like their whole NFT and blockchain nonsense</a> – but while remakes are the safe best, the hip and cool thing these days is actually the demake. Who’s to say that Square Enix couldn’t down-rez some of their more modern games and franchises?</p>

<p>As daft as this might sound, I do actually quite fancy blowing things up with a pixelated Rico Rodriguez in Just Cause HD-2D or some hack and slash pixelated action in Drakengard HD-2D? And while they might have sold off Crystal Dynamics, they kept a hold of their most important game series in the divorce. What about an HD-2D reworking of Gex after next year’s 3D re-release?!&nbsp;OK, maybe that’s a step too far. I should stop now before we revive the <a href="https://kaneandlynch.fandom.com/wiki/Kane_%26_Lynch:_Dead_Men_(Mobile)">Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men mobile game</a>…</p>
<p>What other games would you like to see get the HD-2D treatment?</p>

The other <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859354951140421781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">two emotes</a> haven’t been revealed, but we know one will be with Eminem, and the other will feature Juice WRLD’s unreleased music.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Creators and consumers are tangling with the use of generative AI in everything from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">games</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-ai-made-secret-invasion-opening-prompts-response-from-studio-after-backlash/1100-6515426/" data-ref-id="1100-6515426">TV-show opening sequences</a>, and the sentiment on AI seems to be shifting. To help consumers make decisions about which games to buy, game storefront Itch.io now requires all creators to disclose the use of generative AI in games, Itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran announced in a <a href="https://itch.io/t/4309690/generative-ai-disclosure-tagging" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post to the site</a>.</p><p>The text of the post itself is fairly straightforward, directed primarily at the creators who will have to disclose this information.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080" data-ratio="0.47015610651974" data-width="1089" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png" data-ref-id="1300-4403080"></a><figcaption>Itch.io's generative-AI disclosure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1603/16030002/4403080-ai-generated-itch.png"></figure><p>"We’ve deployed a new field to project edit pages called 'Generative AI disclosure.' This field asks if your project contains the results of generative AI. If you select yes, then we also ask what kinds of generative AI you utilize, including Graphics, Sound, Text &amp; Dialog, and Code," Corcoran wrote. Selecting Yes will give your project an "AI Generated" tag, while selecting No will give it a "No AI" tag.</p><p>Importantly, though, Corcoran notes that "Assets comprised of generative AI (even if modified afterwards) that are not tagged will no longer be eligible for indexing on [Itch.io's] browse pages." The project won't be removed, but will not show up when browsing, and must be discovered through search or a direct link.</p><p>Corcoran is careful not to make a moral judgment of the use of AI, and Itch.io's Content Creator Quality Guidelines state that "we are strictly enforcing disclosure for all game asset pages due to legal ambiguity around rights associated with Generative AI content."</p><p>As Itch takes this measure, many game developers and publishers are moving to clarify their stances on the technology, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ms-flight-sim-24-dev-on-why-the-game-needed-to-use-machine-learning-and-ai/1100-6527889/" data-ref-id="1100-6527889">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-executive-promotes-ai-game-development-shortly-after-huge-layoffs/1100-6527567/" data-ref-id="1100-6527567">Netflix</a>, and others.</p>

[...] We’ll have a grace period for people to update their pages, then we’ll likely use user reports to handle pages that have not been addressed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Itch has rolled out a bulk tagging tool to simplify the process for asset creators with multiple pages. Asset creators who confirm their project contains generative AI outputs will automatically be handed the 'Generative AI' tag.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company has also added sub-tags to cover AI Generated Graphics, AI Generated Sound, AI Generated Text &amp; Dialog, and AI Generated Code.

As for those who attempt to circumvent the tagging system, Itch said assets featuring undisclosed generative AI outputs–including those modified after they were uploaded–will no longer be eligible for indexing on its browse pages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It said individual users can report assets they suspect might have flouted the new rules, but the company will largely be trusting asset creators to police themselves for the moment. "We're letting creators tag their work at their own pace to ensure that we have the classifications in place to provide better filtering," it added.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>The award-winning <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is seemingly the gift that keeps on giving.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse revealed that the game's average daily peak concurrents are up by a not-to-be-sniffed-at three percent this year over last year, when Baldur's Gate 3 launched.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, its average daily active users are up by a more substantial 20 percent over last year. "If you zoom out on our sales chart it looks like the heartbeat of a happy little guy," Douse wrote on social media platform X.</p>

<p>These increases, Douse has implied, are thanks to mods (they are "very good", in his words).</p>
<p>Back in October, Larian celebrated 50m mod downloads since it released Patch 7 (which<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-next-week-on-pc-bringing-modding-support-and-more-evil-endings"> introduced mod-support to the fantasy role playing game</a>). At this same time, the developer said 10k of those mod downloads were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-modders-really-want-to-change-withers-name-to-bone-daddy">players changing Baldur's Gate 3's mysterious Undead entity Withers' name to Bone Daddy</a><em>.</em></p>

<p>In June, Larian head Swen Vincke stated Baldur's Gate 3's official mod support would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">handover moment to players</a>, though the studio will continue to provide updates afterwards.</p>
<p>As for what's next, Larian previously confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-initially-started-work-on-a-follow-up-as-it-was-the-obvious-thing">Balder's Gate 4 was briefly toyed with</a> before the studio decided to try something new instead. The developer is yet to formally reveal its next project, it has confirmed two games are currently in the works - both of which will be based on its own IPs and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-studio-confirms-two-new-projects-will-be-our-best-work-ever">described as the studio's "best work ever"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
