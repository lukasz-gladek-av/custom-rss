            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-revealed-hero-shooter-fragpunk-deals-alpha-test-this-month-to-show-card-based-twist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
FragPunk, the new hero shooter revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase earlier this week, will have a closed alpha test on Steam at the end of the month.
</p>
<p>
The five-versus-five free-to-play online shooter is vibrantly stylised with a card-based twist, where players include shard cards in their loadout to modify the rules of gameplay.
</p>
<p>
News of the alpha comes alongside an extended trailer you can watch below.

<p>
Developer Bad Guitar boasts FragPunk is "endlessly replayable" thanks to its selection of heroes, weapons and maps, but mainly its shard cards.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will include 70 of the shard cards, which as per the trailer include flipping the world upside down, dragon's breath to power up weapons, adding an electrifying chain reaction to bullets, slicing projectiles as a blade master, sprouting long grass or strange plants, giving opponents a big head for easier kills, and more.
</p>
<p>
There will also be 10 playable heroes with unique abilities, four playable maps, and 15 weapons to wield in the alpha test.
</p>
<p>
The alpha test will run from 27th June until 1st July, with a focus on North America. Registration is open on the <a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/#/">game's website</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/">Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>
FragPunk is set for full release in 2025 across Xbox Series X/S and PC, so this alpha test provides a very early look.

            <p>
Sony is rolling out the ability to join Discord calls from your PlayStation 5 without relying on the service's PC or mobile apps.
</p>
<p>
This means you can now use the Discord tab in the PS5 Control Center to access a Discord server or DM group directly, and from there pick from the available voice channels to join. 
</p>
<p>
You might not see the option available today - Sony says it is rolling out first in Japan, before Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East and finally the Americas in the coming weeks. See how it all looks in the video below:

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/discord-voice-chat-now-available-on-playstation-5">PlayStation initially added Discord integration a year ago</a>, though until now it hasn't been a seamless process - requiring you to transfer calls over from the separate Discord app.</p>
<p>
One other new feature coming to PS5 from this week is the ability to share your PSN profile to quickly connect with others. You can generate a shareable link from your console or the PlayStation App and then send it to a friend via any other messaging service.
</p>
<p>
It's been a busy time for PlayStation, which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-is-a-perfect-match-a-breezy-light-hearted-approach-the-series-has-perhaps-always-needed">recently shown off Lego Horizon Adventures for the first time</a> - a bold new take on its blockbuster franchise that's also coming to Nintendo Switch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-owe-you-44-quid-according-to-a-656-lawsuit-against-the-company-for-allegedly-overcharging-uk-customers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  

        <p>“We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games”</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>In what is possibly the biggest scandal the UK has seen since the last time the price of Freddos went up, a digital rights campaigner is suing Valve for £656m in compensation, accusing the company of overcharging and anti-competitive behaviour. The accompanying <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">website</a> describes the collective action claim as a “ground-breaking legal action,” which is very gamer of them. 16 times the litigation, etc.</p>

<p>“Valve Corporation faces a £656 million collective action claim for overcharging 14 million PC gamers and abusing its dominant position in the UK,” reads the website. “We believe Valve Corporation has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products,” it continues, also accusing the “gaming giant” of “charging an excessive commission – of up to 30% – to publishers.”</p>
<p>If the claim is successful, then you - yes, you! - could be eligible for up to £44 in compensation, if you’re based in the UK and have bought either a game or “add-on game content” since the 5th of June 2018. The total £656 million appears to come from the 14 million UK based PC gamers the website alleges “could” have been overcharged by Valve. Here’s a look at the ‘key stats’ on the site. Cowardly move not to go full hog and make it look like an RPG character sheet, honestly.</p>

</figure>
<p>This is all being headed up by digital-rights activist Vicki Shotbolt and legal firm Milberg London LLP. The firm were also involved in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">£5bn lawsuit against Sony</a> in 2022, who they alleged “ripped people off” by charging a 30% commission on PlayStation Store purchases. Valve themselves faced a similar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-lawsuit-accuses-valve-of-abusing-steam-market-power-to-prevent-price-competition">antitrust class action legal-me-doo</a> in 2021, though that appears to have gone nowhere.</p>
<p>As both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-sued-for-5bn-for-ripping-people-off-on-playstation-store">Eurogamer</a> and the website’s FAQ point out, this current story could take years before anything more of note happens. Personally speaking, maybe there’s something in that 30% publisher commission being a touch high, but I’ve got no idea how much it realistically takes to keep something like Steam running.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ps5-system-update-24-04-09-40-00-allows-players-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-ps5-and-more.900132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-ps5-system-update-24-04-09-40-00-discord/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has started to deploy PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00, allowing players to start or join Discord voice chat directly from their PS5 console.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official blog post</a> on the PS Blog, the new firmware will be rolled out over the coming weeks, starting for PS5 owners in Japan and Asia, followed by those in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and the US. We can confirm, however, that the new system update has already been rolled out in Europe.</p>
<p>Support for Discord was already available on Sony's console, but this latest update makes it easier for players to access voice chat by allowing direct access to voice chat from the PS5 console. As such, players will no longer have to rely on using applications or Discord PC to start or join Discord voice chat.</p>
<h2><strong><em>How to join Discord voice chat on PS5</em></strong></h2>
<p><em>To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join. Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</em></p>
<p>In addition to making access to Discord easier, PS5 system update 24.04-09.40.00 also allows PS5 child accounts to link and add third-party services as well as apps for the PSN account. Also, the new firmware version includes improvements the device software for the PULSE Elite wireless headset, PULSE Explore wireless earbuds, and PlayStation Link USB adapter.</p>
<p>As always with Sony's system updates, this new one once again further improves the PS5's system software performance and stability. You can check out the full release notes <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for this new system update here</a>. Interestingly enough, Sony's official blog post mentions the option to share a PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, but the official release notes don't mention this new option.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 is available worldwide now. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> last month, more than 59.2 million PS5 consoles have been sold globally since the console's launch back in November of 2020.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-amd-fsr-3-0-frame-generation-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Valhalla AMD FSR 3.0 Frame Generation mod has been released online, bringing considerable performance improvements in a variety of scenarios.</p>
<p>The new mod, developed by well-known modder PureDark, brings considerably better performance, more than double in most benchmark scenarios, in conjunction with the FSR 3.0 Performance setting on a ROG Ally, as shown by the modder in a new test video. Unfortunately, the mod is not available for free right now and is only available for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark">Patreon supporters.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla FSR3 on ROG Ally" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AnZXt02JjQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-nvidia-dlss-3-rtx/">Last month</a>, PureDark also released an Assassin’s Creed Valhalla NVIDIA DLSS 3, which supports both Super Resolution and Frame Generation, which work extremely well. NVIDIA Reflex support also ensures that input delay is kept as low as possible.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is the latest main entry in the open-world series by Ubisoft. Released back in 2020, the game was later expanded with multiple expansions, although the base game is already a massive experience, as well as an enjoyable one, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a definite step up for the series, thanks to the many tweaks made to the RPG mechanics that powered the previous two entries in the series, better storytelling, great atmosphere, and meaningful side-content. Even with the tweaks, however, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is still an Assassin's Creed game at heart, so those who are not into the Ubisoft open-world game design will hardly change their opinion with the game. Everyone else will probably love every second of Eivor's adventure, especially if they are into Vikings and ancient Norse culture.</em></p>

  <p id="rzY2vD"><strong>Weapons </strong>are the most important tools in your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-now-guides"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a> arsenal.</p>
<p id="cr8aA0">This mobile version of the series stripped back the usual roster of weapons down to six choices at launch, locking them behind story quest progression or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635639">Hunter Rank</a> progress, with more being introduced with seasonal updates over time.</p>
<p id="jcJqDn">Despite smaller number of weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, there are a couple of ranged options and series staples, such as the Great Sword, giving you some variety to play around with.</p>
<hr id="tRFQUJ">
<h2 id="MX1pj6"><strong>Monster Hunter Now weapons list: How many weapons are there?</strong></h2>
<p id="x9QCVz">To date, the roster of weapons in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="r1Cnx2">Sword and Shield</li>
<li id="rQj8kE">Great Sword</li>
<li id="tI2EN1">Bow</li>
<li id="z7vcxd">Hammer</li>
<li id="YVCF8X">Light Bowgun</li>
<li id="xSg1Aa">Long Sword</li>
<li id="NC8rcK">Dual Blades (added in Dec. 2023’s “Fulminations in the Frost” update)</li>
<li id="8toloA">Lance (added in Dec. 2023’s “Fulminations in the Frost” update)</li>
<li id="LzMg9Q">Charge Blade (added in March 2024’s “The Vernal Invader” update)</li>
<li id="QBs9gl">Gunblade (added in June 2024’s “Dancing in the Tempest“ update)</li>
</ul>
<p id="4Ial3w">Developers Niantic and Capcom have confirmed new weapon types will continue to be added to the game as seasons progress, so for those familiar with the main series, hopefully your favorites will roll out before too long.</p>

<p id="cnL5X3">To begin with, you’ll only have access to the Sword and Shield, albeit with multiple variations by forging together parts from slaying large <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635999">monsters</a>.</p>
<p id="6LkBCI">To unlock new weapon types in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, <strong>you must progress through the main story quest. </strong>In Chapter 2, you’ll first unlock three more weapons, and just a few steps later, you’ll get the remaining roster of weapons.</p>
<p id="wDSasH">Specifically, you need to reach the following points in the story:</p>
<ul>
<li id="MBNPmT">
<strong>To unlock the Great Sword, Dual Blades, and Lance,</strong> complete the first stage of “Chapter 2: Shimmering Swamp” in the main story.</li>
<li id="dvtNST">
<strong>To unlock the Bow, Hammer, Light Bowgun, and Long Sword, </strong>reach <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23635639">Hunter Rank 15</a>.</li>
<li id="st0AFM">
<strong>Finally, weapons added in seasons (Dual Blades, Lance, Charge Blade, Gunblade), </strong>will be available automatically.</li>
</ul>
<p id="t3bUId">These pre-requisites aren’t too far into your <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> journey — requiring just a few hours of play. Of course, that might be staggered out depending on how much you’re able to explore, with many story steps based on collecting resources, which will be limited if you are playing in just a single spot.</p>

<h2 id="ahiZBC"><strong>When will new weapon types arrive in Monster Hunter Now?</strong></h2>
<p id="aquF4D">New weapon types — alongside new monsters and story updates — will be coming to <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> as part of major quarterly updates.</p>
<p id="Kn6IO1">The first of these was “Fulminations in the Frost,” arriving Dec. 2023, which introduced the Dual Blades and Lance.</p>
<p id="04Xnzy">The iconic Charge Blade was added in March 2024 as part of the “The Vernal Invader” update, while the Gunblade was added in June 2024’s “Dancing in the Tempest”.</p>
<p id="AZNwEA">From here, expect more weapons to be rolled out in subsequent updates.</p>

<p>PlayStation has announced that Discord voice chat will finally make its way to the PlayStation 5 directly. </p>



<p>In its new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/?sf273538206=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog update</a>, PlayStation has announced that players will soon be able to join Discord voice chat directly from the PS5 console, without relying on the Discord PC or mobile apps to initiate the connection. Previously, players had to manually transfer calls to their PlayStation 5 from their Discord app using a PS or mobile. </p>



<p>According to the blog, the update will roll out in the “coming weeks,” starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, the Middle East, and finally, the Americas.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-discord-voice-chat-on-ps5">How to join Discord voice chat on PS5</h2>



<p>To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join. Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.</p>



<p>This update will make it easier than ever to quickly hop into Discord conversations with other gamers. It will gradually roll out over the coming weeks, starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas.</p>



<p>Please note that you will need to&nbsp;update your console&nbsp;to the latest system software, and your accounts for PlayStation Network and Discord must be linked. If you haven’t yet linked accounts, you can learn how to do so&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/support/subscriptions/link-psn-status-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>



<p>Will you be using Discord on your PlayStation 5? Let us know down in the comments below!</p>

<p data-characters="252" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The day has finally arrived. After three years of Epic Games Store exclusivity, the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series will make its debut on Steam later today, and Square Enix has handily shared exact launch times for when the games will be available for purchase.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">We already have <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a breakdown on exactly which <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> titles will be available</a> but, as a quick reminder, there will be seven games across three separate compilations (plus three movies), and you can purchase all of them as part of a <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em> collection. As for when you can actually start playing them, below is a list of release times for every timezone <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1800513569290924305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">as provided by Square Enix</a>:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="580" data-injectable="true"> <li>Los Angeles—9am PDT June 13</li> <li>New York—12pm EDT June 13</li> <li>Brazil—1pm BRT June 13</li> <li>London—5pm BST June 13</li> <li>Berlin—6pm CEST June 13</li> <li>Tokyo—1am JST June 14</li> <li>Australia—2am AEST June 14</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">At the time of writing, no prices have been shared, but I have to imagine the games will cost about the same as they do on other platforms:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX</em>—$49.99/£39.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts 3 + Re Mind</em>—$59.99/£49.99</li> <li><em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>—$89.99/£79.99</li> </ul> <p data-characters="803" data-current-count="1102" data-injectable="true">While this is a meaty collection of games, and perfect for anyone looking to get into <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, it doesn’t include any of the mobile games. Said mobile games can’t be played anymore, but you can still download them to watch their cutscenes (or watch them on YouTube) if you crave extra lore and backstory. What’s more puzzling, though, is that this Steam line-up doesn’t include <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory</a></em>, a rhythm game spin-off released after <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a></em>. It’s available on every other platform, including the Epic Games Store, and yet there’s been no mention of a Steam release. Hopefully, it’s only a matter of time since aside from being a very fun game in its own right, it has important plot details that help lead into <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Speaking of <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, the game was sadly absent from Summer Game Fest, and while there have been rumours of it launching in 2025 or 2026, Square Enix has yet to share any official info. Given the publisher intends on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/expect-more-multiplatform-square-enix-games-as-company-pledges-itself-to-new-aggressive-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“aggressively pursuing” a multiplatform strategy</a> going forward, perhaps we’ll see <em>KH4</em> launch on consoles and PC at the same time, which would be ideal.</p>

		<p><span data-contrast="auto">We’re getting ever closer to that all-important release date of 2</span><span data-contrast="auto">nd</span><span data-contrast="auto"> July and our first visit to Tural, the supposed “New World” of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail, and based on the trailer we’re in for another amazing experience. The sweeping vistas, local cultures, and – of course – the food all look enticing. It’s shaping up to be the holiday we (and the Warrior of Light) have been waiting for. In the meantime, if you want to take a short break in Eorzea (and beyond) and get your tan started or just relax while you wait, we’ve got you covered with our travel guide to the best places to visit in Final Fantasy XIV. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em>Warning: minor spoilers for Final Fantasy XIV ahead.&nbsp;</em></p>


<h3><strong>The Churning Mists</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">It’s not the easiest place to get to, given that you must travel through Dravania to reach them, but those without a fear of heights will love the views from the floating islands of The Churning Mists. One for thrill seekers, regardless of vertigo, as you need to be constantly aware of the dragons that reside in the region and there aren’t any safety rails to be seen anywhere. The tourist bureau also advises that you keep a keen eye on your belongings as moogles are known to frequent the area.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>


<h3><strong>Tamamizu</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Nestled beneath the waves of the Ruby Sea, yes you read that right, is the beautiful town of Tamamizu. Inhabited by the industrious kojin, this underwater dome contains some of the most breathtaking sights in Eorzea, and you don’t even have to hold your breath to witness them. Once you’ve settled into the town, you can also pay a small fee for excursions to nearby sights like the Shisui of the Violet Tides, a resplendent palace between the waves. The only downside is having the lung capacity to get there!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Eulmore</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">You deserve to treat yourself, and nowhere says decadence more than Eulmore. If you have a lot of money to spend, you can gorge yourself with some of the best food and drink in existence – we would recommend the meol – while surrounded by the upper crust of Kholusia. After nightfall, you can visit the Beehive; a nightclub with music, dancing performers and strong drinks that’s open all hours. We’ve heard reports of suspect news coming from the area, but these rumours are unsubstantiated.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Gridania</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Those seeking a return to a simpler life should visit the city of Gridania nestled in the Shroud. There’s no wi-fi, and the tomestone signal is poor, but surrounding the city are some of the best rambling routes you can find. You can wander to Bentbranch Meadows and meet the friendly chocobo farmers of the woods, stop to watch the soldiers of the Twin Adders in training, or those with a thirst for danger can even visit Sorrel Haven. This is the best option for those wanting to get away from modern life.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>New Sharlayan</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Do you love places with a deep and rich history? Being surrounded by beautiful architecture? How about insular and elitist people? What about a stellar cup of coffee? Well, New Sharlayan has you covered. Explore the pseudo-Ancient Greek architecture, get in trouble exploring the gigantic (but restricted) libraries, or just wander the beautiful harbourside. Any seeker of knowledge and culture will find plenty to enjoy here, if you have the approval of the Forum to enjoy it.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Mandeville Gold Saucer</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">A mere airship ride from Ul’dah is the glittering and gaudy Gold Saucer. Staffed by girls in bunny outfits, suited cactuars and owned by a studly gentleman with an aversion to clothing, you can fritter away hours in palatial decadence. With card games, arcade machines, chocobo races, mahjong and other events every 20 minutes, you will always find something to do. The best part? The place operates on its own currency system, saving you from needing to dip into your gil coffers!</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Costa del Sol</strong></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Obviously, this was going to be top of the list. Just a short hike away from the towering Limsa Lominsa is a beautiful stretch of golden beaches. You can take a swim in the crystal blue waters, soak in the atmosphere at one of the beach-side bars or drop down onto the beaches to take on a myriad of creatures that patrol the coastline. The only points it loses are from the annual festival that sees a strange obstacle course take over the coast, but that’s a small price to pay for beaches like this.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}">&nbsp;</span></p>

First <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/8/23630228/sony-ps5-update-discord-1440p-vrr-support">launched last year</a>, Discord support on PS5 currently requires you to manually transfer a call to a console by using the Discord app on mobile or PC. Sony is now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/">rolling out an update</a> that integrates Discord directly into the PS5 dashboard so you can select the server or DM group you want to join.</p><p>The update is rolling out gradually over the coming weeks, starting with PS5 owners in Japan and Asia followed by Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, and then finally the US and Canada. You’ll need to update your PS5 to the latest system software to get this new Discord integration, and a PlayStation Network account will need to be linked to your Discord account, too.</p><p>“To start, select the Discord tab in Game Base within the PS5 Control Center and choose the Discord server or DM group you’d like to join,” explains Sabrina Meditz, senior director of product management for the PlayStation platform experience. “Then, select your preferred voice channel. This will reveal more details, such as who is already in the channel chatting. You’ll also receive a PS5 console notification when another Discord user calls you, allowing you to join right away.”</p><p>This latest PS5 update puts the Discord experience nearly on par with what Microsoft offers on the Xbox. Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/20/23271170/discord-xbox-voice-calls-integration-hands-on">first offered Discord support on Xbox</a> in July 2022 for testers, before then rolling out an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/16/23460701/xbox-november-update-discord-voice-channels-deals-capture">improved experience</a> without the need for a phone in November 2022. Discord on Xbox was also updated to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/2/23816949/discord-xbox-stream-feature-testing-xbox-insiders">let you stream your gameplay</a> to friends last year.</p><p>Sony is also rolling out the ability to share your PlayStation Network profile on any messaging or social app, with a new share profile option in the PlayStation mobile app next week. The feature generates a shareable link or QR code so people can easily add you as a friend.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Claim accuses Steam maker of market dominance and overcharging consumers</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Steam is facing a £656 million collective action claim, brought forward by a digital rights campaigner who has accused Valve of using market dominance to overcharge 14 million UK consumers.</p>
<p>The claim was filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal on June 5, brought forward by Vicki Shotbolt.</p>
<p>"Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers," Shotbolt told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cpwwyj6v24xo">BBC News</a>.</p>
<p>She said the claim was filed "to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed."</p>
<p>The claim also accused Valve of "forcing" publishers to sign up to pricing restrictions, in addition to charging publishers commissions of up to 30%.</p>
<p>"We believe that Valve has been unfairly shutting out competition for PC games and in-game content, which has meant that UK customers have paid too much for these products," a statement read on an <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/the-claim/">accompanying website</a> for the claim.</p>
<p>Shotbolt is represented by Milberg London LLP, which represented consumer rights expert Alex Neill in bringing forth a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/legal-claim-filed-against-sony-over-30-store-cut">similar claim against Sony in 2022</a>, in which the firm was accused of overcharging players, developers, and publishers.</p>

<p data-characters="290" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following a short delay, it’s finally time to get our hands on <em>Fortnite</em>‘s v30.10 update, which brings a host of Metallica content including a concert and a new weapon, an updated Loot Island, and changes to <em>LEGO Fortnite</em> and <em>Rocket Racing</em>. Check out the full patch notes below. </p> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em>‘s 30.10 patch was originally scheduled to drop on June 11, but after a two-day delay, it’s finally here. The headline addition, of course, is the Metallica collaboration, which is taking place across all of <em>Fortnite</em>‘s modes. </p> <h2 id="h-fortnite-v30-10-patch-notes" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite</em> v30.10 patch notes</h2>  <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true">Fancy experiencing six of Metallica’s biggest songs as you’ve never experienced them before? Then get ready for Fuel. Fire. Fury, a six-song in-game concert that will take place over the weekend of June 22. </p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">Unsurprisingly, Metallica is headed for <em>Fortnite Festival</em>, where they’ll take part in a PvP Battle Stage where 16 players enter and one is left standing, kind of like a musical battle royale. </p> <figure data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>“Exit light! Enter night!” Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false">Of course, all four members are also available as skins too, included in the <em>Fortnite</em> Festival Season 4 Premium Reward Track. Players will unlock Lars Ulrich as soon as they purchase the track, with James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo unlocked by earning XP and ranking up. Special “Master of Puppets” versions will also be available to purchase in the in-game store.</p> <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">There’s also a special Metallica-themed <em>Rocket Racing</em> track which plays Fuel in the background as you speed around, so there are plenty of ways for fans of the band to celebrate. </p>
  <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As part of the crossover, a special Metallica-themed Loot Island is coming to Battle Royale! In the middle of every match, the floating island will appear from a rift, with a stage on top inspired by the one used on their M72 World Tour. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Epic Games says that if you “rock out to the holographic James, Lars, Kirk, and Robert,” you’ll be able to capture the POI, and the loot that comes with it. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>It’ll just appear in the sky. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-ride-the-lightning-guitars" data-injectable="false">Ride the Lightning guitars</h2> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="498" data-injectable="true">Ride the Lightning guitars are one of two new additions to the loot pool, allowing players to create a lightning bolt in the sky that you and your teammates can ride on to rotate around the island. </p>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">This Mythic item is available as both ground loot or from Chests, so grab one and take to the sky. </p> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>This thing looks awesome. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-tow-hook-cannon" data-injectable="false">Tow Hook Cannon</h2> <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">Epic has also added the Tow Hook Cannon, a new weapon that should help you combat all those <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pesky vehicles</a> driving around. </p>
 <p data-characters="103" data-current-count="103" data-injectable="false">Fire it at a car, and you’ll be able to slow it down, making it harder for them to run you over. </p> <figure data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Anything to slow down these vehicles is great for me. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-cozy-and-expert-mode-in-lego-fortnite" data-injectable="false">Cozy and Expert Mode in <em>LEGO Fortnite</em></h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">Epic has given us more ways to play <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-lego-fortnite-a-battle-royale-game-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Fortnite</a></em> by dropping two new difficulty levels. Cozy Mode makes enemies easier to fight, turns of Storm-Wild creatures entirely, removes hunger, temperature, and stamina, and lets you keep your inventory when you die. </p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="false">Expert, meanwhile, is for those who really want a challenge, as the Storm-Wild enemies deal more damage, have more health, and move faster than regular creatures. It’s also a hardcore mode, which means that when you die, that’s it. No more respawns unless you have a Totem of Return. </p>

			<p>Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, the first and only expansion to Elden Ring, PC Gamer <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-developers-know-most-players-use-guides-but-still-try-to-cater-to-those-who-go-in-blind-if-they-cant-do-it-then-theres-some-room-for-improvement-on-our-behalf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> game creator and FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki and asked whether the development team was aware of how many players had to use guides to complete their games, and if it changed anything in their design plans.</p>
<p>Miyazaki said:</p>
<p><em>Of course players are going to consult guides, and there's going to be a wealth of information on the web and in their communities where they have access to the secrets and the strategies. We expect that. We obviously understand players use guides, but we don't make or plan anything with that as a prerequisite. If anything, we try to cater to the player who is completely blind and wants to go through organically. If they can't do it, then there's some room for improvement on our behalf, and we'd like to try to embrace those players more in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>We don't necessarily cater to players who are reading guides as they go. Of course, it's a perfectly valid playstyle, and we respect those players who like to approach it with a guide in hand. We just want to let you know it's not our prerequisite, designing the game in their favor.</em></p>
<p>You are absolved of the 'sin' from the man himself, then. That said, Miyazaki also believes that everyone who went far enough into Elden Ring to be able to access Shadow of the Erdtree won't have too much problem with the expansion's new obstacles.</p>
<p><em>We have faith that they will be able to continue, find these secrets, and overcome these challenges.</em></p>
<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launches is out on Friday, June 21; look forward to our review soon. By the way, FromSoftware just <a href="http://1800890964925366476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Elden Ring has passed 25 million units sold to date.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-support-ps-vr2.900072/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-devs-explain-why-the-game-doesnt-support-ps-vr2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Astro Bot is arguably Sony's most promising first-party exclusive for 2024 in a year otherwise devoid of big releases. The platform game <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-revealed-ps5-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked great</a> on its State of Play debut, but it won't support PS VR2 despite the franchise launching on the first PS VR headset with 2018's Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p>
<p>At Summer Game Fest 2024, Push Square <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/06/ps5s-astro-bot-doesnt-support-psvr2-because-it-was-never-designed-to-do-so" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asked</a> Team Asobi's Studio Director and Creative Director Nicolas Doucet why. You can read his response below.</p>
<p><em>So, we focused 100% on this one from the get-go after Astro's Playroom. It was the hope that if it was welcome, it could be a platformer that stands on its own feet, and we could go off to make a bigger version of it. So no, PS VR2 was not a consideration.</em></p>
<p><em>When we talk about VR versus non-VR, for a game like Astro, if you were to make a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. And if it's not a VR version, it has to be fully designed for that medium. Certain games can afford to be hybrid, like first-person games, because there's a closer similarity. But in our case, the design philosophy for both are very, very different. So, you know, it was a decision to expand on the world of Astro's Playroom and bring Astro to the big stage. So, from the beginning, that was really our focus.</em></p>
<p>Another possible reason is that Astro Bot is by far the <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-is-the-biggest-game-made-by-team-asobi-with-80-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest game in the franchise yet</a>, featuring around 80 levels spread across six planets. This inevitably means a larger investment from Sony, which will be interested in selling as many copies as possible. PS VR2 isn't doing too well, and it would certainly have limited the game's sales potential if it was only available for the VR headset.</p>
<p>Astro Bot will be released for PlayStation 5 on September 6. However, given Sony's stance on PC, it's likely the game will be ported to the platform in the next couple of years.</p>

A demo will also be available. <span id="more-891976"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via ACQUIRE:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>Scars of Mars</em> is a new real-time RPG. During combat and exploration, time flows, so you must make split-second decisions, execute precise commands swiftly, and vanquish enemies within a limited time. It’s a thrilling experience that captures the unique tension and satisfaction of the gameplay.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>December 6, 2158.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You take on the role of a commander of a humanoid unit, embarking on a top-secret mission to rescue survivors and escape from a research facility on Mars, which suddenly lost contact.</p><p><strong>Real-time Formation Battle</strong></p><p>Engage in strategic combat where you control four humanoids in a 3×3 grid, making real-time decisions on their <a title="Genres > Action [1,929 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Every move counts as you decide which characters to control, when to attack, dodge, heal, or protect. The constant flow of time demands tactical positioning and precise timing, creating an immersive and strategic battle experience.</p><p><strong>Character Customization</strong></p><p>Assemble a party of four humanoids and take on missions. Each humanoid can be customized by combining different classes, frames, and weapons, allowing for a wide range of character variations. Whether you prefer a Sniper who attacks from afar but moves slowly, a Fighter who swiftly slashes through enemies, a Berserker specialized in close combat but with low defense, or a Healer focused on support and defense, the choice is yours.</p><p><strong>Battery Consumption</strong></p><p>Routes are procedurally generated for each playthrough, offering different paths, but you can select your movements to progress without getting lost. Every enemy encounter, event, and item container changes in each playthrough, making battery management crucial. Battles, events, and route movements all consume time, gradually depleting your battery. To succeed, you must make precise decisions based on your party’s condition and remaining battery power. Whether you aim for defeating the boss at the deepest level or return midway for equipment and item collection, player wisdom and experience are vital for success.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The protagonist pilots a power armor called Paladin to fight giant demons by using their own weapons against them.</p><p>The key components of the swordplay mechanic includes the ability to equip and use any weapon dropped by defeated enemies, high versus low attacking and blocking, a rock-paper-scissor weapon type system that grants attack bonuses, and the ability to cast spells by breaking weapons. Weapons abound in levels, so the player is encouraged to use them profusely. The Paladin is the main means to fight enemies but players can eject and also play as the swifter and smaller pilot called a Squire. The Squire uses a laser whip to attack enemies, swing across gaps, and recharge the Paladin’s energy.</p><p><em>Panzer Paladin</em> lets the player choose the order in which to complete the first 10 levels of the game.

Gauntlet recommissions Flame, a former rescue operations android, to become a Squire and take control of the last remaining Paladin unit, a state of the art power armor capable of wielding Spirit Weapons.</p><p>To arms! Overseeing their operations from aboard the Avalon, their flying headquarters, Gauntlet is ready. The showdown between mankind’s highest technological prowesses and the powerful forces of the occult has begun! It’s up to Squire Flame and her Paladin named Grit to defeat all Weapon Keepers, and ultimately face off against Ravenous, the sinister leader of the invasion.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="kxuMhj"><strong>Interceptions</strong> are how you encounter Elder Dragons in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/monster-hunter-now-guides"><em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a> .</p>
<p id="bBtBDj">First introduced in June 2024’s Dancing in the Tempest update with the arrival of Kushala Daora, Interceptions are a mix of the game’s Hunt-a-thon events and <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24168766/raid-schedule-legendary-mega-shadow-five-star">raids</a>, where hunters team up to take down a rare, powerful creature.</p>
<p id="8p7fPK">Here’s how Elder Dragon Interceptions work in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, and the list of Elder Dragons added to the game so far.</p>

<hr id="V1ZNNt">
<h2 id="lYYZjh"><strong>Elder Dragon Interceptions release time</strong></h2>
<p id="QdReTg">Elder Dragon Interceptions will debut as part of Season 2 Dancing in the Tempest on <strong>Thursday, June 13</strong>, with the first events appearing from <strong>12 p.m. local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="JAnnlq">From there, they will rotate in and out of Gathering Points throughout the day, starting from around 7:15 a.m. until around 10:45 a.m.</p>
<hr id="KL5F0S">

<p id="AJvefr">Similar to Hunt-a-Thons, Elder Dragon Interceptions are events which <strong>appear on the map at Gathering Points for a limited time</strong>. Approach the encounter before the timer ends to begin.</p>
<p id="q5e6Kb">In battle, a key difference with Elder Dragon Interceptions is <strong>the health bar is split into two</strong>. If you reach the halfway point (known as the “repel” phase), you will receive monster parts even if you don’t complete the rest of the encounter. Additionally, you will still receive a reward if you only manage around 20% of the overall health bar.</p>

<p id="opsMg4">The time limit for Elder Dragon Interceptions<strong> are longer than most battles</strong>, with each of the two phases lasting around 75 seconds, likely to account for the higher difficulty of the encounter.</p>
<p id="zH2xtl">Finally, similar to Hunt-a-thons, solo players who enter an Elder Dragon Interception <strong>will have matchmaking</strong>; simply wait in the lobby when you first join until it populates with other players. They will also have a<strong> cooldown of 180 minutes</strong>, unless you purchase and use an Ultra Hunting Ticket from the in-game shop.</p>
<hr id="e9CEsI">
<h2 id="w9s1y9"><strong>Elder Dragons list in Monster Hunter Now</strong></h2>
<p id="J0PAsQ">For those new to Monster Hunter, Elder Dragons are among the rarest and most powerful creatures in the game — described by Niantic as “monsters that have existed since ancient times and possess characteristics that transcend human knowledge.”</p>
<p id="TNkEm1">As with <em>Pokémon Go</em>’s Legendaries, it’s likely they will be rotated in and out of the game through Interceptions over time.</p>
<p id="8VFQG9">The Elder Dragons that have appeared in <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> so far are:</p>
<ul><li id="xFTvJU">Kushala Daora (appeared June 2024)</li></ul>
<p id="G3MwQQ">With more than 40 Elder Dragons appearing in the series as a whole so far, there’s many more for the game to catch up on — though the rate at which we’ll see them is currently unknown. </p>
<p id="pjDWMv">You can get a sense of how many there are in this graphic of their rollout, generation-by-generation, on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/wvoqyp/thought_id_make_a_post_that_shows_how_many_elder/">Monster Hunter subreddit</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-final-shape-end-to-light-and-darkness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2014, the launch of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/destiny"><em>Destiny</em></a> promised the start of an epic ten-year story. It was a promise echoed by other live-service games that rose (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/marvels-avengers-11-months-later">and fell</a>) in its wake.&nbsp; With <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, Bungie's space opera is the first to reach this major milestone. As such, <em>The Final Shape</em> is packed with high expectations.</p>
<p>The narrative must surpass previous expansions, and work as an extended conclusion, bringing narrative threads and character arcs to a close. The gameplay must continue the high bar set by Bungie's esteemed pedigree. Finally, it must set the stage for what will come next in this sci-fi universe.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all of these expectations, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-developer-bungie-suffers-layoffs-among-reported-delays-for-final-shape-and">series of layoffs</a>, and the studio's pivot to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/learn-what-marathon-is-all-about-in-new-video-from-bungie">other projects</a>, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> delivers. It's the best expansion ever released in Bungie's history, packed with excitement, larger-than-life drama, and the most satisfying gunfights.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=JgW0A1Fd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-cosmodrome-artwork.jpg?itok=maP4U6xm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's the Cosmodrome but...wrong.</figcaption></figure><h2>Destiny 2: The Final Shape – Into The Pale Heart</h2>
<p>After the year of confusing storytelling in last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/destiny-2-lightfall-what-happened-with-that-finale"><em>Lightfall</em> expansion</a>, the main story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is simple in plot and grand in stakes. The Witness, the godlike being of the Darkness and grand architect behind some of Destiny's most horrendous atrocities, is on the cusp of completing their grand design. By delving into the heart of The Traveler, it plans to use the cosmic powers of Light and Darkness to form the universe into The Final Shape: A calcification of reality where everything is forced into a waking nightmare of permanent stasis.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the Alliance forces have found a way to pursue The Witness into The Pale Heart, spearheaded by the player's Guardian.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the nature of The Pale Heart. It is a landscape formed by memory twisted into surreal and unnerving shapes by The Witness' influence. To make things worse, this funhouse mirror of nostalgia is invaded by a brand new enemy faction known as The Dread.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=QcCMyqki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-pale-heart-canyon.jpg?itok=R0Z5SCfP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This imagery gets worse the more you progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Presentation-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> is packed with the kind of fast-paced, larger-than-life, operatic storytelling that made Bungie a household name. It navigates high drama and bombast alongside quiet contemplation on the nature of life, suffering, and the bittersweet beauty in something coming to an end.</p>
<p>In every sense of the word, the story of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> feels... well, final.</p>
<p>This propulsive storytelling blends well with the level design of The Pale Heart. The environments are familiar vignettes and locations across <em>Destiny's</em> history corrupted into unsettling new forms. Faces contorted in anguish jutting from a rock face. Hands with too many fingers breaking out of the ground. Buildings and caverns that are built upside down. This is taken to its natural extreme in the new Salvation's Edge Raid: an uncanny fortress packed with alien liminal architecture.</p>
<p>Bungie' narrative team uses this surrealism to provide fan service with sinister overtones. From art direction alone, the campaign celebrates the game's history, an exercise in nostalgic horror, and a masterclass in an apocalyptic atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=T-wsMyWg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-cayde-6-monologue.jpg?itok=YmG3R3g3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Melodramatic? Yes. But powerful.</figcaption></figure><p>While I was initially skeptical, Nathan Fillion's return as Cayde-6 is handled expertly, forming the beating heart of <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. He completely nails the emotional minefield of coming back from the dead with the right amount of solemn contemplation and wry wit.</p>
<p>A close second for acting MVP is Keith David as Commander Zavala. David effortlessly makes the character his own, maintaining the taciturn stoicism of the late Lance Reddick's performance while bringing a tangible pain and vulnerability to the role.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-prismatic-warlock-menu.jpg?itok=NWUbpXVk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-prismatic-warlock-menu.jpg?itok=7xBK8oMo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I am still finding new synergies with this.</figcaption></figure><h2>Breaking Down The Wall Between Light and Darkness</h2>
<p>Gameplay-wise, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> doesn't try to fix what isn't broken. A loop of guns and space magic striking down aliens and getting loot. At this point, you've either bounced off of this gameplay, or it is comfortably familiar.</p>
<p>The new wrinkle added in this expansion is the new Dread enemies. Overall, they are a great new enemy faction. They introduce elements of air superiority with the flying Grim alongside crowd-control with the Subjugator's Strand abilities. They feel like a natural extension of The Witness' forces and complement established enemy factions.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw of this expansion is the new Prismatic subclass. In the simplest of terms, it is the Build-A-Bear of <em>Destiny</em> subclasses. You can take elements from different subclasses and combine them. This leads to strong combos that aren't normally possible. Furthermore, it introduces a new empowered mode called Transcendence, which introduces more enhanced abilities for a brief period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=T-GbrTtD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-blooming-event-gameplay.jpg?itok=S1AIk81F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Strand needles, Void grenades, Stormtrance Super... life is good.</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who has put hundreds of hours into <em>Destiny 2</em>, the Prismatic subclass is a dream come true. Overlapping damage-over-time effects with Jolt, Scorch, and Devour. Combining Strand, Stasis, and Void into nightmarish crowd control. The list of possibilities goes on.</p>
<p>Prismatic feels like a acknowledgment by Bungie to their dedicated fans. After so many years learning the ins and outs of abilities and gear, this new subclass represents your mastery of the game-breaking your limitations.</p>
<p>This burst of personal empowerment doesn't completely disrupt <em>Destiny 2's</em> overall balance. Prismatic is great, but it doesn't give you every class ability. Some are only accessible within their dedicated subclass.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=qTx5WG6k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-the-witness-boss-fight.jpg?itok=CTHTKpW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This was a nightmare on Legendary difficulty.</figcaption></figure><p>The gear game continues a gradual shift in Bungie's weapon design. Early on, weapons were key to damage and crowd control with class abilities playing support. Now, outside of exotics, weapons support the abilities. Popular perks involve reducing ability cooldowns, generating Super energy, and even briefly healing teammates.</p>
<p>The result is more visually busy gunfights with larger enemy hordes. But it also means getting god roll on weapons feels less important.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=wsyMC6_j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-epilogue-screenshot.jpg?itok=FePPHGYz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>After ten years, it's over.</figcaption></figure><h2>The End of An Era</h2>
<p>Recently, Bungie laid out their plans for <em>Destiny 2</em> after <em>The Final Shape</em>. They will be moving from long overarching narratives to an episodic structure, exploring the consequences of the final battle against The Witness. It's a noticeable but measured scaling back of ambition. One that comes with the acknowledgment that people may wish to move on to new things; both the players and Bungie themselves.</p>
<p>In 2014, Bungie launched <em>Destiny</em>, a game that spawned the concept of the live-service game with an epic ten-year story.&nbsp;After initially bouncing off, I have been an avid player. Reading lore, playing through the raids, and developing long-lasting friendships with my fellow Guardians. In 2024, <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> concludes its story in a way that players will remember forever in an industry flooded with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">failed attempts</a> to capture its magic.</p>
<p>It was a decade packed with euphoric highs and salty lows, but when it mattered most, it ended beautifully.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/monster-hunter-now-season-2-is-good-time-to-jump-back-in<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re reading this, <em>Monster Hunter Now</em> has just entered its second season, Dancing in the Tempest. Niantic’s adding a lot of exciting stuff to the game, perhaps the biggest thing being an Elder Dragon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mobile game has reached 15 million downloads at the time of writing, which is a pretty good measure of success in my book. To capitalize on the player base, many of season 2’s updates are focused on making it a more social game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, Kushala Daora from <em>Monster Hunter 2 </em>is coming to the game, along with a new mechanic called Elder Dragon Interceptions. These function a lot like Hunt-a-thons, but instead of a gauntlet of five monsters, it’s one big encounter.</p>

We still ran the clock all the way to the literal last second, and that’s including the extra 75 seconds you get after taking out half of its health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, even if we failed at that point, taking out half of Kushala Daora’s health will give you some bonuses, as you’ve repelled the creature (instead of slaying it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Niantic spokesperson declined to comment on whether we can expect more Elder Dragon Interceptions, but as <em>Monster Hunter </em>fans know, there are many more Elder Dragons to work with from the main games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of more things to work with, Season 2 also comes with a new weapon: the Gunlance. This brings <em>Monster Hunter Now </em>up to 10 weapon types, out of the 14 typically found in a mainline game.</p>
<p>The Gunlance was a lot of fun to use; much like the other weapons I’ve used, the interface was intuitive and simple, with a lot of options for somewhat more robust gameplay. After four taps, you can do some pretty big damage, but you have manually reload it to get that big damage on the fourth tap.</p>

<p>You can manually reload by holding, and then swiping down. It’s not quite as intuitive as you’d think, and that’s somewhat true for the other weapons’ controls, too. That’s why Season 2 is also coming with guides for every weapon for more accessibility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To round out the social aspects here, Niantic is also adding a button to quickly send a friend request after a hunt. If you see a familiar username on your morning commute, now’s the time to shoot your shot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Friend Quests are being added, where you and three others can opt in to complete a bigger quest within a time limit (think something like “slay 250 monsters”).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/monster-hunter-now-review-in-progress">Last time I checked out <em>Monster Hunter Now</em></a>, I was having a pretty good time with the early game. However, I was hitting a wall thanks to the grind that was setting in, and the microtransactions at the time had me feeling wary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I’ve just reinstalled it with a sense of freshness in my eyes. I want to try reincorporating it into my routine, because after all, I have 14.99 million or so new friends to find.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/demo-trailer-e3-gamescom-pax-tgs-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to '<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What I Do</a>', a feature that shines a spotlight on the essential, bizarre and often unheralded work that people do every day across the video game industry.</p><p>Today's instalment is a timely one: it's summer, the time for big game announcements, so I wanted to talk to someone who had some experience with what it was like not just working at a big studio that was going to be starring at a major international games event, but having to meet journalists/fans about a game as well.</p><p>That person is Albert (not their real name!), a jack-of-all-trades working across platforms and genres whose identity has been withheld so that they could spill the beans on what it's like getting media training and having to build a vertical slice just so some press could play part of the game ahead of release.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: </strong><strong><em>Hi Albert! Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your history in the games business?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: I've been in the industry for nearly 20 years? How is that true?! I started in QA, where I spent the first five years of my career at a number of studios. I've been a designer for almost 15 years. I've worked at studios of around 60 people up to a studio of nearly 300. I've worked on AAA MMOs, AAA singleplayer RPGs, and AA RPGs. In that time I've been an active part of development on several demos for press, show floors, and publishers. I've primarily worked in content (like quests and such), but I've also worked on PvP modes, co-op gameplay, and other systems as an implementer and lead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Because it's summer and we've all got big game reveals on our minds, which of those games had a presence at a major show?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: The MMO and AA RPG I worked on had presences at a major industry show, the MMO multiple times. I also worked on a demo for a big consumer-facing event for the MMO.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>What were your exact roles on both games mentioned in these answers?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO I worked on the maps as an open-world designer, as well as in the PvP portions of the game. For the RPG I was responsible for implementing quests.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>What was involved in getting the demos ready for the big reveal? Were people pulled off actual work to get them ready? How long did it normally take to put something together?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, the biggest and most important show demo of ours was the major industry show, as it was the first time any players got their hands on the game. We put a lot of energy into the zones we were showing off, and probably pushed the polish level of those higher than was strictly necessary for that time in development. It was most of the studio focused on that, but ultimately that work wasn't so much throwaway work as it was focus on things that we were either going to need more broadly (like combat skills), or it was work that would ship eventually, think map content.</p><p>I honestly don't remember how long we were focusing on it, but it was months and months of essentially the whole studio's time. The fact that it was going to be on the show floor, and thus we couldn't control the impressions the media would get out of it, meant that we were very mindful of not just how it would feel to players at the show, but also how it would look when recorded. The sheer scale of it prevented us from being able to fully polish all of it, but it did allow us to build a slice of our game up to a much closer-to-final level than we had done up until that point. Where and when this work became the most onerous is as we got closer and we needed to make sure the build wasn't going to crash or break in any critical ways. That involved very few changes, but lots of time playing the build, identifying one critical issue and then waiting for a fix.</p><figure><blockquote><p>I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production...</p></blockquote></figure><p>For the RPG, while we built something using a lot of the existing tools, there was a large amount of work on all disciplines to get things to a level that we were comfortable showing to the press. And a large amount of that work was one-off and trashed afterwards. I'd say we put somewhere in the realm of 3-4 months of work with 25% or more of the studio building things. There was a lot of special-casing of things because it wasn't like the game was ready to ship yet, or even fit within console memory. There were folks that grumbled about it and were upset about throwaway work.</p><p>The studio head was a micro-manager about details and so we had daily play sessions where he would find small art issues and pull in multiple people to talk about how we could fix them. He wanted all the details to be very tightly controlled, which honestly just takes a ton of effort, especially in a game with any sort of underlying simulation that is inherently random. A specific example: there was a bush next to a house that we were playing around that would flicker a little at certain points. The studio head was fixated on it and we had to figure out how to fix it for the demo. Which meant a number of leads or other folks getting pulled in to look at it, talk about potential fixes, etc. We also rehearsed so many times to try and have everything perfect. Which was helpful, I suppose, but honestly just overkill.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>How did people on the team feel about this? Was it a huge pain in the ass? Did anyone resent being taken off other work for it?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I think folks were mostly understanding and onboard, because it was so tightly linked to our first time in front of players and to so many parts that were stuff we would need to do anyhow to ship the game. The most clearly throwaway work was all the stuff required for the specific logistics of a show floor. How do we log people out? What happens if someone walks away in the middle? Stuff like that. That wasn't so much work, but was certainly not related to the actual game at all. That's not considering a lot of the things I didn't have insight into, like planning the show floor, travel plans, etc. It's not easy to get a bunch of PCs over to another country and set up to run for three days straight.</p><p>For the RPG, folks weren't super happy. It was a press-only demo that also wasn't going to be recorded, so I think the degree to which that felt like a waste of their time was noticeable. Not to mention that we just had a lot of shit to do in order to try and get the game built and we were always up against milestones. Those two things really pushed folks to a place of seeing this as stupid, rather than necessary. Something with that tight of a leash and the desire to make and see very small changes is always going to be a pain in the ass, because you need builds to process and all that takes time. We also did the work on a separate version of the game build, so it meant you had to be able to swap between places and do your work in the correct location, which is a hassle. It felt very ancillary to the actual work of making a game. And it had the fear always in the air that someone would promise something or say something offhand to the press that would turn into a must-have feature that we had no plans to deliver.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Be honest, how much of these showcases, if any, was bullshit? Not accidentally bullshit (like something WAS going to be in the game but plans changed), but just a straight up smoke and mirrors job?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: For the MMO, I'd say it was mostly not bullshit. Performance and balance wasn't close to final, but we weren't faking things to any major degree.</p><p>For the RPG, I'd say it was 50% bullshit? I literally custom did all the content work, nothing about that was going to ship. And we put our thumb on the scale of all sorts of systems to make the demo exciting and reliable for those of us giving the demo to press. As a simulation game, that's somewhat going to always happen in that you either go in fully with the idea that we're open to whatever, or you very tightly constrain what can and will happen in the demo. For example, if things would sometimes spawn and sometimes not because of the simulation, we would force them to always spawn for the demo.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal...</p></blockquote></figure><p>Actually, now that I think about it, I was at a studio (if not directly involved) in a trailer that was 100% Grade A bullshit. Essentially our publisher really, really wanted stuff to show and despite the fact that our next project wasn't even in the pitch phase, let alone production, we had an external team create a trailer to build hype. It was completely divorced from anything we hoped to do, and it was so early in development that it couldn't help but be misleading or tie our hands. That one sucked. It thankfully didn't eat up a ton of our resources and time, but it was still demoralizing because we had little to do with it and we all knew it was going to be promises that we couldn't necessarily deliver on.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Did you attend any of these events in a public or press-facing capacity? And if so, did you ever receive any kind of media training?</em></strong></p><p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, pretty much every single time. Now, front-facing in the first several times was just in the sense of the show floor and talking to fans and players, mostly. But for the RPG I was one of four people presenting to the press. We did get press training each time for the MMO, although it varied in quality.</p><p><strong>LP: <em>I've long been fascinated by this: what exactly did that press training entail? Did anyone have to role-play, were there powerpoints, who exactly was doing the training?</em></strong></p><p>The press training took a number of different forms. The most rigorous was an outside consultant coming in, walking us through how to approach things, doing some role-playing, that sort of thing. In general at the MMO studio we would run folks through an internal training before they did any press or public-facing stuff. Some of the key takeaways are: defer to someone else if you aren't sure about the answer, don't let long silences trick you into giving more details, and remember that as soon as you walk out the door, you are working and guard what you say. It's a fairly different experience being with fans compared to the press, however. We generally are less worried about major mistakes with fans, because it's just not the same as a press hit. I am fortunate in that I was able to observe folks that were really good at press before I had to do much myself. And I'm a solid extemporaneous speaker, which is a double-edged sword and hasn't yet gotten me fired, but has come close!</p><p>What I've found most personally useful with press is to remember that making shit up or lying is never, ever going to work. Not only are you likely to get called out by your boss, the players are eventually going to actually play the thing! I focus on telling the most positive, but still grounded in reality, version of the story that I can and hope that comes across. For example if we aren't going to release any new skills for a particular class, I want to be able to say something like "Our focus, in this release, is on the classes that are furthest from our overall goals. Something that is really important to us is making sure we are making measured changes that don't put too much stress on the team." Or something like that.</p><p>Our relationship with the press is both antagonistic in some sense but also highly reciprocal. And press that are doing their jobs, looking out for the truth and for the audience, will sometimes ask tough questions. But those questions come from an important place and you can bet your players are asking the same ones.</p><p><strong>LP: </strong><strong><em>Thanks for your time Albert!</em></strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
League of Geeks - the studio behind Armello, Jumplight Odyssey, and Solium Infernum - has announced it's going into "hibernation for the foreseeable future", following its decision to cut 50 percent of its workforce at the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
Back in December, the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jumplight-odyssey-development-paused-indefinitely-as-layoffs-announced-across-studio">said</a> it had been affected by a combination of "rapidly rising operation costs, a worsening AUD/USD exchange rate, poor early access sales [of starship management sim Jumplight Odyssey], and the unprecedented withdrawal of funding opportunities across the industry". Alongside layoffs at the studio, it confirmed development of Jumplight Odyssey would be paused "indefinitely".
</p>
<p>
Since months on and the studio's fortunes have clearly not improved. In a <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin">post on the League of Geeks website</a>, studio co-founders Ty Carey, Blake Mizzi, and Trent Kusters wrote, "The economic situation in games being what it is right now, we have made the decision to put LoG into hibernation for the foreseeable future and take some extended time off."

<p>
"The vast majority of our team have moved onto exciting new endeavours," the post continued, "and those who remain are going to take a well deserved break over the next few months."
</p>
<p>
"We're not sure when (or if) we will resurrect this great beast, but we're incredibly proud of all we've achieved, both in the experiences we've crafted together, the great developers who made LoG a world-class development environment, the peers we inspired along the way, and of course, those community members who believed in what we made, how we made it, and supported us fiercely in those convictions. Now it's time for rest, some play, and other opportunities."
</p>
<p>
Although the studio is winding down, all its games will remain online and continue to be supported - active development, however, will cease. Jumplight Odyssey will, inevitably, remain on an indefinite hiatus, but the team still wants to bring it out of early access over the next 12 months. "This is unlikely to be the fully realised v1.0 release we had originally planned," it notes, "though we will try to find some way to tuck the game in with our limited, remaining resources."
</p>
<p>
Development on turn-based grand strategy game Solium Infernum will also come to a close, with League of Geeks noting, "Sales revenue cannot fund further active development or DLC." However, the studio says it still has a "couple of treats" up its sleeve, alongside bug fixes and minor content - so players can expect "a lil update or two" before thing wrap up for good.
</p>
<p>
As for Armello, the studio's first game released back in 2015, it will "continue to cruise along as it has for the past few years, rotating seasonal content and providing a hit of heroism for our furry adventurers". The Armello Board Game, meanwhile, won't be affected.
</p>
<p>
"Makin' videogames is hard, excruciatingly hard these past few years," the studio's post concludes, "but the smart, lovely people we got to do it with, both inside LoG and out, made this crazy business worth it every single day."

                <p dir="ltr">Extraction shooters have taken over battle royale as the PvP genre du jour. Load out, drop in, loot up, and hopefully escape with your life; it's a fun gameplay loop and has already been done in a number of different frameworks, from hardcore settings like Escape From Tarkov to the haunted bayou of Hunt Showdown. Heck, even Call of Duty tried it with its short-lived mode, DMZ. For a new game to stand out and survive in this competitive genre, it has to do something different, and Sharkmob's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/exoborne/" data-ref-id="5000-612212">Exoborne</a> may have just the thing to put some distance between itself and its countless counterparts.</p><p dir="ltr">I hesitate to call Exoborne's best feature a hidden gem or a secret weapon since there's really nothing subtle about it. The game drops players into a futuristic open world where corporate intervention has inadvertently accelerated climate change rather than solving it as intended, and the setting, as a result, looks much like a typical video game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Exoborne | Official Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2023</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Lush wilderness clashes with massive human-made structures that are remnants of the failed climate project. Dilapidated buildings ask to be picked apart for survival scraps. The post-apocalyptic setting is as typical of video games as the playable armored-up warriors you control and the diverse gear you'll seek out to build your perfect future soldier. As a third-person extraction shooter, it would be a pretty, but perhaps pretty standard, experience.</p><p dir="ltr">But where Exoborne stands out is in its impressive weather systems that are capable of completely altering a round. Reminiscent of Just Cause 4--only dialed up to be much more visually dazzling and now affecting a huge PvPvE world--tornados, lightning, and heavy rain can alter the odds instantly. This was never more obvious than when I watched a team of three book it through the ravaged world with their loot in tow aboard an SUV, only to be swept up by a tornado and sent flying across the map as though their vehicle was nothing more than a patio umbrella in a maelstrom.</p><p dir="ltr">It was the sort of video-game chaos that would've been impossible 10 years ago--to have such detailed and involved physics disrupting the flow of a multiplayer game with emergent, unscripted moments that would seem to challenge the fanciest PC rigs. Somehow, the game is coming to consoles too. Since I didn't get to play it myself, I do wonder just how well the game will hold up on consoles and lesser PCs, because what I saw looked gorgeous, but very demanding.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png" data-ref-id="1300-4318185"></a><figcaption>This Exoborne concept art accurately portrays the chaos I witnessed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4318185-exoborne_art_concept_key_art_05.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">To counter the chaotic weather systems, players can equip armor rigs--which essentially serve as Exoborne's character classes--that each grant them different benefits, including one that lets players stand tall in a tornado, unaffected by the sweeping winds. Another strategy is to embrace the chaos by equipping their always-ready glider to purposely get sent flying in the storm in a moment that redefines "fast travel," ending--if players are skilled enough to pull it off--in a team dropping in on an objective with style, or even landing an air attack on an unwitting rival squad in the open world.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside their glider and guns, players will also have a grappling hook that can reel them into a target, which should further enhance combat and traversal alike. It seems my earlier name-drop of Just Cause 4 is apt in more ways than one.</p><p dir="ltr">There are other important parts of the game Sharkmob will need to deliver on, and some of them--like the overall progression loop--I didn't get to see much of in my time with the game, and I never felt gunplay for myself, of course, so my mind is far from made up with regard to the full picture. Still, in a genre in which games can rise and fall in a hurry--sometimes literally overnight--Exoborne is at least forecasting to offer a game-changing feature that could disrupt the competitive genre.</p>

                <p>Sea of Stars has a distinctive visual style influenced by the JRPG hits of the SNES era, but beneath that design, there's an incredible foundation of art supporting it.

                <p>While late manga creator Akira Toriyama is best-known for Dragon Ball, the famed illustrator also produced several other terrific series throughout his lifetime.

It's an incredibly faithful recreation of Toriyama's unique art, right down to the wonderfully detailed vehicles and quirky characters you'll encounter throughout your adventure. As the pink-skinned demon prince, Beelzebub, players have to navigate through a desert world where water is in short supply and the realms of magic and sci-fi have become intertwined.</p><p>While combat can become monotonous and vehicle customization could be better, Sand Land still captures the charm of the original manga with its fascinating cast well-layered storytelling. "Sand Land is bittersweet in many ways, but it's a testament to Toriyama's talents as both an artist and storyteller that, despite its numerous flaws, it's still worth playing," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/sand-land-review-tanks-a-lot/1900-6418216/" data-ref-id="1900-6418216">Sand Land review</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in checking out the original manga, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sand-Land-Akira-Toriyama/dp/1591161819?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can grab it for just $12</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-mythic-unit-in-anime-defenders/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-mythic-unit-in-anime-defenders<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="385" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Anime Defenders</em> is a popular Tower Defense game on <em>Roblox</em> specifically because of the ability given to players to be versatile in choosing which units they use. However, even with an overall solid level of balance, there are still certainly better Mythic units than others. This is the best Mythic Unit in <em>Anime Defenders</em> as well as some other solid options so you know what to evolve.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-best-mythic-unit" data-injectable="false">Best Mythic Unit</h2> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">While balancing changes and updates can affect which unit is best from time to time, Carp is the best Mythic Unit overall in <em>Anime Defenders</em> as of the Raids update. Carp’s full Area of Effect (AoE) attacks allow him to deal damage in a massive total area, able to take out entire waves of enemies with just one attack. This makes Carp extremely efficient during waves of large enemies, allowing you to clear stages more easily.</p>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">When fully evolved, Carp boasts a total damage rating of 31,870, one of the highest in the game. This insane damage amount, paired with his AoE capabilities, means Carp is without a doubt the best Mythic Unit in <em>Anime Defenders</em>.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Also, with a range of 34, you can essentially slot Carp into any location on the battlefield and he will be useful. While some units may only benefit from certain map layouts, Carp can be effective on any map making him extremely versatile and overall the best Mythic unit that you should strive to acquire first.</p>
 <h2 id="h-other-great-mythic-unit-options" data-injectable="false">Other great Mythic Unit options</h2> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">If you already have Carp or are simply not interested in his playstyle, you do have some decent follow-up alternatives. Here are some other great Mythic Unit options to go for in <em>Anime Defenders</em> other than Carp for the Raids update:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Ant King</strong> – Strong overall big circle AoE, high damage, very flexible </li> <li><strong>Flame Dragon King</strong> – High damage over time via burn, medium circle AoE, consistent attack pattern</li> <li><strong>Prince of Curses</strong> – High damage output, small circle AoE, weakens strong enemies</li> <li><strong>Skull Warrior</strong> – Powerful raw damage attack, large line AoE, flexible placement options</li> <li><strong>Thunder Hokage</strong> – Large AoE circle, effective SPA and damage timing</li> </ul>

<p data-characters="262" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> splitscreen co-op would be a blast from the past for many, but it’s still a feature that’s highly requested by players. Being able to team up for multiplayer matches or zombies sounds like a fantastic idea for a Friday night.</p> <h2 id="h-will-there-be-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-splitscreen-co-op" data-injectable="false">Will there be Call of Duty Black Ops 6 splitscreen co-op?</h2> <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Activision has provided a few details about Black Ops 6 through a <a href="https://support.activision.com/black-ops-6/articles/black-ops-6-editions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">short Q&amp;A</a> section on its support website. “Split-screen gameplay (two players sharing a screen) for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5,” said Activision. “To ensure performance integrity, split-screen gameplay will not be supported on Xbox One or PlayStation 4.”</p> <figure data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Black Ops 6 will have splitscreen co-op but there’s a catch.</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, the PS4 and Xbox One versions won’t support <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-not-be-300gb-in-size-activision-clarifies/">Black Ops 6</a> </em>splitscreen co-op, at least from day one of its launch. </p> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">It’s great to see splitscreen co-op still being supported in 2024, and the <em>Call of Duty </em>series has a history of implementing the feature into its games. Last year’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-split-screen-modern-warfare-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>has it, for example.</p> <h2 id="h-splitscreen-shooters-on-ps4-and-xbox-one" data-injectable="false">Splitscreen shooters on PS4 and Xbox One</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">Now that Activision has sunset splitscreen functionality within its PS4 and Xbox One ports of <em>Call of Duty </em>games, you don’t want that seat next to you completely empty. Thankfully, there are still some shooters you can play with a pal with split-screen on the older consoles. One example is the <em>Borderlands </em>series, including the most recent <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-tiny-tinas-wonderlands/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a>. </em>You can hook up two controllers and get as much loot as you can gather together. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands has splitscreen co-op</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="false">If you’re on the Xbox One, the <em>Halo Master Chief Collection </em>is a good way to go. You can play through the campaigns with a buddy, and you can wreck fools online as well with some split-screen action just like the old days.</p>

			<p>A couple years ago Microsoft and developer Oxide Games (Ashes of the Singularity) unveiled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ara-history-untold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ara: History Untold</a>, a new 4X turn-based game with elements of grand strategy and even city building mixed in. We haven’t heard that too much about it since then, but today, Microsoft unveiled a September release date for the promising title.</p>
<p>The Official Xbox Podcast also provided an in-depth look at Ara: History Untold gameplay, including the game’s large selection of leaders (45 in all at launch), living world, and unique cloud-powered approach to multiplayer, in which everyone takes turns simultaneously and players can hop in and out of games as they wish with AI taking over if they leave. You can check out the Xbox Podcast Ara: History Untold Showcase, below.</p>

If you’re unsure what to spend money on, or don’t wish to pay for mods, however, there are some great free ones to get started with. I’ve rounded up six free mods that’ll subtly but meaningfully improve your <em>Starfield</em> experience. If you’re just looking for some gentle modifications or are new to modding in general, these are a great place to start.</p><h2 id="h101890"><a id=""></a>Make the galaxy look better with Color Filter Removal and Darker Nights</h2><div><p><figcaption>Left: No visual mods. Right: Color Filter Removed and Darker Nights enabled.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><p>I am absolutely digging a pair of mods that dramatically improves the visual look of the game on both PC and Xbox. The first is GTA_R0CKS’ “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/87835815-0b34-415e-b13a-6c0cf1d8409d/Color_Filter_Removal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/87835815-0b34-415e-b13a-6c0cf1d8409d/Color_Filter_Removal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Color Filter Removal</a></span>.” This mod peels away <em>Starfield</em>’s meh color filters pl, lending itself to a much cleaner image. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-install-and-use-starfield-s-official-and-fan-mad-1851535695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-install-and-use-starfield-s-official-and-fan-mad-1851535695">How To Install And Use <em>Starfield</em>’s Official And Fan-Made Mods</a></span></p><p>“Color Filter Removal” pairs delightfully well with HopeFulWishing’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/fa7b5736-e0e2-4fd6-80e6-aa3487a6c7cd/Darker_Nights&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/fa7b5736-e0e2-4fd6-80e6-aa3487a6c7cd/Darker_Nights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Darker Nights</a></span>.” This mod lowers the game’s ambient lighting to make for a darker, more imposing image that, during evenings on planets and moons, allows darkness to actually blanket and smother the environment. Everything feels notably spookier, and in my experience it hasn’t been too hard to see things. In fact, it makes the game more compelling. Spotting distant structures in the distance, for example, feels more ominous as you can’t necessarily make everything out. </p><div><h4> What about “Pitch Black Nights?”  </h4><p> If you’re fishing around the <em>Starfield</em>  Creation suite, you’ll likely come across another mod from  HopeFulWishing: Pitch Black Nights.” This mod makes the environment even  darker. In my experience, however, it’s too dark. If you want to go for  some ominous, liminal, space photography of abandoned structures, it  might be neat to turn on every now and then. But for regular gameplay, I  recommend “Darker Nights.”  </p></div><p>While “Darker Nights” is great on its own, the mod is made even better by a simple flashlight mod that increases the amount of light you emit.</p><h2 id="h101891"><a id=""></a>“Vanilla Flashlight Improved” is a considerable improvement</h2><div><p><figcaption>Left: stock, “vanilla” flashlight. Right: Modded flashlight.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><p>Litbeep’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/6c3c002d-a6ed-4b7a-99d6-34e1d2c629c7/Vanilla_Flashlight_Improved__VFI_&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/6c3c002d-a6ed-4b7a-99d6-34e1d2c629c7/Vanilla_Flashlight_Improved__VFI_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanilla Flashlight Improved (VFI)</a></span>,” available on PC and Xbox casts way more light with your flashlight, making it actually useful for seeing further in dark areas. This combines really well with “Darker Nights” and the “Color Filter Removal” to make for some excellent night-time planetary exploration. The mod also removes the banding effect that the stock flashlight has, so it’s not only more light, it’s a cleaner flashlight texture too.</p><h2 id="h101892"><a id=""></a>“Headshot kills any actor” makes for better combat and more realism</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/208831b4-04a8-4a89-9b31-67181e6c2517/Headshot_kills_any_actor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/208831b4-04a8-4a89-9b31-67181e6c2517/Headshot_kills_any_actor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This mod from SKKmods</a></span> not only improves the regular flow of combat in <em>Starfield</em>, it can also free up the rigid nature of many quests by letting you finally kill essential NPCs (yes, I know which one you’re thinking about right now, and I’ll answer that question in just a moment).</p><p>To activate this mod, you’ll need to use the item added to your inventory once the mod is installed. This item will give you a menu that lets you choose who can be killed with a headshot, from regular enemies, to friendlies, to yourself, and to essential NPCs. </p><p>On that note, if you kill an essential NPC, you will likely break any quest they’re associated with. So this is really best for sandbox play, or you can leave the “Essential actor headshots” toggle off and enjoy the benefits of headshot kills for regular hostile characters. </p><p>And yes, when “Essential actor headshots” is toggled on, you <em>can</em> kill the board of Paradiso. Is this the correct way to deal with this situation? Well I ain’t writing a guide on morality here, but I can say in my tests it sure did make me feel a certain way. </p><figure id="" data-id="f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-recommend-id="image://f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>There I go killin’ again.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-recommend-id="image://f262aa30b54725090c28581d764a49d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A dead body sits at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h101893"><a id=""></a>“Shade’s Stealth Takedowns (Knock-out or Lethal)”</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/aa98cf0c-85be-4024-bc49-574e79f59d97/Shade__39_s_Stealth_Takedowns__Knock_out_or_Lethal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/aa98cf0c-85be-4024-bc49-574e79f59d97/Shade__39_s_Stealth_Takedowns__Knock_out_or_Lethal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadedness’ takedown mod</a></span> immediately changed how I was playing <em>Starfield</em>, finally inching the game toward more immersive sim territory—which I am absolutely all about. This mod adds a new “Takedown” skill in the Physical Skills tree, with four ranks to ascend through. Now you can sneak into an enemy base and take down enemies from behind without much fuss. When used with the “Sense Star Stuff” ability, it almost feels like playing <em>Dishonored</em>…in space. </p><p>Do check out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?author_displayname=shadedness&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?author_displayname=shadedness" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadedness’ other mods</a></span> as well, as they address and improve a few critical areas of <em>Starfield</em>.</p><h2 id="h101894"><a id=""></a>“Starshards” help you unlock new skills faster</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/80b7f535-19a7-40f8-98a9-a4fda05e1ce6/Starshards&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/80b7f535-19a7-40f8-98a9-a4fda05e1ce6/Starshards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Starshards” by _Ravageron</a></span> is a neat little mod that spawns various, well, starshards on planets for you to collect. Not only does this add an extra activity to planetary exploration, you’ll also get a skill point for every three shards you collect. This will come in handy if you’re planning on adding more skills to the skill tree.</p><hr><p>The Creations mod suite is rapidly growing, so there will undoubtedly be more mods worth your time in the future. But improvements to the visual style of the game and its combat can go a long way to making <em>Starfield</em> feel nice and fresh again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You play as Capt. Chuck “Wolfhound” Rossetti, a one-man army tasked with infiltrating a secret Nazi base in the Bermuda Triangle. In classic Metroidvania fashion, there’s plans for a sprawling 2D map, special abilities that unlock new areas, and tons of different guns, from flamethrowers to more experimental weapons. </p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p> James Petruzzi, the head of Bit Kid, told me in an interview that he was inspired to make <em>Wolfhound </em>after playing 2017's<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-mummy-demastered/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-the-mummy-demastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Mummy Demastered</em></a></span>, a retro run-and-gun where every time you die and come back, you have to kill your old self to continue. He wanted to do something similar set in World War II, partly as an homage to his grandfather, a WWII vet who had recently died.</p><p>“My grandfather passed during the the making of <em>Chasm</em>, and when we went to the funeral afterwards my dad had gotten out all these old photos he took while he was in Europe, and made a big collage out of them,” Petruzzi said. “And so when <em>Chasm</em> was over I was really interested in getting all those photos, scanning them, restoring them, and all that.” </p><p>On the backs of the photos were short captions written by his grandfather, which became the inspiration for <em>Wolfhound</em>’s titular hero. “This is the guy that just ran up Omaha Beach, almost died, and then a few days later there’s all these German soldiers walking down the road, and he writes on the back, like, ‘More of Hitler’s supermen,” he said. “I kind of try to take that perspective he had and put it in the game.”</p><figure id="" data-id="241f3a8c99703a01ad6bf4fd92a31207" data-recommend-id="image://241f3a8c99703a01ad6bf4fd92a31207" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pixel-art commando shoots mutan Nazis.

He’s trying to take his time this go around, especially after crunching on the development of <em>Chasm</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-story-of-two-games-that-took-forever-to-make-1825059678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-of-two-games-that-took-forever-to-make-1825059678">a procedural medieval metroidvania</a></span> whose flaws and mixed reception still seem to weigh on him.<br></p><p>“When we did<em> Chasm</em> we kind of had that romantic crunch culture, you know, it’s, ‘Oh, we’re going to work so hard day and night and we’re going to make our dream game,’” Petruzzi said. “Five years goes by and all your friends are going ‘You’re like a shell of a person’ because you’re completely burned out. And I was like, okay, and my wife, you know, at the same time was like, ‘You can’t do that again.’”</p><p>He and the <em>Chasm</em> team, who ended up going their separate ways, pushed out several updates to address player feedback and improve the game after launch, and he says the long-tail has been strong enough to give him the freedom not to rush with his next game. “We’re trying to stay much more steady with not working weekends and nights and all that,” he said. </p><p>“It gets a little crazy sometimes where you get stressed out and just want to get things done, but you kind of have to have some of that self-control and just be like, ‘It’s going to be there Monday.’ It’s just not worth it, because that slippery slope just keeps going and then when you start talking years of time it’s like, I can’t go through that again. So, yeah, it’s not easy, but I’m just trying to do my best and do my best by the team.”</p><p>I hope it pans out. Wolfhound looks like a lot of fun and I can’t wait to see the finished game. With <em>Wolfhound</em>, Petruzzi is ditching the procedural levels in favor of a hand-crafted map. “There’s just something appealing to making something hand-designed  this time,” he said. “I spent a couple of years just working on it in my spare time as I was kind of decompressing from <em>Chasm</em> development and catching up on other games and just trying to figure out what I wanted it to be and what would be fun to work on for several years of my life.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
