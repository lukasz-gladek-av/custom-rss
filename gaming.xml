		<p>In a world of forgotten 3D platforming stars, Croc is a green, snappy reminder that time has no meaning, and that your childhood was genuinely only a few moments ago, rather than the truth. If you’re ready to put on your nostalgia shoes, and think about a time when Sony’s PlayStation didn’t need a number because it was the only one, Croc: Legend of the Gobbos Remaster is due to release on the 2nd of April 2025, for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC as a GOG exclusive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Croc Legend of the Gobbos coming April 2nd!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTbQv0NENaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This beloved title from Argonaut Games, founded by 3D gaming visionary Jez San OBE, harkens back to a time where 3D platforming was the apex predator of the gaming scene. It captured the hearts of players worldwide in the late ’90s – the original really did release in 1997 – and is now making a triumphant return with stunning new visuals, updated quality-of-life features, and an array of exciting additions that are sure to delight longtime fans and new players alike. These features will evoke a sense of nostalgia and deepen appreciation for the game’s rich history.</p>

<p>The remastered Croc Legend of the Gobbos brings the heart-warming journey of Croc, the humble and courageous little crocodile, equipped with his iconic backpack and wiggly butt back to life with vibrant high-definition graphics, modern controls and an updated camera system (thankfully) and refined gameplay mechanics. Players will once again embark on a delightful quest across a series of imaginative worlds by running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and tail spinning to rescue the adorable Gobbos from the nefarious Baron Dante’s grasp. Players will navigate Croc through beautifully recrafted levels brimming with quirky enemies, puzzles, and hidden secrets in order to save Croc’s adoptive family of  Gobbos from captivity.</p>

<p>The original Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remains a much-loved title in many gamers’ back catalogue, and it’ll be interesting to see how the remaster fares when it launches on the 2nd of April.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Argonaut Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster, and it won't be long before you get to revisit this cult platforming classic.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1902030119524331617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and consoles on April 2nd. You can wishlist the game on PC now via GOG, but wishlisting isn't yet available for the console platforms; it's coming "soon", according to Argonaut.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what's happened to the Steam version of the game, Argonaut revealed back in October that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-no-steam-release" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming to Valve's platform</a>, citing a desire for the game to remain DRM-free on PC (although not on consoles, of course).</p>

<p>The game was part of a rush of mascot platformers released around that period, going up against the likes of Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64</em>, Naughty Dog's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and Insomniac Games'&nbsp;<em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, all of which were released within a couple of years of one another.</p>

<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>wasn't quite as well-received as the aforementioned titles during its time, but it garnered a cult following, and in August last year, its original publisher Argonaut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster" rel="nofollow">announced its revival</a>, as well as the game's remaster.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster will, of course, sport fresh HD graphics, as well as new controls and an updated camera to make the game's occasionally janky platforming a little less frustrating. You can also expect a&nbsp;<em>Croc</em>&nbsp;treasure trove with lots of materials pertaining to the game's creation.</p>




<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>, as well as on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, on April 2nd.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-n64-reimagining-analogue-3d-delayed-once-again.1137954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro gaming specialist company Analogue has announced that its upcoming Analogue 3D, a "reimagining" of the original Nintendo 64 console, has once again been delayed.</p>

<p>Back in October, the console was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed until the first quarter of this year</a>, but in an updated <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for the machine, Analogue says it's now intended to ship "by July 2025" following a delay. The company doesn't give the reason for said delay.</p>

<p>Analogue does, however, say it's "working hard to get your 3D order in hands ASAP" and that it "appreciate[s] your patience". The company also reiterates that its refund policy is still "no questions asked", so while you don't need to do anything if you're happy with your pre-order, you can cancel it and get your money back if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=iqnLh1d3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=zJAucjb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming Analogue 3D retro console has been delayed once again.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Analogue says that it will email customers a week in advance of the eventual shipping date (which has not yet been announced) to ensure that it has the correct address.</p>

<p>If you're not aware of the Analogue 3D, it's a retro console that's intended to serve as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">sort of supercharged N64</a>; it can play any cartridge officially released for Nintendo's console, but it's got a bunch of upscaling tricks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D will be fully region-free, and it'll support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as well as sporting its own operating system. The console is engineered in FGPA, too, so Analogue says it won't have any of the kind of glitches you might expect from software-level emulation.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is basically a reimagined N64, it'll also feature the same four controller ports included with the original console, and you can even use your original N64 controllers with it, although you may prefer to use the (not included with purchase) 8BitDo 64 controller.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-8bitdo-controller.jpg?itok=Qo71V_U0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-8bitdo-controller.jpg?itok=DTK_LmTD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may wish to use this more sensible controller with your Analogue 3D.</figcaption></figure><p>The Analogue 3D is now set to ship in July 2025. You can head over to the <a href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">store page</a> if you'd like to be notified when it arrives.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp%E2%80%99s-omen-16-slim-gaming-laptop-packs-an-rtx-5070-gpu-into-a-thin-ish-chassis.1137951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631371/hp-omen-16-slim-gaming-laptop-rtx-5070-specs-announcement<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HP is introducing a new entry into its PC gaming line with the Omen 16 Slim. As the name indicates, it’s a 16-inch gaming laptop with a “slim” profile — the thinnest portion being 20mm / 0.79 inches. What its product branding doesn’t immediately tell you is that the Omen 16 Slim is aimed at a midrange spec, using an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, where the bigger, badder, heavier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332194/hp-omen-max-16-elitebook-x-flip-g1i-zbook-ultra-14-g1a">Omen Max 16</a> tops out with the RTX 5090.</p><p>The Slim is meant to be more portable than its higher-tier siblings. I presume it will also be cheaper — in addition to a lower-spec GPU, it opts for lower-cost extras, like a four-zone RGB keyboard instead of customizable per-key lighting. But HP didn’t have finalized pricing in my brief time checking it out at a recent preview event. At the time, HP reps only disclosed that it’s expected to launch in June.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Even setting aside my personal dislike of number pads on laptops, that keyboard looks a little cramped to me.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Omen 16 Slim features a 16-inch 2560 x 1600 IPS display capable of 240Hz refresh and 3ms response time. It uses Intel Arrow Lake CPUs, starting with a Core Ultra 5 225H and topping out with a Core Ultra 9 285H. As for its GPU, you can go up to Nvidia’s RTX 5070 — which is the bottom end of the current crop of 50-series cards until, as is expected, Nvidia launches new entry-level options. For storage and RAM, the Omen 16 Slim starts at a typical 512GB and 16GB, respectively.</p><p>While HP’s new laptop may be slimmer than its other 16-inch offerings, at 0.79 inches and 5.4 pounds, it isn’t the slimmest or lightest around. Razer’s $3,000 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335984/razer-blade-16-laptop-thin-ryzen-amd-cpu-nvidia-gpu-240-hz-oled-display">Blade 16</a> for 2025 trimmed some of its fat from previous years and is both 0.20 inches thinner and 0.75 pounds lighter than the Omen 16 Slim. But even if the Slim isn’t the slimmest around, it maintains a decent port selection, with a 10Gbps USB-C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a 10Gbps USB-A, two 5Gbps USB-A ports, ethernet, 3.5mm headphone / mic combo jack, and HDMI 2.1. It’s also got Wi-Fi 6E support.</p><p>There really isn’t one thing about the Omen 16 Slim that reaches out and smacks me with excitement, but it seems on paper to have a respectable set of specs and features — especially if the price is right. Hopefully we’ll find out what that price is well ahead of the expected June launch.</p><p>Aside from the new 16 Slim, HP’s Omen laptop line will soon see refreshed versions of the Omen 17, Omen Transcend 14, and HP Victus 15. The Omen 17 and Omen Transcend 14 will both be configurable with the RTX 5070, while the Transcend 14 gets Intel’s Arrow Lake and the Omen 17 opts for AMD Strix Point (and is still stuck with a 16:9 screen — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7">yuck</a>). The HP Victus 15 is down in the bargain basement, to be offered in a wide range of configurations as low as the two-generations-old RTX 2050 — though HP’s spec sheet does list it with the option for a “Nvidia GeForce RTX Next Gen Laptop GPU.” Perhaps an <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/leaked-geforce-rtx-5060-and-5050-specs-suggest-nvidia-will-keep-playing-it-safe/">RTX 5050 or 5060</a>?</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/631589/hyperx-cloud-iii-s-wireless-gaming-headset-hp-announcement-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/antonio-g-di-benedetto">Antonio G. Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget. He spent over 15 years in the photography industry before joining The Verge as a deals writer in 2021.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>HyperX is announcing a new flagship Cloud III S Wireless gaming headset that adds Bluetooth 5.3 and a second microphone for standard headphone use on calls. It’s a follow-up to the Cloud III Wireless from 2023 that was HyperX’s most popular model, and which our own Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686476/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-features-price-release-date">found very compelling</a>. Like that model, the new Cloud III S Wireless headset takes a working formula and enhances it with some new features and improvements.</p><p>Using the HyperX Cloud III S in Bluetooth mode can get you up to 200 hours of usage, even more than the already high 120 hours it gets via 2.4GHz wireless. It still uses a small USB dongle for 2.4GHz, though it can connect dongle-free to specific HP Omen gaming laptops that have the connectivity built in.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Yep, that looks like a HyperX Cloud headset alright.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Since this is an “S” model, it’s unsurprising that it looks nearly identical to its predecessor and is available in the same all-black and red / black color options. But when you pop out the 10mm boom mic on the III S, you uncover a backup omni-directional mic hidden underneath. I wish all gaming headsets had this, since it allows you to take your headset on the go and not lose any core functionality. (Why not allow a gaming headset to double as your headphones when traveling or commuting — as long as they’re not ugly as sin?) You could also pop the boom mic off the last-gen model, but doing so restricted it exclusively to listening duty.</p><p>Another fun new feature is the magnetic earcup covers that allow users to hot-swap different designs, including 3D-printed ones — you can even 3D print your own. like you can with the recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24336191/check-out-these-colorful-modular-mouse-shells">HyperX Pulsefire Saga Pro mouse</a>. The ones I saw in my brief in-person demo of the Cloud III S Wireless all had a dragon motif, which was — a choice.</p><div id=":Rcbdber6:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The tiny mic port-hole is buried beneath the boom mic’s slot.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>Here be dragons for some reason.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>Otherwise, the Cloud III S is a lot like the Cloud III, with the same 53mm drivers and cushy earcups for lengthy play sessions. The headset is expected to launch in May, but like other new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/631371">gaming</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/631559">non-gaming products</a> from HP announced today, pricing is not yet solidified. Though, for reference, the original Cloud III Wireless launched at $170, is currently listed for $150, and is <a href="https://hyperx.com/products/hyperx-cloud-iii-wireless-gaming-headset">discounted to $99.99</a>.</p><p><em>Photography by Antonio G.

Moore, who has credits on some of the most beloved TV episodes around, starting with <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, can probably get a pass.

<p>In the 11+ years since the ID@Xbox program was announced, the indie game self-publishing program has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/idxbox-developers-finding-success-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">generated more than $5 billion</a> in payments to indie developers, according to Microsoft. The program shows no signs of slowing down, with over a thousand games released just in the past year.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-id-xbox-program-has-generated-billions-for-indie-game-developers">The ID@Xbox Program Has Generated Billions for Indie Game Developers</h2>



<p>The amount of money generated though the ID@Xbox program and given to indie developers has greatly increased in recent years. In 2020, the program’s director Chris Charla <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/what-idxbox-is-doing-for-the-next-generation-of-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> ID@Xbox paid developers close to $2 billion since 2014, and had paid out more than $1.5 billion just in royalties since the program’s start.

<p>Since the program’s inception, some of the most popular and successful indie game titles have made their way to Xbox Game Pass. Just in the past year, Microsoft claims that over 1,000 games were added to Game Pass through ID@Xbox over the past year, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our 2024 indie game of the year, Balatro</a>.</p>

Xbox says that the program’s upcoming lineup includes several titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Descenders Next, FBC: Firebreak, and the highly anticipated Hollow Knight: Silksong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/towerborne-xbox-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Xbox has announced that Towerborne will be launching on Xbox Game Preview on April 29. The game will be available on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC via the Xbox app, and Game Pass all on the same day.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/18/towerborne-game-pass-xbox-game-preview-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Xbox channels</a>, with the game also being available for press at this weeks GDC event.</p>



<p>Alongside the release on Xbox, Towerborne will get new features such as cross-platform play and progression between PC and Xbox consoles, couch co-op on Xbox consoles, and a new class skills progression system.</p>



<p>“Probably the biggest change to the game itself, Class Mastery is an all-new progression system that makes every Ace unique, based on individual player choices,” Xbox says. “By completing missions, players earn Skill Points, allowing you to fine-tune your chosen class, unlocking Focus Skills and Class Mechanics that drastically change how you play. And don’t worry, you can swap your Skill Points freely between missions, meaning you can experiment and find the perfect build.”</p>



<p>Developed by Stoic and published by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/xbox-game-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Studios</a>, Towerborne first released on PC in early access in September 2024. Despite early strong impressions, the game had only hit a peak concurrent player count of 596 on Steam, with only 12 concurrent players playing at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-role playing game where the player takes control of the heroes of the game called ‘Aces’, who must set out to reclaim lost territories and make the land of Belfry safe. </p>



<p>Will you be playing Towerborne? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The director behind Skyrim, Fallout 4, and Starfield was asked to pick the most influential game of all time. Todd Howard decided there are actually two titles that fit that billing: Super Mario Bros. and Doom. But that's not all, as the Bethesda Game Studios executive producer also offered up what he thinks are the two most important titles, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BAFTAGames/status/1901709779061420388" rel="nofollow ">On X</a>, the official BAFTA Games Awards account asked Howard for his selection regarding the most influential game of all time. While the acclaimed developer is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-talks-elder-scrolls-6-and-retirement-i-want-to-do-it-forever/1100-6517168/">currently busy with The Elder Scrolls VI</a> (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-is-coming-after-the-elder-scrolls-vi-confirms-todd-howard/1100-6504615/">and Fallout 5</a>), he started his response with a small, but intriguing detour. "Well first, I think, the two most important games of all time are Tetris and Pac-Man for what they do for gaming overall and bringing so many people to it," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the actual question, Howard selected Super Mario Bros. and Doom as the most influential games because he sees their DNA in modern games--even three decades later. "Two games where if you trace things games are doing today, you can trace so much of that back to those games," Howard said.</p><p dir="ltr">Howard most recently served as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-raids-indiana-jones-game-studio-doesnt-get-crushed-by-giant-boulder/1100-6520460/">executive producer on Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.

It was a process—and their first "cheat"—they called their joke engine, or a system that came up with jokes quickly and easily. They came up with and illustrated characters like a "Riot Priest" that would eventually become full on characters in their game alongside the likes of the Traffic Warlock and the Necro Medic.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-ufo-50-s-incredible-8-bit-journey" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside UFO 50's incredible 8-bit journey</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis's cheats detailed how several well known writing methods worked for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Methods like dialogue trees that put the player's sense of humor first, word-by-word text that helped timed-based jokes hit in stride, character-based comedy that doubled as both jokes and context, and the idea that jokes should be told with the lowest amount of friction possible. Don't put a ton of work into a single joke—or take your player on a detour—to avoid letting them down in a big way.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Francis detailed one joke, in which two players are hugging a wall as they prepare to breach a room, where one character starts trash talking someone that she noticed inside. The character on the other side of the door could hear her and a speech bubble popped up as he said, "wow, Jen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">We got a ton of value out of that out of very little cost," Francis said.

Some games that have nothing but jokes exist and do well, but others that want to inspire empathy and emotion have to dig deeper to work with the player. This led to another cheat, including the idea that parody doesn't give a license to repeat a genre's mistakes.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I like military action games, but their views don't align with mine," Francis said, adding that he couldn't set his game within a different genre, because it wouldn't align with the premise of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It was a simple way for the players to recap the story, cement the ideas the story presented, and reinforce that the story was taking place in a larger world.

			<p>Eight years after its release, the Nintendo Switch hardware continues to be rather impressive for what it has achieved, and with some small changes to its specs, it could have been even more impressive, as shown by a new test video shared online today.</p>
<p>YouTube user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Naga</a>, who previously shared other <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-extreme-overclocking-tegra-x1-steroids/">test videos</a>, shared today a new video showing how an overclocked Nintendo Switch modded with 8 GB RAM runs 20 PC games, such as the Dead Space games, Kingdom Hearts III, Rise of the Tomb Raider, Grand Theft Auto IV, Fallout 3, NieR Replicant and others via Wine 9.22 w/ ESync Support + DXVK Fix. Some of the most demanding games included in the test, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, don't achieve playable framerates, while others, like Kingdom Hearts III and the Resident Evil 2 remake, run surprisingly well, though only at low resolution, which is impressive nonetheless also considering they are not running natively on the system.</p>
<p><iframe title="20 PC Games Tested on Nintendo Switch (8GB RAM) - Wine 9.22 Esync" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_q2DjKjsuc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Due to its low specs and total RAM, porting games to the Nintendo Switch from other consoles could be a real challenge, but developers should have far less trouble porting games to the Nintendo Switch 2. The new Nintendo system launching later this year may not be as powerful as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but its better specs over its predecessor will reportedly make it <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/">easier to port current-generation console games over.</a> We still do not know how much developers will have to make compromises in their ports, but thankfully, it won't take much longer to see the new system in action, as a Nintendo Direct focused on it is scheduled for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd.</a></p>

            <p>
I'm still learning how to say "ginger" in Ginger, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-maw-whats-new-in-pc-games-this-week-35">recommended</a> to us by Maw feeder Fachewachewa. It's listed in the game's dictionary, and I have worked out how to say "er" - A + space + down arrow - and "g" - shift + S + space + up arrow. But I'm struggling to string together these consonants and vowels into words. It turns out computer keyboards are not an intuitive way of operating the human voicebox. This, of course, is what makes Ginger fascinating.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Ginger isn't just a striking interfacial experiment, mind you. It's a "novella within a dictionary", written by somebody called Kevin, who "wants to know what a home is". It contains a whole, made-up language you must translate using internal cross-references - the best place to start, probably, is by deciphering the dictionary's tutorial pages, which include controller and keyboard maps. 
</p>
<p>
The speaking part, meanwhile, makes use of WASD, space bar, shift and arrow keys to operate your character's tongue, lungs, vocal cords and lips - or at least, that's my read of the anatomical pixel diagrams hovering over the pages - with input order shaping the results of button combinations. As you sputter, moan and hiss your way to fluency, lines, dots, and textures appear on the screen, forming what could be a map. It's as though you were composing some geography by means of echolocation. Like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mu-cartographer">Mu Cartographer</a>, but you can sing to it.
</p>
<p>
Here's the full blurb from Steam. Hmm, "blurb". I can say the middle part of that.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Ginger is a language adventure game where every word is pronounceable, even without understanding its meaning. Step into a labyrinth of interconnected meanings and immerse yourself in a one-person subculture. 
</p>
<p>
- Embark on a journey to understand a language using only its internal cross-references.
</p>
<p>
- Join Kevin on an adventure to explore the essence of knowledge.
</p>
<p>
- Master the art of speaking a completely new language.
</p>
<p>
- Explore 1000+ entries in an expansive dictionary.
</p>
<p>
- A promised ending awaits those who persevere.
</p>
<p>
- A subtle tutorial and story lie within.
</p></blockquote>
<p>

I've never played anything quite like this. Maybe <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mask-quest">Mask Quest</a>, with its breathing mechanics. Maybe <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavens-vault">Heaven's Vault</a>, in which you pieced together alien script to solve a galactic mystery. The demo is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3418910/Ginger/">live now on Steam</a> and the full game launches on 20th March. I'd have written this up for release day, but I'll be away from the office.</p>
<p>Let me know if you figure out the button combinations for "ginger". The next step, of course, is working out what "ginger" means.

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>At the end of every month, we have an edition of Remap Recommends focused on video games. But in the middle of the month, we'll have an edition focused on...everything else. It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h2 id="patrick-recommends-daredevil-season-three">Patrick Recommends: <em>Daredevil</em> (Season Three)</h2><figure></figure><p>I was all in on Netflix's corner of the Marvel universe for a few years there, deeply into <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em>, that whole crew. (No, I did not watch Iron Fist!) Somewhere along the line, probably when <em>The Defenders</em> came and went, I fell off. Do I need to watch <em>The Punisher</em>? After all the Elektra stuff, do I really want to watch another season of <em>Daredevil</em>? The answer became no, no, no.</p><p><a href="https://www.decodingtv.com/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">I podcast about television shows with my buddy David Chen</a>, who never even got on the <em>Daredevil</em> train to begin with. I agreed to watch a few episodes of the third season in advance of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, which turned into watching a few more episodes of watching the third season in advance of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, which turned into watching the entire third season in advance of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> because <em>the third season of Daredevil is fucking awesome, everyone</em>.</p><p>Brutal. Cathartic. Inspiring. Tragic. "Matt Murdock struggles with his identity as Daredevil and the role violence plays in his work" is not exactly new territory for the character, but the third season deftly mingles this question with Matt's faith—a deeply unique character trait that I hope continues in <em>Born Again</em>, even though it drops Matt into a world of literal gods—with being pushed to the brink by Kingpin.</p><p>It's great. It's long. It's makes you retroactively upset that Marvel abandoned all of this. (And made <em>that</em> decision with <em>Born Again</em>.) The only question is whether or not I need to go back and watch <em>The Punisher</em>? Even if you're watching <em>Born Again</em>, make time for this.</p><hr><h2 id="rob-recommends-conclave">Rob Recommends: <em>Conclave</em></h2><figure></figure><p>Twenty minutes into <em>Conclave</em>, having spent the entire opening of the film in a couple sparse rooms with middle-aged men speaking to each other in wary undertones, my wife turned to me and said, "<em>I am so fucking happy</em>." I felt similarly elated: here was a taut, superbly acted bureaucratic thriller. A self-contained story where you had a sense of the characters and the stakes almost from the moment they were introduced, and then watched them crashing into each other and sending the story through one sharp turn after another.</p><p>As deeply Catholic as the story might be, <em>Conclave</em> is also a film that recognizes the ways in which the Church is one of the world's oldest and largest corporations. The cardinals and bishops that arrive to elect a new Pope are men with their own power bases, serving different markets, with different visions for the future of the Church and different interpretations of its past. The stakes are high: efforts toward improvement and reform are incremental and fragile, insular sectarianism and reaction are always ready to sweep aside centuries of progress. And at the center of all this is Ralph Fiennes' doubting Thomas of a Vatican power broker, knowing he can tip the scale between those forces but not without sacrificing his integrity and loyalty to the position entrusted to him. A movie about faith and the crises of liberalism, <em>Conclave </em>is the most I've enjoyed a movie in years.</p><hr><h2 id="cado-recommends-mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-beginning">Cado Recommends: <em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX Beginning</em></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Sunrise</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's get the first thing out of the way: are you an OG <em>Gundam </em>fan? Then you should absolutely go see this movie in theaters (if you haven’t already). As a novice <em>Gundam</em> enjoyer, I wasn’t sure what to expect when I heard that Hideaki Anno, creator of <em>Evangelion,</em> was attached to a new <em>Gundam</em> series. <em>Evangelion </em>borrows heavily from the original <em>Gundam</em> so it was certainly interesting to see his name pop up when <em>Gquuuuuux </em>(pronounced “gh-quhcks” I think?) was announced. </p><p>Then, details for the series and its accompanying intro movie started to come out, and I started to get a picture of what Anno might be cooking: it was set in the UC timeline (Universal Century, essentially the mainline “canon” for the Gundam universe), but was it an alternate history?&nbsp;</p><p>In recent years, Anno has made a series of movies with the <em>Shin </em>moniker, a Japanese word that can mean many things, including “new.” In them, the acclaimed anime director revisited popular long running series like <em>Godzilla </em>with his own takes on them, revisiting the franchises of his youth with a modern lens. They were remakes in the sense that <em>Final Fantasy VII: Remake</em> was a remake: while some of the familiar beats and themes followed through, the plots of the movies were shifted to accommodate a new beginning to well established stories.</p><p>So, was <em>Gquuuuuux</em> Anno’s version of doing <em>Shin Gundam</em>? In a way it is, but it also managed to be much more than what the name <em>Shin Gundam</em> might’ve invoked in my mind. The opening 30 minutes had me hooting and hollering (internally), and was such a delight to experience first hand in a theater I can’t bring myself to spoil it. It’s a <em>Gundam</em> reimagining from a person who has very obviously spent the better part of his life rotating the original in his mind, examining all the angles. And while it may not hit as hard for people who haven’t seen the original series, it is still compelling enough and doesn’t overshadow the world that it sets up that the rest of the series will continue to explore. </p><p>Do you like big robots being used both as tools of control in tense geopolitical situations <em>and</em> in secret underground fighting rings? Do you want a story about the way a state tilts towards fascism while also getting not one but two extremely queer-coded relationships? Well, then you should run back in time (I think the last week was the final week of its theatrical run) to catch <em>Gquuuuuux </em>in theaters, or whenever it comes home.</p>

                <p>In 2024, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Palworld developer Pocketpair on patent infringement claims, and now Palworld's community manager has revealed more details on how it all went down.</p><p>Appearing at GDC 2025 this week, community manager John Buckley said Pocketpair did "legal checks" prior to Palworld's release to try to mitigate a lawsuit risk in Japan, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/it-was-a-very-depressing-day-palworld-community-manager-reveals-studios-reaction-to-nintendo-lawsuit/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer reported</a>. Given that, Buckley said the team was confused when Nintendo and The Pokemon Company sued Pocketpair in Japan.</p><p>"When the lawsuit was announced we were like, 'What?' And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts and asked, 'What's going on?' and that's when we realized it was patents they were going for,'" Buckley said.</p><p>He added that it was a "very depressing day" for Pocketpair when it got sued, adding that developers at Pocketpair are big fans of the Pokemon series.</p><p>"It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version, we were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show, so obviously we had to scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that," Buckley said.</p><p>Pocketpair posted <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a summery of the information</a>, which reveals that the three Japanese patents in question for the lawsuit are <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7545191B1/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7545191</a>, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7493117B2/en?oq=7493117" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7493117</a>, and <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/JP7528390B2/en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 7528390</a>. Instead of going after Palworld for its Pokemon-like creatures, the patents appear to be centered on the mechanics of throwing a ball at characters, riding characters in the game, and shooting at targets.</p><p>Nintendo and The Pokemon Company are seeking an injunction against Pocketpair and Palworld, as well as a payment of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-developer-shares-more-details-about-nintendos-lawsuit-against-the-game/1100-6527664/" data-ref-id="1100-6527664">5 million yen (which is roughly just under $33,000 USD). </a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto said Nintendo is going after Pocketpair and Palworld because Pocketpair was "copying what they are doing." Toto also noted that Nintendo was trying to "spit in their bowl" by suing Pocketpair just before Palworld came to PS5.</p><p>"I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business," Toto said.</p><p>Palworld continues to grow, as Pocketpair has just recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-cross-play-update-officially-confirmed-for-late-march/1100-6530069/" data-ref-id="1100-6530069">cross-play is coming at the end of March 2025.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-pokemon-sets-officially-announced-for-2026.1137846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego and The Pokemon Company have announced that a Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration is coming in 2026, although details about the collaboration are fairly scant right now.</p>

<p>The collaboration was <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official Lego website today, accompanied by a single teaser image that shows both the Lego and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>logos, as well as what appears to be a Pikachu's tail rendered in Lego form.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect to see Pikachu making an appearance in the Lego sets, but considering that the little electric mouse is easily the most popular Pokemon in the world, that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=7fvNQQJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=4Zc4HSKc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We can reasonably expect to see Pikachu appear as part of the recently-revealed Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration.</figcaption></figure><p>Lego describes the collaboration as "a brand-new collaboration that brings your love for bricks and your love for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>together", asking "Pokemon Trainers" to come together next year to "build and catch some of their favorite Pokemon".</p>

<p>The company goes on to describe its&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover as "a real Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>adventure", so it sounds like it'll be more than just some sets you can build with bricks; we can, perhaps, expect some interactive elements along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/build-real-life-mario-courses-with-lego-super-mario" rel="nofollow">the Lego&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>sets</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to keep up to date with the Lego <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>collaboration, you can do so by signing up to the Lego Insiders <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/insiders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter program</a>, which will keep you informed about everything to do with the crossover going forward.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't be the first collaboration between Nintendo and Lego; the two have crossed over on the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>Lego sets, as well as sets for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-ever-lego-mario-kart-sets" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>.</p>

<p>The presentation also revealed a new battling game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, as well as several updates to existing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles. It's all go for the world's biggest media franchise.</p>

Game Pass Core is available only on console.</p><p>Some of the other games in the Core catalog include Vampire Survivors, Halo 5, Stardew Valley, Limbo, Hellblade, Fallout 76, Grounded, Firewatch, Dishonored 2, Celeste, and Among Us.</p><p>By comparison, Game Pass Standard ($15/month) includes "hundreds" of games, while Game Pass Ultimate ($20/month) includes all of that plus day-one new releases for all first-party games, cloud gaming access, and an EA Play membership.</p><p>As for Game Pass Ultimate, the library grows this month with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adds-all-these-games-very-soon-in-march-2025/2900-6328/" data-ref-id="2900-6328">a bunch more games</a>, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-10-games-are-leaving-game-pass-soon/2900-6327/" data-ref-id="2900-6327">10 games are getting axed soon</a>.</p>

<p>Split Fiction has only been out for a little under two weeks—as of writing—and the game has seen incredible success in a short period of time. But that doesn’t mean developer Hazelight is resting on its laurels. In fact, Hazelight is already working on its next game.</p>



<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Hazelight head Josef Fares confirmed that the studio began working on its next title about a month ago. </p>



<p>“Split Fiction is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I’m so fully focused and excited on the next thing, that we’ve already started,” Fares said. </p>



<p>Fares added that the next game is still “way too early” in its development, but they have about 130 pages so far of current ideas for the game’s story.</p>



<p>“[It’s] mostly in the story, what’s going to happen but a little bit in gameplay as well,” he said. “It’s kind of like, ‘this is where we start, this is where we’re going.”</p>



<p>With Split Fiction having done so well at release, Fares says that the studio has a belief that it can do anything it puts effort towards. He said that the overall mood of the company is as good as its ever been, and there is a confidence of topping its past releases.</p>



<p>“We just feel like, when we talk in the lunchroom or we talk to each other, we’re like, ‘Oh shit, we feel we can do better than this.’,” he said. “That’s how confident we feel, and people are very happy and excited. It’s a very happy place, Hazelight.”</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review.1137780/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In an era where open-world games are a dime a dozen, Xenoblade Chronicles X soars above the pack. There’s an unparalleled feeling of freedom and exploration as you fly your mech suit across the massive planet of Mira, the size of which dwarfs other RPGs like it. While its story about humanity finding another home can be forgettable at times, an already engaging battle system is bolstered by the dramatic quality-of-life improvements this Definitive Edition makes, resulting in an RPG unlike any other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xenoblade Chronicles X starts off with the human race boarding spaceships in an attempt to escape Earth after it gets caught in the crossfire of an alien war. Your ship, the White Whale, eventually crash-lands on Mira, and it falls on you to find its scattered remnants from the freshly settled city of New Los Angeles. It’s a passable story in a vacuum, but it’s also the weakest of the Xenoblade games overall. That’s partially due to its customizable silent protagonist, who is completely devoid of any personality. That blank slate means the story lacks the same emotional impact as the other games in the series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the side quests really help pick up the slack, with fascinating worldbuilding and compelling character development for the rest of your party and even many NPCs. For example, as all of humanity was forced to band together in order to survive, one basic quest explores the topic of discrimination against other alien races – it offers important insight into how humans interact with those races on Mira and how friendships can be forged across racial boundaries outside of Earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing any mission increases the Affinity levels of whoever is in your party at the time, which can then unlock Heart-to-Heart events for them. These are special scenes that provide essential bits of extra backstory, similar to how Persona and The Legend of Heroes handle their bonding events. For instance, Colonel Elma’s cold personality starts to melt away as you learn more about her interest in cars and pizza, fleshing out her character and showing us a different side that the main story doesn’t.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once a character has a high enough Affinity level, you’ll also unlock their personalized Affinity Missions, and the rewards for completing these are some of the most substantial available. The main draw is that your protagonist will learn exclusive combat skills, called Arts, that otherwise can’t be obtained by leveling up. It’s an excellent incentive to learn more about the supporting cast while also getting stronger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your main character may be bland, but the world is certainly not.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One standout is the engineer, Lin. Her Affinity Mission details how integral her engineering skills and passion were to the White Whale. While she would much rather sit on the sidelines, she understands that she must also fight when needed, which is why she wields a giant shield and gatling gun in battle. Personal moments with your crew like this really help balance out the fact that your bland silent hero doesn’t have any of their own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Definitive Edition even includes brand new recruitable characters, as well as new story content that is well worth seeing. Without going into spoilers, this content is dolled out at an even pace throughout the 50-60 hour campaign, making its inclusion feel natural while adding even more longevity to an already massive game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your main character may be bland, one thing that’s certainly not is the open world of Xenoblade Chronicles X. It’s divided into five regions, each with its own type of terrain. For example, the beginning area of Primordia is a lush grassland, while a later area called Cauldros feels overpowering with its lava fields. There are so many gorgeous landmarks scattered throughout Mira that keep exploration exciting, from the giant natural overpass called Arendt Bridge in Primordia to the mysterious and mechanical Leaning Ring sticking halfway out of the sand in the desert region of Oblivia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the only hub area for human activity is New LA, everywhere else is still absolutely filled to the brim with life. Both small and giant monsters are crawling in every direction, but what makes them stand out is that some are docile while others are hostile. The low level bee monster might attack you on sight, but that level 40 gigantic dinosaur-like creature could just walk right past you, minding its own business. Each species has its own habits and behaviors, which means you have to stay alert as you explore instead of just mindlessly meandering around like in many other open-world games. Some monsters will only show up at certain times of day, too, which you can now conveniently adjust from the menu rather than having to find and use special pods scattered throughout Mira.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What also helps is the speed at which you run. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may be great overall, but I was constantly frustrated by how slow Cloud ran, realistic or not. In Xenoblade Chronicles X, your character runs incredibly fast in contrast. Mira’s gravity also feels like the moon’s, letting you cover long distances and even reach higher elevations with a single jump. Decisions like these make exploring Mira much smoother and less intimidating.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s impressive how well the world scales up with its mechs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also impressive how well the world scales up with its mechs, called Skells, which unlock once you get far enough into the story. When in your Skell, you can move even faster than running on foot, but those giant monsters that were peaceful before may now be hostile to you. That means sometimes it’s better to run to a destination instead of driving your Skell there depending on what is standing in your path. This constantly changes the dynamic between you and Mira’s environment, keeping exploration fresh. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Towards the end of the story, your Skell even gets the ability to fly, letting you reach higher altitudes and providing access to mountains you couldn’t explore at the beginning. This brings exploration to new heights, making Mira really feel like humanity’s new home as you gain the ability to go pretty much anywhere unrestricted.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Everybody was MMO fighting</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat in the Xenoblade Chronicles series is in real-time, but it is distinct from other battle systems as it feels much more like an MMO. Both enemies and allies fight with basic auto-attacks, and you have a row of more powerful Arts to choose from at the bottom of the screen. The order you use them in is similarly important – for example, some offensive Arts can inflict Topple onto enemies, which is a status condition that causes them to fall to the ground temporarily, while others then do more damage to Toppled enemies. There’s a lot of synergy to play around with that adds quite a bit of strategy to the action.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another unique feature is the Soul Voice. RPG characters love to call out the names of their attacks and spout quippy one-liners as they fight, and Xenoblade Chronicles actually turns that trope into a game mechanic! You and your allies will occasionally shout out specific phrases that suggest certain actions, like using an Art that inflicts a status effect (which is color coded purple) – following that suggestion will then activate a purple Soul Voice, giving you extra bonuses like making the enemy more susceptible to status effects. It’s immersive while simultaneously leaning into the genre’s more absurd elements.</p><div id="rank-every-xenoblade-chronicles-game" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank Every Xenoblade Chronicles Game</h3><h3>Rank Every Xenoblade Chronicles Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While that’s all just as fun as it was in the 2015 original on Wii U, Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition also adds a bevy of quality-of-life improvements. One substantial addition is the Quick Cooldown bar, which fills up over the course of battle as you use auto-attacks. By spending a portion of the bar, you can completely bypass the cooldown period of any Art and use it right away. Need extra healing and can’t wait? Use your healing Art then Quick Cooldown to save your allies from getting knocked out. The Quick Cooldown bar builds fairly slowly, so it’s important to pick the right time to use it, but it can instantly turn the tide of battle when you do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the biggest adjustment is that you can now conveniently change out your party members at any time, anywhere, from a separate menu. While this is a basic feature of many RPGs, the original version instead asked you to memorize where every single character was within New LA and go talk to them in order to swap them in. Sure, maybe that process was more tied to the world around you, but it was also painstaking and incredibly annoying – especially if you were out exploring, since you’d have to return to New LA to change your lineup. This single change is monumental, and quite frankly, is enough to make the Wii U version feel completely obsolete on its own.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Definitive Edition cuts down on unnecessary grinding.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of that, characters not in your active party will still gain EXP now, reducing the tedium of swapping people around even further. In the Wii U version, benched members had to be brought in and leveled separately, making for some very uneven party compositions. The Definitive Edition enormously cuts down on unnecessary grinding, which is certainly appreciated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for customization, each party member has a specific class that can’t be changed, like Lin as a Shield Trooper, but your custom character can switch their class at will. By going down different class trees, you can level up their ranks to learn new Arts and passive abilities. That makes the protagonist feel like they belong in Fire Emblem, where characters can mix and match different skills, and it’s fun to play around and find the perfect setup that fits your playstyle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also fight in your Skell, and Xenoblade Chronicles X scales its battles to them just as well as its exploration. Their overinflated stats and power make mincemeat out of smaller enemies, but they are perfect for facing off against Mira’s giants and other bosses that would otherwise crush you. Battles in your Skell play out similarly to ones on foot, except the Skell weapons you equip determine what kind of Arts you have. It’s another added layer of depth and tinkering that pleased the min-maxing part of my brain.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">George's favorite Japanese RPGs</h3><p>George's list of his 10 favorite Japanese RPGs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the quality-of-life changes listed above, the Definitive Edition boasts some nice visual improvements, too. The UI is much cleaner and the character models are sharper (as you’d hope they would be a decade later), which makes for a smoother look finally worthy of one of the best sci-fi gaming series around. With the Wii U gamepad gone, fast travel and map info have also been smartly reworked into a separate menu on a single screen, transitioning that information perfectly over to Switch. Now I no longer have to experience the neck pain issues caused by having to constantly <em>switch</em> between looking down at my gamepad and back up at the TV screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also some returning multiplayer functionality in Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition, though I wasn’t able to test these features as the servers were not on during this review period. In the Wii U version, you could recruit the avatars of other players to tackle Squad Missions such as defeating a specific group of enemies, and online Nemesis Missions offered a satisfying way to test your endgame skills. While minor parts of an otherwise single-player heavy game, these multiplayer elements contributed to the more MMO-centric identity that makes Xenoblade Chronicles X unique, so here’s hoping they’ll have been done justice in the final version of the Definitive Edition.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ahead of today's public debut of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-demo-announced-for-march-18-as-rtx-remix-is-officially-released-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>, NVIDIA provided us with access to the first taste of this highly anticipated remaster. Let's first recap what we know about it, though.</p>
<p>Modders have long toyed with the idea of remastering Valve's 2004 first-person shooter masterpiece using NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform. Even before RTX Remix was officially available in any capacity, modders grabbed Portal RTX (the first example of an RTX Remix-powered remaster) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-rtx-dropped-into-other-games-half-life-2-max-payne-swat-4-makes-them-drop-dead-gorgeous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">injected it into Half-Life 2</a> with promising results as early as December 2022.</p>
<p>A few months later, when NVIDIA released the RTX Remix Runtime as open source software, modder Igor Zdrowowicz further <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-path-tracing-mod-nvidia-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> the potential of the game when coupled with path tracing. However, at Gamescom 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-2-rtx-is-in-development-by-a-group-of-modders-will-support-ray-tracing-dlss-3-rtx-io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that a group of modders had formed Orbifold Studios specifically to create Half-Life 2 RTX with the blessing of NVIDIA (and Valve) with RTX Remix. It wouldn't be just a quick and dirty project, either - the team wanted to remaster every single asset in the game, as well as use all of NVIDIA's technologies to the fullest extent. Right away, it was announced that the game would use RTX IO, DLSS 3, and ray tracing. Over time, though, as NVIDIA updated and expanded the RTX suite, the project benefited as well.</p>
<p>The Half-Life 2 RTX demo includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>NVIDIA's most advanced path tracer, featuring up to four times more bounce lights than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft RTX</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/rtx-direct-illumination-shows-games-will-soon-feature-up-to-millions-of-dynamic-lights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination</a>, which enables millions of dynamic lights in a game environment without major performance or resource constraints. With RTXDI, all geometry emits light, casts shadows, and moves freely and dynamically</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/neural-radiance-cache-technique-aims-to-make-path-tracing-faster-on-nvidia-gpus-thanks-to-tensor-cores-and-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Neural Radiance Cache</a>, the first implementation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neural shading</a> in a game yet. With NRC, a grid of AI neural networks is trained on a player's real-time game data to calculate indirect lighting for the scene, improving the lighting quality and also performance at the same time. NVIDIA says NRC provides up to 15% improved performance in Half-Life 2 RTX.</li>
<li>The newly unveiled RTX Volumetrics and RTX Skin effects. The former uses a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-researchers-demonstrate-new-raytracing-algorithm-that-can-render-direct-lighting-from-millions-of-dynamic-light-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReSTIR</a>-based algorithm to calculate volumes and accurately track how light scatters through the air, fog, smoke, and atmosphere, ensuring physically accurate volumetric shadows, light diffusion, and atmospheric depth. The latter is an enhanced form of subsurface scattering that accurately simulates how light interacts with skin.</li>
<li>Remastered assets with PBR properties</li>
<li>Remade particles</li>
<li>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, I enabled all of these effects in this test powered by AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090 Founder's Edition. I manually set NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to Quality (it was set to Auto, which likely scales to Performance mode when using 4K resolution) and cranked up Multi Frame Generation to 4x (by default, it's set at 3x). The results were excellent, to say the least.</p>

<p>The computer averaged 190 frames per second in our Ravenholm benchmark. Moreover, stuttering was nearly nonexistent, with just 3,59% of the frame time in the red area, according to the Frame Latency Analytics Tool.</p>

<p>The average frame rate was even higher (193 FPS) in the Nova Prospekt level, the second and last available in the Half-Life 2 RTX demo. However, this level registered a far lower minimum frame rate (down to 60 FPS); as such, due to the far larger delta between the maximum and minimum frame rate, the stuttering was significantly higher, according to the data.</p>

<p>This level features a lot more fighting, which could help explain the difference. There might be some more optimization left to do, too. Even so, subjectively, that didn't bother me at all while playing it.</p>

<p>I was so engrossed with the incredible level of visuals that I would have been hard-pressed to notice some micro-stutters, despite usually being quite sensitive to them. Half-Life 2 RTX boasts amazingly remade assets that show outstanding fidelity even when zoomed upon. In this regard, the team at Orbifold has done incredible work so far. And then, of course, there's the path tracing, boosted by RTXDI and Neural Radiance Cache. The game is completely transformed with them, almost entirely for the better, with bounce lights and indirect lighting illuminating everything they should and bringing the environments to life.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only caveat is of an artistic nature here. If you compare the remaster with the original, in some cases, it could be said that there is a bit too much illumination coming from certain light bulbs, slightly deviating from the somber atmosphere of Half-Life 2. It's a piece of feedback that Orbifold will hopefully take to heart as they fine-tune the game's look before the full release.</p>

<p>Of course, the RTX Remix platform does allow users extensive amounts of tweaking. However, most players will likely just want to enjoy the remastered game without having to fiddle too much with the developer settings. As such, it may be beneficial to provide a preset that sticks closer to the original game. Beyond that, while the animations were said to have been improved, they're by far the clunkiest part of the demo, standing out negatively in comparison to the great visual strides. Again, hopefully, the full game can deliver improvements in this area.</p>

<p>Overall, though, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo is an incredibly impressive showcase of the remastering capabilities of the newly released RTX Remix tool (not to mention of NVIDIA's latest technologies, of course). Granted, it's unlikely that many other classics will receive the same level of treatment; in this case, a talented team has grouped and received the help of NVIDIA to develop a professional-grade remaster. Moreover, Valve's game lends itself well to such a remastering job due to its linearity. A game like The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, despite originally being among NVIDIA's RTX Remix early showcases, would be much more complicated. Still, several older PC games could be brought to modern standards with the tool, which would be great for everyone.</p>
