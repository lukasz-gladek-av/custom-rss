Most of what we’ve seen of the RPG thus far has been in the early game, so we still didn’t have a strong grasp of what high-level encounters look like. There have been a lot of questions surrounding the sequel, as we’d been hearing the studio talk a fair bit about how some long-held mechanics for the series, such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">controlling your party members</a></span> and having access to all your abilities, wouldn’t be returning in <em>The Veilguard</em>. So now’s the time to see what those things were replaced with in this more action-focused RPG. If you don’t have time to watch the full breakdown, here are some of the big takeaways.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-recommend-id="image://6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-recommend-id="image://6a70fadfcde96b0ff11b26275865548d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Choosing Rook's abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A lot of <em>The Veilguard</em>’s systems seem to draw heavily from <em>Mass Effect</em>, and that includes a spin on <em>Andromeda</em>’s ability loadouts. Since you can’t access all your abilities on a wheel like you used to, <em>The Veilguard</em> has you decide on what attacks you’ll have at your disposal on a given quest and assign them. The showcase had a warrior version of protagonist Rook kitted out with a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Prc1UfuokY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Prc1UfuokY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Sparta”</a></span>-style kick, a grappling spear used to draw enemies in close, and a shield-like aura to protect her from damage. They definitely seem to be going for a tanky, brawler build, and picking the abilities best for whatever approach you’re going for will be key to defining your playstyle.<br></p><p>Also in the loadout is an Ultimate ability called Warden’s Fire, which rains down an area-of-effect attack on enemies. It sounds like this might be exclusive to Grey Warden Rooks, one of the origins you can select for your hero&nbsp;in the character creator at the beginning of the game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-recommend-id="image://bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-recommend-id="image://bf0d43a58509ca3011bc296518a79f07" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player choosing runes for Rook's equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Runes are used to augment equipment in the <em>Dragon Age </em>games, and they’ll be making their return in <em>The Veilguard</em>. The Warrior showcase shows the player equipping runes that are effective for crowd control, such as one that weakens enemies within a six-meter radius of Rook. The synergy between your class, ability loadout, and your runes will be key to making sure you have an effective build.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d1f81f025df8b0648786bb629ef4dfad" data-recommend-id="image://d1f81f025df8b0648786bb629ef4dfad" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard's skill tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard's skill tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1f81f025df8b0648786bb629ef4dfad" data-recommend-id="image://d1f81f025df8b0648786bb629ef4dfad" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard's skill tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up we got a look at the skill tree, which includes stat buffs, abilities, and specialization branches. The showcase highlights the Champion specialization, which gives a Warrior defense-driven abilities, so it’s meant to be a frontline tank. This is further underlined by acquiring Heavy Armor Mastery in the skill tree to allow Rook to wear the most powerful armor sets in the game.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a382241dced4daab66eb4466167d2405" data-recommend-id="image://a382241dced4daab66eb4466167d2405" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook swings her sword while it's covered in fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook swings her sword while it's covered in fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a382241dced4daab66eb4466167d2405" data-recommend-id="image://a382241dced4daab66eb4466167d2405" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook swings her sword while it's covered in fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The sequence BioWare shows here includes Darkspawn enemies, who are susceptible to fire damage, but they don’t bring a mage character like Neve to cast fireballs. We instead see Rook equipping burn-based equipment to add a fiery element to their physical attacks. Given you can only have two party members with you in <em>The Veilguard</em>, it’s nice to know you won’t have to default to having one of every class to handle certain situations, as that would be more limiting.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8a715c0eae4b1db514f511bfd93c2b1b" data-recommend-id="image://8a715c0eae4b1db514f511bfd93c2b1b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard party selection screen shows Davrin and Lucanis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Veilguard party selection screen shows Davrin and Lucanis." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a715c0eae4b1db514f511bfd93c2b1b" data-recommend-id="image://8a715c0eae4b1db514f511bfd93c2b1b" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Veilguard party selection screen shows Davrin and Lucanis." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s our first look at the party selection screen, which uses <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition’s</em> gorgeous tarot card-style art, but also has a <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>-style render of the characters. The trailer includes the Grey Warden Warrior Davrin and the Antivan Crows Rogue Lucanis, who I’m leaning towards for my own party when I play <em>The Veilguard</em> because I also plan to make them fight for my love and affection.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ee2206c0fd28dc01a2087992f02cd3af" data-recommend-id="image://ee2206c0fd28dc01a2087992f02cd3af" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook has an alert above their head when they are nearly hit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook has an alert above their head when they are nearly hit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ee2206c0fd28dc01a2087992f02cd3af" data-recommend-id="image://ee2206c0fd28dc01a2087992f02cd3af" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook has an alert above their head when they are nearly hit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When we saw <em>The Veilguard </em>at Summer Game Fest in June, one thing I noticed about the action-oriented combat is that Rook seems to have a <em>Batman: Arkham</em> or <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man-</em>style alert above their head when an enemy attack is incoming. Initially, I wondered if this might be exclusive to the Rogue class, as the dual-dagger playstyle is meant to be nimble and quick on their feet. But it looks like this also applies to the Warrior class.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="945eff6a4a04f824d3b8955ce0c7820a" data-recommend-id="image://945eff6a4a04f824d3b8955ce0c7820a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook dodge and weaves through the battlefield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook dodge and weaves through the battlefield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="945eff6a4a04f824d3b8955ce0c7820a" data-recommend-id="image://945eff6a4a04f824d3b8955ce0c7820a" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook dodge and weaves through the battlefield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Veilguard </em>seems to prioritize fast-paced action, so even if the Warrior class is meant to stand their ground and control the crowd, we can see Rook rolling, parrying, and getting in and out of a scrap with relative ease as a shield-wielding Warrior with passive abilities like having a fire element added to their weapons by parrying incoming attacks. So the class seems like it’s been fine-tuned for the action pivot.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b8689de0248320ab1c45c7b70cc1f44f" data-recommend-id="image://b8689de0248320ab1c45c7b70cc1f44f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook kicks an enemy off a cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook kicks an enemy off a cliff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8689de0248320ab1c45c7b70cc1f44f" data-recommend-id="image://b8689de0248320ab1c45c7b70cc1f44f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook kicks an enemy off a cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, you can use the kick ability to reenact that one scene from <em>300</em>. Rook is shown kicking a Darkspawn off the side of a cliff, and it looks pretty damn satisfying to pull off if the circumstances are right.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d750766f82120484f8a4709aa4e3c9dc" data-recommend-id="image://d750766f82120484f8a4709aa4e3c9dc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook pulls up the Ability Wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook pulls up the Ability Wheel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d750766f82120484f8a4709aa4e3c9dc" data-recommend-id="image://d750766f82120484f8a4709aa4e3c9dc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook pulls up the Ability Wheel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Davrin and Lucanis are shown having three abilities just as Rook does through the Ability Wheel, and pulling up this menu during fights has a fair bit of intel to help you in a fight. Combo opportunities between Rook and their companions are labeled, enemy vulnerabilities and resistances are laid out, and you can command your party to use either specific abilities or just direct their attacks toward a targeted foe.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fff349ba71cb0c44544c4237ef70881d" data-recommend-id="image://fff349ba71cb0c44544c4237ef70881d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook delivers a finishing blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook delivers a finishing blow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fff349ba71cb0c44544c4237ef70881d" data-recommend-id="image://fff349ba71cb0c44544c4237ef70881d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook delivers a finishing blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you and your enemies tussle in <em>The Veilguard</em>, you’ll notice they have<em> </em>a stagger bar above their life bar. Focusing on an enemy and hitting them with a barrage of attacks will put them into a staggered state once this bar fills, which will open them up to greater damage or a takedown finishing move. This can be increased by inflicting status effects like the Overwhelmed debuff via Davrin’s Heroic Strike attack.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2063479422c708d3a6df4f96ac71f520" data-recommend-id="image://2063479422c708d3a6df4f96ac71f520" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook throws her shield at a group of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook throws her shield at a group of enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2063479422c708d3a6df4f96ac71f520" data-recommend-id="image://2063479422c708d3a6df4f96ac71f520" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook throws her shield at a group of enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve got a shield-based build, you can throw your metal frisbee like Captain America. That’s pretty cool, in my personal opinion. This Warrior Rook had spec’d their build to include the Shield Volley passive ability, which allows it to ricochet off multiple enemies. If you don’t think that’s the tightest shit, I can’t help you.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="072f5dcdb3758bc3b1ef0846800326c7" data-recommend-id="image://072f5dcdb3758bc3b1ef0846800326c7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assan attacks an enemy from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Assan attacks an enemy from above." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="072f5dcdb3758bc3b1ef0846800326c7" data-recommend-id="image://072f5dcdb3758bc3b1ef0846800326c7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Assan attacks an enemy from above." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t know if we can pet Davrin’s griffon friend Assan yet, but if the Grey Warden is in your party, he has an ability called Death From Above, which calls down the creature to attack enemies from a distance. That shit rules, and I’m feeling like Davrin having a pet is already endearing me to him before the game is even out, which is an unfair advantage in this love triangle I’m thinking about weaving through my playthrough. Lucanis, get a pet. Even the odds.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fcfac2bb7e509e0e964268111b5d09a0" data-recommend-id="image://fcfac2bb7e509e0e964268111b5d09a0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis casts Eviscerate on a group of frozen enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lucanis casts Eviscerate on a group of frozen enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fcfac2bb7e509e0e964268111b5d09a0" data-recommend-id="image://fcfac2bb7e509e0e964268111b5d09a0" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lucanis casts Eviscerate on a group of frozen enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games have had ability combos that allowed players to use abilities to set up devastating combos, but <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to codify it a bit further by baking primers and detonators into its systems. The example shown in the trailer is using a Crystallize rune to encase a group of enemies in ice, then having Lucanis follow it up with an area-of-effect ability called Eviscerate.

<p>Stalker 2 was recently delayed by GSC Game World and pushed back to November, which left some players stewing in dismay. It’s not the first time the game has been delayed, but hopefully, it’ll be the last. At Gamescom, the Stalker 2 team hosted a live, hands-on demo of the game, inviting players to enjoy 20 minutes of the intense survival shooter.</p>



<p>During the event in Cologne, the team from GSC Game World opened up about the expansiveness of the game, stressing that it’ll take 100 hours to fully complete Stalker 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-by-hand">All By Hand</h2>



<p>Speaking to GamesRadar, GSC’s Yevnhenii Kulyk explained that Stalker 2 is ‘huge’ and that it’ll take the average player around 100 hours to rinse it. As he broke down the depth of Stalker 2, he mentioned that the team used almost no procedural generation to create the massive in-game map, which incorporates areas in and around Chornobyl and Pripyat known as ‘The Zone’.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/stalker-2-dev-says-the-game-is-huge-takes-100-hours-to-fully-beat-and-was-built-entirely-by-hand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, it was stressed that ‘everything you see in the game was actually touched by a human hand.’</p>



<p>Kulyk said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everything you may notice or experience in our game was made by the hands of our talented level designers, level artists, team designers, and so on. You will not notice two exact buildings or two exact rooms with the same placement of the same props of meshes or something like that. Every player that is playing Stalker 2 will get their story.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stalker 2 is one of this year’s most highly anticipated releases. I got hands-on with the game at Gamescom and was blown away by the depth of it. It’s a harrowing experience for players expecting an easy ride, and the world-building is nothing short of stunning. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/soneium-blockchain-sony-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-has-launched-%E2%80%98soneium%E2%80%99-blockchain-to-get-closer-to-web3-devs.962958/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/soneium-blockchain-sony-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Sony has just revealed the development of Soneium, an all-new blockchain that aims to create ‘a world where Web3 use cases are a part of daily life.’ It’s not yet open to the public, but the plan is to flesh out an ecosystem that’ll one day facilitate Web3 game creation, interactions with NFT marketplaces, and ‘entertainment-related services’.</p>



<p>The tech titan said an extensive array of tools and environments will be provided to developers leaning on Soneium. They’ll be accessible, cost-effective, and user-friendly, and soon, a test environment will be set up for those eager to piece together applications that rely on the Soneium blockchain.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-very-significant-developments">‘Very Significant’ Developments</h2>



<p>In a statement, Sony’s Jun Watanabe spoke positively about the future of Web3 on Soneium, despite many naysayers claiming the company is getting involved far too late to gain traction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p id="anchor2-2">I think the development of a comprehensive Web3 solution based on blockchain is very significant to the Sony Group, which has developed a wide variety of businesses under its purpose of “Fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology.” We will work to create diverse businesses and new use cases with the aim of delivering customer value that can only be enjoyed through Web3 technology to as many users as possible and making people’s lives richer and more colorful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At the end of August, Sony will take to the stage at WebX in Tokyo, presenting further information about Soneium, an innovation from Sony Block Solutions Labs.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202408/24-029E/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release published by Sony</a> explained that other businesses within the Sony Group will be explored for ways to link them to the Soneium platform. It wasn’t explicitly mentioned, but it’s assumed that this would include PlayStation. </p>



<p>It came down to dollars and cents towards the end of the press release, with Sony addressing the ‘new value’ streams that Soneium will open up, particularly in the <em>crypto asset trading </em>space. </p>



<p>Do you think Sony is a little late to the party with this?</p>

<p>Fallout hails from executive producers Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy, the creators of Westworld. It stars Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, and Walton Goggins.</p>
<p>Described as a story of "haves and have-nots in a world in which there’s almost nothing left to have", the show is set "200 years after the apocalypse, [when] the gentle denizens of luxury fallout shelters are forced to return to the irradiated hellscape their ancestors left behind and are shocked to discover an incredibly complex, gleefully weird and highly violent universe waiting for them".</p>
<p>Fresh from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-adaptation-nominated-for-16-emmy-awards">nominations for 16 Emmy Awards</a>, the second season of Amazon's Fallout TV show is in production and "ahead of schedule".</p>

This includes assigning abilities, as you’ll have to make a loadout of select attacks similar to <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> rather than having a huge wheel to choose from in the previous games, navigating the skill tree and specializations, and choosing equipment that will be effective against enemies you know you’ll be facing on a certain quest. The showcase also shows the party selection screen—which features my husbands <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-companions-party-members-dreadwolf-1851530857">Davrin and Lucanis</a></span>—so you can see how party members interact on the battlefield as well.</p><p>The encounter shown in the trailer includes fighting Darkspawn enemies, which are used to showcase enemy elemental weaknesses. With the Warrior class, you’ll be able to empower your weapons with elemental affinities such as a passive fire property, meaning you won’t be without options for elemental damage if there’s no mage in your party. The video also shows off companion commands, party synergy, and some stats and debuffs to be mindful of. The trailer wraps things up showing off primers and detonators, which, again, feels very <em>Mass Effect</em>-y in terms of one character setting up enemies with a status effect and another following it up for explosive damage. On top of having two companions you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-companions-controls-1851616515">only control through commands</a></span>, it definitely feels like a lot of the design philosophies of the science fiction series have made their way to <em>Dragon Age</em>.</p><p>Overall, despite the action-heavy leanings, <em>The Veilguard</em> does seem to have a fair bit going on under the hood.

		<p>Since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> first unveiled its new PvP multiplayer shooter, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, sentiment surrounding the game has been mixed to say the least. In the weeks leading up to the game’s launch it’s been hard to ignore the outpouring of negativity, especially on social media platforms where official Concord updates are usually met with laughing emojis and memes, as well as claims from video game “fans” that it will be dead on arrival.</p>

<p>The fact that beta numbers were lower than expected and Concord only managing to hit a peak of 697 active PC players on launch day will no doubt feed into this conjured narrative that it’s an inherently bad game. That just isn’t true. Developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> has carefully crafted a fun and vibrant online shooter that, while it has some kinks to iron out, has proved to be one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences of 2024.</p>
<p>So, what’s with all the negativity? It seems bizarre that anyone who truly cares about video games would want to campaign against a newcomer looking to break into such a hotly-contested genre.</p>
<p>A rudimentary scan through some of the comments and discussions surrounding Concord reveals a vocal minority seemingly hellbent on the game’s demise simply because it dares to feature a diverse cast of heroes. In particular, female characters who don’t conform to imagined beauty standards, and the inclusion of pronouns in hero bios (a minor detail many won’t even notice in-game). Concord’s very existence, it seems, is an affront to this vocal minority who believe they are fighting a moral crusade, choosing to spend their free time moaning about fictional agendas rather than championing the hobby they claim to love.</p>


<p>Even without the tiresome “anti-woke” mob, Sony’s hot new shooter has contend with prospective players asking why they should be spending £35 on a game that shares an arena with so many free-to-play alternatives. It’s a tricky spot to be in: if Concord had launched as a free-to-play title instead, we’d no doubt be hearing about how content is locked behind paywalls and money-grabbing monetisation.</p>
<p>Sony has opted for the former strategy, charging players a one-time fee to experience every nugget of playable content Concord has to offer, without pushing premium battle passes, and promising even more maps, modes, and heroes in future updates. That isn’t even mentioning the quality of the game itself. We’ll hold fire on our full critical analysis until our review in the coming days but, overall, Concord is a highly polished first person shooter with fast, frenetic gameplay and a dynamic cast of characters to master. The negative sentiment surrounding its launch is misplaced, and we’d be disappointed if Concord failed to gain the momentum it deserves.</p>

            <p>More Call of Duty Black Ops 6 footage has leaked online, this time purporting to be from its multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Whilst the videos were eventually removed by the uploader themselves rather than a copyright claim, the footage - reportedly from the PC version - gave thousands of fans a sneaky peek before going offline.</p>
<p>As you may well expect by now, dozens of mirrors are popping up faster than Activision can take them down.</p>

<p>In a thread on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ez7p2s/black_ops_6_leaked_multiplayer_gameplay/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, fans commented on the "insanely fast" time-to-kill (although many players dispute it any faster than other recent Call of Duty game) and the new movement system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some commenters also note that the uploader may have been using cheats, too, pointing to signs they were using aim assist cheat, Cronus Zen.</p>

This is exacerbated by so much of the stuff we’ve seen in trailers constantly jumping to cinematic third-person views, given how odd of an angle it is when trying to show off the game. But now we’ve seen ten minutes of in-game footage, and it’s starting to make more sense. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-recommend-id="image://8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-recommend-id="image://8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a fine line between medieval gameplay that’s historically accurate and medieval gameplay that’s fun.

But I’m surprised by just how “immersive sim” it is, even if I get the sense Warhorse might shudder at that characterization.

That was the question that faced <em>Dying Light</em> developers Techland as they worked on the next entry for the long-running zombie-battling parkour franchise. Intended to be the second major piece of DLC for 2022’s <em>Dying Light 2</em>, what has now been announced as standalone release <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> made this transition through a process of disaster and inspiration. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-beast-techland-preview-roger-craig-smith-1851629671">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="661fb79e56323fe3705b256468c5367b" data-recommend-id="image://661fb79e56323fe3705b256468c5367b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pax, Sai, Noam, and Theo ride in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pax, Sai, Noam, and Theo ride in a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Red Thread Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="661fb79e56323fe3705b256468c5367b" data-recommend-id="image://661fb79e56323fe3705b256468c5367b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pax, Sai, Noam, and Theo ride in a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In its first few hours, Red Thread Games’ <em>Dustborn </em>flaunts so many of the qualities I look for in a story-driven adventure game. It’s full of relationship-building with complex characters, has stakes that are just high enough to draw me into the weight of each dialogue choice I make, and its supernatural elements don’t feel so overbearing that they detract from the humanity at its center. I’m hooked. I want to learn more about protagonist Pax and her group of nomadic, superpowered roadtrippers. But, my god, I haven’t hit a momentum killer like <em>Dustborn</em>’s action combat in a game I’m otherwise enthralled by in a hot minute. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dustborn-impressions-preview-characters-combat-rhythm-1851630273">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
