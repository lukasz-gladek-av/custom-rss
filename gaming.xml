I think the idea of a chill, cosy, and/or “Zen” factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> is among the most pernicious to ever dribble from a game developer’s earhole, but I can’t deny how... soothing it can be to look down on a world of symmetrically nested conveyor belts. At least till your iron smelting district backs up. Modulus seems zouper-douper Zen. It also has a pleasing consistency: in this factory game, you shape and manufacture pieces for buildings which, as far as I can tell from the devlog below, can then be used to manufacture pieces for other buildings.

These building parts aren’t generic, liquid resources that magically add up into an airport or similar, once you’ve met the requirements. You can trace them within the architecture of the resulting construction. Rather than growing them from a given recipe, you’ll also sculpt these building parts from clumps of smaller cubes. You can venture inside each production facility to rotate, colour, stamp and trim these cubes to satisfaction, a mechanic that reminds me distantly of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industries-of-titan">Industries of Titan</a>, but without the accumulating e-waste.
</p>
<p>
Yes, this is quite nice. It helps that the world you’re building factories in is a blend of pearly iPod paving stones and verdant plastic greenery. Very calming. Nicely... lacking in things besides factories.
</p>
<p>
“There are no timers, no enemies—just you and your factory,” adds the Steam page. “Relax and find your flow as you build at your own pace. Watch your factory expand, with monumental buildings emerging to meet the ever growing demand from The Grand Neural Network.” That last part sounds a little ominous. Still, I’m sure “ever growing demand” won’t cause any difficulties as long as the resources available to me are also “ever growing”. Incidentally, are there any animals in this world? Any people? Ah, no matter.
</p>
<p>
There’s a demo for Modulus in the works for 3rd April. It will encompass an estimated two hours of playtime, though it’s fundamentally “only limited in factory floor size.” It’ll also have an objective-free "Zen" mode and a tutorial. I guess I could have waited till the demo launch to write this up, but it’s a slow news day – it was either this or write about some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> nonsense. Besides, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2779120/Modulus/">you can sign up for the Modulus playtest right now on Steam</a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-you%E2%80%99ve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk.1148055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baby-steps-first-hands-on-preview-youve-got-to-fall-before-you-walk<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Five minutes. It only took me five minutes of my hour-long demo to become beguiled by the world of Baby Steps and see the promise of what developers Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy have in store for us. Baby Steps takes the simple premise of a guy on the couch, Nate, needing to find his way home after being transported into another world. It all starts straightforward enough: you wake up in a new world and need to put one foot in front of the other by lifting Nate's feet and thighs in an almost rhythmic way to make him walk, and if that sounds complicated, well, that is just the tip of the iceberg. During my preview, I climbed natural steps made of rock, walked across narrow beams of wood, and climbed the remains of a destroyed carousel from a circus, each challenging my grasp on the controls. Every location brought new challenges or obstacles and a new way I had to think about progressing over or past them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking in a game sounds so simple, but the complicated part and most significant challenge in Baby Steps is perfecting how to control the protagonist. Walking in 99% of games is as simple as holding up on an analog stick or pressing the assigned key on a keyboard. However, in Baby Steps, walking is anything but simple because while the left analog stick still directs movement, you control Nate's legs with the bumpers and triggers. Like QWOP, this took some time to get used to, leading to not an insignificant amount of flops, falls, and setbacks. But in Baby Steps, those setbacks are all just part of your journey and Nate's story of learning to put one foot in front of the other as he traverses landscapes decorated with natural and unnatural slopes, steps, mountains, and other obstacles to test your prowess with controlling him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Baby Steps is shaping up to be the largest world yet from the team that brought us QWOP, Ape Out, and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. During my sessions, they remarked that I was the fourth person that day to play, and each of us had taken different paths as we explored. Although there is a great joke about it, Baby Steps follows in the footsteps of some other recent open-world games but goes even further. There are no directions to guide Nate on his journey, no map, no markers, no radar – nothing. You only have your intuition to guide you. Maybe you will spot a sign offering a reward if a lost cup is found and returned, perhaps you'll see the remains of a circus, or possibly something glowing hanging from a tree hanging off the edge of a nearby mountain. All of these and more are Baby Steps’s ways of telling you to go somewhere, and it works remarkably well; not once did I find myself lost in this vast open world or feel like I didn't know where to go, what to do, or how to overcome an obstacle. The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly so he can maneuver around narrow ledges, finding spots to increase your height to reach the next foothold or surface you can stand on, and it's all done without the use of yellow paint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yellow paint isn't as immersion-breaking for me as it apparently is for some. When chatting with the team about it, they spoke about how, while useful, it's a tool for developers to tell players the right way to get from point A to B. However, Baby Steps doesn't use it because there is no "right" way to walk up a slippery hill or climb a rock with precarious footholds. Whatever way you end up accomplishing it, that is the right way. Now, some ways will be easier than others for sure, but even that mileage will vary based on your experience and determination. The team expects some players to see a path that looks too difficult and take the easier route early on, and then, after they have become more familiar with the controls and Nate's capabilities, return and try that tougher route. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The biggest challenge is not in finding the path somewhere, but in the execution of moving Nate properly...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also benefits to taking some of these more demanding routes or exploring the perceivably more challenging areas. Hidden little treats and bonuses are sprinkled throughout. The remains of that circus carousel I mentioned earlier actually had a funny little hat at the very top, and my reward for reaching the top was Nate wearing it as I explored the world. The catch is that these rewards aren't permanent, as I soon found my hat at the bottom of an outcropping of rocks after I tumbled while wearing it. The development team fully expects players to create their own challenges, such as, “Can I beat this game without losing this hat?” This may not sound like too tough a challenge, but it only takes one wrong step while climbing up a mountain or across a thin walkway to fall and watch your hat hurtle to the very bottom. Hats also aren't the only thing to collect. I won't spoil the details of that cup I previously mentioned, as it's a fun treat for some fans, but it gave me a good idea of the type of humor and extra challenges that Baby Steps has in store for its players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of humor, the few cutscenes I did manage to find by reaching various locations had me cackling with laughter during my preview. These cutscenes have a sort of absurd humor that stuck with me; the closest thing I could compare them to would be some of the off-the-wall humor you might see in an episode of Looney Tunes. Nate isn't the only person in this new world, but he seems to be the most awkward. Granted, the NPCs I met weren't exactly normal, either. From what I've seen so far, Nate's personality is a blend between that stereotypical child still living with their parents past the point that many would consider healthy and someone who would rather face hardships than interact with someone they aren't comfortable with. This trait becomes evident from the beginning of the game when he meets the first of what I hope are many recurring NPCs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The sound design and music also have interesting quirks to them; hearing the collisions, impacts, and sound of Nate as he slams face or body first into the world around him evokes that feeling you get when watching a show, and someone gets kicked in their groin or stubs their toe. Now, there is no health bar to keep track of, and from what I could tell, Nate can't die, regardless of whether I fell off a two-foot or 20-foot rock, which will make it a bit more approachable for those who might worry about dying in a game like this. Accompanying the sounds of Nate colliding with the environment are sounds of nature, birds squawking, insects chirping, frogs croaking, and various animals coming together to create a discordant yet harmonic soundtrack to explore to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I don't know what the future will look like for Baby Steps. It has a lot going for it at first glance, with what I consider is the studio’s most approachable entry. Many others have combined the various elements and mechanics to different degrees. Plenty of open-world games now pride themselves on removing markers from maps, encouraging players to live in and interact with the world; physics-based games have been around for even longer in various forms, either ragdolling characters or using it to affect the world around your character. However, something about Baby Steps's combination of these elements and their unique control scheme makes me believe it could be special. The team's approach to just turning players loose in a strange world full of obstacles, challenges, and secrets isn't necessarily new, but the way it combines them feels fresh enough to not only reach their dedicated fan base but also reach a new audience and welcome them to their unique style. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendo-hints-at-enhanced-switch-2-edition-games-for-new-console/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>When Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">finally officially revealed the Switch 2</a> in January, one of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/all-the-things-nintendo-didnt-tell-us-about-the-switch-2/">our major unanswered questions</a> concerned whether games designed for the original Switch would see some form of visual or performance enhancement when running on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">the backward-compatible Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo-watchers are pointing to a fleeting mention of "Switch 2 Edition games" as a major hint that such enhancements are in the works for at least some original Switch games.</p>
<p>The completely new reference to "Switch 2 Edition games" comes from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/">a Nintendo webpage</a> discussing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">yesterday's newly announced Virtual Game Cards</a> digital lending feature. In the fine print at the bottom of that page, Nintendo notes that "Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games <em>and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</em> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system [emphasis added]."</p>
<p>The specific wording differentiating these "Switch 2 Edition" games from "Switch 2 exclusives" suggests a new category of game that is compatible with the original Switch but able to run with enhancements on the Switch 2. But it's currently unclear what Switch games will get "Switch 2 Edition" releases or how much developer work (if any) will be needed to create those new versions.</p>
<h2>We’ve seen this before</h2>
<p>Nintendo is no stranger to the idea of single game releases that work differently across different hardware. Back in the days of the Game Boy Color, developers could create <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/graphics-modes-in-game-boy-black-cartridges-compared.html">special "Dual Mode" cartridges</a> that ran in full color on the newer handheld or in regular grayscale on the original Game Boy. Late-era Game Boy cartridges could also be coded with special enhancements that <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/super-game-boy-enhancement/3015-4804/games/">activated when played on a TV via the Super Game Boy adapter</a>—Taito even memorably used this feature to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=TRALiaCidP4">include a complete SNES edition of <em>Space Invaders</em> on a Game Boy cartridge</a>.</p>

            <p>Krafton has patched out a bug in its early access release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which allowed players to run over children with a car and kill them.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inZOI/comments/1jldd0w/i_dont_think_that_krafton_realizes_that_you_can/">post on the InZoi subreddit</a> titled "I don't think that Krafton realises that you can run over children in inZOI" had started making the rounds. Attached to this post is a clip from the game, showing a player hitting a child with the front of their car.</p>
<p>Once the car has hit the child, this child is then launched ragdolling across the ground in front of them, with the impact ultimately killing them.</p>
<p>While the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-like-inzoi-has-16-different-types-of-deaths-so-watch-out-for-slippery-bathroom-floors">previously confirmed characters in InZoi could die from getting hit by a car</a>, with game director Hyungjun 'Kjun' Kim warning players they "might want to be careful" near the road, it was never said that children would also be subjected to this death.</p>
<p>Krafton has now addressed this bug. In a statement shared with Eurogamer, the Krafton spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of inZOI. We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Our Matt has been playing InZoi, and while he appreciated its "expansive customisation" and "richly detailed worlds", he was a touch disappointed with Krafton's life-sim game.</p>
<p>"The trouble is, it's all so <em>soulless </em>– its flashiness failing to mask a lack of personality. Where The Sims feels tuned for maximum chaos and carnage (sometimes exhaustingly so), InZoi barely mustered a single memorable event in the six hours I played. I milled about its empty streets, trudged around its handful of notable landmarks, sang a song in a park, and unsuccessfully tried to strike up a friendship with strangers before returning home," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-25-years-of-the-sims-could-inzoi-be-about-to-steal-its-crown">Eurogamer's InZoi impressions feature</a>.</p>
<p>"By the time I'd tired of redecorating and had clicked on everything in my apartment at least twice, I was genuinely wondering how I was going to fill the rest of my virtual day as InZoi's clock – glacially slow even on its fastest setting - ticked on by."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Nintendo Direct event to reveal all of the features of the Nintendo Switch 2 takes place on April 2, but that doesn’t mean rumors aren’t going to stop spreading before then. In a new claim by a known leaker, the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a unique feature that connects to the current-gen Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://youtu.be/l2QbjzzdVj8?si=TzuZlQutPSLgmFJk&amp;t=546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2’s mysterious “C” button will have multiple functions. One specific function, however, is that it will let you connect the new system to an original Nintendo Switch. This will reportedly allow players to use the Switch 1 as a controller or screen for Switch 2 games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>“I don’t know if it’s the only function, or it will have more,” eXtas1s said via translation. </p>



<p>He then went on to give an example of how this would work based on what his sources explained to him. Using Mario Kart 9 as an example, the Switch 2 user will be able to hit the “C” button and connect to the Switch 1, letting it then be used as another controller for the game. That would also allow, in this example, for Mario Kart 9 to be played on the Switch 1 screen to avoid split-screen play.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what—or how many—games this feature would work with.</p>



<p>As with all rumors, please take this with a grain of salt unless Insider Gaming can independently verify the information or it is confirmed by Nintendo itself.</p>

			<p>The function of the Nintendo Switch 2 new Joy-Con controller C button has yet to be officially revealed, but there's the chance that we will get to celebrate the unexpected return of the Wii U console when it will, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared today,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s"> eXstas1s</a>, who proved to be an overall reliable insider in the past, revealed that, according to their sources, the C button will be used, among other things, to connect the Nintendo Switch 2 to an original Switch console to use it as a controller or an additional screen, essentially turning the previous generation console into something akin to the Wii U GamePad. As not every Nintendo Switch 2 user may also be the owner of its predecessor, there's no doubt that this connectivity feature will be completely optional, but, on the other hand, it could open up some very interesting possibilities, such as proper emulation of Nintendo DS and 3DS games.</p>
<p><iframe title="BOOM ☄️ XBOX + STEAM : ÚLTIMA Hora 🥵 SWITCH 2 Botón C: ASÍ FUNCIONA 🤔 JUEGOS de PS5 en NINTENDO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l2QbjzzdVj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While eXstas1s has proven to be somewhat reliable in the past, we have to take this Nintendo Switch 2 rumor with a grain of salt until the C button functionality is officially revealed next week. At the same time, a patent that emerged online<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dual-screen-patent/"> earlier this month</a> suggested some sort of dual-screen functionality for the system, so the ability to use the original Switch as a second screen doesn't sound all that improbable.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches later this year worldwide. The console's release date is expected to be revealed next week during a dedicated Nintendo Direct.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Some <em>Helldivers 2</em> players are reporting that they can no longer play the game on their computers equipped with older CPUs. The issue stems from the developer Arrowhead Game Studios’ and publisher Sony’s requirement that users play on systems that support AVX2 (Advanced Vector Extensions), which has been a feature in many CPUs since 2013. However, the requirement was not properly enforced in the software, allowing some players with older hardware to play the game since it was launched for PC last year.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-suddenly-unplayable-for-some-pc-players-on-older-systems"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>, players on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server have voiced their displeasure with suddenly not being able to launch a game they have paid for and have been playing. “600+ hours in a game I love just to be locked out is making me so frustrated to the point I just want to ask for a refund instead of fixing their mistakes,” said a user.</p><p>Server moderator Birby responded to some of those complaining and explained that “the AVX2 check in the script is experimental, and can throw false positives.” The moderator blamed users for not following the stated minimum system requirements. “I don’t like to have to tell people their 13 year old processor is out of date,” said the moderator. “You should never be surprised if your out of spec machine can’t run the game.”</p><p>Still, players with the older CPUs likely have PCs or laptops that aren’t upgradable, so they will need to prepare to spend a lot of money on a totally new system.</p><p>This isn’t Sony’s first unpopular move made on PC <em>Helldivers 2</em> players. Last year the company had forced PSN account requirements for PC users, but then <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">pulled back after all the negative reviews on Steam</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-baby-steps-i-stumbled-through-a-refreshing-kind-of-open-world.1147965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638179/baby-steps-preview-ps5-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Is the rage boiling over?” Bennett Foddy asks me as I fall down a wooden plank for the dozenth time. The creator of <em>QWOP</em> and <em>Getting Over It</em> is known for games that can be both frustrating and meditative, pairing challenging physics with thoughtful design. The latest, <em>Baby Steps</em>, is similar — but a whole lot bigger.</p><p>I had a chance to play a chunk of the early portion of <em>Baby Steps</em> at 2025’s Game Developers Conference earlier this month. The game is developed by a trio made up of Foddy, Maxi Boch, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255975/ape-out-game-pc-nintendo-switch"><em>Ape Out</em></a> creator Gabe Cuzzillo. It starts out pretty silly: you play as a slacker named Nate who is transported to a strange world with little choice but to hike. There are cutscenes where he babbles in confusion at his situation and a handful of characters who aren’t especially helpful. At one point, someone offers Nate a map, and he refuses; there is no gear that aids your adventure in <em>Baby Steps</em>.</p><p>Instead, the game is perhaps the most literal definition of a walking simulator. You move by controlling Nate’s two legs individually to take steps. At first, I couldn’t take more than a few steps before falling flat on my face, which, to be fair, was often hilarious. The physics makes the wipeouts in <em>Baby Steps</em> entertaining to watch. But it was also infuriating. Walking is supposed to be the easy part of a video game; you push the stick forward and go where you want to. But here, even the tiniest obstacle proved troublesome. The first time I saw a small staircase, I wondered how I’d ever make it.</p><p>But slowly, through a lot of trial and error, I fell into a rhythm. It reminded me a bit of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima"><em>Death Stranding</em></a>, where I had to carefully pay attention to my movements if I wanted to get anywhere. For just regular walking up a path, this meant timing my steps just right so that I didn’t stumble. For obstacles like logs or staircases, it meant taking my time and carefully placing my foot where it needed to go. It never got easy, but at least I felt in control of my movements after a while.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> takes place in what seems like a fairly large and open world, the kind of place where you can see something on the horizon and go there. The trick, of course, is being able to actually walk toward it. Early on, I came to a fork in the road: on one side was a gently sloping hill that led further up the mountain; on the other, a wooden plank across a muddy slope that led right back down to the bottom. After some deliberation, I attempted to get across the plank and, two steps later, found myself sliding in the mud.</p><p>The developers tell me that <em>Baby Steps</em> is built on the idea of “self guided play,” meaning there are no artificial obstacles in your way, and you don’t have to worry about things like health or death. It’s just you and the environment. And while it might not seem like it at first, the game isn’t really designed to be punishing. As an example, when I had my big fall down the mountain, it didn’t send me back to the beginning but instead brought me somewhere new that I wouldn’t have seen otherwise. It also taught me an important lesson about taking on challenges I’m ready for.</p><p>I played for less than an hour, but I could already feel myself settling into a contemplative style of exploration I’ve experienced in games like <em>Death Stranding</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a>. There were no quests to complete or to-do lists to check off. Just me, my legs, and a serene mountain full of risks and rewards.</p><p><em>Baby Steps</em> launches later this year on Steam and the PS5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Vampire Survivors fans can soon read an official book that takes a closer look at the lore of the popular bullet-hell's world and the characters who inhabit it. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire</a></strong> will be published by Titan Books on <strong>October 21</strong>, and preorders for the budget-friendly hardcover book are available at Amazon for $30.</p><p>Dozens of new monsters and characters have been added to Vampire Survivors since it left early access in 2022, so this lore guidebook could help you parse the surprisingly deep stories that aren't always easy to absorb due to the (delightful) chaos of the gameplay loop.</p><div title="6530465 - Vampire Survivors The Grimoire" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3308" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6530465 - Vampire Survivors The Grimoire" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire (Hardcover)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1835411932?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$30 | Releases October 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Written by prolific author Paul Davies, this 176-page hardcover book is penned in an in-universe style. Designed to be a guidebook authored by the mysterious Merchant who appears at the start of each level, Vampire Survivors: The Grimoire covers locations and secrets from the award-winning game.</p><p>"Vampire survivors are on a relentless quest," the official plot synopsis reads. "Stumbling through the Mad Forest, climbing the calamitous Gallo Tower, searching the far reaches of the Inlaid Library. The Belpaese family, the Ladonnas, assorted clerics and supernatural folk all join the search. Why is there roast chicken everywhere? How is that dog making flowers bloom? And who – or what – is Poe Ratcho?</p><p>And where are the vampires? That’s where I come in. I am the Merchant, and I can be your guide. If you have gold of course. Always gold. If you seek coffins, I may know where to find them--for a price. Though I cannot guarantee you’ll find the vampires you seek."</p></div>                      </div><p>In case you haven't played it yet, Vampire Survivors is a fun game that feels deceptively simple to play. Unlike other bullet-hell adventures where you have to constantly dodge projectiles, the game flips that script on its head and turns you into a tornado of doom as you gradually increase your power through a 30-minute run. The catch here is that the longer you survive the more progressively difficult a level becomes, and even if you can last for 30 minutes, the Grim Reaper will always be ready to claim your life at the end. The game is very affordable, and if you have a Game Pass account, available to play on PC and Xbox through that subscription service.</p><hr><p>It's going to be a while before this book is available, but in the meantime, you can score a pretty great deal on a bunch of other video game lore and art books.

If players are downed during battle, their teammates can revive them by attacking them. During the network test, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to revive downed players.</p><p>However, players will lose the Runes they've accumulated if they fall in battle, as a result of not being revived in time.

These creatures were summoned 427,533 times.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign will launch on May 30 for PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Netflix Gaming boss Alain Tascan has outlined his vision for the future of gaming at Netflix, and his aim is to help reduce "friction" similar to how the Wii helped opened things up for a wider audience.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/netflix-games-strategy-evokes-the" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business,</a> Tascan said when he worked at EA, one of his ambitions was around "lowering friction and eliminating it." He was a big fan of the Wii because it was a lower-priced console that appealed to a wide audience, and Tascan wants to try to achieve something similar at Netflix.</p><p>Tascan said some of the frictions that exists in gaming today is the need to have enough controllers in a home and having an "expensive" piece of dedicated gaming hardware. Waiting for game downloads is another friction, Tascan said. Netflix Gaming aims to offer solutions in these areas by eliminating the need for dedicated gaming consoles and controllers, in part because Netflix aims to offer games over the cloud. In fact, cloud-streaming games is already available on Netflix.com under the Games tab.</p><p>Tascan hopes Netflix can create more "party games" that can help people have fun quickly--without the need for a console or a special controller.</p><p>"For party games, I believe we can give instant fun, using the phone controller as a very innovative controller," he said. "On every phone you have a gyroscope, you have a microphone, you have a speaker, you have a touchscreen… if you give that to creative people, what do they do? Whether you're alone, or with two people, or 20 people, why not? Can we do something really engaging?"</p><p>Tascan went on to say that what he's excited about at Netflix is helping games reach more people.</p><p>"The same way mobile opened up gaming to go beyond 150--200 million players to now 3.2--3.3 billion players, I believe we can reach to a larger number of players," he said. "Does it really need to be these super complicated RPG-style games? There is a place for them, for sure. But this for me this is what's interesting. Netflix is giving us this opportunity to have access to these people. What do we give them, and in what way, so they can enjoy and engage with [games] over and over?"</p><p>Finally, Tascan addressed a question regarding Netflix's commitment to gaming. After all, the company already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">shuttered its AAA game studio to instead focus on mobile and party games</a>. Google, many will remember, was heavily invested in gaming with its Stadia product, only to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stadia-is-officially-dead/1100-6510708/" data-ref-id="1100-6510708">quickly shutter it. </a></p><p>Tascan said to find success in a market like gaming, "it takes time, stubbornness, and investment to get great results." Not every company is willing to put in the time and effort, but Tascan said Netflix is different.</p><p>"If you look at our two Co-CEOs, Ted [Sarandos] has been in the company 25 years, Greg [Peters] over 15 years. And look at where Netflix was 10 years ago in terms of their core business. They know the path of being stubborn, hard-working, innovating, having a vision and going after it," Tascan said. "The road is not always straight to the top. But I believe them when they told me that gaming was important, because if [Netflix] wants to entertain the world then there’s no-way around it, we need to be in games. When I look at these two leaders in particular, but also the rest of management, I believe in their full commitment."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> publisher Bandai Namco has released some player statistics from the game's network test last month, and it seems players were struggling to finish it.</p>
<p>The online co-op game takes place over three in-game days, defeating bosses each night to progress the next. However, the final boss of the cycle - Nightlord Gladius, Beast of Night - was only defeated 58,615 times.</p>
<p>The publisher hasn't released total player numbers, but looking at the <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-infographic">remaining stats</a> we can get an idea of how popular the test was.</p>

</figure>
<p>For instance, a total of 23,627,489 attacks were used to save downed players. Considering it takes around three hits to revive a player in this way (sometimes more), that's about 7.9m revives.</p>
<p>Further, the mini bosses strewn across the world were defeated from between 99,000 times to 195,000 times, depending on how often they appeared over the day cycle.</p>
<p>Lastly, 37,957,453,867 runes were lost during the test, when not retrieved after death. That's a lot of death - and a lot of heartache.</p>
<p>In all, it seems players were struggling to get to grips with Nightreign. The shift to online co-op and a faster pace may have proven a challenge for players, whether through poor explanation from FromSoftware or just not enough time to master the game during the test.</p>
<p>And that's when players even managed to get on - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-first-network-test-suffers-server-issues-due-to-congestion">first of several tests over that weekend was a disaster</a>, with players completely unable to log into a match. This was resolved for the remainder of the weekend.</p>
<p>Of course, FromSoftware's games are known for being difficult. In particular, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>'s expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> caused much debate with its difficulty level. Just give it time and somebody will be finishing Nightreign with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-boss-beaten-with-an-actual-banana">banana controller</a>.</p>
<p>Personally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">I had a great time playing Nightreign</a> and enjoyed its new style of challenge, as well as working with others - though I had a decent chunk of time with it during the preview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-announced-by-fromsoftware">Elden Ring: Nightreign is set for release on 30th May 2025</a> across PS4, PS5, Xbox consoles, and PC (Steam).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><span>Despite burgeoning budgets and development teams growing to the dozens, if not hundreds, the AA gaming space is something where it’s rare to see a developer thrive. MercurySteam has been crafting up a variety of third-person adventure titles over the years, and we recently went hands-on with their latest adventure, slated to release in just two months. <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blades of Fire</a> is one of those titles that might sound average on paper but certainly holds its own with the right tempering.</span></p>
<p><span>After a brief backstory introducing the world of Blades of Fire, from the world once ruled by mighty giants known as The Forgers to an evil Queen whose magic can turn steel into stone, the lore of iron and blood runs deep through this adventure’s DNA. Players pick up the hammer of Aran de Lira, a commander’s son and subsequent blacksmith whose character designs can only be described as a down-on-his-luck Gabriel Belmont. After a brief introduction, Blades of Fire introduces the plucky sidekick Adso and an abbot whose screen time lasts a mere couple of sentences before his life is cut short, yet serves as the catalyst to send this duo on an adventure to slay the merciless Queen. It’s just enough to set the mood before Aran de Lira and his new travel buddy venture out, accompanied by a travel montage and a brief tutorial on weapon crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Weapon crafting seems to be the main hook to Blades of Fire, setting it apart from other character action titles. By venturing back to The Forge between worlds, players can first pick out a learned recipe and put it together with the various ores and woods that have been wicked up during the journey; naturally, I only had access to the very bottom tier of materials given that I was playing from a fresh save file. Once all the materials are acquired and distributed, a separate mini-game plays out where the player has to hammer out any impurities and even out the thickness of metal to match the shape of the blade.</span></p>
<p><span>There’s a strange system where I had to select a portion of the blade on a sliding scale and then slide the intensity up and down to impact not just that particular section of the blade but also by raising and lowering the surrounding regions. It was not a system that led itself to being too intuitive to crafting a perfectly even blade and I spent too much time just trying to even out the peaks and trying to come as close as I could to the intended shape of the blade. Initially, this doesn’t seem to do much for the blade beyond raising its core stats like damage and durability, but there were other mechanics on offer, such as changing the type and material of the handle or additional flourishes and accessories to the weapon. The Forge itself feels like the main source of progression throughout Aran de Lira’s journey and the ability to customize every minute stat to a particular weapon might end to some interesting builds for crafting.</span></p>
<p><span>Blades of Fire also features an interesting combat system where attacks are done across all four face buttons and determine where Aran’s strikes will land. You don’t often see games that map body parts to a specific button, so it took some time to get used to aiming for an enemy’s left arm versus its right if it happened to be less armored in that location. Aran can wield two separate blades in combat and swap between the two. Each weapon can deal damage between slashing, blunt and piercing attacks, with some offering up multiple damage types. There’s an obvious effectiveness system at play where different body parts on an enemy will glow in colors from red to green that show how effectively a particular weapon or damage type works. </span></p>
<p><span>As much as players might want to forge an unstoppable sword and carry it through the adventure, the weapon's effectiveness coupled with a durability system for every weapon means that routine trips to The Forge will be required. As is typical of most action RPGs these days, combat is driven through a stamina system that dwindles down quickly through dodges and repeated attacks. It does recover on its own, but Aran de Lira can hold down L2 and go into a defensive position and recover at a faster rate.</span></p>

<p><span>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive war hammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies when Blades of Fire launches on May 22nd across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and the Epic Games Store.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed some fun statistics for the recent&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>network test, in which those lucky enough to be invited got a glimpse of what can be expected from the game's final release later this year.</p>

<p>Over <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1905622167158432218" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Bandai Namco shared what it called its "Numbers from the Night", and it turns out that across the network test as a whole, players slaughtered the Gladius, Beast of Night boss 58,615 times. That's a lot of dead Nightlords.</p>

<p>Spectral Hawks, the ghostly birds used to ferry players across&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s map, were summoned 427,533 times across the network test, while 23.6 million recovery attacks were used to help downed players get back on their feet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=7Iz2zJVv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-stats-hawk.jpg?itok=Iruk7NEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hundreds of thousands of these little ghostly birbs were summoned during&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s network test.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s minibosses, players killed almost 200,000 Golden Hippopotamuses (Hippopotami?), almost 165,000 Flame Chariots, and just over 150,000 Fire Monks.</p>

<p>Almost 150,000 Flying Dragons of the Hills were killed, and almost 100,000 Royal Knights met their ends at the hands of enterprising warriors. If you think you're going to struggle in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, let these numbers give you some solace.</p>

<p>On the other hand, almost 38 billion (!) runes were lost by players cumulatively over the course of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>'s network test. I like to imagine that 37 billion of those were just one very, very unlucky player.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's an upcoming action RPG spinoff of FromSoftware and Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and it represents the developer's first major spinoff for one of its properties.</p>




<p><em>Nightreign</em>'s core gameplay loop sees you and two other players (or just you, but not you and one other) descending onto a map in order to loot it, kill its bosses for XP, and grow strong enough to battle the Nightlord at the end of a three-day period.</p>

<p>The game will feature not only enemies from&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, but also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-dark-souls-enemies-confirmed" rel="nofollow">foes featured in FromSoftware's&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>series</a>, including the likes of the first game's Centipede Demon,&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 2</em>'s The Duke's Dear Freja, and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls 3</em>'s The Nameless King.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">on May 30th</a> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

It feels like the first genuinely adult-focused project within the MCU, and its shocking brutality is all the more surprising for being created by Disney. (While <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em> had gore and naughty words, it’s hard to really credit the silly movie with being “adult.”) It’s not just <em>Born Again</em>’s visceral combat and ferocious language but also its thematic concerns as the inexorable pull of violence condemns its leads, all delivered with whip-smart writing and meticulous subtlety. But one thing it <em>isn’t</em> is an allegory for the re-rise of Donald Trump.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(Note on spoilers: I’ve deliberately written this not to spoil any significant story beats in the show, including the widely discussed major events from the first episode, but I obviously have to cover generalities.)</p><p><em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> (<em>DBA</em>) is now six episodes into its run of nine, Disney+ adding two new episodes this week, and while it’s fair to say it’s suffering from that perennial Marvel TV issue of trying to stretch too little story across its run, it’s utterly compelling television.</p><p>As lawyer Matt Murdock aka Daredevil, Charlie Cox has developed his performance from the earlier Netflix seasons to something far subtler, exuding this extraordinarily purposeful quietness, the composure that allows his superheroic fighting abilities  channeled into his speech. Whether convincing a jury in court or calmly establishing authority during a bank robbery, he neither performatively whispers nor shouts, but instead maintains a timbre that’s just quiet enough that people are forced to listen. It’s spellbinding.</p><p>Meanwhile, human chameleon Vincent D’Onofrio returns to the role of Wilson Fisk, aka Kingpin, with a similarly more moderate tone, without losing any of the power or fear that he commands. Fisk, who was seriously injured in sibling MCU TV show <em>Hawkeye</em>, returns to New York to attempt to pivot to politics, at the same time learning that his marriage is in serious trouble, and his control over the city’s crime is in tatters. Everything that stabilizes him, gives him the certainty of power he requires, is threatened, and yet D’Onofrio and the creative team behind the show have the wisdom to underplay this magnificently. We know he’s quiet-quiet-quiet before <em>exploding</em>, that’s his nature, but this time the rumbling feels so much more unnerving, and the contained explosions so much darker.</p><p>One of the core plots of the first season of <em>DBA</em> is Fisk becoming the mayor of New York, and the sometimes comic, sometimes abhorrent conflicts this raises for a man more used to performing his corruption and violence in the open. This known criminal, this man people know was Kingpin, takes a populist position in a politically fraught city to gain political power, but then realizes his victory brings with it a requirement to perform the expected role. And in this, many have reasonably leapt to draw the obvious similarity between this and Donald Trump’s being president. A known criminal who has been openly corrupt for decades gaining political power. It seems clear.</p><p>As a result, multiple reviews and opinion pieces have been written drawing out the common themes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/daredevil-born-again-review-1236309328/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">many praising Disney’s boldness</a></span> in addressing this face on, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fandomwire.com/an-absolute-trump-analogy-daredevil-born-again-isnt-breaking-any-new-ground-with-kingpin-and-the-schtick-is-now-getting-boring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others condemning it for being too easy</a></span>. But, while it absolutely had to be on the minds of the writers and producers, I’m not at all convinced that there was any desire for this text to be a piece of commentary or satire on this matter. It falls down in such a significant way that, if it were intentional commentary, would suggest an ignorance on the part of the creators that isn’t evidenced anywhere else in the show: Fisk isn’t an idiot.</p><figure id="" data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-recommend-id="image://5af5741b15cd278cd60256f98f69c163" data-format="jpg" data-width="1572" data-height="885" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fisk in his suit, sat in a chair, looking quizzically to the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s worth noting immediately that <em>Daredevil: Born Again </em>showrunner Dario Scardapane has already denied the allegory, albeit for the somewhat tenuous reason that the script was already written and the show mostly filmed “long before” 2024. (Those with long memories will remember Trump was president once before.) In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kr85lr7270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a video interview with <em>IGN</em></a></span> (that <em>is</em> packed with spoilers), Scardapane explains that Fisk’s ability to win an election despite his widely known criminal past is largely to do with New York’s turning on superheroes, and Fisk’s figurehead position as a person of power promising to stand against them. If anything, it was his legitimacy as a dangerous man of enormously cunning influence that gave him the edge. And those really aren’t words that sensibly apply to Trump.</p><p>While I am skeptical of Scardapane’s claims that he didn’t consider Trump’s original rise to power <em>at all</em>, instead saying it was simply the continuation of a plot written by others in 2016, I do genuinely believe that he’s smart enough  to know a person as intelligent and conniving as Fisk couldn’t be a meaningful allegory, <em>and</em> smart enough not to say that in an interview.</p><p>But without the words of the author, it’s plain to see. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is a series about two men desperately fighting not to put their masks back on. That’s the core of everything that happens, every strand of plot we see. It is a show about two addicts doing everything they can to overcome their urges, while the world around them is doing everything <em>it</em> can to force them back down. Both are desperately clever men, blessed with everything they need to succeed in their respective fields, and yet beholden to an alter-ego that not only affords them shortcuts to all their goals, but satisfies a dark, awful bloodlust that lies within them.</p><p>Trump is just an idiot. I don’t say that to be “controversial” or because I think I’m making some exciting and provocative claim. It’s just dully and demonstrably true. He’s a stupid man for whom the storms converged, driven by populism on an instinctive, lizard-brained level, able to use his ill-gotten wealth to let him ride a wave of (woefully ironic) anti-authority milieu at the same time as the international Overton window lurched violently to the right.</p><p>Trump is a man who thinks that Ukraine sits on a trove of “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/28/trump-raw-earth-deal-ukraine-zelenskyy/80856299007/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/28/trump-raw-earth-deal-ukraine-zelenskyy/80856299007/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw earth</a></span>,” and believes that human bodies <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/how-trump-could-get-fired&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/05/08/how-trump-could-get-fired" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">begin life with a fixed reserve of energy</a></span>.

The difference is, one is being mendacious and manipulative, while the other just says stuff out loud and then latches on to the comments that get the loudest cheers. Fisk recognizes that following the atrocities that have visited New York since the advent of superheroes, he can exploit the anti-hero rhetoric to his own ends, given his own self-motivated reasons to have those who might stop his crime eliminated. Trump recognizes that his base cheers louder when he says he’s against abortion rather than for it, so switches to that view accordingly. One is directive, one is reactive. One is smart, one is dumb.</p><p>As such, reading <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> as a satirical reaction to Trump’s presidency relies on assuming the creative team behind the show are also stupid, too stupid to notice any of the above. And they’re clearly not! And that’s largely demonstrated in just how little of the program is occupied by exploring the means by which Fisk was able to become mayor. <em>DBA</em> is far more fixated on far more interesting things, most especially how Fisk can suppress his alter-ego in order to achieve his wider aims—something that makes the reveal at the end of episode five so much more interesting than simply, “Oh, what a scamp!” Instead, it demonstrates the externalizing of his basest needs, <em>literally</em> taking prisoner his all-consuming need for harm and vengeance. If a Trump allegory were desired, he’d instead just be using his spare time looking around going “Doy doy” and watching TV.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
