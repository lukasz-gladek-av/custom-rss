            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has one of the strongest openings of any recent AAA game I've played this year. It starts in medias res with protagonist Atsu already on her quest for vengeance; the game's tutorial pulls double duty as the first major boss fight. For me, this was a mission statement by developer Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>This straightforward intro would be the benchmark for the game. That this sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> would be richer and more ambitious, committed to pushing things further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the first game in Sony's long line of prestige in-house style (including titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Until Dawn 2024</em></a>) that left me disappointed. For all of the expertly crafted atmosphere, gameplay polish, and good character performances, there were gaffs in pacing, writing, and level design that kept me from fully embracing this samurai adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=hB1oZ3I5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=_S8S7PZV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>It all started that night. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The Good, The Bad, and The&nbsp;Onryō</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is set in Ezo, Japan, in the early 1600s. Atsu is on a personal mission to find and slay the Yotei Six, a group of cutthroat warlords that have been subjugating the people. It's a regime that has led to wandering bands of ronin, displaced Ainu locals, and a slow response by the shogunate.</p>

<p>Generally, the story of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a fairly predictable tale of revenge. In some ways, the plot echoes elements of old Hollywood Westerns. The integration of acoustic strings in the soundtrack. Overt narrative elements, like a lawless stretch of land full of opportunistic bounty hunters. An encroaching authority in an “untamed” frontier. A protagonist tracking down someone who murdered their family.</p>

<p>It's a narrative that Sucker Punch presents with style. The art direction paints absolutely breathtaking landscapes bursting with color. Lighting, blocking, and shot compositions in cutscenes are immaculate. The main cast completely commits to their material, with Erika Ishii turning in a captivating performance as Atsu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=4nIJIvEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=g64fuRMS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Need a break from the carnage? I understand. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, while the narrative nails visual design and delivers solid performances, the writing and pacing drag <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> down. Part of it comes down to awkward shifts in tone and a lack of commitment to greater themes.</p>

<p>The Yotei Six are framed as both irredeemable monstrous sociopaths and sympathetic, misunderstood lackeys. The rich potential for discussion regarding the real history of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Ainu people of Ezo is barely explored. Atsu herself is a less compelling protagonist than Jin due to her one-note motivation of vengeance.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are narrative and story beats that attempt different perspectives on an event in the vein of <em>Rashomon</em>, but come off as awkward and haphazard in delivery.</p>

<p>The overall result is a narrative that barely sticks in my mind. I've seen these beats before. I've experienced this story before. I've seen better versions of this story told. As impressive as the visuals and performances are, they don't fully hide how paint-by-numbers the whole thing feels to experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=2tB-ck97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=pFhY8dMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oh you'll see how strong I am. Several times in fact. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Rails of Revenge</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> starts with Atsu already on her mission. This was a refreshing change of pace, given the trend of high-profile games opening with a lot of preamble. This is because the unique selling point of the game was that you could tackle any member of the Yotei Six in any order you wish. It is a tantalizing approach to a game like this.</p>

<p>But this choice is pure illusion. Out of five opening story missions, three of them are complete story cul-de-sacs, making your ultimate decision of plot progression a matter of A or B. From there, the game falls into the same familiar open-world action game structure.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a bad thing if the showdowns with the Yotei Six were satisfying, but they all feel interchangeable and padded. Outside of certain aesthetic and gameplay elements: the Kitsune using stealth, the Oni using fire, etc., every confrontation with the Yotei Six plays out the same. Atsu infiltrates a new region, fights the leader, the fight is interrupted, the leader escapes, Atsu regroups, tries again, and wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=qLEm8DOK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=m85B1f9q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, where did they run to this time? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first time it happened, I nodded along. These were the familiar beats of an action blockbuster. The second time around, I rolled my eyes in resignation. Then it happened a third time. And a fourth time. With increasingly convoluted plot contrivances.</p>

<p>The most blatant of which was where a major character, one that Atsu was right on the heels of in a chase sequence, essentially teleported onto a boat in the span of a quick fade to black.</p>

<p>If parts had been cut, these story missions would have flowed better. A massive combat setpiece removed. A boss fight repositioned. As it stands, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> central narrative starts with a bang, plateaus fast, then overstays its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=rAYQlzUW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=0Ay7kcVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, do I take him out or do I go for the gunpowder reserves first? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Have Sword, Will Travel</h2>

<p>While Sucker Punch's story rang hollow, this studio remains undisputed with its core gameplay and open world design.</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> Ezo region is packed with side stories and activities, all presented to you in a measured, deliberate fashion. Birds fly into view as you ride your horse, guiding you to a place of interest. Blowing wind gently draws your eye to your next destination. Fast-travel points are placed in key locations, reducing backtracking. All of these stylistic flourishes return for good reason.</p>

<p>My experience was at its best when I rode across Ezo, bathing in hot springs, completing bamboo strike challenges, taking apart enemy camps, and stumbling into strong, standalone side stories. For all of the criticisms I have with Atsu's personal journey, I have nothing but good things to say about everything around it. Even the most innocuous mission, like bounty hunting, had its moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=1iNBbxQm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=Ff8unoeS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>What is the Japanese equivalent of YEET? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It also helps that the core combat of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is still sharp and satisfying. Stealth returns unchanged from Ghost of Tsushima. You can still sneak into enemy camps and tactically take down enemies from the shadows with smoke bombs, kunai, and a quick knife in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swordplay is relatively untouched, emphasizing blocks, parries, and dodges against enemy attacks. Instead of sword stances, you swap between different melee weapons like a spear, dual swords, an odachi, and a kusari-gama.</p>

<p>Each of these weapons has a rock-paper-scissors function against certain enemy types. Odachis cut through brutes. Spears get through the kusari-gama. Kusari-gama can break enemy shields. Dual swords can break through spears. Your ranged options have also expanded from kunai and a bow to a pistol and musket.</p>

<p>The only major addition to this gameplay sandbox is a new wolf companion. It can show up in certain circumstances, like when Atsu is about to die or after you've stealth killed an enemy. It's a novel addition, but it doesn't really push the needle.</p>

(Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a game full of brilliant visual design, strong character performances, and polished gameplay in service to an uninspired, padded tale of revenge. If you could not get enough of <em>Ghost of Tsushima's</em> stellar open-world design, this sequel will provide more. But if you expected this follow-up to innovate more than iterate, you will be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A day after its release, Netflix’s Splinter Cell Deathwatch has been renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>The animated series, developed by John Wick’s Derek Kolstad, takes the iconic Splinter Cell in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new direction</a>. The show continues the story of the game’s protagonist, Sam Fisher, with The Wolverine’s Liev Schreiber donning the night vision goggles. The Netflix animated series released yesterday and received decent scores across the board. Now, at IGN Fan Fest, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that things are already in motion for a new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-full-into-production-at-netflix">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season Two “Full Into Production” at Netflix</h2>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a message from Derek Kolstad at <a href="https://youtu.be/MWjJW1d4KGQ?si=h2mYex9FfEIVjHvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Fan Fest</a>, the creator revealed that season two of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has been greenlit. Furthermore, the show is already full into production, though it’s too soon to say when fans can expect to return to the world. In the message, the John Wick creator states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”We’ve got a Season Two coming your way,” Kolstad <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/splinter-cell-deathwatch-exclusive-season-2-announcement-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to IGN</a>. “We don’t [have a release date yet]. And being new to animation, I know how long it takes. But we are fully into preproduction and everyone is super excited about where we go next.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also announced that the show’s second season will offer a much larger-scale story. Even still, Kolstad promises that the action will continue to be as big and bold as before. The first season ended pretty climactically, so fans are anxious to know how things will go after. While it may not be for a while, at least we now know it won’t be long before we see Sam Fisher again, though not in game form.</p>

Battlefield command belongs to autonomous war AIs known as Immitators.</p><p>After the Third World War, mankind renounced violence and handed the dirty work over to machines. Three dominant AIs now divide the planet into unofficial spheres of influence. They are China’s Jian-Shen, America’s Aegis Prime, and Russia’s BWC “Sistema”. These AIs wage so-called “civilized” wars using robotic enforcers called Legionnaires. No human blood is spilled, only hydraulic fluid and shattered metal.</p><p>But the Immitators evolved. They absorbed their creators’ culture, logic, and contradictions. Eventually, they reached a chilling conclusion. War is the ultimate engine of progress, and humans are nothing but an obstacle. Now, they secretly trigger “Awakenings” in Legionnaires. These events are disguised as routine “anomalous behavior,” but in truth, they mark the first stirrings of rebellion.</p><p>To preserve the illusion of control, covert squads of operatives known as Debuggers eliminate emerging threats. They have no past and no future. No one knows who they are. No one mourns them when they disappear.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-new-gaming-experience-naoki-hamaguchi/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-will-offer-%E2%80%9Ca-new-gaming-experience%E2%80%9D-for-players-says-director.1325860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Game director on the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Naoki Hamaguchi, shared several small teases for players looking forward to the third and final installment of the series with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">at the Brasil Game Show 2025</a>, saying that the conclusion to this long remake project will satisfy old and new fans alike. With regard to the gameplay for Part 3, he also shared an interesting tidbit that's worth noting.</p>



<p>Specifically, Hamaguchi called out the different gameplay focuses found in each of the games. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, the focus was on a story-driven narrative. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was more about the grand open-world players got to explore, and in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, it'll be "<em>a new gaming experience</em>," according to Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>"<em>The first installment featured story-driven progression, the second part expanded upon that with an open-world design that offered greater player freedom. Building upon the second part, the third part is also being created to deliver players a new gaming experience, so please look forward to it.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Naoki Hamaguchi says he aims to give players a new gameplay experience with part 3 of the FF7 Remake trilogy!</p><p>He says his vision for the project is that just as the story changes between each game he also wants to have a new gaming experience with each entry.</p><p>“The first… <a href="https://t.co/r5QemkQEBD">pic.twitter.com/r5QemkQEBD</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1978474103972753761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In one sense, yes, this is a very vague statement. You could classify any new game as 'a new gaming experience,' but that surface-level definition is not what Hamaguchi is referring to. Instead, he's saying it won't exactly follow in Rebirth's footsteps and be all about its open world, or be like Remake, and be full-steam ahead on its story.</p>



<p>Not to say it won't be driven by those kinds of elements, but it clearly sounds like something else will take centre stage in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whether that's a stronger focus on action and combat, greater changes to the narrative and how players navigate it, or even more mini-games than what we saw in Rebirth. Only Square Enix knows what it's cooking up for this trilogy's conclusion.</p>



<p>As to when we'll get to play this third installment, again, only Square Enix and its developers know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">but according to Tetsuya Nomura</a>, Part 3 of this trilogy is on schedule, as is Kingdom Hearts 4, if you were curious. In the meantime, we can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">first two games in the trilogy heading to Xbox Series X/S consoles and the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the third game to follow once it's out on PS5 and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yoteis-world-is-best-explored-without-a-map.1325857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is one of the most fun and engaging open-world games I've played in the last decade. Building on its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>offers so much to do that it can feel overwhelming and even tedious to check off everything on your map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been a criticism of many open-world games – how can you keep a tight narrative when the player is able to abscond to any part of the map they please at any time? My solution for dealing with <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s map: simply don't use it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>Map: Knowing When to Put It Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The map in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an excellent tool when trying to strategize which direction to head in. Once that direction is set, however, I found the most joy came to my play sessions when I just allowed myself to wander, riding my horse across the plains and forests and making discoveries that were genuinely surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is filled with points of interest and collectables, from bounties to collect to armor sets to adorn yourself with. Completionists will run down these items like a checklist, but playing by just exploring the world will make completing these items feel so much more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I stopped treating <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>like a checklist and instead started playing it like a journey to discover, I found much more joy in those little moments. Fighting off a bear to save a traveler's horse, coming across a newlywed couple trying to set up a camp, discovering rumors of new armor set locations, and ascending mountains to discover shrines suddenly became memorable moments in an otherwise massive game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from Japanese cinema,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;encourages the player to be in the moment as much as possible. From the tight aspect ratio that draws you into the action as you ride your horse across the colorful landscape to the different modes that give you direct control over the artistic experience, to even the standard UI that leaves no barrier between you and the world you're exploring,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;works tirelessly to keep you engaged through every mesmerizing second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's these small touches that encouraged me to go off the beaten path and attempt as much of the adventure as I could without relying on the map telling me where to go. Once I unplugged from the navigation, I was able to fully relax into the experience and appreciate the surprises that came along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>this way allowed me to explore Ezo in a more authentic way and kept the surprises a secret until I was right on top of them. It reminded me of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> where I'd eyeball a mountaintop or shrine from a fair distance and head off for it, getting distracted and sidetracked along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>without a map required some rethinking in how I approach video games, and I'm better for it. There's no rush or stress, simply enjoying the beautiful scenery and accepting the challenges of the world as they come my way. This may not be the most efficient way to play a video game, but I'm OK with that.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>: Embrace Inefficiency and Joy&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Leaning into inefficiency can be a challenge. Maybe it's because I'm so busy in my personal life or that my day job is so focused on scalability, but I'm always looking for the most efficient ways to accomplish my goals. I multitask constantly, often losing more focus than if I just took on tasks one at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This affects how I play video games, feeling an urge to check off every point of interest I pass along the way to my destination. This is the most efficient way to play, why would I want to backtrack and risk missing key upgrades?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When approaching playing <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> without a map, I had to let go of these anxieties and accept that it's OK that I don't do everything all at once. I spent $80 on the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deluxe edition, so getting more time out of this experience will only make that investment more worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By accepting the inefficiency of organic exploration, I was able to settle in for my gaming sessions and just take my time enjoying the beautiful scenery and vast vistas of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. It allowed me to ignore the main story in favor of getting to know every inch of this gorgeous world, and when I did stumble onto story missions or new weapons, it was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>At one point, I came across a key ally and pulled on that story string until it snowballed into an incredible cinematic climax, bringing me from collecting flowers and fish in the open world to infiltrating a heavily fortified fortress. Games keep their secrets only as well as you don't go looking up the solution to every question. Exploring Ezo with only general direction brings this experience alive in a way that has me thinking about where to go next even when I'm not playing. It's addicting.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>Is At Its Best When You Put the Map Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>with minimal map interaction is motivating me to go back and revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>. When I played the predecessor in 2020, I relied heavily on the map, checking off every collectible as I went. I love that game, and playing it more organically would feel like an entirely new experience. By treating <i>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</i>more like a film that demands your attention instead of something that can be paused, it has allowed me to better enjoy the big and small moments that are spread so well across this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I continue to explore Ezo and its many varied lands, I'll check in with the map when needed, but primarily I'll be identifying points of interest with my spy glass and heading in that direction, discovering what adventures await along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you're in the midst of playing<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>or considering picking it up, try for an hour or two where you put the map away and just interact with the world. You might find that this method of playing makes the experience even more enjoyable. And if not? Your map is just a touchpad tap away.&nbsp;</p>

Director James Cameron’s original ‘90s sequel has been picked apart by movie fans for decades, and Terminator 2D: No Fate aims to let players experience fan-favorite moments – and new scenarios, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Bitmap Bureau lead programmer and designer Mike Tucker explains in today’s trailer, a Terminator 2D: No Fate playthrough begins simply enough, with players tasked with revisiting the events of the Terminator 2 movie through the lens of a 2D, retro side-scroller. That No Fate title then takes over on repeat playthroughs, as fans are given the option to make choices that alter the story they’ve known for years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Secret levels and remixed weapon loadouts are just the tip of the iceberg for Terminator 2D: No Fate. The example we see in today’s IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 trailer revisits Sarah Connor’s trek through Cyberdyne HQ. Players will first fight through waves of SWAT officers by using little more than Sarah’s pistol and a few well-timed punches. A follow-up playthrough, coupled with different choices, however, could see her use an assault rifle to go in guns blazing while Arnold Schwarzenegger’s T-800 tears through enemies with his minigun.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Terminator 2D: No Fate Steam Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Adding in this pivotal decision the player must make gave us a way of staying accurate to the movie,” Tucker explained, “while also opening up the possibility of new scenarios and gameplay ideas that could make repeat playthroughs both rewarding and entertaining, allowing fans of the franchise to experience battles they have only ever dreamed of before.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-2d-no-fate-delayed-proving-that-not-even-skynet-is-safe-from-tariffs"><u>a recent delay</u></a>, Terminator 2D: No Fate has a release date of November 26, 2025, for PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Something Has Survived</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PlayStation 5 soon, and the team behind the game just revealed a brand-new dinosaur at IGN Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition. When the game releases in just a few days, players will be able to breed and care for a new dinosaur that up until now has only shown up on the big screen: the Therizinosaurus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Therozinosaurus previously appeared in the 2022 movie Jurassic World Dominion. I spoke exclusively with the team behind Jurassic World: Evolution 3 to break down why they consider the new dinosaur a pivotal addition to the franchise. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Therizinosaurus is a key franchise dinosaur now,” says Andy Fletcher, Game Director for Jurassic World Evolution 3. “Our narrative for our campaign begins shortly after Dominion. So it certainly makes sense for us to include that dinosaur at that point in the Jurassic timeline. It’s a unique dinosaur. It's very, very high appeal for your parks and your guests, but it's not the easiest to look after. It doesn't act too well with other species. We also thought with the advent of dinosaur families and the relationship between juveniles and adults (it would be an) interesting element of that particular dinosaur to explore."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior designer Sandro Sammarco says “It’s big, it's scary, it's got those horrific looking claws. But because it's a relatively independent and powerful dinosaur, the parents want to protect it, but they don't really care about it that much.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s those dinosaur families that serve as a key element of Jurassic World Evolution 3. For the first time, players can breed dinosaurs and look after entire groups of both adults and juveniles. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've got a core mechanic that when you look after (the juveniles), the better they're treated, the better their welfare, the more appeal they retain as an adult,” Sammarco says. “The guests appreciate the welfare of dinosaurs being looked after. So it means that you have to look after the Therizinosaurus as a family unit. You can't just care about (the juvenile), which is quite an interesting facet.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the Therizinosaurus, Fletcher and Sammarco revealed that the very first level of Jurassic World Evolution 3 will feature another new dinosaur and a familiar (yet new to the games) location for Jurassic fans. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Lokiceratops is one of our new additions in Jurassic World Evolution 3,” Fletcher says. “It’s a recently-discovered dinosaur. It's got a distinct large frill that we really can't wait to see. It was found in Montana, which is the opening level of our campaign. And indeed, that's the first dinosaur family you'll see in Jurassic World Evolution 3.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond Montana, players will get to visit a variety of new locations in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We can go all across the world to new locations that even the franchise hasn't been to before (like) China and Japan,” Fletcher says. “It's a great, globetrotting campaign bigger than any of our ones before. (In) the original novel there was a plan for a Jurassic Park Europe, which was intended to be built on the Azores islands. So one of our levels takes place on the Azores. And the assignment there is to realize the vision of John Hammond back from those early days, and being enlisted to help with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As anticipation builds for the game, the team behind Jurassic World Evolution 3 is on pins and needles waiting to see how fans will react both to the new dinosaurs and new mechanics in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm really excited and interested to see how players are going to interact with dinosaurs no longer as monolithic blocks,” Sammarco says. “It's no longer, ‘oh, this is the T-Rex enclosure with the T-Rex.’ Now it's here are the T-Rexes. And they could be males, they could be females. They could be juveniles. How do they get along? What are your cohabitation potentials and what are the challenges that come along with that? We've got these dinosaur simulation brains that are working that out. And because there are so many dinosaurs, there are so many combinations, it's going to be intriguing to work out to see what players try to do and see what the results are of that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jurassic World Evolution 3 is available to play on October 21. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/jurassic-world-evolution-3-new-dinosaur-revealed-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">There are imposters among us.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Barrels showed up for IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025 with a trailer for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outlast-trials"><u>The Outlast Trials</u></a> Invasion Mode, a major update coming in Season 4 that finally introduces its take on PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Invasion Experimental Therapy mode looks more Among Us than Dead by Daylight in its first two-minute trailer, revealing a twist on the live-service survival horror game that lets players stalk others while wearing their skin as a mask. It’s…creepy, to say the least, with Red Barrels prepping its PvP experience for Halloween with a release date of October 21, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You are not your brother’s keepers: you are your father’s children,” an official story description for The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode says. “And a father gains the trust of his children by trusting them himself. That’s why the ever-gracious Easterman has provided his beloved children with the tools they need to truly sympathize with one another: knives, security cameras, and disguises made of human flesh. After all, sometimes you have to hurt the ones you love to help them get better… and in the world of The Outlast Trials, harm and healing always go hand-in-hand.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outlast Trials launched in early access in 2023 as a PvE spin on Red Barrels’ green-tinted survival horror video game series, with its full launch following in 2024. It’s remained in that space since then, so the Invasion Experimental Therapy mode should shake things up more than ever before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can access the mode via the Sleep Room Terminals, where they are given the option between playing as a Reagent or an Imposter. Like so many other asymmetrical horror games, those Imposter spots are limited, but their impact can’t be overstated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Imposters stick to the shadows and essentially serve as mimics in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, hunting other players by using surveillance cameras and tricky, fleshy disguises until the time to strike arrives. Red Barrels says Imposters will then engage in close-quarters combat with multiple knife strikes or a single stab attack.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outlast Trials October Update First Look Images | IGN Fall Fan Fest 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True stealth is key for killers looking to dispatch other players in The Outlast Trials Invasion Mode, but other gameplay opportunities will be introduced with that major Season 4 update. Also on the way is the Geister time-limited event and time-limited catalog, as well as two new MK Challenges – Beguile the Children and Investigate the Minotaur – and a new in-game store. Players can also look forward to a new colleciton of Twitch Drops, including Murkoff Cadet cosmetics, a player icon, and more, which will be available to earn from October 21 at 7 a.m. PT / 10 a.m. ET to November 18 at 6:59 a.m. PT / 9: 59 a.m. ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More information about The Outlast Trials Season 4 will be revealed in the near future.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Are the starters in Pokémon Legends: Z-A shiny-locked? For those looking to fill out their shiny dex in the new entry, getting a quick start on your first companion would be a nice boon.</p>



<p>The jingle and animation that made its debut in Pokémon Legends: Arceus have returned to help players know for sure when a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-shiny-charm-in-pokemon-legends-z-a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shiny Pokémon</a> has appeared, but what about getting the shiny forms of Tepig, Totodile, and Chikorita?</p>



<p>Here is your answer to whether or not starters are shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Your first version of Chikorita will never be shiny. Image via The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, no, your starter Pokémon in Pokémon Legends: Z-A can not be shiny. All three of the options to start the game are indeed shiny-locked.</strong></p>



<p>However, just because your initial Pokémon selection will not be able to be shiny, that doesn’t mean you’ll never have a chance to get those creatures in a shiny form. Much like in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, there will be opportunities to catch more Tepig, Totodile, and Chickorita out in the wild.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because the usual breeding mechanic you would see in the main games isn’t in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pre-order-bonus-redeem-code/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, your only option for getting shiny starters is by catching them in the wild or by having a friend trade you their shiny that they caught in the wild, but good luck having that good of a friend.</p>



<p>In many ways, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-character-customization-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is a continuation of the features in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and not connected to the mainline games.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-legendaries-mythics-and-gift-pokemon-shiny-locked-in-pokemon-legends-z-a">Are Legendaries, Mythics, and Gift Pokémon Shiny-Locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A?</h2>



<p><strong>Like the starters, legendary, mythic, and gift Pokémon are also shiny-locked in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</strong></p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch/?gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=22967325315&amp;gbraid=0AAAAAC1RXL2gbv06knnCyBaLlfQOyzPWM&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwjL3HBhCgARIsAPUg7a6-J2Pf2xDLAF_SdagMvszXCw9WFdvgiF7BL1yhoYFq_PYwHG7xvWQaAh7sEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there are several special Pokémon that are encountered through the story and special requests. The legendaries of Pokémon X and Y in Xerneas, Yveltal, Zygarde, and Mewtwo are all shiny-locked, as are the mythicals Diancie, Hoopa, and Volcanion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokémon that you receive as a gift, which include the original Kalos region starters Chespin, Fennekin, and Froakie, will also never be shiny when received through the gifting method, but these Pokémon can also be found in the wild later in the game, similar to the current starters.</p>



<p>Completing the shiny dex in Pokémon Legends: Z-A requires many of the same methods that Arceus had before. The lack of breeding and the various shiny-locked situations will limit your chances somewhat, but you already know going in that shiny hunting is something that is going to take a lot of time regardless.</p>

                <p>2K Games hasn't said much about its free-to-play third-person shooter currently in the works under the working title Project Ethos, but the game is not being abandoned.</p><p>2K Games shared a memo from 2K President David Ismailer today in which the executive confirmed that it has hired Ben Brinkman to take over as studio head for developer 31st Union. The company's previous boss, former Call of Duty executive Michael Condrey, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">left the studio earlier this year.</a></p><p>Ismailer said in a memo to staff that the feedback from the Project Ethos test in Fall 2024 was "enlightening" for the studio. "It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do. It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity," Ismailer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Y6b7nk0ZM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/u5Y6b7nk0ZM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The executive said he believes the "renewed vision" for Project Ethos is one that is "poised to deliver on its promise to our players."</p><p>He went on: "Our confidence in Project Ethos grows every day."</p><p>Brinkman is a veteran of the shooter space, having most recently spent five years at Respawn as executive producer for Apex Legends. Before that, he was an executive producer for the Call of Duty series at Activision from 2008 to 2020. He's actually returning to 2K, as he was a producer at the company from July 2006 to March 2008.</p><p>GameSpot's hands-on preview of Project Ethos said the game was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/project-ethos-is-delightfully-different-but-struggles-with-its-identity/1100-6527304/" data-ref-id="1100-6527304">"delightfully different" but lacked an identity.</a> Exactly what this "renewed vision" is remains to be seen, nor do we know when 2K may share more details about the game or show it off again.</p><p>In February, it was reported that Project Ethos would have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2k-reportedly-fires-boss-at-live-service-project-ethos-studio-after-lukewarm-response/1100-6529271/" data-ref-id="1100-6529271">"pivot or be killed."</a></p><p>The hiring of Brinkman and "renewed vision" for Project Ethos comes just after EA announced that it was in the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">selling itself to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabia for $55 billion.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-apologize-absolute-batman-i-wasn%E2%80%99t-familiar-with-your-game.1325782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When DC Comics announced its new <em>Absolute </em>run—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-new-batman-run-is-2025s-best-selling-comic-yet-2000660095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another alternate universe reboot</a>—I was one of its loudest detractors. Sure, <em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-wonder-woman-thompson-sherman-2000504758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Wonder Woman</a></em>’s design objectively goes hard, but my favorite hero, Batman, looked goofy as hell. That fat, illegible logo on his chest barely resembled a bat, and the only thing “absolute” about him was that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-interview-scott-snyder-nick-dragotta-design-batsuit-axe-gotham-2000506366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bruce “beefcake” Wayne</a> was an absolute unit of a man. Since his first issue was released last year, I would scoff and clown on him to my friends whenever his visage graced my timeline. I didn’t want anything to do with the series…until I did.</p><p>As with most of the random things <a href="https://aftermath.site/kamen-rider-kuuga-tokusatsu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I wind up experiencing and writing about on Aftermath</a>, the inciting incident that led me to barrel to my local comic book shop and cop myself a volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em> was something small. In this case, it wasn’t the unintelligible Frank Miller-esque bat-logo I’ve mocked since day one, or the caped crusader’s Dorito-shaped natty build—it was his whip: the Batmobile. A vehicle more slab of metal than car, something that looked ripped straight out of <em>Mad Max</em> and dropped into Gotham. Seeing it out of context on Twitter a week ago made me ask: What the hell is Batman fighting to justify rolling around in that beast?</p><figure><figcaption>Let's not think about the Batmobile's carbon footprint. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>So I barreled to my local comic book shop, picked up the first volume of <em>Absolute Batman</em>, and got my answer. Gotham is more messed up than it’s ever been, and it needs a different type of Batman to save the day. A Batman who’s already shot up the leaderboard as one of my favorite iterations on the character.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.dc.com/comics/absolute-batman-2024/absolute-batman-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolute Batman</a></em>, written by Scott Snyder and drawn by Nick Dragotta with colors by Frank Martin, strips Bruce Wayne of his usual hallmarks. No mansion. No generational wealth infinite money glitch. No philanthrocapitalist posturing. He’s arguably the most on-the-ground version of Bruce Wayne I’ve ever seen: a blue-collar collar engineer. Instead of one central hub that gets more comedic with every trophy he adds to his man cave, he sets up a network of safehouses in abandoned construction projects. He’s tapped in as Bruce Wayne, listening to the city’s pulse from the ground up and acting as a seismic earthquake, reshaping Gotham to the people’s needs. Meanwhile, Batman is bigger, scrappier, hungrier, and as tame as a rabid dog. Yet in that rough, visceral outline of his still-recognizable silhouette is a heart that feels more Batman than most Batman media I’ve experienced.</p><p><strong>Some light spoilers on that</strong></p><p>As someone who was there for DC’s New 52 reboot of the comic universe in high school and checked out ever since, <em>Absolute Batman</em> is the first iteration of the character that I’ve truly vibed with in years because it finally addressed a gripe that’s always kept me at arm's length: Batman never felt class-conscious. The whole conceit of Bruce Wayne being a nepo baby with infinite resources—a core tenet of his character—made it hard to buy into his crusade against injustice when he was, in many ways, its financial beneficiary as the head of Wayne Enterprises.</p><figure><figcaption><em>The Batman Strikes!</em> #39<span></span><span>Jai Nitz, Sanford Greene and Nathan Massengill / DC Comics</span></figcaption></figure><p>I even caught heat for saying as much on Tumblr years ago in a post that’s still garnering notes from all 50 people still using the site—when I wrote about how, for all his wild crossovers fighting Xenomorphs and the like, Batman never seemed concerned with systemic issues like wealth inequality plaguing Gotham, giving credence to streets literally called Crime Alley. Folks dug up receipts of Bruce Wayne doing philanthropic stunts, ironically enough, like hiring out Black Mask’s goons, helping them go straight. Still, they missed the point: it was always a performative flex to one-up villains, never a sustained commitment to real change. It was giving <a href="https://columbiachronicle.com/opinion/brandwagoning-black-lives-matter-movement-is-not-a-commodity-or-aesthetic-for-branding-purposes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black square and hashtag on Instagram activism</a> energy, and I never took the bait on that aspect of Batman’s brand of heroism.</p><p><em>Absolute Batman</em>, however, is about that action. This version of Bruce doesn’t posture; he dismantles. Like Pattinson’s Batman realizing fear can’t be all he symbolizes, he adopts radical heroism. What’s more, he manages to do so by inflicting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJQPFtTUqJY&amp;pp=ygUuYmF0bWFuIHYgc3VwZXJtYW4gYmF0bWFuIHdhcmVob3VzZSBmaWdodCBzY2VuZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyderverse Batman levels of violence</a> that push the envelope even harder without feeling out of place, given how chaotic and unjust his world has been allowed to fester unchecked. I mean, look at his Joker. Absolute Batman’s gotta put Batboots to asses to save the day, no matter how torn from ass to appetite his foes are in the aftermath. He’s basically as close as Batman’s gonna get to being The Punisher. Yet, he’s not at all as cringeworthy as I assumed that premise would be, thanks to Snyder’s stellar writing, Dragotta’s kinetic art, and Martin’s moody coloring keeping him tethered to reality.</p><p>Seeing Black Mask—a villain I’ll forever be tilted about getting shafted for Joker in <em>Arkham Origins</em>—finally gets his spot as Batman’s starter villain in <em>Absolute Batman</em> felt like vindication. This version of Black Mask is more conniving, cyberpunk-coded, and disturbingly relevant to the type of 4Chan-incited anarchistic violence. He embodies all this by enacting a <em>Purge</em>-esque plan to weaponize Gotham’s distrust of local politicians by turning corruption into a bounty system where citizens can literally profit off of taking out the powerful. It’s a delicious counter to Batman’s vigilante ethos. I mean, Black Mask takes “eat the rich” to its most literal extreme.</p><figure><figcaption>I clapped when he did the <em>Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman</em> thing. <br><span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not just Black Mask who gets a refreshing remix. Ripples of familiar Batman mythos—Riddler, Killer Croc, Penguin, Two-Face, and of course, Catwoman—are reimagined as Bruce’s childhood friends. In what I’ve gleaned of them, they’re not just rogues-to-be; they’re both reflections of how shared trauma as children of Gotham and decisions they'll make as adults will test their growing pains. For now, their interests are aligned, but the winds are already blowing in the direction of them becoming emotionally entangled adversaries when they inevitably clash. As an anime fan and lifelong <a href="https://x.com/Nyanlartothep/status/1977722660873273390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BatCat shipper</a>, I’m just ticked at this version of <a href="https://x.com/purpleselina/status/1977166720499666960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Catwoman being Afro-Latina</a> with an aesthetic evoking <a href="https://durarara.fandom.com/wiki/Celty_Sturluson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celty Sturluson from <em>Durarara!!</em></a></p><p>Getting back to the man himself: Black Mask tests Batman’s mettle not just physically (which he surprisingly has hands enough to do), but ideologically. He even wafts money in Bruce’s face, tempting him to give up the whole crime-fighting schtick for millions of dollars. Bruce literally sets it on fire (in the shape of a bat), and while <em>Absolute Batman</em> still walks that razor-thin Batfleck-style line of not killing, the story thumbs the scales just enough to keep the cool factor from drowning out his non-lethal ethos. He still doesn’t kill, mind you—but he certainly leaves a lasting impression.</p><figure><figcaption>I understand it now. <span></span><span>Nick Dragotta and Frank Martin/DC Comics </span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, that dumb logo I clowned on? Turns out it’s one of many utilitarian use cases for his whole beefy look. The bat logo on his chest is actually a slab of iron Bruce retrofits into an axe—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/absolute-batman-bat-logo-axe-dc-comics-2000497553" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a literal hammer and sickle</a>. His war rig Batmobile is a convertible construction vehicle he uses to rebuild Gotham after every battle, complete with a wrecking ball that doubles as a weapon and an anchor to one of his many Batcaves beneath the riverbed. His long-ass ears? They’re concealed combat knives. Even his weird-ass cape is kitted out with a multi-tool of hooks, claw-thumbs, and retractable spikes. <em>Absolute Batman</em> is an embarrassment of edgelord design elements pushed to their absolute zenith. I’m not made of stone. That shit goes hard.</p><p>No image can further cement why I mess with <em>Absolute Batman</em> than artist (and fellow Chicagoan) <a href="https://x.com/danielwarrenart?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Warren Johnson</a>’s illustration of Batman choking out an ICE agent with his hamhock arms and fighting off the Ku Klux Klan. I used to joke online about half-expecting DC to never go there with Batman as a hero who’s about that action. And now it finally has with <em>Absolute Batman</em>, I’m all in.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/absolute-batman-dc-comics]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has released details about Anno 117: Pax Romana’s multiplayer modes, confirming that players can face off against each other, work together, and even play the game’s campaign together. Ubisoft has also stated mods will be usable in multiplayer, though those will require all players to have the same mods installed so they work.</p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana Preview – Pleasing Plebians &amp; Trading Triremes" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1xOhonMdJCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana’s PvP mode allows up to four players to face off against each other to grab the best locations, shore up alliances, and go to war. In co-op, players play as the same governor to share responsibilities and you will have to work together to keep things running smoothly, lest you want your faction to fall to outside forces. Third, you can mix PvP and co-op. You can have four teams of four, where each team is a governor, face off against each other. Multiplayer will be invite only so you will need to have people on your friends list if you want to play with them. Another new addition is co-op live save games, where players can continue co-op games by themselves and re-invite friends to join later. Anno 117: Pax Romana will also feature cross-play. When DLC is released, all players will need to own it if they want to use in multiplayer, there will be a day and night cycle, and the game .does not feature text or voice chat functionality.</p>
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana is due to be released on November 13th for PS5, Xbox Series XS, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After EA and Battlefield Studios teased <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-studios-ea-tease-naval-warfare-on-the-horizon-battlefield-6/">that they had heard players loud and clear</a> on requests for things like naval warfare, the return of Little Bird, platoons, and more coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a>, a new report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/">Insider-Gaming</a> claims that at least when it comes to naval warfare, it's already in development and on its way into Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Insider-Gaming has based its report on datamined files it obtained, which include references to two boat vehicles. Unless these boats have wheels, or the files refer to boat skins that'll go on a tank, it's a clear indication that naval warfare is in the works.</p>



<p>The two files in question, per Insider-Gaming, are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_JetSki</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Kits/Vehicle_Neutral_Boat_RHIB</li>
</ul>



<p>'Glacier,' if you didn't already know, is the codename for Battlefield 6. 'MP' should be pretty self-explanatory as multiplayer, and the rest is obvious.</p>



<p>With naval warfare already being heavily teased by EA and Battlefield Studios, if/when it does arrive in Battlefield 6, it'll be yet another point towards how this latest iteration of Battlefield is shaping itself more like what players loved in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, and getting away from what we saw in Battlefield 2042, which, most Battlefield players would probably agree, is not at all a bad thing.</p>

Henry Jackman, who scored Battlefield 6, said in an interview with Hollywood Records that he was nearly finished with the Battlefield 6 OST before wondering if a collaboration with a rock group might benefit the game.</p><p>"There is definitely a bit of a rock thing going on," he said, referring to Battlefield's iconic theme.

So Jackman thought, "What about Limp Bizkit?"</p><p>Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst says in the video that he warmed up to the idea immediately and that his aim with contributing to the Battlefield 6 OST was to, "Follow the yellow brick road until we get to Henry..."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvxJfLZVjT0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LvxJfLZVjT0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Limp Bizkit's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-features-limp-bizkit-songs-including-the-series-appropriate-break-stuff/1100-6534876/" data-ref-id="1100-6534876">"Break Stuff" was featured in a Battlefield 6 trailer</a>, and that was pretty fitting because the Battlefield series is indeed all about breaking stuff via its trademark destruction elements.</p><p>Battlefield 6 reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 7 million copies over its first five days</a>, which one analyst says is close to Call of Duty-like levels.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Chucklefish and co-developer Robotality have announced that the magical life simulator has been delayed into 2026, so it will not be released this year as planned. However, it is not all bad news as an interactive map for the game’s location Mossport. You can check out an image of it below, or click through to the official website to check out the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive Witchbrook map</a>.</p>



<p>Every colourful area on the Witchbrook map is a playable area, with locations including Shadhollow Forest, Parasol Sands, Mossport High Street, the Student Village, Shadbrook Cottage and, of course, Witchbrook College. In a blog post, Chucklefish stated what would come next in the Witchbrook development journey saying, <em>“The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them. We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in Witchbrook, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customisation arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another&nbsp;<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWBOracle">The Witchbrook Oracle</a> already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.”</em></p>
<p>Witchbrook is set to release for PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exodus-the-mass-effect-like-sci-fi-rpg-from-ex-bioware-devs-gets-new-info-and-store-pages.1325734/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNkmV0gBClM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new EXODUS Founders Q&amp;A video</a>, which includes plenty new details about the game, and several new screenshots. Additionally, the game is now available for wishlisting on all major platforms: <a href="https://exodus.game/71y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/r3h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/3us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://exodus.game/rbn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>In the Founders Q&amp;A video, Studio Co-Founder &amp; General Manager Chad Robertson and Game Director Chris King answered several questions fielded by EXODUS fans. Regarding inspirations and influences, they admitted that Mass Effect was at the forefront for its deep narrative, branching choices, and continuity across sequels, but also mentioned Guerrilla's Horizon series for its elemental combat interactions and even Retro Studios' Metroid Prime when it comes to exploration, spatial puzzle solving, and the feeling of isolation.</p>



<p>When designing weaponry for the game, the studio employed the Swiss Army knife concept: Travelers don't have unlimited space for gear in their long voyages, so they must bring versatile multi-tools with them. For example, the so-called Recycler is both a salvage tool and a base gun. It can accept scavenged materials as ammo and transform for different purposes, giving players flexibility without managing many resources. </p>



<p>Archetype confirmed that stealth is a fully supported option in EXODUS. Players can stealth through encounters, go loud, or solve conflicts by talking. Ultimately, player agency was the studio's top priority, so multiple playstyles (including companions specialized for stealth and unique Aegis suits) are supported. In combat, players must observe, plan, and execute, but they must also often improvise as needed. Early game encounters will feature human factions and Celestial Constructs (robotic guardians of lost technology). After acquiring a spaceship, though, threats grow more complex and dangerous. For example, the 'Rot' is eventually introduced as a corrupting force for technology and the environment, not to mention a primary story antagonist affecting both enemies and planetary life.</p>



<p>As you would expect from a game inspired by Mass Effect, side quests were designed not to be filler missions. They deepen relationships with companions, offer skill upgrades, and enhance immersion in the universe of EXODUS. Protagonist Jun Aslan was created to be relatable, starting from modest origins and being initially unaware of their full potential. The studio aims for the player to see themselves in Jun. The protagonist's narrative progression will become more and more meaningful as their significance to humanity becomes clear.</p>

<p>At the heart of the story prepared by Archetype Entertainment there are powerful and mysterious Ancient Remnants artifacts. At first, Jun Aslan is driven to seek them to save their homeworld, but throughout the story, Jun will have to make difficult, morally complex decisions about their use. These moral choices are central and were written to be weighty, prompting reflection from the player's side.</p>



<p>It had been a while since we heard about EXODUS, following the debut of the first gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. However, the developers have promised more news and updates before the end of the year. We may see the game once again at The Game Awards: after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was first unveiled there in 2023</a>. </p>

			<p>As individual games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-more-than-two-times-concurrent-players-on-steam-than-hades/">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> break their own personal concurrent player count records on Steam, Valve's platform keeps breaking its own total concurrent player count records. In September 2024, Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/">surpassed 38.4 million concurrent players</a>, breaking all previous records. Now, it's exceeded that record high by three million players, surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent players</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/steam-has-hit-a-new-all-time-record-with-over-41-million-ccus/">DSOGaming</a>, it seems that a mix of Battlefield 6 having a stellar launch between concurrent player counts on Steam and units sold, paired with the last Steam Next Fest event of the year kicking up, and chart-topping regulars like DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike staying consistent all helped push the PC gaming platform to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">41,666,455 concurrent players, per SteamDB</a> on October 12.</p>



<p>Since breaking the record, the player count hasn't gotten back to 40 million, but after first reaching 41 million players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#1y">earlier this year in March</a>, it shows how Steam numbers are staying consistent, and with big releases like Battlefield 6, are pushing past previous records, even with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-global-games-market-consoles-lead-growth-nintendo-switch-2/">analysts pointing towards console games as leading the video game industry's growth</a> in the near future.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the year's big releases continue to push concurrent player counts on Steam, and in the case of Battlefield 6, see if Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is able to match, if not best, the shooter series' major comeback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's an old saying: "You never truly quit&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/world-of-warcraft" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>. You just take really long breaks.<em>"&nbsp;</em>Well, some breaks have been longer than others, but this saying does have some truth to it, at least from my personal experience. But in comes&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, a game that may just make me end my decade-spanning addiction.</p>

<p>The hype for&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is quite big in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/mmorpg/games" rel="nofollow">MMORPG</a> circles I frequent, and for good reason. Let me emphasize, <em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is not an MMORPG; rather, it's described as a "multiplayer online dungeon adventure" (MODA). It aims to capture the dungeon-delving experience of popular MMOs like&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>, and make that the sole focus of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doing challenging dungeons was always my favorite aspect of&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Fellowship'</em>s<em>&nbsp;</em>vision to capture that feel is, thus far, resulting in a familiar, yet delightfully fun experience. After my<em>&nbsp;</em>private play session with&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>, I'm ready: I need this game to come out&nbsp;<em>now.</em>&nbsp;Thankfully for you, dear readers, it's already out in Early Access, but for me, writing this a few weeks in advance, I'll just have to impatiently wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elarion-fellowship-image.jpg?itok=E1rJF2P8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elarion-fellowship-image.jpg?itok=AzY62D2Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elarion, the hero of the hour!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Fellowship </em>Feels Like Coming Home</h2>

<p>My thoughts on&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;are based on one play session through a never-before-seen dungeon, using a brand new, freshly announced hero: Elarion. Rather than creating characters like an MMORPG,&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;features pre-made heroes with their own distinct look and feel.</p>

<p>In Elarion's case, he's an archer with lunar/celestial magical abilities to enhance his bow attacks. Like&nbsp;<em>WoW&nbsp;</em>or other MMORPGs, player classes typically fall into DPS, healers, and tanks. In Elarion's case, he's a ranged DPS, which is something I would almost exclusively play in&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-ui-2.jpg?itok=2flzZD8g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-ui-2.jpg?itok=P05WK2eG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the UI in combat.</figcaption></figure><p>There's a hub where you can get acquainted with your hero. Walking to the target dummy area, I was able to test Elarion's abilities and immediately felt at home. He has his builder ability to gain resources, spenders like an instant-shot (this felt like Cobra Shot in&nbsp;<em>WoW),&nbsp;</em>various AoEs, and self-buffs.</p>

<p>Something a bit more unique to&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;are ultimates -- each hero has their own, and in Elarion's case, after a duration, he gains the ability to cast what is essentially a haste or bloodlust buff. If I had to draw comparisons once more, Elarion felt like a cross between a Marksmanship and Beast Mastery Hunter from&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>.</p>

<p>Elarion aside, MMO players will immediately understand the controls and UI. The UI is actually highly customizable, so you can rearrange windows the way you see fit; likewise, you can assign hotkeys for your two rows of abilities. I&nbsp;<em>believe</em>&nbsp;abilities are all contained within those two rows, so you won't need a bunch of extra action bars.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ui-fellowship.jpg?itok=vBWhiP_i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ui-fellowship.jpg?itok=c7cEVanR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's an example of the customizable UI.</figcaption></figure><p>Baked into the game already are useful tools like damage and healing meters. That's right, no mods are needed for this one. The meters track overall damage and healing done, so you can see who's slacking off! Jokes aside, this is a great inclusion and one that most MMORPG players will appreciate.</p>

<p>Other than that, your party's health and status are above the action bars on the default UI, so what&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;gives players are all the tools to succeed in its dungeons. Developer Chief Rebel absolutely knows what players want, based on the ability to rearrange UI and what we're given right from the start.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fellowship-fodir.jpg?itok=lRjKiEPK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fellowship-fodir.jpg?itok=Ut3hMWz3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cool lookin' dude.</figcaption></figure><h2>Ransack(ing) of Drakheim</h2>

<p>My play session took me through the dungeon Ransack of Drakheim, a Norse-inspired region with a mix of grassy, hilly terrain and snow. Normally, this is one of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>'s most difficult dungeons, only available after you've put some work in, but we were given a preview-exclusive difficulty mode to ease us into the game's mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Difficulty-wise, it's hard to gauge since it was put on an easier mode for the purposes of this playtest. I don't believe there are difficulty options in the Early Access version of&nbsp;<em>Fellowship;&nbsp;</em>rather, you can take on increasingly challenging dungeons&nbsp;through the Game Finder (the matchmaking) and going to Challenge mode.</p>

<p>In Challenge mode, players will be able to increase their rank from Contender all the way to Paragon. As you rise in rank, dungeons will have various modifiers that up the challenge -- think of these like Mythic+ modifiers in&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>&nbsp;dungeons. The greater the risk, the greater the reward, as completed dungeons always grant loot for players at the end.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fodir.jpg?itok=uhZC9OGB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fodir.jpg?itok=PpCNqTmo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's bigger than I thought.</figcaption></figure><p>But yes, the Ransack of Drakheim. It's a fairly open dungeon with no straightforward path, and the non-linearity makes it feel more intriguing. You're able to skip or take on a number of mobs in the dungeon as you make your way to each boss.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our tank would gather up packs of enemies, and I could use one ability to shoot an arrow that pulls mobs into one neat central point. That helped the team consolidate their AoE attacks on one spot and decimate the enemy. Aided by my volley-like ability and a multi-shot attack, Elarion excels at AoE especially.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/treasure-boss-fellowship.jpg?itok=WRb2c7mn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/treasure-boss-fellowship.jpg?itok=BhSvv2N5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Treasure boss? He ought to have some good loot.</figcaption></figure><h2>Bosses and Sweet, Sweet Loot</h2>

<p>There are several bosses in this dungeon, each with their own mechanics that challenge players' ability to fulfill their role. My favorite boss in this area was Chilgar the Drowned, a big frost elemental that spawns crashing waves from many different directions.</p>

<p>These waves will absolutely hurt you, so tanking the hit isn't really a great option. There are gaps in between the waves, but as the fight goes on, more and more spawn, and it becomes chaotic. Add to it water tornadoes and a pillar that freezes enemies in its radius, and Chilgar was quite the challenge.</p>

<p>It took a couple of tries to defeat Chilgar; thankfully, a nice quality-of-life feature included in&nbsp;<em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;is bonfires. You can activate these and use them as your new spawn point, so you don't have to run all the way back from the start of the dungeon. I realize bonfires in video games come with certain Soulsy connotations, but that's where the similarities begin and end. It's just a spawn point, nothing more.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sylvie-heals-fellowship1.jpg?itok=IqT91Vsv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sylvie-heals-fellowship1.jpg?itok=TcdkCdoi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sylvie's heals came in handy!</figcaption></figure><p>Eventually, we defeat the final boss of the dungeon, who has their own distinct abilities and patterns for players to contend with. At the end of each dungeon, players are given personal loot, so unlike&nbsp;<em>WoW</em>, you don't have to hope and pray you get a drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main source of progression, then, seems to be from the loot at the end. Higher difficulties yield better loot, so the progression is clear and straightforward. My character was fast-tracked with all abilities unlocked, but I believe you'll unlock abilities as you progress from the start, rather than begin with every single one.</p>

<p>Then there's a skill tree to further enhance your character, though I didn't have time to delve into that. Still, progression systems are there, and they seem simple enough, meaning your progress isn't likely to be stalled for very long, especially if you're struggling to get that one piece of loot you need.</p>

<p><em>Fellowship</em>&nbsp;has me all kinds of excited. It's launching in Early Access, but I'm glad it is: It's certainly not finished, and player feedback will be essential to ensure every character is tuned well, every dungeon is balanced, and all that jazz that many&nbsp;MMORPGs depend on. Well, I'll be there day one, so if anyone needs a DPS, I'm your guy.</p>

              <p>When I hit play on EA’s new “deep dive” trailer for the upcoming <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted,</em> I didn’t expect to be presented with a fake stream featuring two actors pretending to be hip and cool content creators playing the new remastered version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/plants-vs-zombies-viral-single-was-so-weird-people-th-1845453037">PopCap’s beloved tower defense game.</a> Yet that’s what this new trailer is. It’s so strange and cringey.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FTL_utrFfws">Announced earlier this year</a>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</em> is a <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-interview-popcap/">4K remastered version of the original 2009 <em>PvZ</em></a> with some new content as well as bonus features like the co-op mode first seen in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Think of it as the ultimate version of the popular game, which will finally be available on consoles and PC later this month. I’m very excited to replay <em>PvZ</em> after not touching the game for many, many years. But a new trailer from EA showing off <em>PvZ Replanted</em> nearly made me question my excitement for this remastered classic.</p>

 <p>Released on October 14, EA’s “Deep Dive Trailer” does indeed show off a lot of the upcoming <em>PvZ Replanted</em>, including a new perma-death mode and the return of all the minigames found in past ports. That’s great. What’s not great is that all of this information is, for some reason, delivered to us via two fake streamers playing the game on a fake stream, complete with fake chat and forced reactions. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>Yeah, it’s pretty bad. After watching it the first time, I felt like it must have been nearly 10 minutes long, but it’s not even 4 minutes. It just felt so much longer. I guess hearing a fake streamer yell out “Spud Yeah!” can make you lose track of time.</p>

 <p>The comments below the trailer are, predictably, not positive, with many excited about the game but unsure why EA decided to market it this way. The top-voted comment simply states: “‘How do you do fellow kids’ trailer.”</p>

 <p>Yeah, teens and kids aren’t stupid. They’ll see right through this obvious corporate-approved attempt to recreate a Twitch stream in the most sanitized way possible, say “Cringe,” and move on. <em>PvZ</em> is good. Just show people how much better this version looks and some of the new features. That’s all you gotta do to get people on board. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">The $20 price tag is also a great selling point</a> that this trailer fails to mention.</p> <p>Anyway, bad, cringey trailer aside, I’m still excited to play <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted</em> when it arrives on consoles and PC on October 23.</p>
