            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-league-of-legends-seasons-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has revealed a major change to the way&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>seasons will work in the new year, with each season now revolving around a "unique theme" that will dictate its narrative, champion focus, and gameplay updates.</p>

<p>As revealed on Riot's <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/dev-2025-season-one-gameplay-preview/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>, the studio is calling the next season in January "Season One", indicating a pretty major reboot for the long-running MOBA.</p>

<p>This first season will revolve around a Noxian invasion, which feels pretty appropriate given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-ambessa-revealed" rel="nofollow">arrival of Noxian general Ambessa</a> in&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>. It'll result in some pretty important gameplay changes, including a visual change for Summoner's Rift, new item upgrades, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/league-of-legends-season-one-january-noxus-map.jpg?itok=vhruUGtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/league-of-legends-season-one-january-noxus-map.jpg?itok=O5AzVJr3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>Season One will bring map changes, new gameplay elements, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>A brand new Epic Monster along the lines of Baron Nashor or the Rift Herald will also be introduced as part of this Season. Atakhan spawns at 20 minutes into the game, and he can either appear at the top or bottom of the map depending on who's got more damage and kills at 14 minutes.</p>

<p>If the kill count is high, Atakhan will become Ruinous Atakhan, and taking him down will grant extra buffs from other slain Epic Monsters. He'll also leave a field of the new Blood Rose plants around him, which grant extra XP and an Adaptive Force buff to your whole team.</p>

<p>The gold rewards from First Blood and First Turret will also be replaced by a new Feats of Strength system, which sees your team granted a tier 2 boot buff if you score First Blood, First Tower, or First Three Epic Jungle Monsters bonuses.</p>

<p>Other big changes in this Season will include new runes, a new Teleport mechanic that sees players physically rocketing across the map instead of simply blinking in and out of existence, and respawning Nexus Turrets to help you recover a game that's going south.</p>




<p>A new game mode, <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/dev-introducing-swiftplay/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Swiftplay</a>, is also being introduced. It's designed to replace Quickplay in certain regions, and it's effectively a combination of classic quickplay and ARAM; it's designed to be a faster-paced experience that doesn't lose any of&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' traditional strategic appeal.</p>

<p>Not only that, but to celebrate the second season of&nbsp;<em>Arcane&nbsp;</em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the final show</a> based on&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>), the Machine Herald Viktor is <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/dev/tldw-season-1-reveal-gameplay-preview-more/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">getting a visual and gameplay update</a>.</p>

<p>His update is intended to retain the gameplay Viktor mains know and love, but with a new eldritch, ethereal visual style, as well as an updated ultimate that gets larger with each kill.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes heading to&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>as part of Season One. You can check them all out over on Riot's <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-gb/news/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news portal</a>, which has plenty of information regarding each change that's being implemented.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access.1044756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-classes-are-available-in-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While the full release of Path of Exile 2 will feature a total of 12 playable classes with 36 Ascendancies to choose from, the Early Access launch on December 6 will not. It will include access to six playable classes—a mere handful of the potential. By the time we’re done with EA, we’ll all have mastered these six classes. Here’s what you can play as!</p>



<h2 id="h-six-path-of-exile-2-early-access-classes">Six Path of Exile 2 Early Access Classes</h2>



<p>On Early Access launch, we’ll receive a nice variety of classes, from your Strength-based Warrior to the Intelligence-favoring Witch, along with the Monk and Mercenary, which should offer unique playstyles. But most players will likely opt for Ranger or Witch on their first playthrough. Both classes are staples of the franchise.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong>
<ul>
<li>Titan</li>



<li>Warbringer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Sorceress</strong>
<ul>
<li>Stormweaver</li>



<li>Chronomancer</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Ranger</strong>
<ul>
<li>Deadeye</li>



<li>Pathfinder</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Monk</strong>
<ul>
<li>Invoker</li>



<li>Acolute of Chayula</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Mercenary</strong>
<ul>
<li>Witchhunter</li>



<li>Gemling Legionnaire</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Witch</strong>
<ul>
<li>Blood Mage</li>



<li>Infernalist</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>So, six classes, each with two Ascendancies to test out. You can easily spend a few hundred hours playing through the most basic class builds across each playable class. Then, you can turn around and mess about with your very own build, mixing and matching skills and passives to create a workable prototype before full release!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-class-to-play-first-in-path-of-exile-2">What Class to Play First in Path of Exile 2?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, let’s get this out of the way. Path of Exile 2 is a massive ARPG offering countless viable build and playstyle paths, with every class in the game capable of pushing end-game content. As such, you should choose to play whichever class speaks to you, whether you want a high-damage glass cannon or a tank worthy of defeating any of the optional bosses in the game.</p>



<p>But if you’d like a recommendation, then we suggest you play as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Witch</li>



<li>Mercenary</li>



<li>Ranger</li>
</ul>



<p>Witch is always a fan-favorite, Mercenary is new to the sequel and shows a lot of promise, and Ranger, while initially weak, winds up as a powerful and hard-hitting solo class that’s easy to manage from the jump.</p>



<p>Hop into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to tell us which class you intend to play! Maybe—just maybe—you’ll find someone to party up with for the game’s six-player co-op!</p>

                <p>The modding community for Baldur's Gate 3 is a massive one, and<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-have-collectively-downloaded-over-50-million-mods/1100-6527513/"> with Larian officially embracing mods</a>, the game has<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mods-help-player-numbers-grow-and-someone-in-the-vatican-just-bought-a-copy/1100-6527834/"> more players than ever</a>. However, how many mods for a single game is too many? Larian was looking through stats, and apparently, players with 100+ mods aren't that uncommon, but this poses a bit of a problem for gameplay, so the studio is putting its foot down for console players.</p><p>Larian announced that it is issuing a 100-mod limit to console players for the sake of gameplay to avoid any other possible disasters. In the statement, the studio broke down why it imposed the limit and what to do if you already have exceeded the limit.</p><p>"Unlike PC, consoles can only juggle so many files at once. The more mods you have installed, the quicker this file limit is reached. Now that some of you have been trying to play with more than 100 mods, you've been letting us know that you're experiencing slow loading times or even game crashes," the <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/hotfix-29-now-live-console-only_127" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement read</a>. "While we recommend only installing the mods you know you'll definitely continue playing with, to [maximize] stability, we’re introducing a 100-mod limit for console platforms. This change comes in today's console-only hotfix that introduces the limit, and depending on how many mods you already have installed, you may see different messaging when you next load your game."</p><p>The statement continued explaining if you have more than 100 mods, you won't be able to play on a console for the time being, but cross-saves on PC and console should be fine. The statement warns players may have to disable a number of mods from their PC so they can access the cross-save. However, another update is coming to give players access to those saves.</p><p>"We'll be shipping another fix soon that will aim to give you the means to access console saves that are disabled after today's update," Larian continued. "However, it is important to note that mods can cause general instability, particularly on console, and depending on the mods you've had enabled on a save, you may run into issues when certain mods are disabled."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-you-can-t-objectively-design-the-perfect-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I&nbsp;was reading a game design piece that gave me pause for a second about whether this is what game design at the AAA level is about now — focusing on analytics and trying to “math” the perfect game.&nbsp;A monumental shift that more people haven’t talked about occurred in the 2010’s with the rise of the indie industry and how it put to rest a lot of the assumptions about AAA development. For today, I want to talk about why you can’t just use numbers to create a great and memorable game, and when the best games have a little “grit” to them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Objectively average"><span>Objectively average</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Design at its core is not something you can really teach or easily put into words. You can explain to someone what good coding is or different art styles, however, it’s a lot harder to explain the differences in feel between&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crash Bandicoot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or how&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom 2016</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom Eternal</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;are completely different experiences despite continuing a franchise and both being FPS.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In my opinion, feel is the X factor that separates bad games from good games, and good games from award winners. It’s the distinction between titles that people remember for years to come and those that completely disappear within two weeks of launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you don’t understand mechanics and game design, then you end up with a bad game that no one wants to play. However, if you only look at a game from a numerical standpoint and not how it feels to play, you can end up with something surprisingly worse — a game that is remarkably average that no one will remember it or your studio after playing it. For a studio, you’re not going to be growing with new and exciting ideas or having a fan base that comes along for that ride.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5FtY_FbGgI" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of sustainable game dev is being able to create games that keep people excited about what’s coming next from your studio. You want them to be interested in your games sight unseen — just the fact that you are working on something or publishing it gets them excited. Studios like Strange Scaffold or New Blood Interactive are examples of this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And to be able to understand feel at this level means going beyond just playing what everyone loves.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding the rough edges"><span>Finding the rough edges</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Part of good game design and good game criticism is being able to look at games beyond just what everyone else is playing. You can’t study game design solely by playing the best games each year. The reason is that you are playing a heavily curated and refined experience with all of its edges sanded down. You’re not going to see the pitfalls of a genre or the pain points, or even know what they are. And sometimes, that off-kilter 6 out of 10 game may have something completely original and amazing in it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my absolute favorite games of recent memory is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astlibra: Revision</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a game that is a hodge podge of assets and free music that is as far away from polished or a AAA experience as a game could be. And yet, it all comes together for an amazing time that still feels cohesive. Something like this could have never been conceived by a major studio or someone who only plays AAA games. The same could be said of hits like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatro, Vampire Survivors, Lethal Company</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and many more. These are games that are not the best looking, graphics card shattering, games that required millions to develop.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What these games all share is exploring a very unique and specific aspect of game design and gameplay. Are they all perfectly designed titles that hit their market segments? No. Some of the most memorable games released in the past 14 years all have some element of “chaff” to them — they were not designed by a marketing committee. But what they do have is something that resonates with people, very much in the same way that games like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Factorio</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;did.</span></p><p>Imagine telling someone 10 years ago that this would be a scene from one of the most successful games ever made</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designers and publishers continue to chase game success stories thinking that there is some kind of mythical blueprint that if you follow to the letter,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>your</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">game will be the next million copy seller that will win GOTY from every outlet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What we find instead, is that those games that try to copy another one end up doing far less than that game. People don’t want to play a game they’ve already played — they need something new and exciting. With Bullet Heaven games, I’ve lost count of the number of them I’ve played that are either “worse&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">” or “ Exactly&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vampire Survivors</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;but with X theme.” Whereas my favorite examples have all gone in a different direction, such as&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brotato, Picayune Dreams,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Must Die</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Feeling it out"><span>Feeling it out</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding the differences in game feel between bad, good, and masterclass examples of design is something that you can’t quite put into words. You can explain to someone how to code jumping physics in your game; you can’t spell out the exact numbers needed to make jumping feel good. Here’s a bit of an exercise: can you make a platformer with a similar feel to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or a shooter like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but you can only watch footage of these games; you are not allowed to play them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many designers I’ve seen who try to make games inspired by these classics often do it in the most cookie-cutter way — but there is a monumental difference between how&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mario</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Doom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;plays vs. the myriad of games “inspired” by them. I’ve said this point before and it needs to be understood by everyone:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Classic games are not the goal of your game’s design, they are the benchmarks that you need to clear if you expect someone to even think about playing them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If anyone tells you the perfect way to build a platformer, strategy, FPS, or any game, they are lying. There are always foundational aspects of game mechanics and genres that need to be understood, but these are the “boxes” you need to understand before you can start thinking outside of them. If you think that a consumer will be interested in any game made like it was back in 1989, even the best of that year, you are sorely mistaken. This is also why it’s difficult to explain to someone “this game is great” or “this game is bad” without playing a spectrum of games. Just because you have “jump” or “shoot” as verbs in your game doesn’t mean they are helping sell your game to the consumer.</span></p><p>the best games I’ve played all are about finding that “feel” that works for them, and running with it.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When a game does do something above and beyond with its mechanics, I want to tell everyone about it so that they can then be inspired by it and do something different.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Anyone who understands coding and basic design can make any genre they set their minds to — but making something that will excite people is another matter. You never know when building your game what will resonate with someone. Making a perfectly optimized platformer is one thing, but what about a game about climbing a mountain using a hammer and having to “get over it?” And it’s that ability to create something that resonates that is open to everyone — how so many indie games are able to punch way above their weight and deliver experiences that not even the largest teams with the biggest budgets can achieve.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

<p>It has been reported that Troy Baker, one of the industry’s most sought-after talents, will return to work under Neil Druckmann on whatever comes next at Naughty Dog. Baker has been in bed with ND since 2013’s The Last of Us, and the developer is unwilling to part ways with the superstar VA just yet.</p>



<p>In an interview with GQ, Troy Baker discussed his recent ventures. In one segment, he promised to return to work with Naughty Dog on Druckmann’s new project, whatever that may be.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-always">‘Always’</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/troy-baker-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with GQ</a>, it was reported that Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In a heartbeat I would always work with Troy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was quoted alongside a report that Baker <strong>will </strong>return to Naughty Dog to play a role in Druckmann’s next project, which for now remains under wraps.</p>



<p>It has been an uncharacteristically quiet year for Troy Baker, but he is playing the chief role in the upcoming Indiana Jones: The Great Circle, which will be released on December 6. He also had a spot in Arkham Shadow, playing Joker.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I caught up with Troy Baker and talked about a project away from video games. He provided his vocal talents to James Cox for an audiobook, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-troy-baker-james-cox-grand-theft-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covering ‘Grand Theft AI’</a>, a cyberpunk novel of epic proportions.</p>



<p>It isn’t clear what Neil Druckmann’s next game looks like, but in 2025, Baker will surface in Ken Levine’s Judas, a spiritual successor to BioShock and a long-awaited first-person title.</p>



<p>What do you think Neil Druckmann’s next project looks like at Naughty Dog? Are we talking about another game set in The Last of Us’ universe, or could it be something else entirely? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/where-can-you-play-path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>While I primarily play on PC, like many other ARPG fans, the genre is growing on other systems, too. You can now play some of the best titles in the genre on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, including Path of Exile and Diablo IV. But what about the upcoming PoE2? What are the Path of Exile 2 platforms for Early Access? Here’s what you need to know to prepare for the monolithic ARPG!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-path-of-exile-2-releasing-on">What Systems is Path of Exile 2 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-path-of-exile-2-early-access-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access release day</a>, you can play Path of Exile 2 on PC (Steam and Epic Games Store), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. On PC, you can buy a supporter pack ranging in price from $30 to nearly $500, depending on where you purchase. More options are available on the Grinding Gear Games’ official website, all offering game keys. But if you’re playing the ARPG on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S, then you can scoop up one of the multiple supporter packs, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Supporter Pack – $30</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack – $60</strong></li>



<li><strong>King of the Faridun Supporter Pack – $100</strong></li>



<li><strong>Thamaturge of the Vaal Supporter Pack – $150</strong></li>



<li><strong>Warlord of the Karui Supporter Pack – $220</strong></li>



<li><strong>Liberator of Wraeclast Supporter Pack – $370</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Prices will vary depending on your platform, region, and associated taxes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-path-of-exile-2-be-free-to-play-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s">Will Path of Exile 2 Be Free to Play on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S?</h2>



<p>While the full 1.0 launch of Path of Exile 2 will be a free-to-play experience available to anyone who wishes to download and enjoy the game, the current Early Access launch for PoE2 is a paid endeavor. If you want access, you must purchase one of the supporter packs mentioned earlier, all of which include a key to the early release of the ARPG. These packs, once again, range in price, with the cheapest being $30. </p>



<p>Now, if you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, eating up all of the grind you can, $30 isn’t a high asking price. Many people wind up playing PoE for hundreds or thousands of hours.</p>



<p>Where do you intend to play Path of Exile 2? Let us know in the comments below, or start a discussion about ARPGs and PoE2 on our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Actress Jen Taylor has had the same longevity as Master Chief's AI companion, Cortana. However, according to Downes, he and Taylor were briefly replaced by other performers during the development of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/halo-4-review/1900-6399288/" data-ref-id="1900-6399288">Halo 4</a>.</p><p>Downes recently shared the story of his recasting on his YouTube channel. As the actor recalls, neither he nor Taylor were aware that 343 Industries--which took over the Halo franchise from Bungie--had already cast new performers for Master Chief and Cortana. According to Downes, testers complained about not feeling connected to the new voices for those iconic characters. But before Downes could return, he had to audition for the role he made famous.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfuEJMOAzNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NfuEJMOAzNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Downes and Taylor have remained firmly in place ever since, and the latter even reprised her role as Cortana on the Halo TV series on Paramount+. In response to Downes' story, Generalkidd reposted a clip from a Halo 4 build that features noticeably different voices for Master Chief and Cortana.

			<p>Hitman developer IO Interactive has made the decision to cut ties with the MMA fighter Conor McGregor after last week's Irish High <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/22/mma-fighter-conor-mcgregor-assaulted-woman-at-dublin-hotel-jury-finds">Court ruling</a> where he was found to be guilty of assaulting and raping a woman in December 2018. The decision to cut ties comes shortly after a collaboration between IO Interactive and McGregor was confirmed, where he would be a character in the Hitman series called <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-featuring-conor-mcgregor-attracts-large-player-base/">The Disruptor</a>. His voice and likeness were used for the character, where he was featured as one of the game's Elusive Targets. There was a mission available, as well as a DLC pack that would provide permanent access to an arcade contract featuring The Disruptor and new cosmetics. However, since the ruling, IO Interactive has made the decision to cut all ties and will be removing all content featuring McGregor from the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This statement</a> was made via social media this afternoon, where IO posted their announcement on X. The statement goes on to say: "In light of the recent court ruling regarding Conor McGregor, IO Interactive has made the decision to cease its collaboration with the athlete, effective immediately. e take this matter very seriously and cannot ignore its implications. Consequently, we will begin removing all content featuring Mr. McGregor from our storefronts starting today."</p>
<p>The Disruptor most recently returned to the Hitman game earlier this month as a limited-time mission that players would be able to participate in, with the mission set to be playable until 8 December. However, all of this will now be removed from the game. For those who own The Disruptor DLC, it hasn't been stated what will happen to the content since it's already been purchased. However, in cases like these, where content is removed regardless of circumstance, those who already own it tend to be able to continue to access it.</p>
<p>With the Irish Jury deciding what they did, McGregor was ordered to pay at least 248k Euro in damages. Despite this, he's also said that he plans to appeal the verdict. As there's no date as to when this will happen, it's hard to say what IO Interactive would be able to do about the situation should McGregor be successful in his appeal of last week's court ruling. For now though, people will no longer be able to purchase any content relating to the athlete for the unforeseeable.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, like its predecessor, hasn't been released on Xbox consoles so far, but it definitely sounds like the door is still open to seeing the Remake trilogy on Microsoft consoles in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirths-director-is-an-xbox-fan-and-with-square-enix-testing-the-multiplatform-waters-he-says-he-wants-to-being-the-jrpg-to-as-many-players-out-there-as-possible/">GamesRadar+</a> shortly before taking the stage at this year's Golden Joystick Awards, game director Naoki Hamaguchi commented on the trilogy as a whole, saying that while nothing could be announced at the time, he certainly wants to bring the Final Fantasy VII remake series to as many players as possible. As such, they want to "create that situation, that environment, where more players can play the games in the future, and we want to look in that direction."</p>
<p>Square Enix changing its stance on platform exclusivity, which already produced some results with the release of select titles that missed Xbox consoles at launch, isn't an isolated happening but an industry-wide change, according to the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director. With so many platforms available, it is no longer possible to release a game on a single platform and get most of the players wanting to play such a game on that single platform. Giving his personal opinion on the matter, Hamaguchi-san, owning an Xbox console, praised it as a great hardware platform, so it definitely sounds like there wouldn't be any resistance on his part to get the game out on Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p>Despite having only released Final Fantasy VII Rebirth <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">earlier this year,</a> Naoki Hamaguchi and his team are already hard at work on the third and final part of the remake trilogy.<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"> The story and concept for the game are already completed</a>, so hopefully, it won't take much to see the first glimpse of the conclusion of Cloud's story.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025. That’s according to the latest rumors published by popular Nintendo news channel Nintendo Prime.</p>



<p>According to the latest rumors, which the channel found on Chinese forum <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5103984429499076#comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a> and the <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-speculation-thread-st-this-is-furukawa-president-of-nintendo.7757/page-2146#post-1426497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards gaming forum</a>, Nintendo will officially reveal its next system in January 2025 followed by a March launch. </p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Nintendo has not responded to requests for comment as of publishing. As always, until something is made official or Insider Gaming can independently confirm the details, please take all rumors with a grain of salt. That said, this isn’t the first time a March 2025 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-reportedly-headed-for-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date has been rumored</a> for the follow-up console. Also, the last update from the company is that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console will be announced</a> before April.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect with the next Nintendo Switch console, Nintendo confirmed that it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/">will have backwards compatibility</a> as well as feature the same Nintendo Switch Online service that players currently have. </p>



<p>Other rumors about the console include magnetic Joy-Con <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controllers with additional buttons</a> as well as support for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-backwards-compatible-and-support-4k-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 4K resolution</a> when docked. It’s also been claimed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-get-aaa-games-at-launch-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new system will get AAA games</a> around its launch, something the current Nintendo Switch didn’t have. </p>



<p>None of those reports have been confirmed, either. </p>



<p>Do you think the Nintendo Switch 2 will release in March 2025? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>The year is nearly over, but we still have a handful of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/three-upcoming-free-to-play-games-may-dominate-the-end-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play titles</a> launching in December that promise hundreds of hours of gameplay between them. One of the biggest upcoming launches is Path of Exile 2, an ARPG that rivals Diablo IV in nearly every way. If you’re excited, join the club, but first, check out what’s inside each of the Path of Exile 2 supporter packs on Steam!</p>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-early-access-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Early Access Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you want access to Path of Exile 2 during its Early Access period, supposedly, you’ll have to buy the Early Access Supporter Pack for <strong>$30</strong> to receive a key ahead of the game’s free-to-play launch.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>300 Points</strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-path-of-exile-2-lord-of-ogham-supporter-pack">Path of Exile 2 – Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack</h2>



<p>If you’re the type of player who knows they’ll wind up playing Path of Exile 2 for many tens of hours, then dropping the equivalent of a full price retail game on the ARPG with the Lord of Ogham Supporter Pack for <strong>$60</strong> doesn’t seem like a bad choice. You’ll receive the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Path of Exile 2 Early Access Key</strong></li>



<li><strong>Extended Digital Soundtrack</strong></li>



<li><strong>600 Points</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lord of Ogham Supporter Forum Title</strong></li>

<li><strong>Commemorative Hillock Statue Hideout Decoration</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2>Path of Exile 2 – King of Faridun Supporter Pack ($100)</h2>



<p>On Steam, the most expensive Path of Exile 2 Supporter Pack is the King of Faridun bundle for $100. It includes everything the two previous editions offer, plus more. It’s for the supporter who knows they’ll continue playing PoE2 for years to come and wants to pump up developer Grinding Gear Games with funds for future development!</p>



<ul>

<p>Of course, the official GGG website features additional Supporter Packs for sale, ranging in price from $160 to nearly $500 for a single bundle. These packs include in-game goodies, physical items like a sweater and artbook, and additional copies of the game so that you can hand some out to your friends!</p>

                <p>Amazon is already slashing prices for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a>, and right now you’ll find two popular retro gaming consoles discounted to their lowest prices of the year. Swing by the online retailer and you can pick up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CS3VD9TJ?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari 400 Mini</a> for $100 (was $120) and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CG7LMFKY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari 2600+</a> for just $110 (was $130). The Atari 7800+ also arrives on Friday--so consider snagging a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-is-releasing-a-modernized-7800-console-that-plays-cartridges-this-holiday/1100-6525938/" data-ref-id="1100-6525938">preorder</a> to round out your retro console collection.</p><h2>Atari 400 Mini</h2><h3>$100 (was $120)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405129" data-ratio="0.564" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405129"></a><figcaption>Atari 400 Mini</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405129-71t1ur5x5l._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>What’s great about the Atari 400 Mini is that it can emulate all Atari 8-bit systems, including the 400, 800XL, and 5200. The console has been fully modernized, featuring 720 HD output, HDMI support, and the option to play in a variety of aspect ratios. You can also enable a retro CRT filter to give your games a retro flair. It comes with 25 built-in games, though you can also play games via USB flash drive. This console includes a CXStick joystick, which is a recreation of the iconic Atari CX40.</p><h2>Atari 2600+</h2><h3>$110 (was $130)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405130" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405130"></a><figcaption>Atari 2600+</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4405130-71hesrbyxdl._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The Atari 2600+ offers many of the same features as its smaller cousin, such as HDMI support, a joystick, and 10 games included with your purchase. Best of all, the Atari 2600+ offers full support for Atari 2600 and 7800 games thanks to a functional cartridge slot. That makes this a great way to check out your old Atari collection, though you’ll also find games for sale in case yours are no longer in working condition.</p><p>Shopping for a modern console?

                <p>Activision has released the latest operator bundle for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone, and it's none other than a shark. The "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack," as it's called, allows players to morph into a menacing-looking shark, but that's not all.</p><p>The bundle (<a href="https://www.oneesports.gg/call-of-duty/shark-skin-tracer-pack-price-items/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via One Esports</a>) includes two weapon blueprints and a number of exclusive cosmetics. The operator skin is called "Bloke Biter," and it transforms the operator Carver into a scary shark with huge muscles. The weapon blueprints included in the bundle are themed around the ocean and water. There are additional water-themed cosmetics to help make it look like you escaped from the depths.</p><p>This DLC bundle costs 24,000 COD Points, which is about $20 USD. You can get a closer look at the "G'Day Bait Tracer Pack" in the video below.</p><p>The in-game Call of Duty shop is regularly updated with new bundles, and the shark operator isn't the only new arrival. Peter Stormare's character, The Replacer, is now available in the store as well, and he has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-the-replacers-leaked-finishing-moves-are-some-of-cods-most-ridiculous-yet/1100-6527926/" data-ref-id="1100-6527926">some of the most ridiculous finishing moves we've ever seen in Call of Duty.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">the month's best-selling game in the US</a>, and is already the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, it's been reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the future of the mega-franchise.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-conor-mcgregor-collab-ended<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>studio IO Interactive has announced that it's ending its collaboration with MMA fighter Conor McGregor following a court ruling which found that McGregor assaulted a woman.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Hitman/status/1861049881160273921" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>, IO said that its Conor McGregor collaboration was ending "effective immediately". The studio followed up by saying it takes the matter of McGregor's victim's assault "very seriously" and that it "cannot ignore [the matter's] implications".</p>

<p>As such, all content involving McGregor will be removed from&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>"starting today". The developer hasn't explained what will happen if you already own&nbsp;<em>Hitman 3</em>'s Disruptor Pack, in which McGregor starred, but I'm assuming the content will be removed permanently from all storefronts.</p>

<p>McGregor has been ordered to pay his victim Nikita Hand over&nbsp;€248,000 in damages, a result that Ms. Hand described as "a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be to speak up, you have a voice".</p>

<p>For his part, McGregor says he plans to appeal the verdict and that he's "focused on [his] future" for the time being.</p>

<p>The jury in McGregor's case heard a paramedic who examined Ms. Hand following the assault that they hadn't seen "someone so bruised" in a long time, while Ms. Hand herself said that she had spent over&nbsp;€4,000 on psychotherapy, pharmaceutical aid, and doctor's visits.</p>

<p>Technically, the character in the game is never named as Conor McGregor, although he does clearly sport McGregor's face, as well as bearing a tattoo on his stomach that reads "McGregor".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305474/sonic-3-trailer-chao-garden-detective-pikachu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are a handful of details <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24228966/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-trailer-keanu-reeves">Parmount’s third <em>Sonic</em></a><em> </em>feature needs to get right in order for it to feel like a proper adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2,</em> and the movie’s latest trailer makes it look like it has the Chao Garden (arguably the best part of the game) on lock.</p><p>Though it features a few more shots of the Robotniks (Jim Carey) and Shadow the Hedgehog (Keanu Reeves) plotting to obliterate the earth, the highlight of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>’s new trailer are its new shots of the Chao Garden. While <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>’s Chao Garden was basically a daycare to raise magical little creatures, the movie reimagines it as a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24042393/the-world-definitely-does-not-need-a-chuck-e-cheese-game-show">Chuck E. Cheese</a>-like restaurant where Sonic (Ben Schwartz) and his crew like to hang out as Chao mascots dance around on stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Given all the Chao merch on display, you’d almost think the tiny blob creatures were the <em>Pokémon </em>of the live-action <em>Sonic</em>’s world in terms of being part of a beloved video game franchise. But these kids and Knuckles (Idris Elba) all seem to have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Detective Pikachu</em></a>, implying that the film was a successful movie adaptation in their world as well. Though Sonic’s Google Maps joke falls a little flat, the shots of Shadow using a weird orb to terrorize everyone gives him a bit of a <a href="https://pokemon.fandom.com/wiki/Mewtwo_Ball">Mewtwo vibe</a> that feels fitting, given his being something of a misunderstood villain.</p><p>And while there’s no sign whether Rouge the Bat will make an appearance, the trailer’s a good reminder that the movie’s December 20th premiere is going to be an explosive one.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
