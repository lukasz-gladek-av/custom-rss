			<p>Where Winds Meet is the hottest new free-to-play game on the market as 2025 winds down, and developer Everstone Studio and publisher NetEase are ready for its popularity with a jam-packed month of updates for the game's December 2025 roadmap.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/">hitting over 9 million players on PC and PS5</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997337719257895205">more than 5 million pre-registrations for the mobile version</a>, which is still to arrive on December 12, 2025, Everstone Studio is already adding huge chunks to the game, the big highlight being the addition of an entire new region for players to explore called Roaring Sands.</p>



<p>There are also new bosses to defeat, including a new campaign boss, and new limited-time activities for players to take advantage of.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Discover the Winds of December:</p><p>🗺️New Region: Roaring Sands<br>🌊New Bosses: River Master and Feng Ruzhi<br>📱Global Mobile Launch: Dec 12 (UTC)<br>🗡️New Hero's Realm, Sword Trial and more! <a href="https://t.co/d12Ra9uXwb">pic.twitter.com/d12Ra9uXwb</a></p></div>— Where Winds Meet (@WhereWindsMeet_) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhereWindsMeet_/status/1997001761807388991?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The first week of additions, which includes the two new Jianghu Legacy quests, is already available at the time of this writing. The second week additions, which include the new River Master campaign boss and the big highlight of the Roaring Sands region, will arrive at the end of this week, alongside the game's launch on iOS and Android mobile devices.</p>



<p>The second new boss fight of the month, Feng Ruzhi, will arrive in the third week, alongside two limited-time activities. The final week offers the Scarlet Shock Sword Trial and Hero's Realm: Blade Dance activity, on top of a festively themed Fireworks Festival.</p>



<p>As post-launch content goes, it's clear that NetEase and Everstone have hit the ground running, ready to build off the momentum of the game's strong launch. If it can keep up its numbers now that millions of players have already stepped into its world, it could be the next Genshin Impact-level multiplayer action RPG.</p>



<p>For more on Where Winds Meet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/where-winds-meet-review-living-the-wuxia-dream/">check out Wccftech's review by Francesco De Meo</a>, who gave the game an 8.5/10, writing, "<em>Where Winds Meet delivers an exceptional open-world experience, successfully blending an engaging story, meaningful activities, a solid combat system paired with competent character progression, a wealth of multiplayer options, and one of the most lively cities in the genre. Though some of its features and mechanics suffer from the constraints of the free-to-play model, the good undeniably outweighs the bad, making it a rare title that can captivate even players who typically avoid similar open-world games, easily providing hundreds of hours of content even in its launch state.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/</link>
            <guid>1376260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The development of Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 began even before the release of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/"><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong></a>. Over the past year or so, director Naoki Hamaguchi teased how the experience, likely deeply rooted in the introduction of the Highwind airship, will be different from its predecessors while confirming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/"><strong>development was proceeding smoothly.</strong></a> And finally, we are nearing the point at which more information on the highly anticipated game can be shared, the first reportedly coming before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking in a new interview with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@julienchieze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Julien Chièze</strong></a>, Hamaguchi-san commented on the current development state of the game, confirming that its experience is almost complete as the development team is focusing on fully fleshing out the experience.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"So, honestly, I want everyone to play it as soon as possible, but since it's a game, we must properly finish the detailed work, and only then can we deliver it to the users,"</em> Hamaguchi-san said in regards to when Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 will launch. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So, after properly going through that [fleshing out] phase, we want to deliver it to everyone in a satisfactory form, so if you can just wait a little longer, I believe we will reach the stage where we can deliver various information to everyone,"</em> he added.</p>



<p>Speaking about the game's final name, Hamaguchi-san said that he and Tetsuya Nomura have <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"narrowed down"</em> the options to two, and he expects the final choice to be made before the end of the year.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it may be too early to see Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 in action, the fact that we are nearing the point when more can be shared about it is definitely exciting. As for when this moment will arrive, it's not easy to say. Though unlikely if the game's name hasn't been finalized yet, if an announcement accompanied by the very first footage is coming before the end of the year, this week's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">The Game Awards</strong></a> would be the perfect occasion to begin the marketing cycle for one of the most anticipated JRPGs of the next few years.</p>



<p>Although Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 won't see the light of day anytime soon, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S owners who did not have the chance to play the Remake trilogy yet will finally get their chance next year, starting with Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade, which<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/"> <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">launches this January on the Nintendo and Microsoft current-generation systems.</strong></a> The other two entries in the trilogy will also launch on both systems in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Sorry, <em>Shenmue </em>fans, but <em>Shenmue 3 </em>is still the latest <em>Shenmue </em>game for now.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Ys Net goes on to say that the use of its logo, as well as the attempt to mislead viewers into thinking the footage is official, "constitutes a serious issue that may amount to trademark infringement and unfair competition".</p><p>As such, the developer says it's "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action". It sounds like whoever made that footage might be dealing with some uncomfortable queries soon.</p><p>Although some believed the <em>Shenmue 4 </em>footage to be real, others suggested it had been made with generative AI, pointing to certain animations and the slightly-too-reverent story content in the trailer as proof.</p><p>Of course, being made with generative AI doesn't mean the trailer isn't real by itself; many studios, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="affdbbdc-41b9-4313-aacc-396adb4aed5a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and, indeed, <em>Shenmue </em>owner <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Sega</a>, have embraced the technology in one form or another. Still, this particular <em>Shenmue 4 </em>balloon has been thoroughly popped, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>The <em>Shenmue 4 </em>footage doing the rounds might not be real, but that doesn't mean the franchise has no future.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in August, Ys Net <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba817600-c94e-4669-a165-612cf6c34c02" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced an enhanced version</a> of <em>Shenmue 3 </em>for modern platforms, bringing improvements like camera tweaks, stamina adjustments, and skippable cutscenes.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, it's the first big DLC expansion for <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and it introduces two brand new Nightlord bosses to take on, including the fearsome Dreglord.</p><p>As well as the two extra bosses, <em>The Forsaken Hollows </em>adds a new map (although it's technically just a Shifting Earth condition) to explore, plus new bosses from <em>Souls </em>series history, new enemies, and plenty more.</p><p>You can also play as two brand new characters in <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>, namely the Scholar and the Undertaker, who bring disparate play styles to make your expeditions into the parallel land of Limveld more exciting.</p>
<p>As for the base game itself, <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>is an experimental spinoff of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6919a2a8-7d6a-4b7b-ba51-02f9b15b7407" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">multi-million-selling open-world Soulslike</a>, one which mixes elements of games like <em>Fortnite </em>and extraction shooters into FromSoftware's signature blend of exploration and combat.</p><p>The game sees teams of up to three players heading into a constantly-changing map in order to scavenge gear, battle enemies and bosses to level up, and take on an especially powerful bespoke encounter at the conclusion of each three-day run.</p><p>You can check out <em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em>and its <em>Forsaken Hollows </em>DLC on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2622380/ELDEN_RING_NIGHTREIGN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-nightreign/9PJ22QNVCZ3G" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> right now, and you can read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-nightreign-review-fort-night" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6d6f261-ff0a-4fbc-9eea-253dd2d55ca7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">my review of the base game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<figcaption>Longtime <em>Tekken </em>director Katsuhiro Harada is leaving Bandai Namco at the end of this year.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Harada goes on to say that he's spent the last "four to five years" handing off responsibilities for <em>Tekken </em>to the franchise's development team, including the "stories and worldbuilding [he] oversaw", so his departure shouldn't come as too much of a shock for <em>Tekken</em>.</p><p>As for what's next for Harada, he says he'll "share more about [his] next steps at a later date".

He says that he will be attending the Tekken World Tour finals in January, albeit "as a guest", so you'll see him there if you check out that event.</p><p>Additionally, to say goodbye to <em>Tekken</em>, Harada has created a "DJ-style nonstop mix" of music from the franchise that he "personally edited". You can listen to it <a href="https://soundcloud.com/katsuhiro-harada-1/tekken-a-30-year-journey-haradas-final-mix" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <p>They might <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-still-sounds-like-it-wont-commit-to-a-new-vegas-ending-but-for-the-love-of-all-thats-housely-i-hope-it-will">not have committed</a> to making any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> ending the canon one, but the folks behind Amazon's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tv-shows/fallout">Fallout TV show</a> have been quick to decide they'd like to get started on filming a third series as soon as they can. Summer 2026, if all goes well, so the radioactive glow of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/macvulpes-inculkin-stares-at-a-guy-spitting-blood-as-fallout-season-2s-latest-trailer-sets-up-many-family-searches">imminent second series</a> hasn't totally faded to background levels by the time a follow-up drops.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So said executive producer Jonathan Nolan in a recent chat with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-executive-producer-wants-hit-tv-show-back-on-the-air-as-soon-as-we-can-after-season-2-ends-with-season-3-set-to-film-next-summer">Ian Games Network</a>.</p>
<p>"With regards to production, we're hoping to be shooting again next summer," the producer outlined. "We'll see if that all comes together, best laid plans and all." He then added: "I think what's happened with television in terms of taking longer and longer from season to season is an unfortunate trend. You don't want the show to lose any of its scope, but we know that we'd like to be back on the air as soon as we can."</p>
<p>Well, the conundrum outlined in that last bit sounds <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">similiar to another medium</a>, especially as the last couple of Fallout entries grow more and more distant in the rear view mirror.</p>
<p>As it is, I'm not surprised that having been given the green light earlier this year Fallout's showrunners are keen to keep pressing on while they've got momentum. It's not like they'll need time to decide the basics of where the third series will go either, having sketched out some stuff all the way up to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fallout-tv-star-says-his-characters-plot-has-been-planned-up-to-at-least-season-5-or-6/">fifth or sixth season</a> according to Maximus actor Aaron Moten.</p><p>I am interested to see which location's next on the road trip list of Lucy and co, with the series now having done arguably the two biggest stops on the non Bethesda-developed Fallout tour - California and Nevada. Maybe it'll be off to the Midwest for some Fallout: Tactics deep cuts.</p>
<p>I jest, but to be honest if the trend of revisiting locations is set to continue, it'd be nice to see an entry that isn't already given prominent billing given a bit of a spotlight. I mean, most of the gear and props will likely still be made to look <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>-ish in the name of corporate synergy, but hey, I'm used to that by now.</p>

            <guid>1376242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Graphic card upgrades can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Right now, you can pick the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB OC edition gaming graphics card without paying the full price, courtesy of a deal currently live on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/">On a regular day, it would run you around $540, but you can snap it up at a 30% discount right now, which drops the price to $378.</a> This is its lowest it’s dropped to in quite some time, and is packed with everything you need to push some gaming and creative boundaries this holiday season. It’s selling out like crazy, though, which is why we recommend grabbing yours before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Efficiency With Impressive Heat Dissipation</h2>
<p>ASUS has designed this thing with military-grade components for exceptional performance and reliability. We’re talking certified military-grade TUF chokes and MOSFETs to deliver impressive power to the GPU for better stability, plus 5K black metallic capacitors for wider temperature tolerance and a longer lifespan than other options in this range. The protective conformal coating makes the graphics card temperature (high and low), shock, humidity, and fog resistant, while the dual ball fan bearings ensure quiet cooling even when things get intense.</p>
<p>Speaking of intense gaming/creative sessions, you’ll also appreciate the axial-tech upgrades with fans that propel more air, and the high-quality diecast shroud with aluminum backplate featuring larger vents for even better heat dissipation. The MaxContact design expands the surface area of the heat spreader by 5% when needed to keep the overall GPU temperatures and prevent thermal throttling. Fans are also designed to stop when the temperature reaches below 50 degrees Celsius, letting you enjoy quieter performance during less resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>As for the performance, RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you play. You’re getting fifth-gen tensor cores that deliver incredible AI performance with FP4 and DLSS4, new streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neural shaders, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores for mega geometry. Translation? Low latency and improved visual quality for all your favorite titles. Responsiveness comes from Reflex 2, which offers quicker target acquisition and better reaction times, as well as introduces Frame Warp to further reduce latency based on the latest mouse input in the game. Customization options let you monitor performance and tweak settings based on your own preferences. This is done through GPU Tweak III, where you can overclock, undervolt, and monitor real-time stats with an intuitive interface.​ You’ll also enjoy access to MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app with your purchase, plus get a complimentary membership to Adobe Creative Cloud, all Apps.​</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to upgrade the way you play your favorite titles or work on some creative projects, you need a solid graphics card in your setup. These don’t come in cheap, and discounts on some of the best options out there are few and far between, which makes this deal one worth grabbing. You’re saving $162 on an option that’s going to completely transform your experience, but the discount wraps up soon. Grab it before that happens!</p>

<p>A new report reveals that Netflix considered acquiring Electronic Arts, Disney, and Fox, but none of those deals came to fruition. </p>



<p>Netflix is the new big dog in town, ever since it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the company would acquire Warner Bros. for $82.7 billion in 2026, likely giving it access to studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche. New details reveal they have considered buying other major companies, including EA and Disney. </p>



<h2 id="h-netflix-debated-pursuing-ea-disney-and-fox">Netflix ‘Debated Pursuing’ EA, Disney, and Fox</h2>



<p>A new Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-wooed-trump-personally-ahead-of-warner-bid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> about Netflix CEO wooing Trump ahead of Warner Bros.’ bid says the company considered acquisitions of EA, Disney, and Fox. It first talks about how Netflix is an “unlikely bidder”, as co-founder and chairman, Reed Hastings, avoids major deals to build things “from scratch”. The company’s management “debated pursuing just about every major asset put up for sale, including&nbsp;Electronic Arts Inc.&nbsp;and&nbsp;Fox.” They also considered acquiring Disney at one point. </p>



<p>However, the “executives could never coalesce behind a deal.” Additionally, the execs didn’t want to “hurt their stock price by overpaying for an asset that traded at a much lower multiple.” Netflix’s co-CEO Greg Peters also stated, ahead of the acquisition of Warner Bros., that “One should have a reasonable amount of skepticism around big media mergers, they don’t have an amazing track record,” which led people to think Netflix was not interested in the deal. </p>

Additionally, Paramount has made a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paramount-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-billions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hostile offer</a> to acquire Warner Bros.

                <p dir="ltr">Nightdive Studios has announced that the System Shock remake will launch December 18 on Switch and Switch 2. The developer revealed that a critical decision regarding Unreal Engine made the ports possible, especially with the original Switch.</p><p dir="ltr">In a dev diary video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwdpC__mTw">on YouTube</a> (seen below), Nightdive explains that the team first planned on utilizing Unreal Engine 5 for the remake of System Shock on Switch 2. But then Nightdive wondered about bringing the classic immersive to both Nintendo hybrid consoles and found out Unreal Engine 4 was a possibility. "Once we made that discovery, we did that big pivot for a few reasons--the biggest was stability," said developer Thomas Curnow.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKwdpC__mTw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hKwdpC__mTw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Within 48 hours, Nightdive felt vindicated by the choice with Unreal Engine 4, according to the video. That's because successful builds of the remake were created for Switch and Switch 2 in that timeframe. "I want the game to be just as we remember it," said producer Justin Khan.</p><p dir="ltr">The System Shock remake first launched on PC in 2023 before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/system-shock-remake-is-out-in-may-for-consoles/1100-6521791/">arriving on PlayStation and Xbox consoles</a> in May 2024.

            <p>A listing for Resident Evil Requiem's Deluxe Edition may have given away more than Capcom intended, with the suggestion of an unexpected playable character.</p>
<p>Ever since its announcement, players have speculated that Leon Kennedy would be popping up when Requiem debuts next year, but GameStop has unintentionally added another series name to the list of possible playable characters. <strong>Please be aware of potential Resident Evil Requiem spoilers below. </strong></p>

<p>As spotted by social media account <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">DuskGolem</a>, the GameStop store page for Resident Evil Requiem's Deluxe Edition once featured exclusive content for none other than Rosemary Winters. She is the daughter of Resident Evil 7 and 8 protagonist, Ethan. And, while her inclusion has been scrubbed from the site now, the internet remembers.</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, the Deluxe Edition initially promised users a Shadow Walker costume pack, which would include three outfits for Rosemary.</p>
<p>The same listing also mentioned two additional story scenarios, along with a "major" Mercenaries mode update and a Morphic Visor cosmetic filter for "Rose's visor" (oddly, they didn't say Rosemary here).</p>

<p>The wording has since been changed, and the <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/pc-gaming/pc-games/products/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe---pc/20023062-2a094304.html">GameStop listing</a> for the Resident Evil Requiem Deluxe Edition now reads thus:</p>
<p><strong>The Deluxe Kit contains the following content:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Five costumes including Grace's Costume: Dimitrescu</li>
<li>Two filters including Filter: Apocalypse</li>
<li>Four weapon skins including S&amp;S M232 Weapon Skin: Apocalypse</li>
<li>Two charms including Charm: Mr. Raccoon</li>
<li>Audio Pack: Raccoon City Classic</li>
<li>Files: Letters from 1998</li>

<p>The last time we saw Rosemary Winters was in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil 8</a>'s Shadows of Rose DLC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-resident-evil-village-dlc-trailer-reveals-roses-mysterious-power">where she appeared as a teenager with supernatural powers</a>. In 2022, director Kento Kinoshita said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-village-dlc-will-conclude-the-winters-family-saga">Capcom was "creating the Shadows of Rose story to conclude the Winters family saga"</a>. So, was the studio calling our bluff?</p>

<p>It's a goal!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>One of the most unique a beautiful games of the year — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/despelote">despelote</a> — is all about the beautiful game itself and the communities it helps build, and it's coming to Switch on <strong>11th December</strong> in North America for just <strong>$14.99</strong>.</p>
<p>Japan will get it on 18th December, while the rest of the world will have to wait for kick-off on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>despelote isn't your typical soccer game where you're kicking about a ball to win matches; this is a slice-of-life narrative-driven experience which is all about the importance of soccer to Ecuador and, in particular to eight-year-old Julián, in the run up to the World Cup.</p>
<p>In despelote, you'll dribble, pass, and shoot the ball around Quito, but not for victory — simply, to connect. How will people react? Will Ecuador qualify for the World Cup? And how does everyone feel about the beautiful game, of their city, their country?</p>
<p>It's a short game too, clocking in at around 2 hours, but from looking at reviews back when the game launched on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox in May, it'll stick with you long after. Here's a rundown of what toe expect from the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Features:</u></p>
<p>- A bittersweet and sometimes dreamy semi-autobiographical tale of youth.<br>
- Explore a dense town space at your leisure, full of activities, interactions, and mischief to get up to.<br>
- A physics-based soccer ball that feels good to kick around in a first-person perspective.<br>
- A vibrant world full of characters that have funny, and genuine conversations.<br>
- Photos and audio recorded on location in Ecuador are used to create a strong sense of place.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-battlefield-6-black-friday-eu-sales/</link>
            <guid>1376203</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/ps5-ea-sports-fc-26-and-hogwarts">The Game Business</a> has, as it does each week, the latest <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD Sales Data</a> for the top-selling games in the EU. This time, the weekly sales are from the week of November 24-30, which includes all of the Black Friday sales numbers, with EA Sports FC 26 winning the day in both sales by revenue and units sold. Meanwhile, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was able to stay ahead of Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>In fairness, both of fall 2025's popular shooters were in the top five for the week, with Black Ops 7 riding its launch wave and Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-black-friday-deal-amazon/">getting put on a fairly significant Black Friday sale</a>, though the discount <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-loses-ground-eu-sales-charts-black-friday-sales/">wasn't enough to change the rankings from the week before</a>, with Black Ops 7 still holding fast just above Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Hogwarts Legacy was another notable entry in the charts. Even though it came in eighth place on the sales by revenue chart, it shot up all the way to second place in the units sold chart, beating Black Ops 7 and Battlefield 6. Red Dead Redemption 2 rounded out the top five units sold list, while on the revenue charts, after Battlefield 6 in third, Pokémon Legends Z-A and NBA 2K26 rounded out the top five in fourth and fifth place, respectively.</p>



<p>None of the entries in the revenue chart or units sold chart were brand new releases, with everyone taking advantage of Black Friday sales to pick up older games they had been eyeing. In fact, the most recent release on both charts was technically Black Ops 7, since it's the only game on either top ten list that released in November 2025.</p>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by units sold for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>
<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>



<li>It Takes Two</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>
</ol>



<p>Here's the list of the top ten best-selling games in the EU by revenue for the week of November 24-30, per The Game Business.</p>



<ol>

<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Pokemon Legends Z-A</li>



<li>NBA 2K26</li>



<li>F1 25</li>



<li>Ghost of Yotei</li>



<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>



<li>Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2</li>
</ol>



<p>Elsewhere in The Game Business' report, on the hardware side of things per NielsenIQ, it was the PlayStation 5, not the Nintendo Switch 2, that was the hottest hardware item of the week. Not that the Switch 2 was a slouch, but significant discounts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-available-at-lowest-price-of-648-99-on-amazon-despite-sale-period-ended/">on the PS5 Pro</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-takes-100-off-ps5-for-black-friday-sales/"> base PS5 models</a> helped push it to be, according to The Game Business, the only console to actually improve on its sales numbers compared to last year.</p>



<p>Overall, not the most surprising Black Friday sales charts. Popular sports games and first-person shooters are at the top of the charts, with the rest of the list filled up by regulars on the charts like Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. </p>



<p>Though you do wonder if Microsoft continues to change how it delivers its games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-xbox-exec-says-microsoft-would-be-delighted-to-avoid-making-hardware-and-delivering-games-netflix-style/">particularly if it goes full-on into the Netflix-style distribution as former executive Peter Moore suggested</a>, will Call of Duty or any other Microsoft-owned game still make these charts, or will the subscription-based focus leave a gap for other games to claim a spot as one of the regularly best-selling games week-to-week?</p>

            <p>The modders behind <a href="https://beyondskyrim.org/project/cyrodiil">Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil</a>, the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">modding</a> project aiming to add a post-Oblivion-crisis version of the Imperial province to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>'s map, have given a lengthy tour of the latest city they've whipped into shape. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beyond-skyrim-cyrodiil-the-full-imperial-expansion-from-the-devs-of-skyrims-massive-bruma-mod-gets-a-bird-chatter-heavy-teaser">teased the other week</a>, that city is Anvil, and it's certainly home to some quirky folks.</p>
<p>Just in case of confusion, what makes Beyond Skyrim different to both Bethesda's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> and recently delayed Oblivion remake mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> is that it'll be introducing a fresh cast of characters and stories to familiar locations from the fourth Elder Scrolls game. After all, by the time of Skyrim, Martin Septim and his contemporaries are long gone.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that existing Skyrim map expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-beyond-bruma-mod-released">Beyond Skyrim: Bruma</a> offers a great early taste of what this group of modders can pull off, what's intrigued me most so far is the project's mission to wind forward time and tell new tales. After all, Oblivion's a nice game to retread, but I've seen the narrative it has to offer plenty of times at this point.</p><p>However, having watched a good chunk of that livestream embedded above, where the Beyond Skyrim team show off some of the stories and characters they've worked into Anvil, my feelings are a bit mixed. The city itself looks brilliant, having been expanded and given an architectural feel which blends Cyrodiilic vibes with the deserty aesthetic of neighbouring province Hammerfell.</p>
<p>The layout still invokes plenty of nostalgia, while Beyond Skyrim's team look to have arguably leant more towards zany comedy with the side characters and quests who pop up to newcomers than the notoriously eccentric Oblivion did. Upon first entering the city, you come across and encounter with two drunken sailors swimming in the town's pod. A guard jumps in to arrest them, and these two loinclothed lads sprint off through the city; according to the devs, the idea is that you might pursue their nearly-bare bottoms and do some sightseeing. Or, maybe you'll move on and talk to an Argonian named Left-Hand who randomly demands you tell him what 4833 x 76 is.</p>
<p>Maelorn, an older version of one of the two elven twins you might remember from Oblivion, is less on the weird side, since he just asks you a riddle and then reminisces about his life since the days of The Elder Scrolls 4.</p>
<p>Anyway, what grabbed my attention the most was a quest involving a kid called Jinol, which kicks off in Anvil bazaar about half an hour in. It's simply called Child Labour, and is about, er, that. Jinol wants your help setting up a business selling saltwater from the docks door-to-door, so you recruit other kids to act as runners. So far, so quirky little quest in terms of premise. The idea's that you gradually realise that you maybe shouldn't just be going along with trying to make a buck off some kids doing work an adult should be doing, at least if the Elder Scrolls' world is being kept a bit more on the 'fantasy' side of the 'medieval fantasy' coin.</p><p>There is one character, a merchant named Pavia Tara, who calls you out and asks if you've considered the ethics of your actions. However, at the moment the modders seem to have reduced her to being a one-dimensional scolding Karen, even if she does weave a bit of small business vs big business chatter into her rant, mirroring the city's wider themes.</p>
<p>There's a spot of tonal whiplash there, alongside the quest's very on-the-nose name. Then, we meet Franny. Basically, you and Jinol go and meet the owner of a big fishing company, Francis of Anvil. He lives with multiple wives in a house the devs say was at least in part inspired by the Playboy mansion. Franny literally goes "Child labour, why didn't I think of that", and offers to buy out Jinol's business. You help the kid decide whether or not this grown, multiple-wife guy gets to save money by relying on child labour.</p>
<p>The quest is mostly played for laughs, and I certainly don't think the goal is to make light of what remains <a href="https://www.unicef.org/protection/child-labour">a real issue</a> in our own world. Plus, the modders have aimed to make the kids essentially act like mini-adults. However, I'm not sure the quest strikes an effective balance between wacky/edgy humour, and making the player confront the morals behind what starts out as innocent fun.</p>
<p>As things go, it hasn't put me off Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil entirely – I’m still keen to see what other sorts of tales the modders have weaved into their work. But it wouldn’t be the first time a mod has mishandled controversial or delicate themes in an attempt at crafting fresh narratives, and while Jinol’s water distribution service isn’t anywhere near the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-the-frontier-goes-offline-after-modder-accused-of-sharing-animated-paedophilic-content">worst examples</a>, it is something I hope gets revisited. Maybe when they go back to swap all the placeholder AI voices for real ones.</p>

            <guid>1376188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

         <p><span>Fans have a theory that this decline in writing quality may have come from a Netflix mandate. In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>The Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 release date carries on Epic’s new mission to let everyone relive the early years by experiencing older content again from top to bottom. Key content for Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 has been revealed, showing you what you can look forward to for several weeks.</p>



<p>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 celebrates the battle royale’s Christmas period from SEVEN years ago. The game has changed dramatically over the last seven years, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-dark-voyager-quest-rewards-chapter-7-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1</a> begins the next significant milestone in the game’s history, it’s time for a Holiday throwback.</p>



<p>OG Chapter 1 Season 7 brings back some banging skins and some beloved POIs and weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 releases on December 11, exactly two weeks out from Christmas Day!</strong></p>



<p>It’s time to put in some real work. Alongside Fortnite Chapter 7 Season 1 is OG Chapter 1 Season 7. It’s a testament to Epic to keep so many areas of the game in operation at once. But the nostalgic return to bygone Fortnite eras has been a huge dub in the community.</p>



<p>The OG Chapter 1 Season 7’s tagline was “You Better Watch Out,” and Insider Gaming will tell you why.</p>

<p><strong>Alongside returning Xmas-themed POIs and a new OG Battle Pass, you can look forward to the Boom Box, Stink Bombs, a Scoped Revolver, and much more in Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick summary of every item outed by Epic Games ahead of Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloons</li>



<li>Boom Box</li>



<li>Dual Pistols</li>



<li>Glider Redeploy</li>



<li>Infinity Blade (In-Season)</li>



<li>New Battle Pass</li>

<li>Scoped AR</li>



<li>Scoped Revolver</li>



<li>Stink Bombs</li>



<li>Suppressed Sniper Rifle</li>



<li>X-4 Stormwing</li>

<p>Chapter 7’s storyline was a fairly new narrative more in keeping with the theme of Christmas. You too can experience this all for yourself when Fortnite OG Chapter 1 Season 7 drops a few days from now.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1376179</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Tigz, who was documented last week as being the first person in the world to successfully escape from Tarkov, has been awarded a unique streamer item by Battlestate Games. These items are used to represent the respect that Battlestate Games has for the content creators who pour their lives into pulling Escape from Tarkov into the limelight time and again.</p>



<p>There are dozens of streamer items in the game, but the latest one belongs to Tigz, and it’s a tongue-in-cheek reference to the failed runs that prevented him from getting out of Tarkov without too many issues.</p>



<h2 id="h-tigz-has-a-streamer-item">Tigz Has a Streamer Item</h2>



<p>Tigz has a unique streamer item that’s reminiscent of his time spent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-finally-escaped-from-tarkov/">escaping through Terminal</a>, the final map in Battlestate Games’ tough extraction shooter. In his first attempt, which was watched by tens of thousands of people, Tigz fell short of the ending after failing to find a splint to patch an injury that ultimately led to his death.</p>



<p>That forced him to try again, numerous times.</p>



<p>To honor and recognize that moment, Battlestate Games created a unique <strong>splint </strong>for Tigz’s streamer item – <strong>Tigzresq</strong>. It’s a <strong>67-inch </strong>splint in a red and black design that may or may not be practical. <span>Streamer items&nbsp;<strong>are rarely</strong></span><strong> </strong>practical, but if any will have an honest, in-game use, it’s the Tigzresq.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Another streamer item with a practical use is Gingy’s keychain, which does what you’d imagine and holds keys. There’s also WillerZ’s wallet, the RatCola, sprats, and a jar of mayo, amongst other things.</p>



<p>Whenever someone becomes big for streaming Escape from Tarkov, their streamer item is never too far behind. Fans of TheBurntPeanut, who recently won awards at The Streamer Awards, are clamouring for a unique item in Escape from Tarkov, given the amount of time the VTuber (sorry, PTuber) has spent in the game in recent years.</p>



<p>If you had a streamer item in Escape from Tarkov, what would it be? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>The end result, rather sadly, is that younger Pokémon fans are being denied the chance to grab cards for themselves.</p>
<p>British news outlet <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/dec/08/how-pokemon-cards-became-a-stock-market-for-millennials">The Guardian</a> has been speaking to retailers and fans to get their take on the current state of the Pokémon Trading Card Game in the UK, and it's not particularly pleasant reading.</p>
<p>Ben Thyer, the owner of the independent store BathTCG, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off. It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Demand has consistently outstripped supply in the world of Pokémon TCG for a few years now, but Thyer thinks a correction is perhaps on the way – although it may not last for very long:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were. There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima is no stranger to creating unique experiences that challenge established gameplay formulas. With the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-pc-uniting-world/">Death Stranding series</a></strong>, the legendary creator of the Metal Gear Solid series has created open-world experiences that are markedly different from anything else on the market, transforming a desolate post-apocalyptic world into the perfect setting for players to form meaningful bonds through gameplay. With the horror game OD, however, it sounds like the legendary creator will push video game boundaries even further, as he isn't sure the experience will work out in the end.</p>



<p>As translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/hideo-kojima-says-od-is-something-completely-different-from-a-standard-horror-game-we-still-dont-know-if-it-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Automaton</strong></a>, Kojima-san recently talked about OD and the challenges the game will face in a new interview with <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/74735" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>ananweb</strong></a>. <em>"I can’t say exactly what it is yet, nor do I know if it will work out. We’ve created stealth games and delivery games which were unlike anything before, but system-wise, they were similar to other games. This time, we’re trying to change the service model from the ground up, so it should be quite challenging,"</em> Kojima-san said.</p>



<p>While we still don't know exactly how OD will play, according to Hideo Kojima, there's already a way to understand the experience better. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"We’ve packed <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">the trailer</a></strong> full of hints, so if you keep thinking about it, you might figure it out."</em> </p>



<p>I, for one, am not ashamed to admit I haven't any clue about the game as much as anyone else. However, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"><strong>OD being so different from anything else</strong></a> is making me quite excited about what it will offer over traditional horror games, which deserve a major shake-up since they haven't really moved past the experience established by the Resident Evil series in any significant way.</p>



<p>As for when we will be able to understand more about OD, no one can say. With Hideo Kojima having released Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year (and with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pc-version-rated-esrb-published-by-sony/">a PC port</a></strong> likely getting announced during this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a>), it may be a while until the studio is ready to unveil a project that sounds more promising by the day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dell-laptop-used-to-cost-several-times-more-than-a-macbook-now-its-70-off-and-cheaper-than-one-2000651216</link>
            <guid>1376140</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell makes some of our favorite laptops out there, and if you’re a student or a work professional looking to grab a solid option without shelling out big bucks, Amazon is making that possible today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/">The 15-inch Dell Inspiron laptop, which typically sits at a not-so-friendly price of $2,400, is sitting at just $760 at the retailer, after a massive 68% discount – the lowest we have seen it drop to in 30 days.</a> You’re even getting a whole bunch of useful accessories, plus Windows 11 Pro pre-installed with your purchase, for absolutely nothing to sweeten the deal even more. We’re expecting it to be a popular pick this holiday season, so you might want to grab it before the stock starts thinning out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6277/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Memory, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>For under $800, you’re getting a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen that delivers vibrant, immersive, true-to-life visuals consistently, whether you’re catching up on the latest episode of your favorite show or creating a work presentation. The anti-glare panel helps you fight reflections in brighter settings, while the Dell ComfortView software actively reduces harmful blue light to minimize eye strain during those all-nighters. Touch support makes navigation a breeze by letting you use just your fingers to pinch, scroll, swipe, zoom, and more directly on the screen. It comes in handy when you’re working through longer documents and don’t want to rely on the trackpad or the mouse to scroll, or when sharing the laptop with a friend and both of you need to access the screen or work on something together. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back as it does in 2-in-1 laptops, so this doesn’t exactly give you that tablet-like functionality.</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard that features a lift hinge design to keep your wrists comfortable while typing. Video calls are made easy with the built-in HD webcam that offers noise reduction for a clearer picture, even in low-light settings.</p>



<p>For power, Dell offers an Intel 13th Gen Core i5-1334U processor with 10 cores, 12 threads, and intelligent boost speeds up to 4.6 GHz. It’s more than capable of handling all your everyday work and play tasks, plus some resource-intensive creative projects with ease. The massive <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM</strong> keeps the system running fast and smoothly, even when you’re trying to do multiple jobs at the same time. It’s excellent for demanding tasks like 4K video editing, running virtual machines, and even gaming with some apps running in the background.</p>
<p>Creatives and work professionals will also appreciate the<strong> 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD</strong> that not just offers sufficient space to house all your data, but also ensures better boot times, quick file access, and faster file transfers. Basically, the processor, memory, and SSD come together to ensure a lag-free, smooth experience during both regular and demanding days. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with the ultra-fast WiFi 6, Bluetooth, plus a wide range of ports like USB-C, USB 3.2, HDMI, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p><strong>The freebies include Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a mouse, a 7-in-1 cleaning kit, a 128GB UFD, and a docking station</strong>. That’s everything you need to get started with work or play right away. Just note that drops this massive are only around for a short period of time before the stock runs out or the deal expires. If you’ve been after a reliable laptop that doesn’t blow your budget, this is it.</p>

              <p>We knew Paramount Skydance wanted to buy Warner Bros. Discovery. We knew that they company was pretty pissed when Warner CEO <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">David Zaslav turned down the offer for $20 a share for the entire company</a>. And we knew that this became a fury when <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix and Warner agreed to a deal at $27.5 per share last week</a>. Now Paramount has reacted, and reacted&nbsp;<em>big</em>. The company has launched a hostile takeover bid, swooping in with a $30 per share offer, which works out to over $108 billion, $25 billion more than Netflix is paying.</p> <p>It was rumored earlier this year, while Zaslav was making it clear how much he wanted to sell Warner Discovery, that he was looking for $30 per share—a <em>massive</em> over-valuation of the company, but one he was looking to justify <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">by splitting the company</a>, severing off the “Discovery” parts and its loss-making cable networks, and loading that doomed company with all of Warner’s debts. Paramount’s opening bid at $20, however, was for the whole shebang. Netflix, however, outbid everyone by agreeing to $27.5 per share&nbsp;<em>after</em> the split, which is due to happen in the second half of 2026.</p>

 <p>Now, Paramount is going hard in its efforts to prevent this, increasing its previous offer by an enormous 50 percent, and again for the whole company and all its debt. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj69xzpzrdyo"><em>BBC</em> reports that</a> the company, backed by the billionaire Ellison family, called this bid a “superior alternative,” and clearly one designed to make shareholders revolt if Warner sticks with Netflix’s lower offer.</p>

 <p>This was never likely to go smoothly. If the Netflix deal goes through, it would make the streamer one of the most powerful players in Hollywood, and with the absorption of HBO Max an even more dominant force in streaming. Regulators were absolutely going to be scrutinizing this, and in a time when such bodies are now fully under the control of president Donald Trump’s mercurial (and self-interested) whims, that could go in any direction. Things were looking positive for Netflix in this regard, after its CEO Ted Sarandos had recently been to the Oval Office, likely to play on the president’s infantile habit of agreeing with the last confident voice that spoke to him. However, Sunday night Trump gave hints that he was going to be a wrench in the works, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-netflix-warner-bros-merger-problem-f3e317b61899d34ce507ba38af4a2934">saying the deal “could be a problem.”</a></p>

 <p>It’s also worth noting that the recent Paramount and Skydance merger only took place after the company, er, “settled” a legal dispute with Trump <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/07/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-1236465383/">by giving him $16 million</a>.</p> <p>Paramount’s offer would work out to $108.4 billion for the whole company, including its cable networks, dwarfing Netflix’s post-debt removal offer of $83 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t worth close to either figure—optimistically valued at around $10 a share six months ago, and Paramount itself is only worth $11 billion in its own right. Larry Ellison, who backs the company, is said to be worth nearly $270 billion, so could certainly afford it, but it’d still be the most extraordinary outlay were there to be no external investors involved. As more details come to light from <em>Axios</em> reporter Sara Fischer, it seems that—inevitably—a lot of the money will come from wealth funds including Saudi Arabia’s, Qatar’s and the UAE’s, among others.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨🚨 WOW. Paramount's initial press statement didn't include a mention of sov wealth funds, but sep SEC filing said other outside financing partners include funds from Saudis, Qataris, Emirates as well as Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners (!)<br>Those funders, "have agreed to forgo… <a href="https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4">https://t.co/5kkhRQWHx4</a></p> <p>— Sara Fischer (@sarafischer) <a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1998042711698378973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>‘ Lauren Hirsch further details the figures, stating that $24 billion of the total will be sourced this way, with a further billion from Tencent, and then a bunch from RedBird Capital Partners and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners. Kushner’s involvement could explain Trump’s intervention over the weekend.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Paramount’s bid for WBD is backed in part by <br>– $24bn from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds <br>– $1bn from China’s Tencent<br>– Jared Kushner’s private equity firm <a href="https://t.co/Kdt94WevPc">pic.twitter.com/Kdt94WevPc</a></p> <p>— Lauren Hirsch (@LaurenSHirsch) <a href="https://twitter.com/LaurenSHirsch/status/1998050914674811068?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p>So, there we are, more excitement in the world of billionaires buying up everything to feed us their homogenized sludge.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 12/08/2025, 11:17 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post to add details about Paramount’s potential investors in the deal.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Saros rating has appeared in Taiwan for the title’s standard and deluxe editions, suggesting pre-orders are imminent. </p>



<p>Housemarque’s Saros is one of the most anticipated titles of 2026 and also the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-is-the-next-game-from-housemarque/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next PlayStation exclusive</a> from the studio after Returnal. We have already seen some gameplay and have a release date for Saros as well; all players are waiting for now is for pre-orders to open. </p>







<h2 id="h-saros-rating-appears-in-taiwan">Saros Rating Appears in Taiwan</h2>



<p>Spotted by Gematsu on <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1997915897218961521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Saros’s standard and digital deluxe editions have been rated in Taiwan. Both versions have been rated ‘PG-15’ and contain violence and shooting according to the rating. Many players think that with the game’s rating surfacing now, a pre-order announcement could arrive soon; however, there is no official word from the developers. Interestingly, the rating has appeared very close to The Game Awards 2025, so could we expect an announcement there? Also, could Saros be the game behind the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-mystery-statue-new-mexico-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mysterious statue</a>?</p>



<p>For those unaware, Saros is an upcoming sci-fi adventure that has players taking on the role of Arjun Devraj, a Soltari enforcer who will stop at nothing to pursue answers on the shape-shifting world of Carcosa. The title features a constantly evolving world, and you will need to find permanent resources to ensure it yields for you. It also features a high-tech arsenal of weapons, which has players dodging, shielding, and parrying enemy attacks in a “fluid, flow-state-inducing dance.”</p>







<p>In other news, check out Saros’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/saros-gameplay-release-trailer-state-of-play-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a>, revealed during September’s State of Play event.

<p>Last week, Netflix revealed an $82.7 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery and carve out a monumental corner of the media streaming empire. Now, Paramount has clapped back with a hostile bid, slamming Netflix and claiming that it had offered an ‘inferior proposal’ for WBD.</p>



<p>Paramount’s representatives have promised a tender offer of $30 per share, compared to Netflix’s $27.75 offer. It’s also a bid to avoid splitting up Warner Bros. Discovery, which is what the Netflix acquisition would do. If Paramount is successful, it’ll acquire WBD in its entirety.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-paramount-or-netflix-buy-warner-bros-discovery">Will Paramount or Netflix Buy Warner Bros. Discovery?</h2>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/paramount-launches-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-1236444601/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, it was confirmed that Paramount had filed a hostile proposal in the wake of Netflix’s revelation in the WBD arena. In a statement, David Ellison, the CEO of Paramount, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>WBD shareholders deserve an opportunity to consider our superior all-cash offer for their shares in the entire company.</p>



<p>Our public offer, which is on the same terms we provided to the Warner Bros. Discovery Board of Directors in private, provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion. We believe the WBD Board of Directors is pursuing an inferior proposal which exposes shareholders to a mix of cash and stock, an uncertain future trading value of the Global Networks linear cable business and a challenging regulatory approval process. </p>



<p>We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Hollywood Reporter anticipates a lengthy process to follow, with Paramount and Netflix lobbying and counter-lobbying for the acquisition rights of Warner Bros. Discovery. </p>



<p>In a strange twist, it was later revealed that Paramount published a website dubbed ‘StrongerHollywood’, aimed at rubbing Netflix the wrong way and proving that Paramount’s offer is much more worthwhile for the wider industry.</p>



<p>Whichever media titan is successful, they’ll gain ownership of Warner Bros.’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-studio-affected-by-warner-bros-netflix-merger/">gaming studios</a>, including the likes of Avalanche, NetherRealm, Rocksteady, and TT Games, as well as the WB Games branches.</p>

<p>A fascinating interview with Assassin’s Creed game director Simon Lemay-Comtois has revealed that the team is eager to learn from past mistakes and oversights for future Assassin’s Creed games, such as a lack of parkour focus.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-x-attack-on-titan-crossover-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> was a financial and critical success. It may not go down as peak AC, but it’s a solid return to form. Shadows, in particular, and its post-launch content are looking to bring back a classic gameplay tradition, and have spoken about the use of dual-player mechanics in additional releases down the line.</p>







<h2 id="h-future-assassin-s-creed-games-will-learn-from-mistakes">Future Assassin’s Creed Games Will Learn From Mistakes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not the end of two-player narratives. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>An Insider Gaming exclusive revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further details on the Assassin’s Creed Roadmap and what games to expect</a>. There is clearly a long road ahead for the franchise, and Shadows was the latest mainline release.</p>







<p>Shadows game director Simon Lemay-Comtois told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/we-are-hard-to-beat-9-months-since-assassins-creed-shadows-its-associate-director-looks-back-on-what-makes-this-rpg-the-best-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> that the current release and future AC games should focus on one gameplay mechanic that’s been missing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Pay more attention to parkour in future games as its own pillar. We’re trying to rectify that in post-launch with Shadows and push that narrative internally to say, parkour matters. Let’s really push parkour forward.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Old-school AC fans will remember scaling towns and cities across Italy, whereas recent games have placed less emphasis on verticality in favor of grander open-world design and combat.</p>



<p>There’s still an inherent desire for the basics of Assassin’s Creed roots. Speaking of which, another newer addition (opposing convention) in the last few years has been the incorporation of dual-player stories.</p>



<p>Lemay-Comtois has indicated that the system won’t be going away if it makes sense for the project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Dual protagonists can be divisive along very strange lines, right? It’s not just a ‘well, I prefer a war, therefore I prefer Yasuke.’ Some people just don’t like one character over the other, and they don’t like to spend time with one. It was true with Evie and Jacob, but with Naoe and Yasuke it’s more divisive. And we knew this. We knew going into it, but I think it can split our fan base a little too.</p>



<p>I think the learning for us is that, yes, we could do more dual-protagonist games in the future –&nbsp;<em>if&nbsp;</em>we have a good reason to do it narratively and for the setting.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We know that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a> won’t be using two-player mechanics, and parkour will be very much part of its DNA.

                <p>If you saw the Shenmue 4 trailer that went viral recently and were hoping it was leading to an announcement, then you're going to be disappointed. Ys Net, the studio founded by Shenmue creator Yu Suzuki, has issued a statement condemning the trailer as a fake while also hinting that it may take legal action against the trailer's creator.</p><p>In a post on social media, Ys Net said the fake Shenmue 4 trailer "uses our company logo without permission, falsely giving the impression that is an official Shenmue 4 related video produced by us." The statement adds that there have been no official Shenmue 4 materials released, and that the studio is "currently working with relevant parties and preparing appropriate measures, including potential legal action" against the creator of the trailer.</p><p>The original Shenmue was released in 1999 on Sega Dreamcast, and it cast players as a young man, Ryo Hazuki, as he sought to avenge his father's death. The game had innovative takes on open-world gameplay and quicktime events that proved to be very influential in the video game industry. Shenmue 2 followed in 2001, but the franchise went on hiatus due to low sales.</p><p>Following Suzuki's departure from Sega, Shenmue 3 was successfully crowdfunded and released in 2019. Earlier this year, Inin Games and Suzuki announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shenmue-3-enhanced-announced-and-coming-to-xbox-and-nintendo-consoles-for-the-first-time/1100-6534028/" data-ref-id="1100-6534028">Shenmue 3 Enhanced</a> will be coming to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo consoles. That version of the game will feature numerous visual upgrades including 4K texture uplift for the environments and characters. It will also feature increased density of NPC characters in the streets to make the game world feel more alive.</p><p>Last year, a group of dedicated Shenmue fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fans-campaign-for-shenmue-4-with-times-square-ad-in-new-york/1100-6523961/" data-ref-id="1100-6523961">launched a campaign for Shenmue 4</a> by purchasing a Times Square ad in New York. It remains to be seen if that campaign will ultimately lead to the franchise getting a new sequel.</p>

In early 2023, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-space-remake-review-hits-the-marker/1900-6418021/">remake of Dead Space</a> was released, making people speculate about a new sequel or future remakes.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete DEAD SPACE Timeline Explained!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The report adds that the same sources hope the company might sell the Dead Space franchise after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/">EA sold itself for $55 billion to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/">deal could lead to $20 billion in debt</a>. As such, there's speculation EA could auction off Dead Space to help pay off that gigantic amount. But that raises questions: What company would want to acquire Dead Space? And would the sum be even a drop in the bucket against $20 billion?</p><p dir="ltr">In October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-is-making-calls-about-dead-space-4/1100-6535502/">Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield revealed that he's made calls</a> about the series. Schofield claims he can save EA up to $40 million on the idea he has for Dead Space. In addition, Schofield--whose background includes The Callisto Protocol and Call of Duty: WWII--believes EA could sell the franchise, too, as he believes it's a prime candidate for a TV show or movie.</p><p dir="ltr">The latest place that Dead Space popped up was with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-fans-slam-35-isaac-clarke-costume-in-eas-new-skate/1100-6535310/">a controversial bundle in the free-to-play Skate</a>. The roughly $35 add-on included a cardboard-style Isaac Clarke costume, a themed skateboard, and Necro Stomp emote.</p>
