		<p>A major new free update for Sker Ritual has been released by Wales Interactive, and it is called House of the Damned. The House of the Damned content leads with a new map, which this content drop is named after, but that’s not all. There’s new weapons and cosmetics to get your hands on too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sker Ritual - House of the Damned Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qW-SLp-qH6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One the new weapons in Sker Ritual will be The Rattler, which unlocks when the new standard weapon, Pistolet Stamped SMG, reaches Tier 3. The new special weapon is called The Corpse Grinder, and it is exclusive to the House of the Damned map, though some may get lucky in different maps to wield it. It’s essentially a shredder that cuts through flesh and bone, but it can only be accessed after completing the main EE mission. There will be 20 free new rewards added to the Sker Pass, on top of a premium DLC pack. This premium DLC pack will include two wolf masks, a black and white animated menu background, a new voiceline, and a premium emblem.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/20/sker-ritual-takes-the-world-of-sker-in-a-new-and-unexpected-direction/">Sker Ritual takes the world of Sker in a new and unexpected direction</a></h2>
<p>Sker Ritual is a spin off from Maid of Sker, swapping the atmospheric horror for a wave based first person shooter. Steve played Sker Ritual and said, <em>“Sker Ritual is a completely unexpected game in almost all regards and that includes how much fun it is. I was fully expecting to find the shift to wave-based shooting a betrayal of everything that made Maid of Sker distinctive and interesting, but the actual experience of Ritual is just simple shooting fun and I found myself enjoying it a lot.”</em></p>

The free update, which is set to arrive this winter, almost looks like an entirely different game, and will accordingly boast entirely new features like a romance system. Tenno fuckers stay winning, I guess.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,196251,196395" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During a lengthy presentation at the con, Digital Extremes finally provided an honest-to-goodness look at Arthur, <em>Warframe 1999’</em>s protagonist—voiced by gaming’s new golden boy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-best-clive-yuna-cloud-squall-16-rpg-1850627323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-best-clive-yuna-cloud-squall-16-rpg-1850627323"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a></span>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xvi-ffxvi-clive-thirsty-fan-fiction-ps5-1850588637">Ben Starr</a></span>—as well as his supporting team, the Hex. The Hex make up what <em>Warframe</em> calls a syndicate, but what we might call a faction. <em>1999</em>’s “syndicate” consists of Amir Beckett, Aoi Morohoshi, Quincy Isaacs, Leticia Garcia, and Eleanor Nightingale, who appears to be Arthur’s sister.</p><p>Onstage, the developers announced that they wanted players to be able to “get a little closer” to this syndicate than they have to others that have been added to the game. As a result, <em>Warframe 1999 </em>is packing an entire romance system, and any of the Hex, including Arthur, can be romanced. Yes, you read that right, you <em>can</em> romance Ben Starr in this game, and maybe even get a New Year’s kiss from whoever you go all in with.<br></p><p>In keeping with its 1999 setting (specifically New Year’s Eve of 1999, leading up to 2000/Y2K), the expansion will convey this romance system via instant messaging. Prior to the meaty action section of the demo, Arthur hops on a PC in the abandoned shopping mall that the Hex calls a base and boots up a chat client called KIM, which is followed by a horribly accurate dial-up sound.<br></p><p>Unsurprisingly, KIM looks eerily similar to AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) in its early days, and not only features pop-up chat windows but also usernames and notes that may as well be bios and statuses. When the demo player opened one of the Hex’s profiles, a gift icon could also be seen, indicating that the relationship system may take some cues from games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, where gift-giving can help endear you to other characters. Otherwise, KIM looks like a carbon copy of the messaging programs of yesteryear, and I swear to god, if I hear the sound of a door closing as someone logs off, I’m going to sue for emotional damages.<br></p><p>After years of AAA game developers and publishers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/palworld-makes-the-most-familiar-april-fools-joke-of-them-all-with-a-cursed-dating-sim-announcement-pals-take-off-their-clothes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/palworld-makes-the-most-familiar-april-fools-joke-of-them-all-with-a-cursed-dating-sim-announcement-pals-take-off-their-clothes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joking about adapting their established franchises</a></span> into visual novels and dating sims—often around April Fool’s—it’s refreshing to see a game as large as <em>Warframe </em>treat it seriously enough to add it as a feature in an expansion. Though it’s not yet clear how deep the system goes, the pops from the crowd at Tennocon seem to suggest that fans of the game, especially the most devout, really want a system like this. Digital Extremes could’ve thrown some of that <em>Warframe </em>money to outsource a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-hooked-on-you-dating-sim-visual-novel-1849378475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-hooked-on-you-dating-sim-visual-novel-1849378475">(bad) dating sim</a></span>, but it didn’t, and I think that’s worthy of being lauded.<br></p><p>The delightfully retro expansion to <em>Warframe </em>doesn’t stop there. Throughout the 22-minute demo, there are flashes of a boy band called On-lyne. The demo literally opens on an On-lyne commercial, and ads for them appear around town as Arthur rides a motorcycle around <em>1999</em>’s new environment. A banner for On-lyne even makes a brief appearance at the bottom of the KIM client. As it turns out, Digital Extremes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/league-legends-riot-games-worlds-23-interview-1851071665">borrowed a page from Riot Games</a></span> and saw fit to make an <em>actual </em>90s-style boy band and stick them in the game. There’s even a single that’s out right now, called “PARTY OF YOUR LIFETIME,” and you can actually stream it. No shit folks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">listen to this thing</a></span> and tell me it doesn’t sound like Backstreet Boys’ “Larger than Life,” or some cut track from <em>No Strings Attached</em>.</p><p>Though you don’t get to see them in their prime in <em>1999</em>, On-lyne appears to make a greater appearance in the current <em>Warframe </em>timeline. Once the demo cuts forward to a more current Tenno in their ship, they pick up the signal of a concert that seems to be happening smack in the middle of outer space. Once the player reaches the stadium, a host of pods hanging above release a handful of bodies onto the stage, revealing that the boy band have become Infested, one of <em>Warframe</em>’s enemy factions.</p><p>Unfortunately the action cuts short just shy of the actual encounter, but I’ve seen enough. I’ve never played <em>Warframe </em>before, and I absolutely do <em>not </em>need any more service games to play, but I want to romance the hot cyborgs, zip around town on a sick motorcycle, and dance with the pretty boys to catchy anthems. Deep down, you know you want that too.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>For years, gamers have taken to the internet to voice their concerns and opinions about certain titles and the developers that make them. It’s no big secret that an angry mob of gamers can bring down the sentiment of any title by launching a crusade against said game, making a vast effort to ‘review bomb’ a title based on <strong>anything</strong>. It could be an update they don’t like or a promise broken by a developer, but these days, the concept of the ‘review bomb’ is all too commonly seen.</p>



<p>Speaking candidly in a recent SEC filing, Take-Two Interactive, the parent of Rockstar Games and publisher of the Grand Theft Auto series, spoke about the harm that review bombing has on a company or a franchise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-defamation-campaigns">‘Defamation Campaigns’</h2>



<p>In the recent 10K annual filing, the leadership team at Take-Two Interactive highlighted review bombing as a very real threat, opting to be a little more professional and brand the practice as ‘defamation campaigns’.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen some developers buckle under the weight of review-bombing efforts – Helldivers 2 is probably one of the best examples of a game that was horrifically review-bombed this year. It’s not fair to say it doesn’t work, as in that particular scenario, changes that caused the negativity to rise in the community were reverted based on Helldivers 2 receiving hundreds of thousands of deliberately poor reviews.</p>



<p>Here’s what Take-Two’s leadership team wrote in the recent SEC filing that was <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/take-two-review-bombs-gta-nfl-2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shared by Game File’s Stephen Totilo</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, obtaining and maintaining high ratings of our games on the third-party platforms on which we operate are important as they help drive players to find our games. If the ratings of any of our games decline or if we receive significant negative reviews that result in a decrease in our ratings, our games could be more difficult for players to find or recommend. In addition, we may be subject to negative review campaigns or defamation campaigns intended to harm our ratings. Any such decline may lead to loss of players and revenues, additional advertising and marketing costs, and reputation harm.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the run-up to the release of Grand Theft Auto 6, this could be Take-Two Interactive preparing shareholders for a potential ‘defamation campaign’ aimed at Rockstar Games because of <strong>something </strong>in the game. Perhaps it’ll be ‘too woke’ for some players, or maybe it won’t have the right networking features or in-game mechanics for others. That’s all it takes at times – developers are forever walking on eggshells.</p>

<p>Skull and Bones is coming to Steam next month. </p>



<p>Ubisoft has announced that the ship-combat game is joining the platform on August 22. The release comes 6 months after the game’s initial release.</p>

<p>Skull and Bones is an online “naval action RPG” that sees players “rise to become the most fearsome pirate kingpin.” The game was based on the naval combat of Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag.</p>



<p>Skull and Bones first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-release-date-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched February 13, 2024</a>. The release came after years of development and multiple delays, including a full reboot. The game features cross-platform play, and is also available for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Spiritborn Class Impressions | Diablo 4 Vessel Of Hatred Preview</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">There are a few clues as to why this might be the case. Spiritborn gameplay footage shows XP bars post-level-50 without the Paragon Point unlock nodes seen in the current version of the game. Instead, it looks like players may earn Paragon Points each "level" after max, in a way that could be closer to how players earned Paragon points in Diablo 3. That being said, it's unlikely players will be able to earn "infinite" Paragon Points like in Diablo 3, as that would require Blizzard to completely rework Diablo 4's existing Paragon Board system.</p><p dir="ltr">Other evidence suggesting a new, lower max-level is an in-game tooltip that states the amount of armor players will need at level 60. In the current game, the tooltip references the amount of armor needed at level 100. The healin- potion upgrades from the Alchemist shown in the Spiritborn gameplay footage is another indication, with the new upgrades looking like they will cap out closer to level 60 instead of level 90 like in the current game.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the max level and Paragon changes looks to be a damage-number squish. It's something many players have requested given that damage values in Diablo 4 can currently be in the millions or even billions, making them extremely hard to read and requiring bosses to have health in the trillions in order to compensate.</p><p dir="ltr">Those requests look like they've been heard, as players have noticed from the Spiritborn gameplay that not only do the level 30 Spiritborn characters seem to be dealing far less damage in terms of raw numbers than is typically seen in the current game, but that items themselves--like a recently showcased Spiritborn Unique weapon--have much lower damage values than in the current version of Diablo 4. Gameplay likely won't be affected much by this change, as enemies will still die and take damage at the rate they currently do, but the numbers displayed themselves will likely be much lower (and easier to parse) come Vessel of Hatred.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that Blizzard has not officially detailed these changes as of yet, so all of the above has simply been pieced together by the community with available evidence. We will know more once Blizzard spills additional details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred closer to its October 8 release</a>.

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly exploring several different new tiers for Xbox Game Pass, including ad-based and cloud-exclusive ones. The previous Game Pass family plan might also be coming back too.</p><p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/whats-next-for-xbox-game-pass-tiers-and-return-of-family-plan" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is working towards a cloud-only version of Xbox Game Pass that is cheaper than an Ultimate tier subscription. This tier is focused on users who aren't interested in owning an Xbox console. Subscribers to this tier reportedly would also have the ability to "double dip" with their games, meaning that they can play via the cloud and be able to own them digitally.</p><p>As for an ad-based tier, Microsoft is reportedly only exploring that option rather than actively working towards it. This tier would be aimed at users who don't want to spend money on Game Pass at all, but still want access to its games.</p><p>Back in 2022, Xbox <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-friends-and-family-bundle-officially-confirmed-by-microsoft/1100-6507083/" data-ref-id="1100-6507083">announced</a> that it would be testing the Game Pass Friends &amp; Family Plan in regions like Ireland and Colombia, where up to four people could share one Game Pass Ultimate subscription.

The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-takes-aim-at-microsoft-for-xbox-game-pass-changes/1100-6525134/" data-ref-id="1100-6525134">FTC took notice of these changes</a> and called the new tier a "degraded product," as it claims that Microsoft is using its market power post-merger of Activision Blizzard to raise prices.</p>

		<p>Guilty Gear Strive’s season 4 has been announced and released today, adding four characters, two stages, and two new colour packs, with one being a seasonal pass bonus. It has been priced at £22.99. One of the characters takes the honour of being the first every crossover character in a Guilty Gear game, and that character is Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime based on Cyberpunk 2077. In addition, from Friday 26th July an open beta for a new mode called Team of 3 will be launched.</p>
<p><iframe title="GUILTY GEAR -STRIVE- Season Pass 4 Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G2_pb6LiRmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of the four characters coming as part of Guilty Gear Strive Season 4, Dizzy will be the first to arrive, and the only one of the four releasing in 2024. <strong>Venom </strong>will be the second character to be added, and will be coming in 2025, followed by Unika&nbsp;from the&nbsp;Guilty Gear Strive: Dual Rulers&nbsp;anime, and finally Lucy&nbsp;from&nbsp;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners.</p>
<p>The Team of 3 mode, as you may have guessed, pits two teams of 3 players against each other in online matches, with each player assigned the role of either Main or Assist. Assist players support the Main with different skills and strategies. The role of Main can be assigned to any player at any time. The beta of this mode will only last until July 29th. This is an open beta so anyone can play, even if they do not have a copy of Guilty Gear Strive.</p>

<p>In our Guilty Gear Strive review, Miguel wrote, “<em>Guilty Gear -Strive- excels in all the areas you’d expect it to – the music is sick, the characters look crazy, the fighting is fun, and May players deserve nothing. It’s an old dog that’s been taught new tricks, and all of those tricks are rad as hell. At the same time, it feels like it can be so much more. The story mode is clunky and the Online Mode can use some work, but I’m sure as post-launch support ramps up we’ll see stellar improvements to both those fronts.”</em></p>

            <p>
The internet was all in a flap last week after Microsoft promised to place <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-deadpool-bum-controller-as-competition-prize-for-one-lucky-recipient">Deadpool's pert posterior</a> into the hands of a lucky few by way of a new limited edition controller. But if red spandex doesn't do it for you, there's now a <em>second</em> superhero butt in town, courtesy of a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/22/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-wolverine-design/">bright yellow, Wolverine-themed</a> Xbox Wireless Controller.
</p>
<p>
Both controllers (as you've probably already guessed) have been created to promote Marvel's upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie, which arrives in cinemas across the world later this week. And to coincide with its release, there's a global sweepstake going on at the moment via Twitter/X for anyone wanting to get their hands on those superbuns.
</p>
<p>
Full <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/promotions/deadpool-and-wolverine-sweepstakes">rules</a> can be found on Microsoft's website, but the gist is you'll need to follow the <a href="https://x.com/Xbox">official Xbox account</a> then repost one of its designated promotional posts containing the hashtag #xboxcheekycontrollersweepstakes before the competition closes on 11th August.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Double_Controller_WV_16x9-372d7db385e6875b79af.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Microsoft is being pretty tight with its butts, and only one winner will walk away with Deadpool and Wolverine's plastic posteriors when the competition ends. On the plus side, that same winner also gets a (regrettably bum-free) Xbox Series X console inspired by Deadpool and Wolverine, plus a matching custom Xbox Series X stand.
</p>
<p>
Still, early word from one Deadpool controller recipient <a href="https://x.com/jacobkleinman/status/1814351005439402133">suggests</a> the butt, much like a real butt, is held on with magnets and has a tendency to drop off in moments of vigour - so entrants probably won't be missing out too much if they don't win.

In other bum-related Xbox news, Microsoft's Halo TV show has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-divisive-halo-tv-series-cancelled-after-two-seasons">cancelled after two season</a> by Paramount+, despite giving everyone a look at Pablo Schreiber's Master Cheeks back in its first year. If only it had got its own promotional butt controller, eh?

It featured gritty action set in a dirty and dangerous NYC. The game captured these vibes perfectly, even bringing back some original actors to voice their characters. Sadly, the Xbox 360 was released a few weeks later and overshadowed the already niche game from Rockstar. But over the last 20 years, the game has developed a cult following and is seen by many as one of Rockstar’s best creations. And according to a new report, we almost got a GBA port of this underappreciated brawler. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recently,<em> Time Extension</em> reported</a></span> that while talking to a former Rockstar Games developer, they learned about the existence of a <em>Warriors</em> GBA port, something that was previously undocumented. <em>The Warriors</em> did receive a PSP port, but sources told the outlet that Rockstar was originally planning to port the game to Nintendo’s popular handheld device using the same engine the company used for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/wLcHnDXTUSM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its well-received <em>Max Payne</em> GBA port</a></span>. </p><p>“We were going for four-player co-op using the link cable and stuff.

<p>Death Stranding both confused and amazed gamers worldwide when it was released exclusively on PlayStation 4 in 2019. It puts players in control of Sam Bridges, a delivery specialist in a bizarre, post-apocalyptic world haunted by ethereal, otherworldly beings. It’s enough to say it comes from the stunning mind of Hideo Kojima – that tells you all you need to know about the ambition and innovation of the story.</p>



<p>When it was released, many joked that Death Stranding was little more than a spooky walking sim, or more accurately, a delivery boy simulator. Well, thanks to a new mod that hit Nexus yesterday, you <strong>can finally </strong>play Death Stranding without many of the game’s threats, delivering your piles of packages without being plagued by BTs.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-remove-the-threat-remove-the-point">Remove The Threat, Remove The Point</h2>



<p>Death Stranding is nothing short of bizarre. The player uses a baby in a chamber that can sense BTs (‘Beached Things’) and other threats to avoid impending doom, and ‘Timefall’ regularly scours the land, causing things to age dramatically fast, eradicating the player’s constructs and eroding their cargo. </p>



<p>In this new mod that was released yesterday on Nexus – ‘Live Stranding’ – players can manipulate the game and remove almost every trace of Timefall and the BTs that come along with it. This means that gamers are left to explore a vast open world relatively undisturbed by enemy forces or troublesome weather. It removes much of the point of the game, but it’s great if you <strong>are </strong>looking for a delivery boy simulator.</p>



<p>Sadly, the mod that’s hosted <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/deathstranding/mods/51" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Nexus Mods</a> isn’t a cakewalk when it comes to installation. There are a few things you’ll need to do as prerequisites to installing the mod itself, and as it’s <strong>brand new</strong>, it’s bound to be buggy. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/22/24200536/windows-xp-ipad-pc-emulation-utm-se<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24198015/apple-utm-se-pc-os-emulator-for-ios">approved a new emulator app called UTM SE</a> that enables your iPhone or iPad (or Vision Pro!) to masquerade as PC hardware and run honest-to-goodness computer desktop operating systems. Some of you asked in the comments section of my last story how it runs — a fair question that I couldn’t answer at the time. But now that I’ve tried it a little, I have answers, and I can say this much: it’s better than I expected, but I wouldn’t count on it for too much.</p><p>That’s because it doesn’t use a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which translates software into code that your device understands before it’s executed. JIT compilers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137369/dolphinios-emulator-apple-app-store-jit">go against Apple’s software guidelines</a> for the App Store, so you’d have to jailbreak your phone to install a <a href="https://getutm.app/">version of UTM</a> that uses the technique. </p><p>UTM SE will be generally slow on an iPad for anything besides running old OSes on old hardware, but XP runs surprisingly well — and UTM offers <a href="https://docs.getutm.app/settings-qemu/settings-qemu/">plenty of documentation</a> for getting started.</p><p>I tried it out on my M1 iPad Pro, a device I’ve always <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/27/23847743/ipad-pro-oled-m3-13-inch-magic-keyboard-bigger-trackpad">wished could do more than it does</a>. Making a virtual machine on which to run Windows is especially easy if you use one of UTM’s <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">pre-built machines</a>, which you can download and tweak. <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-xp">I grabbed this one</a> and gave it more RAM and storage but otherwise used it the way it came. Then, I pointed it at a Windows XP .iso file from the IDE Drives option in that machine’s settings and booted it up. And waited. For so long.</p><p>It took two and a half hours for my iPad to crawl through installation. But at the end of it all, I was treated to the old “bliss” desktop background and the Windows XP startup sound (which I didn’t realize I’m nostalgic for). Things were slow after everything finished loading; new windows took a few seconds to open; nested Start menu items did, too. None of it was outrageous, though, and I genuinely think it’s faster than the Compaq machine we had when I was a teen. (Those old spinning disk hard drives really took a toll.)</p><div><figcaption><em>I should be able to make all operating systems look this bad.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: Windows XP / UTM SE</cite></p></div><p>Putting aside performance and nostalgia, using Windows XP on an iPad really highlights how much farther iPadOS has to go when it comes to multitasking. And despite some improvements to homescreen customization in iPadOS 18, it’s still far behind Windows XP when it comes to personalizing things. XP doesn’t mind at all if I want my title bar pink and the text inside neon green or different fonts for every button, menu, or window. The world is my terrible oyster! I miss ruining my computer; that was the dream. </p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">allowing emulators on iPhones and iPads</a> has made a big difference for my iPad Pro. I’ve always liked using my iPad but rarely <em>wanted</em> to; now, I don’t think I’ve ever picked it up more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare has revealed the voice cast for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which will feature four voice options for protagonist Rook.
</p>
<p>
Alex Jordan, perhaps <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-narrators-outtakes-are-gloriously-unhinged">best known for making the sex noises in Baldur's Gate 3</a>, is one of your Rook options. (He's also Mr Hands in Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can pick from Bryony Corrigan (as seen in Good Omens and The Goes Wrong Show), Erika Ishii (Valkyrie in Apex Legends, Ana Bray in Destiny 2) or Jeff Berg (Battlefield 1). BioWare notes that these actors provide "two options from US/North American personalities and two from the United Kingdom/EU".

<p>
Newcomers to the franchise voicing the game's companions include Ike Amadi (Mass Effect 3's Javik) as Grey Warden Davrin, Jee Young Han as Veil Jumpeer Bellara, True Blood's Jessica Clark as private detective Neve, Star Trek Picard's Jin Maley as dragon hunter Taash, Zach Mendez as assassin Lucanis, Nick Boraine as necromancer Emmrich and Critical Role star Matthew Mercer as his skeletal assistant Manfred. 
</p>
<p>
Returning cast members include Ali Hillis as Scout Harding, Gareth David-Lloyd as Solas, and Brian Bloom as Varric - though these were all pretty obvious from the game's recent trailers. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Varric, we're all a little worried for our favourite dwarven storyteller after the most recent Dragon Age: The Veilguard trailer. And as Bertie discovered, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-dragon-age-veilguard-does-kill-varric-it-will-be-long-overdue">BioWare has considered killing off Varric multiple times in the past</a>...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-new-heroic-companions-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new and returning companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard has been revealed. Not only have the voices of some of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-about-finding-a-family-and-saving-the-world-with-them-says-bioware/">new&nbsp;and returning characters</a> been revealed, but those attending San Diego Comic-Con will also have the chance to go to multiple panels where they speak about the development process. Those who attend can also get a free pin if you prove you are on the Discord server while stocks last. There are two signing events: one where you can meet the dev team and the other where you can meet the voice-over cast.</p>
<p>To keep players on their toes and ensure that the gameplay is as fresh and customizable as possible, <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/voices-of-the-veilguard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rook is returning to the game</a> with four voice options. Two of these voices are from North America, and the other two are from the UK. These voices include Bryony Corrigan, Alex Jordan, Erika Ishii, and Jeff Berg.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard has seven companions, with only one appearing in the previous games. The cast of voices for the new companions is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ali Hillis as Harding</li>
<li>Ike Amadi as Davrin</li>
<li>Jee Young Han as Bellara</li>
<li>Jessica Clark as Neve</li>
<li>Jim Maley as Taash</li>
<li>Nick Boraine as Emmrich</li>
<li>Matthew Mercer as Manfred, Emmrich's assistant</li>
<li>Zach Mendez as Lucanis</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the voice actors for Solas and Varric were revealed.</p>
<p>Gareth David-Lloyd is reprising his role as Solas in Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and Brian Bloom is reprising his role as Varric.</p>
<p>For those who aren't available to attend SDCC to learn all of Dragon Age's new and exciting news, the panel will be uploaded at a later date so that everyone has the equal opportunity to hear the same news and commentary from the voice panel. The panel features Ali Hillis, Jessica Clark, Zach Mendez, and Nick Boraine, all of whom are prepared to answer questions and talk about their experiences in the voice-over booth.</p>
<p>The dev team assured people in a blog post that more character reveals will come, and fans will see familiar faces return to Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Still, they are not quite prepared to reveal those characters as they want to avoid releasing story spoilers.</p>
<p>Luckily, players won't have long to wait until the full release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which is estimated to be in Fall 2024.</p>

<p>College Football 25 had its global release on Friday, and EA Sports has posted a long list of notes of what the team is working on for updates and patches to the game. </p>



<p>These future notes include general audio, Dynasty Mode, Team Builder, and more.  General gameplay notes, Road to Glory, etc. weren’t mentioned. However, it could be expected that those will also see changes when the first title update to College Football 25 drops.</p>



<p>Aside from the future update notes, the developers also clarified some things surrounding Dynasty Mode itself. Specifically, they detailed how various factories can impact how your Dynasty plays out compared to someone elses.</p>



<p>“There are many factors at play in Dynasty that can create ripple effects: Injuries, players going pro early, transfers, strong or weak recruiting classes, upsets, and more!” the said. “The beauty of the mode is that two different users can begin playing Dynasty as the same school, but over multiple years, their College Football 25 worlds can develop notable differences. </p>



<p>“Dynasty is intentionally designed in a way where the backend systems will create organic and dynamic situations that lead to branching stories. We didn’t want to have a rigid system that leads to all users experiencing the same situations and stories 5, 10, or 15 years in…”</p>



<p>If you want to see the full future update notes, you can read them below <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/General-Discussion/College-Football-25-Launch-Weekend-Notes-Updates/m-p/13889950/thread-id/2446?utm_campaign=cf25_hd_ww_ic_ic_twt_launch-weekend-updates&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=80871&amp;ts=1721665683390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via EA Sports</a>.</p>







<h3 id="h-audio">Audio</h3>



<ul>
<li>Incorrect commentary when playing as the first game of the season in Dynasty at Utah</li>



<li>Florida State’s War Chant and Tennessee’s “Rocky Top” are not audible when playing only on Xbox Series S</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-logos">Logos</h3>



<ul>
<li>The following teams/conferences have incorrect logos: Stanford, UMass, Western Michigan, Jacksonville State, FIU, New Mexico, SEC, Conference USA, and the Sun Belt</li>



<li>UTEP and Wyoming display incorrect athletic branding on their equipment in Dynasty</li>



<li>Visual issue with conference patches when changing a small subset of teams Conference in Dynasty&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-dynasty">Dynasty</h3>



<ul>
<li>Super Sim Logic Tuning: The team is looking into tuning of the Super Sim Logic, including FCS schools upsetting too many Power 5 schools
<ul>
<li>Note: As we continue internal testing on the tuning of Super Sim Logic, Top 25 Polls &amp; the College Football Playoff seedings will also see an improvement.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue when adding additional teams to the PAC-12 conference when using custom conferences does not generate a new conference schedule as intended.
<ul>
<li>Workaround: After adding teams to the PAC-12, open the Conference Rules and set Divisions to ON. Users will see they can now set the number of conference games by toggling back and forth. Users can then disable divisions and edit other settings as desired.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue with modified conference rules not saving
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Users can re-enter the Conference Rules screen to ensure their settings were saved and are valid. If they did not save, then the rules are not valid with their current setup.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Occasionally, when a recruit reaches their Top 5 stage, it will not display the recruit is “Ready for a Visit” despite meeting the requirements.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Recruiting Tuning: The team has planned additional tuning to recruiting logic.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Small chance of a freeze when simulating individual plays quickly after exiting “Super Sim”
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Wait a couple seconds in between simulating the individual plays before exiting Super Sim.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Issue with the Practice Tile not initially appearing in the “Team” tab
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Exit the mode and then re-enter.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Current maximum cap of 20 created coaches instead of the intended 32 created coaches
<ul>
<li>Note: The team is targeting Tuesday for an issue fix that limits Dynasty’s to 20 created coaches. A current work around is using existing coaches in the remaining spots to reach 32.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Player jersey numbers and/or OVRs changing when editing certain players gear.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-team-builder">Team Builder</h3>



<ul>
<li>When using a Team Builder team in Play Now, cleats are defaulted to Adidas regardless of selected brand apparel.
<ul>
<li>Note: This does not impact Team Builder teams used in Dynasty</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Second custom image layer not appearing on the field
<ul>
<li>Workaround: Add a second layer, then select a generic image, and then re-select your custom image.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals - 'Rivals’ First Stand' | Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_platforms"><strong>Marvel Rivals beta platforms</strong></h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test is being held on Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5. There is cross-platform matchmaking, but in the competitive mode, cross-play between console and PC is blocked. Additionally, NetEase said because the Xbox Series S console has "memory limitations," features like Past Lives, MVP animations, and Highlights are disabled to prevent memory-related issues. NetEase said it continues to optimize for Xbox Series S, and that for the full launch, these features will be live.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_test_times">Marvel Rivals beta test times</h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test begins July 23 and ends August 5. Here are the specific times:</p><p><strong>Begins: </strong></p><ul><li>July 23: 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET</li></ul><p><strong>Ends:</strong></p><ul><li>August 5: 12 AM PT / 3 AM ET</li></ul><h2 id="How_to_get_into_the_Marvel_Rivals_beta_test"><strong>How to get into the Marvel Rivals beta test</strong></h2><p>PC players can visit the Marvel Rivals Steam page and select "Request Access" under "Join Marvel Rivals Playtest" to sign up for a chance to get in.</p><p>On console, you'll need to have signed up through a questionnaire. However, the sign-up period on console has ended. Those who were accepted into the beta will receive an email to get started.</p><p>Another way to get into the Marvel Rivals beta test is to have friends. Anyone in the beta will get extra activation codes they can share upon completion of certain in-game milestones. Users can also get in <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/marvel-rivals" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by securing a Twitch Drop</a>. These will be available between July 25-July 28. Beyond these means, you can follow the Marvel Rivals accounts on social media to look for a chance to grab a code.</p><p>Anyone who reached level 10 during the previous Marvel Rivals alpha test, meanwhile, gets in to the beta test automatically on Steam. The game client will simply receive an update taking it from alpha to beta. This program is not available on console.</p><p>NetEase also clarified that, although this is a closed test, participants are free to share videos of their gameplay and discuss their experience with the game on social media.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_characters__maps__and_modes"><strong>Marvel Rivals beta characters, maps, and modes</strong></h2><p>The Marvel Rivals beta test includes access to a range of characters, maps, and modes--you can see all of the beta content below.</p><p><strong>Characters: </strong></p><ul><li>Adam Warlock</li><li>Black Panther</li><li>Doctor Strange</li><li>Groot</li><li>Hela</li><li>Hulk</li><li>Iron Man</li><li>Loki</li><li>Luna Snow</li><li>Magik</li><li>Magneto</li><li>Mantis</li><li>Namor</li><li>Peni Parker</li><li>Punisher</li><li>Rocket Raccoon</li><li>Star-Lord</li><li>Storm</li><li>Scarlet Witch</li><li>Spider-Man</li><li>Venom</li></ul><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul><li>Yggsgard</li><li>Yggdrasill Path</li><li>Yggsgard: Royal Palace</li><li>Tokyo 2099: Shin-Shibuya</li><li>Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands</li></ul><p><strong>Modes: </strong></p><ul><li>Convoy</li><li>Domination</li><li>Convergence</li></ul><p>This is what NetEase is calling a "data deletion test," and that means progress from the beta will not carry forward to the full game when it releases. Additionally, NetEase said it will erase all account information after the test period.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_beta_tournaments">Marvel Rivals beta tournaments</h2><p>As part of the Marvel Rivals beta, there will be four tournaments for players to test their mettle. These are called "War of The Realms." Registration runs July 25-30, while the tournaments themselves will be held July 30-August 4. There are region-specific tournaments on PC for North America, Europe, and Asia. Players can join whatever region they want, but NetEase warned that users who join a region not close to where they actually live may see "high-latency matches." There is also a console tournament open to everyone across the world.</p><h2 id="Marvel_Rivals_PC_specs"><strong>Marvel Rivals PC specs</strong></h2><p>NetEase has published the minimum and recommended PC specs for the beta, which you can see below. Note that NetEase will continue to optimize ahead of launch, so the beta requirements may not match up with the final requirements when the game is ready. The game supports controllers on PC during the beta, while console users can only use controller--keyboard and mouse on console is not supported.</p><p><strong>RECOMMENDED</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-10400 or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li><li>Memory: 16 GB</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 (Super) or AMD RX 5700-XT</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Network: Broadband Internet connection</li><li>Storage: 70 GB available space</li></ul><p><strong>MINIMUM:</strong></p><ul><li>OS: Windows 10 64-bit</li><li>Processor: Intel Core i5-6600K or AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li><li>Memory: 12 GB</li><li>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580</li><li>DirectX: Version 12</li><li>Network: Broadband Internet connection</li><li>Storage: 70 GB available space</li></ul><p>For more on the Marvel Rivals beta, you can <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/news/official/20240719/40185_1168280.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">consult the FAQ.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-creator-no-paid-dlc-ever<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>creator Eric Barone, otherwise known as ConcernedApe, has made a very strong pledge regarding the inclusion of paid updates or DLC in his games.</p>
<p>Speaking on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today, Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815272546130161821" rel="noopener" target="_blank">provided an update</a> regarding the work he's doing on&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley</em>, promising that "the ports and next PC update are still in progress" and that he'll announce when "there is any meaningful news".</p>
<p>A user <a href="https://x.com/Hikuzu56/status/1815276225474285830" rel="noopener" target="_blank">responded to Barone</a> by saying that as long as everything added to the game is "completely free", people won't complain about waiting, which is when Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1815278461269000401" rel="noopener" target="_blank">made his solemn pledge</a>: that he will "never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=n5I2IhI- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stardew-valley-dlc-never-paid-farm.jpg?itok=K_CjnEsG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never pay a cent for&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>DLC, on ConcernedApe's "family name".</figcaption></figure><p>Barone says he swears "on the honor of [his] family name" that he'll never make players pay for an update or a DLC pack, and he doesn't specify that he means&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>alone, so that presumably applies to all of his games.</p>
<p>He says that fellow X users should "screencap this and shame [him]" if he ever goes back on his word, so feel free to do that, although I'm sure that Barone is sincere, so you probably won't need to use it as leverage.</p>
<p>This does mean, however, that when (or perhaps that should be "if")&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/haunted-chocolatier-is-next-game-from-stardew-valley-developer-concernedape">Haunted Chocolatier</a>&nbsp;</em>ever sees the light of day, you won't have to pay anything for its DLC either. Chalk that up as a win for indie development, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=Dh-FHofz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/haunted-chocolatier-concernedape.jpg?itok=bwukYe8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Haunted Chocolatier&nbsp;</em>is still in the works, or at least I assume so.</figcaption></figure><p>For now, though, it looks like Barone is focused on bringing the&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stardew-valley-16-update-released-with-intimidatingly-large-patch-notes-breaking">1.6 update</a> to consoles and mobile devices. Porting the update to these platforms requires "extra work" over and above what the PC version needs, according to Barone.</p>
<p>We may be a ways away from&nbsp;<em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>, but for now, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>on...well, <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pretty much everything</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

She’ll be released as part of the season 4 pass sometime in 2025. The season 4 pass will also include returning <em>Guilty Gear</em> characters Queen Dizzy, Venom, and new character, Unika.</p></div><div><p>The Warner Bros. platform fighter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-review-smash-bros-batman-1851572599"><em>MultiVersus</em></a></span>, is getting two new fighters in season 2. First up is cartoon legend, Samurai Jack, who will join the roster when season 2 launches on July 23. Beetlejuice will also become a playable fighter later in the season, and while no specific date was given, you can bet it’ll probably be around the September 6 release of movie sequel <em>Beetlejuice Beetlejuice</em>.</p></div><div><p>Despite being “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCF4_xqmxo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCF4_xqmxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">completely dead</a></span>” after getting thrown into a volcano in <em>Tekken 7</em>, Heihachi Mishima will be a new fighter in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-katsuhiro-harada-twitter-anna-new-characters-1851575150"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>. The reveal trailer really played up the return, even flashing through the character’s history throughout the series. I’m sure confused fans will be eager to learn what explanation the game has for this miraculous return. Heihachi will release as part of the first season pass for <em>Tekken 8</em>, alongside other returning fighters Lidia Sobieska and Eddy Gordo. There is currently no release date for the first season.</p></div><div><p>The <em>League of Legends</em> developer’s fighting game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a></span>, had a substantial presence at this year’s Evo.

From this we learned that the launch version of <em>2XKO</em> will be pretty lean, with more game modes being added post-launch. Monetization will be a big part of the free-to-play title, but the team says all characters on the roster will be possible to acquire without spending money. On the topic of characters, it was confirmed at Evo that Katarina will not be part of the launch roster, and that fan-favorite Jinx will be part of the game, but the team wants to take more time before showing her off to the public.</p></div><div><p>The 2003 entry in the crossover fighting series is back. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-svc-chaos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/snk-vs-capcom-svc-chaos"><em>SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos</em></a></span><em> </em>was announced during the tournament as a shadow release, now available on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442380/SNK_VS_CAPCOM_SVC_CHAOS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span>. The game will also be coming to Nintendo Switch and PS4 on July 22. <em>SVC Chaos</em> brings together a massive roster of fighters from games like <em>Mega Man</em>, <em>Street Fighter</em>, <em>Darkstalkers</em>, and others.

This coincides with a big 1.50 update that will include new story episodes, a new stage, and a new mode called Grand Bruise about which the trailer didn’t go into detail. She’ll join a roster that is now over 30 fighters long, and includes <em>NieR: Automata</em>’s 2B.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has granted permission to call for an immediate strike against game studios and publishers over protections against AI-generated content.</p>



<p>In a post on the <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-national-board-meets-videoconference-national-board-unanimously-gives-chief-negotiator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">union’s official website on Saturday</a>, the union’s Chief Negotiator and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland now has the power to call for a strike at any point should studios not work with them on the aforementioned protections.</p>



<p>This news comes nearly a year after a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-gaming-industry-strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike was first authorized</a> over these concerns.</p>



<p>“If called, the strike shall be over all covered services under the Interactive Media Agreement and all SAG-AFTRA members will cease rendering all services and performing all work covered by the IMA,” the union said.</p>



<p>They continued by saying that parties remain in negotiations. However, they are still “far apart” on conditions covering AI protections.</p>



<p>“Our resolve is unwavering and should not be tested,” Crabtree-Ireland said. “Our membership voted more than 98% yes to authorize a strike of this contract should the employers not come to the table with a deal that includes our critical provisions — especially in A.I. </p>



<p>“We are steadfast in our commitment to our membership who work this contract and whose extraordinary performances are the heart and soul of the world’s most popular video games. Time is running out for the companies to make a deal.”</p>



<p>As far as dealing with the rise of AI in video game creation, Crabtree-Ireland said that the union remains determined to work with “ethical AI companies”. </p>
