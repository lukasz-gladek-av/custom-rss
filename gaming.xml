            <p>The first Destiny 2 clan to complete The Final Shape's raid has unlocked a final mission for all Guardians to close out the sci-fi shooter's expansive story.</p>
<p>It took the Parabellum clan 19 hours to work their way through Salvation’s Edge – and what a triumph it was – but the bigger surprise was that as the cut-scenes played out the end of Destiny's epic decade, a hitherto secret mission became available to all players, regardless of whether or not they'd gotten through the raid themselves.</p>

<p>The mission – called Excision – accommodates 12 players in a stunning crescendo that's sure to squeeze even the steeliest Guardian heart.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>UPDATE: We've seen a dramatic decrease in BAT errors and believe that has been resolved.</p><p>As we continue investigating the loading issue, we recommend that players launch into the Narrative version of Excision with no more than 6 total fireteam members for the full experience. <a href="https://t.co/jXlw6aa3PZ">https://t.co/jXlw6aa3PZ</a></p></div>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1799542873765122210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>News of the secret mission spread quickly, though, triggering a number of "BAT" errors related to "players in fireteams being unable to view all cutscenes upon completion of the Excision activity". Consequently, Bungie advised players to participate in the activity solo, and suggested that anyone who missed the cutscenes could rewatch them in the narrative version of Excision.</p>
<p>Now it seems the issues have "been resolved", but despite it being a 12-member mission, Bungie is still recommending that "players launch into the Narrative version of Excision with no more than 6 total fireteam members for the full experience".</p>
<p>But that's not all. Bungie also confirmed that tomorrow, 10th June at 4pm UK time (8am PT), the team will present a livestream detailing "the next year of Destiny 2".</p>
<p>While some are very excited that this presentation may provide further details about the next Destiny adventure, the key part of that message is that it pertains to Destiny <strong>2</strong>, so it's unlikely we'll learn much about Destiny 3. Who knows, though – Bungie always likes to surprise us!</p> <div>

<p>Of course, some players didn't have to wait for the formal release date<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">; the DLC leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 shortly before its official launch earlier this week.</p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Among the Stars</em> stole my heart the second its trailer aired during Summer Game Fest 2024. With an art style inspired by Studio Ghibli and a story that reflects the struggles of indigenous people, this 2-D action-adventure game has earned a spot on my “games I want to play” list.</p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Developed by Split Studio, <em>Among the Stars</em> tells the story of Ari and Tai, two sisters separated after armed land developers lay siege to their home in Brazil’s Pantanal region. With Ari lost in a jungle inhabited by nature spirits and Tai stranded deep in territory occupied by the murderous invaders, the sisters embark on a perilous journey to reunite and liberate their homeland before it’s too late.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Among The Stars - Official Teaser Trailer | Latin American Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOg28sU4Od0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p><figcaption>From GameTrailers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">The first thing that stands out about <em>Among the Stars</em> is its gorgeous art direction. <a href="https://splitstudio.tv/en/">Split Studios</a> is an animation company that has cut its teeth on several prominent Cartoon Network and Comedy Central shows, and they’re pouring all of their talent into this project. <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ colorful backgrounds and expressive character designs take a lot of inspiration from anime, particularly the legendary film library of Studio Ghibli.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">While <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ trailer primarily features what I assume are clips taken from in-game cinematics, the gameplay featured <a href="https://www.splitstudio.games/amongthestars">on the game’s official website</a> proves that the in-game animation will be just as stunningly vibrant as those featured in the cutscenes. Those short snippets of gameplay footage also made it clear that the game will be as fun to play as it is beautiful to behold.</p>
 <h2 id="h-gameplay-as-intriguing-as-its-visuals" data-injectable="false">Gameplay as intriguing as its visuals</h2> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">If what I’ve seen is true, <em>Among the Stars </em>will feature two radically different gameplay styles. When the player controls Ari, the gameplay will be very similar to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-child-of-light/">2-D RPGs like <em>Child of Light</em></a>, complete with a turn-based battle system. In contrast, Tai’s gameplay revolves around stealth, with the player’s goal being to sneak around heavily patrolled environments to sabotage the land developers’ machinery. A shared focus on puzzle-solving will tie together both gameplay styles.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><em>Among the Stars</em>’&nbsp;visuals and gameplay have already wowed me, but the game’s story is what has me by the neck. There’s a fantastical undertone to <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ narrative, rooted in the rich, underrepresented world of native Brazilian folklore. Unfortunately, the inciting incident that tears Ari and Tai’s peaceful lives apart reflects a bleaker reality that countless Brazilians face daily.</p>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">“Land grabbing,” a practice in which farmers, miners, and loggers violently seize land owned by indigenous people, is a long-standing tradition in Brazil, and many native Brazilian communities <a href="https://ijnet.org/en/story/how-we-uncovered-largest-land-grab-brazilian-amazon">are still being persecuted for their land today</a>. While <em>Among the Stars</em> isn’t based on an actual event (as far as I know), its story draws inspiration from one of the darkest aspects of Brazilian history and contemporary life.</p>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false"><em>Among the Stars </em>has yet to be given an official release date, but it will be available on the Switch, Playstation, Xbox, and PC through Steam.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viper Commandos Warbond</a> announcement for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, developer Arrowhead Game Studios explained that future Warbonds would be more focused on a theme. Of course, what this community heard is that a medieval knight Warbond would be amazing, and now it’s all it can talk about. </p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">I have to say, I was also pretty thrilled when the developer confirmed it would be tightening the theme of Warbonds. all the ones leading up to Viper Commandos have felt like they’ve had armor that matches the theme, but everything else was kind of thrown into them randomly from whatever new items were working. I can’t even find a fault with the idea of a medieval knight Warbond because the suggestions fans have made for items are fantastic. </p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-fans-have-already-figured-out-what-you-should-get-in-a-medieval-knight-warbond" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> fans have already figured out what you should get in a medieval knight Warbond</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">Fans on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dazls0/who_would_be_down_for_a_knight_based_warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been discussing</a> the potential for a medieval knight-based Warbond in great detail. It has suggestions for armor parts, weapons, and even some themed new items that could be added to the game, just like how Viper Commandos adds the Throwing Knife. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">User JamesMcEdwards’ suggestion, “Like the Blood Dragon armour from <em>Mass Effect</em>?” is genius. This is an exclusive set of armor for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-mass-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></em> you could get as DLC for having the right bonus pack for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-age-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon: Age Origins</a></em>. Based on the image below, I think you’ll agree it fits right into the <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via JamesMcEdwards on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">User Doomedtundra put forward a great idea. “Arc longsword.” I imagine this to be a pretty meaty melee weapon that slows and electrocutes enemies. It would likely cut through the hordes of Automatons in the galaxy like a hot knife through butter. </p>
 <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">This type of Warbond would also open the door for something <em>Helldivers 2</em> fans have been asking for since day one. As user SpeedyAzi requests, “All I need is a Laser Calvary Sword and a Robot Horse. Then give me a flag banner as a stratagem.” I’ve never known this community to ask for anything more than a flag banner Stratagem, and seeing it finally enter the game, regardless of the Warbond theme, would be glorious. It also nails the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-say-theyd-rather-have-new-stratagems-over-new-warbonds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need for more Stratagems</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">User Iwlis666 makes a very sensible recommendation for how this Warbond could interact with items already in the game. “Great sword as primary that breaks to a sword and shield for secondary with a skin for GL as crossbow or a musket skin for railgun.” The Viper Commando Warbond will add vehicle customizations for the first time, so it makes sense that we could have weapon customizations. However, we’d also need some additional functionality for a few in-game items to make a shield work. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">The conversation descends into comparisons to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-multiplayer-modes-warhammer-space-marine-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K</a></em> quite a lot, but that makes sense. After all, Game Workshop’s universe is filled with sci-fi knights who wield futuristic versions of the same melee weapons knights were using hundreds of years ago. With the addition of firearms and lasers and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty grim leadership model</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em> does bear a lot of resemblance to the Grimdark. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I love that the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community has taken the changes Arrowhead Game Studios wants to make to Warbonds so seriously, even if it has resulted in the craziest idea for a Warbond I’ve ever seen. I think it bodes well for the community’s reaction to future Warbonds and shows players are open to pretty much anything as long as it’s well thought out. </p>

			<p>Deck13 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-was-a-financial-disappointment-but-an-enhanced-version-and-new-content-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised </a>new content and enhancements for its action RPG Atlas Fallen, and the German studio has now shared more details. The free Reign of Sand update is slated to launch on August 6, adding new voice acting by the talented Ben Starr (who played the protagonist in Final Fantasy XVI), a new area, new enemies, 25 new Essence Stones, new progression mechanics, quality of life improvements (chiefly to the camera, but also balancing and onboarding), the much-requested New Game Plus mode and a new difficulty mode called Nyaal's Nightmare.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atlas Fallen Reign of Sand - Major Update Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYVLkhaCWcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jan Klose, Deck13's Creative Director on Atlas Fallen, stated:</p>
<p><em>Our team was grateful for the opportunity to further develop Atlas Fallen and to bring a vastly updated version to the players. We listened to the feedback and made a whole series of improvements that we hope will make players enjoy the game even more.</em></p>
<p>Ahmed Boukhelifa, Deputy Chief Executive Officer - PULLUP ENTERTAINMENT STUDIOS, added:</p>
<p><em>Reign of Sand reflects our dedication to keeping Atlas Fallen a dynamic and captivating experience for all players. This free update is a testament to our commitment, offering substantial new content that both returning and new players will enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The game launched in August 2023 to underwhelming commercial performance and mixed reviews. Francesco De Meo wrote <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a> (7/10):</p>
<p><em>With its unique premise and setting, Atlas Fallen could have been one of the best action games of the year, but its mediocre combat system, dull open-world areas, and lack of interesting characters drag the experience down. The full package ends up being just a decent game for those willing to look past its most critical shortcomings.</em></p>

<p id="KDbs48"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5922989/invisible-inc-preview"><em>Invisible, Inc.</em></a> is a gloriously crisp 2015 tactical stealth game from Klei Entertainment, the Canadian indie studio behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/don-t-starve/7125"><em>Don’t Starve</em></a>. It’s a dashing, cartoony cyberpunk heist caper in which a team of augmented agents fly around the globe, stealing things from the high-security facilities of sinister corporations with the support of a powerful hacking AI. Procedurally generated levels and an exquisitely designed network of interconnected rules work together to create dynamic sneaking scenarios that seem to exist on a permanent knife edge of tension; unlike many games in the tactics genre, <em>Invisible, Inc. </em>is impossible to overpower or be overpowered by, and rewards playing with just the right amount of heart-in-mouth risk. In this game, using a gun is a last resort, and remembering to close a door behind you can mean the difference between success and failure. A near-perfect hidden gem of a tactics game. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

Whereas games like XCOM go large with expensive production values, <em>Into the Breach</em> is refreshingly minimalist. Your team of just three mechs is tasked with fighting back kaiju-sized insects. You can see the entire battlefield, in all its pixel-art glory, from an isometric view. Every level is randomized, too — a little bit roguelike — so you never fully know what you’re getting into, but you’ll still need to lean on strategic expertise and understanding of your team. <em>Into the Breach</em> is pure tactical bliss distilled to its essence. —<em>Ari Notis</em></p>

<p id="W74n7T"><em>Xenonauts</em> reads like <em>X-COM</em> 1994 with a fresh coat of paint and will feel immediately familiar to fans of the original. While many of the systems from the strategic and tactical layers have been untouched, <em>Xenonauts</em> does introduce some small improvements and quality-of-life features, like a more robust air combat system and a more complex funding system. —<em>Alice Jovanée</em></p>

<p id="GK3X7p">Whereas many XCOM-style games focus on military operations across big battlefields, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22822622/fights-in-tight-spaces-strategy-fighting-grid-rpg-review"><em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em></a> focuses entirely on small-scale encounters. <em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em> pits the player against goons, prisoners, brawlers, and assassins in small environments. I take up the role of Agent 11, and I have to kick ass through a series of bars, mess halls, and other contained spaces. I play cards to duck, dodge, and brawl my way out of each fight, and with each victory, I earn new cards. This turn-based deck-building game excels at making these small situations stressful, and it takes a tactical mind to play your cards right and John Wick your way out of each scuffle. —<em>Cass Marshall</em></p>

<p id="F0LwEG"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484477/marvels-midnight-suns-review-release-date-characters-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a> could’ve easily just been XCOM with a superhero paint job (Spandexcom, if you will). But it’s so much more. Literally made by the people who made XCOM, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> ostensibly features XCOM-style tactics gameplay. That’s merely the vehicle for a deck-building metagame that allows you to further customize your roster’s (awesome) powers. And while an absence of permadeath minimizes the combat tension you’d get in XCOM, it allows room for one of the most compelling Marvel stories in years. <em>Midnight Suns</em> underperformed at launch, but if any tactics game deserves a second lease on life, it’s this one. —<em>AN</em></p>

<p id="1LS4LJ">My personal favorite faction of the 40K universe finally got its due with <em>Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus</em>. Centered around the tech-obsessed Adeptus Mechanicus, you’ll command a cadre of Tech-Priests outfitted with forgotten and occasionally heretical technology, scouring Necron tombs for knowledge and loot. </p>
<p id="iqREfv">While some elements are borrowed from other popular turn-based strategy titles, <em>Mechanicus</em> still manages to bring some interesting wrinkles to the genre and gets high marks for its score and sound design. It also has the added benefit of being available on multiple platforms. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="z2Ampw"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo 3DS</p>
<p id="qhywCZ">When searching for a good XCOM-like, why not go to the source? Original <em>X-COM</em> designer Julian Gollop produced this spinoff of the Ghost Recon tactical shooter series for Ubisoft, delivering a smartly designed isometric strategy game with the Tom Clancy brand’s modern military styling.</p>
<p id="liJYyz"><em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</em>’ campaign sends players to Eastern Europe and Russia, where they must survey battlefields, carefully move and position their six-person squad, and engage in turn-based skirmishes where one wrong move can spell disaster. You know, real XCOM stuff. <em>Shadow Wars</em> is challenging and sometimes grueling — missions can take upward of 45 minutes each — but the game features a smooth learning curve and difficulty options for players who prefer not to struggle.</p>
<p id="e87BbN">Originally released in 2011 as a Nintendo 3DS launch title, your best option for securing a copy of <em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</em> is secondhand (now that the 3DS eShop is closed) on places like eBay where loose cartridges go for $10 or less. —<em>Michael</em> <em>McWhertor</em></p>

<p id="V2hpWm"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-banner-saga/2273">The Banner Saga</a> is a trilogy of titles that plays like a mix of XCOM and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/31/4575810/the-oregon-trail-was-made-in-just-two-weeks"><em>Oregon Trail</em></a> with the narrative style of the Mass Effect trilogy. Set against a backdrop of Norse mythology, <em>The Banner Saga</em> has you leading a band of warriors and refugees attempting to survive Armageddon, forcing you to frequently choose between empathy or pragmatism. The trilogy is full of meaningful tactical and narrative choices that carry over from one game to the next and can have a profound impact on your characters or how story beats progress.    </p>
<p id="ezyi7J"><em>The Banner Saga</em> features beautifully hand-drawn characters, animations, and environments that highlight the remarkable level of passion that went into this title. The game also includes a score by the incomparable Austin Wintory, the composer responsible for the soundtracks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3445636/journey-review-a-capital-venture"><em>Journey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/2/12290330/abzu-review-ps4-pc-playstation-4"><em>Abzu</em></a>, and other excellent works. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="5Ri8QM">A superhero variant on the XCOM formula, <em>Capes </em>is a relatively new release (May 2024) and puts you in control of a team of superpower crime fighters looking to take on the nefarious Company, which is imprisoning superpowered individuals and experimenting on them. It has fun character design and mechanics that encourage repeated use of powers in combat and unique play patterns for each of the heroes.</p>
<p id="8qPKdf">Some caveats: The writing is intentionally hokey, which I feel matches the expressive art style, but might be a turnoff to some players. And the stages lack the tactical depth of many of the other games on this list, sometimes lacking multiple solutions and forcing you to retry the same stage until you figure out the right path. But I’ve still had a fun time. If, like me, you have fond memories of <em>Freedom Force </em>but wish it played like a more modern tactics game, this one’s for you. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="4Q5qdh"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Windows PC</p>
<p id="gxYOrv">Published in 2001, <em>Fallout Tactics</em> is the only game of its kind in the history of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout">franchise</a>. It’s a combat-focused title, but with a surprisingly meaty narrative that plays out over 22 distinct missions that can be experienced in a variable order. It also features full voice-over, including a substantial role by the late R. Lee Ermey (<em>Full Metal Jacket</em>).</p>
<p id="jy0R1Y">Rendered from the classic isometric perspective, it features three different game modes, including an odd hybrid real-time setting that I’m not particularly fond of. But the most authentic way to play, called Individual Turn-Based, is the most reminiscent of the original Fallout games, <em>Fallout</em> (1997) and <em>Fallout 2</em> (1998). Basically, it takes the gritty combat of the original CRPGs and blows it out into its own version of XCOM. You can even move and fight from inside vehicles.</p>
<p id="dHfpQ7"><em>Fallout Tactics</em> polishes off a lot of the rough edges found in the combat from the first two games, while also introducing a few more of its own devising. Line of sight, in particular, can be a bit hard to suss out at times. I actually prefer its combat to later interpretations of the formula, including <em>Wasteland 2</em>. But the real reason that it’s on my personal all-time-favorites list is that it’s the only entry in the series that takes place in the Midwest, allowing you to blaze a trail from Springfield, Illinois, to Kansas City, Missouri, and beyond to the West Coast.</p>

<p id="4vmwPY"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo Switch</p>
<p id="KPNNpK">If you’re looking for a cutesier, simpler, easier XCOM-like, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/28/16213294/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review-nintendo-switch-ubisoft"><em>Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em></a> is a great place to start. Players use a variety of Mario and Rabbids characters as pawns on preset stages filled with enemies and obstacles.</p>
<p id="HUj8jS">Each turn, you can boost up your pawns with special powers that heal, hurt, or move your own pawn and others nearby. The pawns also move a set number of spaces in a set pattern each turn, just like chess (or XCOM) — that means it’s just as satisfying when you check an enemy off the stage, bounce off your other pawns to traverse the board in one move, or make it to the goalposts on the other side safely.</p>
<p id="nZI4lV">Mario + Rabbids games are certainly easier than your average level of XCOM, but that’s not to say they aren’t challenging at times. I’ve gotten well stuck on a few different levels, which is humbling considering these games are technically for kids — which brings me to maybe the best part of these games, which is how adorable and fun the cinematics are.</p>
<p id="UEQWJH">Watching a Rabbid version of Luigi fly across the board and cartoonishly bonk your enemy on the head is massively engaging, and the sounds are just as enjoyable. It’s practically designed for parents to play with their kids (I say, childless). The stages are reminiscent of 3D Super Mario levels, piquing my nostalgia, but with plenty of new elements that make it exciting to see each stage unveiled.</p>

            <p>Balatro is getting a physical edition.</p>
<p>The creator of the viral Poker game, localthunk, confirmed via a note posted to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that fans will soon be able to pick up a physical copy of the game on PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles.</p>

<p>As an extra sweetener, each "special edition" will come with a pack of 10 bonus Joker/booster cards.</p>
<p>Localthunk – who recently spoke out about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">game's rating drama</a>, stating "it is what it is" – added, "That PEGI 18 rating is mocking me [though]".</p> <div>

<p>"I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," said localthunk. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>"Over the last few weeks, it has taken over the gaming world completely, and I can see why," we wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">Balatro review</a>. "A poker roguelike is such a brilliant idea you almost don't need to make it to see how clever it is. There are a few of these, and Balatro is comfortably the best I've played. It really is ingenious - and it's also ingeniously simple."</p>

I don’t even know what I’ll use this for! But I’m getting one anyway.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/974635-hit-man"><em><strong>Hit Man</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>A bunch of very smart people have said this comedy-action-thriller Netflix flick is one of the best movies of the year. And why not? Richard Linklater directs, Glen Powell stars, it’s based on <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">an all-timer of a magazine article</a>. I cannot wait to watch.</li><li><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/"><em><strong>Dark Wire</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>This is as good a premise for a book as I’ve ever seen: the story of the FBI’s secret tech startup, designed to track some of the world’s most sophisticated criminals. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-biggest-fbi-sting-operation-in-history/">few places</a> have <a href="https://www.404media.co/dark-wire-inside-a-kidnapping-planned-on-the-fbis-secret-chat-app/">published excerpts</a>, and I already can’t put this book down.</li><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744393/building-simcity-by-chaim-gingold-foreword-by-janet-h-murray/"><em><strong>Building SimCity</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>Two books this week! You love to see it. This is a story all about SimCity, yes, but also about the history of computer simulation, with lots of photos and diagrams to go with it. One for the coffee table for sure.</li><li><a href="https://rivian.com/r1s"><strong>The new Rivian R1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Same look, same funky headlight design, totally new car underneath. A lot of what Rivian’s doing here is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172761/rivian-r1t-r1s-refresh-update-motor-battery-price">clearly just to keep costs down</a>, but this continues to be the EV I lust after the most.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479-the-acolyte"><em><strong>The Acolyte</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>This is a very different kind of Star Wars story, set in a very different time and place, told from a very different point of view, all of which I definitely think is a good thing. The reviews seem pretty mixed so far, but I’m excited to give it a whirl.</li><li><a href="https://www.getsequel.app/"><strong>Sequel 2.3</strong></a><strong>.</strong><em> </em>A very cool update to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915813/sequel-sofa-media-tracking-apps-roblox-razr-big-vape-installer-newsletter">the Installerverse’s favorite media tracking app</a> for Apple devices. The new feature is called Magic Lookup, and it lets you send a URL to the app and have it automatically parsed and dumped into your lists. Perfect for saving those “20 things coming to Netflix this month” things you see all over the place.</li><li><a href="https://modretro.com/"><strong>The ModRetro Chromatic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The retro gaming hardware boom we’re in right now is just the best thing. And this, a $199 Game Boy homage from a team led by Palmer Luckey, looks <em>great. </em>It’s not shipping until the end of the year, but it’s up for preorders now.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Frog.asus.com%252Fus%252Fgaming-handhelds%252Frog-ally%252Frog-ally-x-2024%252F"><strong>The Asus ROG Ally X</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Speaking of portable consoles! This one’s a lot bigger, a lot more expensive, and a lot more ambitious than the Chromatic —&nbsp;but it also sounds pretty great. Maybe this is the first Windows handheld that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">really stand up to the Steam Deck</a>?</li><li><a href="https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/"><em><strong>Comfort Zone</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Fun new podcast from the MacStories crew, with a gimmick I really like: every week, the three hosts have to basically do “Tech Show and Tell” and then issue a tech-related challenge to complete before the next episode. (MacStories also has another new podcast, called <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/"><em><strong>NPC</strong></em></a>, all about portable gaming.</li><li><a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/how-wall-e-reveals-our-changing-feelings-toward-tech/"><strong>“How ‘Wall-E’ Reveals Our Changing Feelings Toward Tech.”</strong></a><strong> </strong>I am outrageously jealous of this whole series of episodes from the <em>Offline </em>podcast, looking at how movies like <em>Her </em>and <em>The Social Network </em>influenced the way we think about and build tech. This is the final episode in the miniseries, and they’re all worth a listen.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>Well, friends, it took 41 issues, but it happened: I had someone lined up for Screen Share this week, and it just didn’t come together in time. So let’s do something slightly different. I’ve recently become obsessed with the <a href="https://niagaralauncher.app/"><strong>Niagara Launcher</strong></a> for Android, which is, in theory, largely optimized for one-handed phone use but is also just a better, quieter way of organizing your homescreen. In the last 10 days, I’ve probably redone my setup eight times. It’s a lot.</p><p>Niagara is just so clever! It turns your apps into a customizable list, pops up widgets and notifications right in place, and lets you do a shocking amount of stuff without ever opening an app. This is totally how phones should work. (If you want to understand how it operates, here’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW9U-T_LbIak"><strong>a good thorough video</strong></a> to watch.)</p><p>Niagara just got a big update, too, particularly if you pay the $10 a year or $30 lifetime Pro subscription. Its search is better now, it got some cool new icons, and there are a few other little improvements, too.</p><p>As I’ve been tinkering with my own homescreen, I’ve been collecting some Niagara setups I like, and I figured I’d share a few. You can do so many things with this launcher!</p><p>Cool, right? There are rumors and reports that we’re going to get a bunch of new customization possibilities for iOS, too, so here’s hoping this is a year filled with chaotic homescreen reorgs. If you use Niagara, by the way, or any other awesome Android launcher, I’d love to see your sick homescreen setups. Send them my way. And we’ll be back to regular Screen Share next week!</p><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.&nbsp;</em></p><p>“New version of <a href="https://www.apposite.ai/"><strong>Vibescape</strong></a> just came out for Apple Vision Pro — new Oregon coast-inspired meditation environment! Completely new experience with this and the Forest Ledge environment — pushing the boundaries of what’s possible outside of Apple’s own environments.” – Gregory</p><p>“I’ve been using <a href="https://www.beeper.com/"><strong>Beeper</strong></a> a ton on my Pixel 8 Pro and MacBook Pro. I actually installed it in early April when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">acquisition announcement came out</a> but have really hit my stride with it a month ago. It’s just so helpful to have all of your messaging in one app, both for work and personal.” – Josh</p><div><p>“<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40patrickhwillems"><strong>Patrick Willems</strong></a> has a new video this week about <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSW9b9VpVW0A"><strong>what’s next after superhero movies</strong></a> so I’ve been diving back into his channel after a while.” –&nbsp;Mike</p></div><p>“A friend introduced me to <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/"><em><strong>Guild Wars 2</strong></em></a> a few months back. As someone who likes the concept of an MMO but always felt let down by the execution, I can confidently say this is one of the most underrated games ever made. A fun, free-to-play MMORPG with a healthy community and no microtransactions sounded too good to be true, but it’s not. Plus, with the recent announcements around the next expansion, there are more reasons to play than ever.” – Dallin</p><p>“I heard about Microsoft’s Recall, which felt exhausting and tedious to me. So, last weekend, I paved over Windows and installed the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/"><strong>Bazzite</strong></a> Linux distro on my gaming PC and have been playing all my Steam and Epic games that way. It’s surprisingly so much better than the last time I tried Linux on the desktop. I’m sure mileage varies, but everything worked with about the same amount of tweaking Windows required.” –&nbsp;Les</p><p>“The <em>LOTR</em> movies are finally<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/series/the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy/"><strong>coming back to theaters</strong></a>. The extended editions — the only versions I’ll watch. So excited to go watch these with my pals, like high school all over again.” –&nbsp;Colin</p><p>“Watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/253268-who-killed-wcw"><em><strong>Who Killed WCW?</strong></em></a> from <em>Vice</em>. It’s a three-part miniseries interviewing Eric Bischoff and a bunch of wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Konnan, and Booker T about the inevitable downfall of WCW. Everyone has their own thoughts about who to point the finger at, from Turner executives hating wrestling to Bischoff not knowing what he’s doing to the wrestlers only looking out for themselves. Only one episode out so far, but it’s good.” – Brian</p><p>“The new shows <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/thousandaires"><em><strong>Thousandaires</strong></em></a><em> </em>from Dropout and <a href="https://watch.2ndtry.tv/trolley-problems"><em><strong>Trolley Problems</strong></em></a><em> </em>from 2nd Try premiered this week and are both hilarious and great examples of modern media companies and the trend of creating their own streaming platforms.” –&nbsp;Zach</p><p>“On the anime watch. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/207784?language=en-US"><em><strong>Delicious in Dungeon</strong></em></a>. Very fun to watch, the characters’ comedic timing is excellent. This anime is hilarious while keeping the stakes of the story high.” – John</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot this week about <a href="https://boz.com/articles/inbox-ten"><strong>a blog post</strong></a> Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s CTO, wrote recently. He talks about his system of “Inbox Ten,” which basically means not trying to end every day with <em>nothing </em>on your plate but instead just trying to find a more manageable flow of information in your life. Boz has a whole system for managing his inbox in particular, which I really like — I used to be an Inbox Zero zealot and get stressed out when there’s stuff in there, but I like his slightly less drastic approach. And this sentence has popped into my brain all week, every time I get an email: “Don’t let it linger in your inbox or get yourself talked into work you don’t think is a good use of your time.” Words to live by.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, during Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Piranha Games unveiled the release date for MechWarrior 5: Clans. The narrative-driven game with co-op support will be released on October 3 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000890/MechWarrior_5_Clans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam </a>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mechwarrior-5-clans-e50e3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play support.</p>
<p>Players will experience the Clan Invasion from the perspective of Clan Smoke Jaguar as they lead their five-mech 'Star' squad through engaging missions and combat, with cinematics unlike anything seen before in the franchise. The developers have also promised a story that will bring players across several planets and diverse biomes.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-takes-full-advantage-of-unreal-engine-5-finally-ships-with-great-controller-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2024 interview with Wccftech</a>, Piranha Games CEO Russ Bullock confirmed that the game uses Unreal Engine 5 to the fullest extent: Lumen, Nanite, MetaHuman, Chaos destructibility, and World Partition. MechWarrior 5: Clans will also ship with controller support on PC as well, though that was kind of a given considering the launch on consoles.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Offworld Industries unveiled the 1.0 release date for Starship Troopers: Extermination. The 16-player cooperative first-person shooter game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 11, nearly a year and a half after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-early-access-launch-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2023 early access debut</a>.</p>
<p>One of the additions to the full version is a single player mode featuring 25 distinct missions and a variety of PvE combat scenarios across multiple environments, with a second chapter to follow post-launch. The story premise is that players are selected to join an elite spec ops group within the Mobile Infantry. They will soon find themselves following the orders of living legend General John “Johnny” Rico, proving their mettle against hordes of enemy Arachnids with the aid of three original NPC allies to prove themselves worthy of recruitment. And yes, Johnny Rico will be played by Casper Van Dien, the actor featured in the cult 1997 Starship Troopers movie.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8FRZR728u8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Offworld Industries also confirmed that a long-requested new feature will be added to Starship Troopers: Extermination 1.0: the persistence on the battlefield of bug corpses. This will lend increased realism to the game experience, not to mention the possible introduction of tactical elements as players climb mountains of corpses to shoot the remaining bugs from a vantage point.</p>
<p>Those interested in the game should keep in mind that the current pricing of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access version</a> ($29.99) will increase with the launch of version 1.0. As such, it may be wise to purchase the game now before the expected price increase. The developers also promised to share more information about the next early access update, slated to go live at the end of June, very soon.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's Future Game Show, Red Thread Games and Quantic Dream presented a new Dustborn trailer that celebrates the opening of pre-orders. As a reminder, the game is slated to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-red-threads-action-adventure-game-launches-on-august-20-for-29-99/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 20</a> for $29.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S/X, and Xbox One. Moreover, a physical edition will be released for consoles. Priced at $39.99, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 postcards from iconic locations visited by the crew;</li>
<li>A map of the American Republic, listing all the pitstops the crew has to make before arriving at their final destination;</li>
<li>A 32-page prequel comic book about the crew’s life before accepting this risky mission;</li>
<li>Stickers of iconic elements from the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who pre-orders is getting a Sherbert twirl hat, a Psycho Pete bat, and an exclusive Eye C U Jacket. Ragnar Tørnquist, Creative Director at Red Thread Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are excited to offer a deeper look at how the power of words shapes Dustborn’s gameplay. As we launch pre-orders, we wanted to give players more insight into the crew’s undercover punk-rock road trip and the adversaries they face along the way. We cannot wait to see players discover the game’s comic book-inspired experience, build relationships with the crew, and use their abilities to defeat Justice and the Puritans!</em></p>
<p><iframe title="DUSTBORN | PRE-ORDER TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dustborn will also get a 30-minute free demo next week as part of Steam Next Fest, during which players will be able to go hands-on with Pax, the main character. As an Anormal, she can control words to create new powers, defend herself, get out of sticky situations, neutralize threats, and build relationships with her crew or new encounters. Of course, relationships can be tricky to navigate, as each character brings their own powers, perspectives, motives, and insecurities.</p>

Looking back at January's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-2024-all-of-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5041/">Developer Direct</a>, quite a few Xbox games were shown off then, and it's likely that we'll see more of everyone's favorite archeologist in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Obsidian's new fantasy game Avowed, and the grand strategy of Ara History Untold.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-590943">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg/" data-ref-id="5000-590949">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a>, and a look at what's next for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> could also be on the cards, and we've also seen a few Game Pass updates in the past in previous Xbox showcase events. On the third-party side, Xbox has a lot it could show off here. March's Xbox Partner Preview featured games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/unknown-9-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-517822">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" data-ref-id="5000-590945">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy 14 Online</a> amongst several other interesting titles, so there's a chance that we'll see more of those games during the livestream.</p><p>Following the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/" data-ref-id="1100-6523660">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct will be up next.

Will it contain guns, military jargon, and a few explosions? An educated guess points toward a definite "maybe" for the 2024 Call of Duty game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bodycam-is-so-realistic-it%E2%80%99s-borderline-terrifying.895029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bodycam-realistic-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I’ve spent a few hours playing Bodycam, the Unreal Engine-powered first-person shooter from two brothers that’s turning heads on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was released on Steam on June 7, with many users and prospective fans confusing the project with Unrecord, a similar-looking game that surfaced last year with a harrowing reveal trailer. </p>



<p>Both games look similar but while Unrecord reportedly focuses on a single-player narrative, Bodycam is a multiplayer-focused shooter. After getting hands-on with Bodycam for a while, I can confirm that it’s so realistic it’s scary, and it’s how I want all my first-person shooters to behave going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-yourself">Prepare Yourself</h2>



<p>Bodycam isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s marketed as being a tough-as-nails shooter that walks a fragile line between ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. In Bodycam, players assume control of a footsoldier in either a military force or a terrorist group, using a series of authentic weapons to take down opponents and complete a range of basic objectives.</p>



<p>Everything from the maps to the game’s audio mechanics have been superbly crafted in Unreal Engine 5, and the visual layer of the game is nothing short of sublime. On a high-end PC, Bodycam looks jaw-droppingly good, offering unparalleled graphics and physics that make something as simple as shooting an opponent a terrifying realistic premise.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This is a game, not a shot from LiveLeaks</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Honest disclaimer: don’t play Bodycam if you’re easily disturbed or made uncomfortable by real-world violence.</strong></p>



<p>Allow me to explain. In one sequence, I crept through a gorgeous wooded area on my way to defuse a bomb that had been planted by a terrorist force. In the next moment, I was engaged, and bullets were whipping through the scenery, deafening me. I whirled on an opponent and blasted him with a shotgun, and he was sent collapsing to the floor, his legs bucking wildly as he contorted with the pain of the buckshot slamming into him.</p>



<p>Then, I was hit, and as my camera disconnected I too fell to the ground in the middle of a thick forest, blood gurgling in my throat as my operator choked on his final breaths. It’s <strong>intense</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know where the next shot will come from</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players have a few gripes with Bodycam, namely with the game’s matchmaking mechanics and server instabilities, but for the few hours that I played, I suffered from two issues:</p>



<ul>
<li>In one match, I was doing pretty well and then was suddenly disconnected</li>



<li>In another match, the player I was spectating after I’d been killed was bugging out, jerking around the map</li>
</ul>



<p>Aside from that, I have no issues with any aspect of Bodycam. It’s a solid shooter with huge amounts of potential, and although it could be seen as little more than a tech demo, it has left Unrecord sitting in the dust as far as I’m concerned. Some users might brand it a clone or an act of plagiarism, but I maintain that we saw one trailer for Unrecord several months ago and nothing else, while Bodycam is here, in the wild, and making a stellar impression.</p>



<p>Bodycam is available (for now) exclusively on PC.</p>

			<p>State of Decay 3 will receive a brand-new trailer during the highly-anticipated Xbox Showcase later today, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>Developer Undead Labs revealed as much as part of a press release that was briefly available on the studio's website. As <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1799547951758340402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Gematsu on X (and several others), the Microsoft-owned studio responsible for the State of Decay series is rebranding, and in a now-deleted press release, the studio confirmed that fans will get a new trailer for State of Decay 3. Seemingly, a .zip file containing a press release was<a href="https://www.undeadlabs.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly available on the studio's job page</a>. This link no longer exists, however, and we haven't been able to find a cached sample of the page either. Luckily, Gematsu included a screenshot of the press release as well as the new logo that Undead Labs will use as part of the studio's rebranding. You can find the new logo at the top of this article. A screenshot of the press release is included below.</p>
<p>"Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer", the press release reads.</p>
<p>"This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in the way previously reserved for games", Nate Manny from brand development experts 51 Eggs writes in the press release.</p>

<p>As reported yesterday, the Xbox Showcase is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said to offer 8 world premieres (aside from previously announced games)</a>, including the new Gears title as well as the rumored new DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced back in 2020</a>, State of Decay 3 is being made in <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-being-made-with-unreal-engine-5-and-help-from-gears-of-war-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine 5 with the help of devs from Gears studio The Coalition</a>. As covered some weeks ago, the title is said to be coming along very well - at least, that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-reportedly-coming-along-very-very-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Windows Central's Jez Corden claimed</a>.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about State of Decay 3. For now, stay tuned.</p>

		<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of games. Hell, getting people excited about what’s coming out is at least part of what we do here on a daily basis. However, you can’t bandy around the phrase ‘next Breath of the Wild’ without a bit of evidence to back it up, and thanks to the latest Eternal Strands trailer from the Future Games Show, we’ve got some pretty compelling evidence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands Gameplay Trailer - Future Games Show Summer Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql_EdNY7eX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This new gameplay trailer follows on from the original announcement, and it showcases exactly the kind of action you can expect to indulge in when Eternal Strands releases in the near-ish future. First on the ‘Breath of the Wild comparison chart is the expansive open world and the vibrant visuals, with Yellow Brick Games forging a beautiful graphical style that’s undoubtedly going to entice players into their world. Exploration is clearly going to play a major part in the experience, and there’s plenty of footage of our heroine running and clambering around a variety of distinct and exciting areas.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a bunch of combat, and here you’re tackling an array of gigantic beasts in a way that’s perhaps more reminiscent of Shadow of the Colussus rather than Link’s escapades. You can climb up their limbs, ready to hack parts of them off, or perhaps you’ll be taken for a ride by a gigantic dragon who’s expecting some kind of flame-grilled adventurer for lunch. The designs of these huge bosses looks especially impressive, offering both terror and temptation in equal measure.</p>


<p>There’s also the options of crafting new items of armour and weaponry to improve your chances – we’ll wait to see if there’s a cooking point to throw things into – or to lean on magic to take down these massive creatures. Whatever you choose, Yellow Brick Games looks more than ready to provide it.</p>
<p>While we don’t yet have a release date for Eternal Strands, we do know that it will be releasing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles and PC, and that you can add it to your relevant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">wishlist</a> right now. No matter where you play, Eternal Strands could well be essential when it finally arrives.</p>

  <p id="pC3IeD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is having a Goomy Community Day event on<strong> Sunday, June 9, from 2-5 p.m. in your local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="dnBcPc">As expected with a Community Day event,<strong> Goomy </strong>will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.</p>

<h2 id="JHxyzU"><strong>How do I catch a shiny Goomy in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="ZGv7YR">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Goomy </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Goomy you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Goomy’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Sliggoo into Goodra from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>Thunder Punch</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Thunder Punch. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Goodra do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">For raiding and gyms, Goodra isn’t nearly as good as its fellow pseudo-legendary dragons. You can set it up with Dragon Breath and Draco Meteor, but you should use just about anything else over it (Salamence, Dragonite, or Garchomp, just to name a few).</p>
<p id="nsarC1">Goodra is actually used more in PvP, so you can set it up with Dragon Breath alongside Power Whip and Aqua Tail to give it some good move coverage.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Goomy Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Goomy Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="RnqjWH">Tripled Stardust for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Goomy special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Goomy.</p>
<p id="miKL06">Notably, there will also be a <strong>Timed Research set that rewards you with a Rainy Lure Module</strong> — which you’ll need to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22423676/evolve-goomy-sliggoo-pokemon-go-goodra-evolution-requirements">evolve your Sliggoo into Goodra</a> (if it’s not raining for you). That said, if you head to a more populated <em>Pokémon Go</em> spot (like a shopping mall or park), some players may already use Rainy Lure Modules, so you can use theirs rather than using your own.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a><strong> Charizard X, Ampharos, Sceptile, Altaria, Salamence, Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, or Garchomp</strong>, you’ll score additional Goomy Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Sliggoo raid, Goomy will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Goomy you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

<p>In what was definitely not on my bingo sheet but one I was not-so-secretly wishing for, we’ve heard about an upcoming trailer for State of Decay 3, which will be released during the Xbox Games Showcase. We’re not yet sure if it’s gameplay or another cinematic, like the one they revealed over three years ago, but here’s hoping for the former!</p>



<hr>



<p>This leak stems from developer Undead Labs updating their website with new branding and information to better align with their standing as a first-party Xbox game development studio. Xbox purchased Undead Labs in 2018, following the immense success of their original game, State of Decay, which became a cult classic. Their follow-up, State of Decay 2, continues the franchise, offering a highly replayable zombie survival game of immense quality and entertainment value.</p>



<p>But now, it’s time for something more. In a press release leak that fell through the cracks during the website update, we know there’s a new State of Decay 3 trailer reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. Here’s what the press release had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>IT’S A NEW ERA FOR UNDEAD LABS.</p>



<p>Undead Labs engaged with 51 Eggs, a branding practice, on an odyssey to align the studio brand with its evolution from indie to Xbox. Undead Labs was founded in Seattle in 2009 as a scrappy startup with only a handful of developers. The studio’s name was a clever marketing tactic for the first State of Decay game, a surprise hit that launched in 2013. A decade and a half later, Undead Labs bears little resemblance to its early incarnation. Following an acquisition in 2018, its relationship with Xbox changed from publishing partner to parent company. Shortly after, the founder departed, and new Studio Head Philip Holt began his leadership tenure, including overseeing the expansion of satellite oices in Illinois and Florida. It was time for the studio brand to change. “We wanted to give the creatives we work with a collective identity that transcends zombies,” says Holt. Chief of Sta Vicki Ebberts adds, “It felt right — and also the right time — that our brand reflected how much we’ve grown and changed.” Partnering with brand development experts 51 Eggs proved to be an exciting and rewarding adventure. Collaborating closely with the Undead Labs team, 51 Eggs delivered a holistic, studio values-driven brand experience encompassing everything from brand strategy to verbal and visual brand identity design. The end result includes redefining Undead Labs’ name and brand story, a new logo and visual ecosystem, boot sequence animations, website, custom brand launch kits, interior studio artwork, signage, wayfinding, and more. Over nearly two years, these Pacific Northwest-based companies worked together to explore the studio’s legacy, current trajectory, and the shared dreams and aspirations of its beating heart — the people of Undead Labs. “This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in a way previously reserved for games.” Nate Manny, Founder of 51 Eggs.</p>



<p><strong>Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer. Explore and experience the new Undead Labs brand at undeadlabs.com.</strong></p>

<p>We’ll share more once the trailer goes live!</p>

<p>I love the setup: you're a duck turned into a human and made an intern of a goddess's "magical startup dedicated to finding lost items". 
</p>
<p>I remember when every hidden object game was a faintly hideous photo-collage about investigating ghost murders in an endless procession of damp sheds. It's been a delight to see the Where's Wallyfication (or Waldofication, if you're American) of the genre in recent years, with a growing number of games featuring richly illustrated scenes packed with humour. 
</p>
<p>Lost And Found Co. seems to be in the same vein as Hidden Folks and Labyrinth City: Pierre The Maze Detective, where it's just a pleasure to hang out in its spaces even when you can't find what you're looking for. I appreciate that there's a story to pull you through each scene, too.
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/">the demo from Steam now</a>, with the full game as yet undated.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wave 3 of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>‘s expansion pass, Episode Aigis: The Answer, has received a release date reveal trailer. This section of the game will include more than 30 hours of new content and a new dungeon for players to explore as they navigate through an epilogue to the climactic main story. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Fans are excited to see this part of the game be reworked, as it quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the original <em>Persona 3</em> release. Many players have criticized the pacing of the story, as well as the overall difficulty spike of the original version of The Answer included with <em>Persona 3 FES</em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass | Episode Aigis Date Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTgAlxQyvkE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">While The Answer was a controversial release, that didn’t stop hungry fans from asking about it when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> was first announced. Many assumed that the DLC would be missing from Reload until a surprise announcement confirmed it would be coming. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Although gamers have come to disagree about the way that <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>changes up gameplay in its own ways with the inclusion of Theurgy attacks and changes to each character’s toolkit, the overall outlook from the fandom is optimism at a chance to see this story executed in a way that feels more natural. </p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Additional excitement stems from the fact that a <em>Reload</em> recomposition of the <em>FES</em> version of Mass Destruction can be heard in this trailer. The trailer also shows off some dungeon exploration, Aigis’ new all-out-attack screen, and a sliver of information about Metis, a focal character in this expansion. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Although some players are still holding out hope to see the female protagonist from <em>Persona 3 Portable </em>be included as a DLC somewhere down the road, most of the fandom is just happy to see The Answer be included in <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, since it was pitched to gamers as a faithful remake. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><em>Episode Aigis</em> is the third and final wave of DLC for <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> and will be released on September 10, 2024. Interested players can purchase it via their respective stores. Additionally, Xbox Game Pass members have the opportunity to claim Episode Aigis as a Perk through January 31, 2025. </p>

Why does it need to be set in a virtual reality game show? So it can do things like transport players to Kyoto in the year 1568, which is what will happen when season three arrives on June 13th.

<figcaption>The trailer for The Finals season 3.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kWYWa3Jv2Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new season brings a new 5v5 ranked mode, Terminal Attack, in which one team attacks by delivering a decryption key to one of two terminals, while the other team defends them. The mode is designed to empasise "a more tactical and competitive" style of play, with matches being decided by the best of 13 rounds, and with no healing or revives.
</p>
<p>Although set in different cities and slightly different time periods, so far all of The Finals' maps have been modern urban environments. Kyoto in the 16th century, meanwhile, consists of temples, gardens and bamboo forests - all of which you can demolish as per any other environment in the game.
</p>
<p>The setting also brings a set of themed weapons and cosmetics, including dual katanas for Mediums, a spear for Heavies, and a recurve bow for Lights. I love a bow in any game.
</p>
<p>I haven't returned to play it in a while, but I'm still rooting for The Finals. Being able to demolish buildings is fun on its own terms, as are grappling hooks and portable jump pads, but its real strength is making these overpowered tools into tactically significant options in the push-and-pull of its various game modes. I had great fun with it for a couple of months and I hope it continues to draw enough of an audience to keep its servers online.</p>

A demo is available now. <span id="more-890101"></span></p><p>“We’re counting down the days, and the whole team is excitedly awaiting the launch of <em>First Dwarf</em> in Early Access,” said Star Drifters CEO Jakub Wojcik in a press release. “Both the tests and the demo version are immensely popular among players, yet this is just a glimpse of what we aim to deliver to them on June 19 and in further updates. We’re eagerly awaiting feedback from our fans because we want to listen to their opinions and craft our game together with them. We also feel that with the support of the community, we’ll be able to build a title tailored to what players are currently looking for.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Star Drifters:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>First Dwarf</em>, players become Tru— a dwarven explorer who sets out to build colonies on the floating islands of Driftland. Shipwrecked Tru must prepare for the dangers of the sky-high land, building defenses and infrastructure for the future colonists. Fortunately, with dwarven engineering skills, he can repair and pilot a powerful mech, which proves itself in combat, gathering resources and building. With various upgrades, this pinnacle of fantasy tech will eventually become the ultimate exploration machine. The mech’s offensive arsenal will also come in handy, as the uncharted lands are inhabited by mysterious creatures hostile to the dwarven newcomers.</p><p>But the gigantic mech is not enough to uncover all the mysteries of Driftland. Ragna, a she-dragon, is a playable companion who aids Tru in his quest. Her small size, ability to fly, and breathe fire make her a great addition to the dwarven skills of the protagonist. The game can be played in co-op (split screen and online) with each protagonist doing their job.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Building a colony and managing the settlers is another part of Tru’s job. With <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense</a> mechanisms, the settlement can be prepared for the worst. But it’s not all about survival—Tru will have to balance and fulfill the needs of new inhabitants, providing them with resources, shelter, and entertainment to boost their happiness. Only a prosperous society will allow our protagonist to pursue his own personal goal—discovering what evil taints these lands and what happened to the previous dwarven expeditions, including the one led by his father.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li> Control dwarf Tru, pilot the powerful mech and fly with Ragna the Dragon, each with their own skills to upgrade.</li><li>Build, optimize and look after your colonies.</li><li>Upgrade, craft and discover new structures, technologies, tools, and weapons.</li><li>Fight Tainted enemies by engaging in close combat and by building defensive turrets and walls in advance, preparing not only for monster waves, but also natural disasters.</li><li>Heal the Tainted animals or purge the island of them—the choice is yours.</li><li>Unveil the hidden secrets of Driftland and learn the truth about Tru’s father’s past.</li><li>Embark on an <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> alone or with a friend in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> assist mode</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>First Dwarf</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch, and PC via XXX in 2024.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="First Dwarf - Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uvdR-pXNHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/08/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-is-a-new-stealth-game-from-former-mirrors-edge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5sWLWF20uc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>From Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world," studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. "This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some screenshots from the game</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The advertising bonanza formerly known as E3 continues into its second day with another set of streams. The Wholesome Direct was today's highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

<p>It's a full hour and hot damn it includes a lot of games:

<p>I like the dark edge of Discounty, which takes the familiar shop simulation loop of stocking shelves and serving customers and puts it to work in service of creating a sprawling - and potentially exploiting and polluting - supermarket. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2274620/Discounty/">Steam page</a> warns that not everyone wants you to succeed, which seems only sensible.
</p>
<p>I also liked Littlelands, a cute action-adventure game about catching bugs, exploring caves, and searching for treasure. It's Zelda by way of Boku no Natsuyasumi, maybe? The announcement during the Wholesome Direct above included mention of a demo that would be playable today, although sadly it seems <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2083660/view/4146206204944399615">the developers have decided to delay it at the last moment</a>.
</p>
<p>Lastly, I loved the look of Spilled!. It's a relaxing game about cleaning up oil spills in your little tugboat, then upgrading the boat, and it has had a playable demo for a while. The announcement here was that its getting a graphics upgrade later this summer, following its successful Kickstarter earlier this year.
