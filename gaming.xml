		<p>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II has got a confirmed release date and it is February 14th, 2025. NISA confirmed the news today, along with releasing a brand new trailer for the game.

<p>In our review for The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak, Miguel said, <em>“The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak is the spark that this series needed, and an incredible new chapter for such an iconic franchise. The shift in tone for the story and the addictive dual-mode combat had me hooked from beginning to end. If you play any game in this series, make it this one.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-zorba-boss-how-to-beat-1851672980<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In retrospect, it is a little weird how that otherwise ridiculously generous multi-hour demo for <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> just kinda decided, “You’ve had enough,” after a random boss in Regalith Grand Cathedral. Over a million people have since told Atlus, “<em>We’ll</em> tell <em>you</em> when we’ve had enough,” and bit the bullet on the full game. That’s excellent news for us JRPG sickos, but that demo might give you delusions that all the bosses are just random collections of minions. That is quickly dispelled when you hit the game’s first <em>real </em>challenge.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Zorba—looking like one of the sexiest goths ever drawn, and sounding like Drew McIntyre—is waiting at the top of the Cathedral, and he’s brought a whole lotta dead guys with him, who hit harder than you think. But remain calm. Zorba ain’t a huge deal, so much as a place to practice good synergy. We’ll show you how to take him down.</p><h2 id="h6216"><a id=""></a><strong>Zorba’s abilities</strong></h2><p>You gotta admire a man with a plan. Zorba’s first move, every time, will be Corpse Puppetry, where he raises a Corpsethrall out of the ground. His second move? Raising another Corpsethrall. If you kill one of the Corpsethrall, guess what his next move’s gonna be? You got it. If you’re a Corpsethrall fan, you’ve come to the right place.</p><p>Once he’s got two corpses up, though, his next move will be setting his new rotten buddies up for success with Madness Curse. That inflicts them with Rage, meaning when the corpses hit you, they will hit HARD. If both enraged corpses are still up and shambling while he’s got turns left, then finally Zorba will get down to the business of dealing with you personally, by tossing some magic your way, usually either Mudoon (darkness), Kandera (lightning), or Bondage Curse, which hits one of your party with Paralysis.</p><h2 id="h6217"><a id=""></a><strong>Recommended Archetypes</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-recommend-id="image://fd9bf4600c0bf9efedfc26884c64d1c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1922" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Zorba in front of some spectacular sky action." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your pointman on this one is the Warrior. All of its Slash moves do decent damage to Zorba and the Corpsethralls—a killer name for a band, I might add. If you can get Fire magic equipped—either through Inheritance, or with an Igniter—even better, since Zorba’s corpse friends don’t much care for being set on fire, and they’ll take a big chunk of damage.</p><p>Your second-in-command here is gonna be the Healer. The healing is certainly a big help, but on top of that is the fact that the Healer can cast Hama (Light magic), which the corpses are also weak to. Hama is also one of the only magic spells that can damage Zorba in a pinch, which is nice.</p><p>Lastly, bring a Knight. That’s primarily because you want the Knight’s Synthesis move with the Warrior: Jump Thrust. That move lays the hardest smackdown on Zorba in general, but it also lowers Zorba’s defense, which will make this whole thing go by even faster. The Knight also provides insurance against your biggest weakness in the fight once there are corpses around, which is that the Healer’s weak to Strikes, which the Corpsethralls will use all the damn time. Using Knight’s Proclamation to draw aggro will be the only way to keep their filthy hands off you. The Knight will take hefty damage that turn. Good thing you’ve got a healer then, eh?</p><h2 id="h6218"><a id=""></a><strong>Defeating Zorba</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-recommend-id="image://1f195f1474a0a3b968723241e9ba3a5e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The battle with Zorba." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When the fight starts, you’ve got a free set of turns to do some damage to Zorba. Your Healer can let loose with Hama, your Warrior can use Slicer, but whatever you do, when you get down to two turn icons left, pass your turn over to your Knight and use Jump Thrust. That’ll start this fight off with Zorba in a bad way.</p><p>When it’s his turn, of course, he’ll raise his first corpse. By and large, that first phase is the general template for this whole fight. That is, you’ll want to do as much raw damage as humanly possible to the corpses, until you hit two turn icons, then hit Zorba with a Jump Thrust. The corpses being weak to Fire and Light magic means you’ll easily get three or four big hits in before that point.</p></div><p>If you did a little extra grinding before you got to this point, you might just be dangerous enough where you can take down a Corpsethrall in one go, and in which case, if you’ve brought down Zorba’s defense more than once, the Warrior’s Slicer does absolutely brutal damage to that poor, pretty bastard. But if you’re just going about your merry way through the game, chances are good you’ll end the turn with the corpse low on health but still standing. Zorba will use his time to raise another corpse, but the remaining corpse will lash out at one of your crew for a bit of damage. Let him have a free one, it’ll be his last. Even if he hits your Healer, Zorba won’t have enough of a turn left to do anything worrisome.</p><p>Obviously, start Round 2 by taking out that first corpse, then focus on the second. If you decide to get fancy, you can use the Warrior’s Round Slash to hit all three targets at once, though it’s a bit pricey on the turn icons and MP. Use discretion. Lather, rinse, repeat. Main thing is that somewhere in this cycle of violence, you’re gonna have to sacrifice your Healer’s turn to actually heal, especially if you’re unlucky enough where one of your attacks is a miss. If you’re ever going to end a turn with two corpses standing, especially if Zorba gets to cast Madness Curse, it’s time to let the Knight do their duty for God and country. Make sure the Knight gets the last turn, use Knight’s Proclamation to eat the incoming attacks, and have your Healer recover them after.</p><p>The tl;dr with all of this is to keep Zorba so busy spawning new corpses that he doesn’t have time for anything else. That means a strong focus on getting at least one corpse out of the picture at all times. Shit does happen, however, and you need to brace yourself if you get well and truly unlucky. If you have a choice between letting the Healer do damage or topping off your team’s health, choose the health, unless Zorba’s down to the last sliver. Still, if everything goes smoothly—and 90 percent of the time, it will with this plan—it doesn’t take more than five or six goes around to take Zorba down for good, liberate the Cathedral, and hear Hulkenberg walk Zorba down with some of that, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7-roiI5Vqc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You have offended my family and the Shaolin temple</a></span>” good stuff.

Commonly compared to Monopoly, Talisman features an easy to learn and basic gameplay loop that makes it a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">great board game for beginners</a>, despite its extremely randomized outcomes, hectic situations, and often longer-than-average play times. </p><p>Players choose from over 12 characters, all of which are classic fantasy classes, like the Wizard and Thief, and then the game begins. In it, two to six players battle it out to be the first to reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board and defeat the dragon, venturing through three main sections of the board: the outer, middle, and inner. </p><p>Throughout the game, you’ll have the opportunity to use over 100 different Adventure, Spell, or Talisman cards to gain the upper hand or screw with your opponents. You might even be able to turn one of them into a toad. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p>The entire history of Talisman is vast and has many out-of-print versions and expansions, so this guide will focus solely on expansions and spin-offs that are more easily accessible. </p><p id="talisman-base-game"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman base game">The Base Game</h2></p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="207849"><div id="207849" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman: The Magical Quest Board Game 5th Edition</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $59.99</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 12+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 60-90 minutes</li></ul><p>Released in July 2024, the 5th Edition of the decades-spanning fantasy board game is the latest and most up-to-date version available. With the game’s rich history, it’s easy to get confused on which versions to pick up – don’t look on eBay, as 4th Editions can go for almost $150! Instead, pick up the 5th Edition, which offers the base game as well as the gameplay mechanic changes first introduced in the 3rd Edition. Additionally, compared to the 4th Edition, the newest edition of Talisman is a more streamlined, slightly less chaotic experience; the 5th Edition rulebook even mentions explicit changes with a symbol next to the rules blurbs. This version also comes with two fewer characters; it cuts the Bard and Druid. </p></div><p id="talisman-expansions"><h2 data-toc-title="Talisman expansions">Talisman Expansions</h2></p><p>A very notable bummer is that the 5th Edition is not backwards compatible with the extensive library of 4th Edition expansions.

Each of the five lost Talismans is recovered in their own unique adventures, and can be replayed as many times as possible to get the full experience.

This’ll surely add a lot of meat to the bare-ish bones of the starter book.</p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Tales of The Dungeon</h3></div><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209050"><div id="209050" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Tales of The Dungeon</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $22.11</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 2-4 hours</li></ul><p>The next expansion is much darker in tone, and sees adventurers delving into the Glittering Caverns to confront the Lord of Darkness. This offers two new ancestries; minotaur and vampire, and two new classes; necromancer and tomb robber. </p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Tales of the City</h3></div><div catalogid="fde15d86-9341-45d3-84d5-660752d11d57" id="209051"><div id="209051" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Talisman Adventures: Tales of the City</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Price</strong>: $16.60</li><li><strong>Players</strong>: 2-6 players</li><li><strong>Age Range</strong>: 13+</li><li><strong>Play Time</strong>: 2-4 hours</li></ul><p>Finally, Tales of the City brings players to some of the seedier areas of the City.

The 40th Anniversary Collection includes all 13 of the 4th Edition expansions, from Blood Moon to the Nether Realm. The PS4 and PC versions include extra characters not available on Switch. Notably, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/91b1Eq?object_uuid=4cd575cf-51aa-433b-a553-0fa8bb8df978&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>physical versions</u></a> on PS4 and Nintendo Switch are not region-locked, but the expansions are.</p><h2>The Bottom Line</h2><p>Talisman is undeniably one of the most popular fantasy board games of our time, with a rich history of expansions and revisions spanning over 40 years. The streamlined ruleset of the 5th Edition makes learning it for the first time a breeze, and the updated fantasy art is worth the upgrade. And while many of the 4th Edition expansions are out of print and are either hard to find or expensive on the secondary market, the 5th Edition of the base game marks a perfect jumping on point for newcomers or those looking for a more laid back experience. The Talisman Adventures series of RPGs is a worthy, barebones competitor to DnD, and is  great for budding DMs and players of all ages looking into trying out their first RPG.</p><p><em>Myles Obenza is a freelance commerce writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-does-not-include-any-3rd-party-drm-including-denuvo<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> does not have third-party DRM of any kind, including Denuvo, Bioware has announced.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, the EA-owned studio said its upcoming fantasy role-playing game lacks digital rights management (DRM) on any platform, which is sure to go down well with PC gamers.</p><p>But the lack of DRM has the knock-on effect of preventing Bioware from offering a preload period for PC players. Instead, Dragon Age: The Veilguard will be downloadable and playable on launch day, 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 31 on PC.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a preload period on console, however: Xbox Series X and S preload is already available, with PlayStation 5 preload going live at 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK on October 29.</p><p>Denuvo is a controversial system used by video game developers and publishers to stem the tide of video game piracy by, they hope, pushing back the release of cracked versions of their games by sometimes weeks, maybe months, and in some cases, indefinitely. From a publisher perspective, Denuvo helps to prevent lost sales and revenue it might have received if those who pirate a video game at launch would have otherwise bought it.</p><p>However, Denuvo is often criticized by PC gamers for potentially affecting video game performance and even reducing the life-span of solid-state drives (SSDs). Denuvo has repeatedly denied the claims. In 2021, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-resident-evil-village-cracked-performance-beats-official-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> found the pirate version of Resident Evil Village actually improved performance. Capcom later patched the game.</p><p>BioWare has been on something of a charm offensive with PC gamers for the next Dragon Age. In July, it announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-steam-native-so-you-dont-need-the-ea-app-to-play-the-game-on-pc"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u> is “Steam native,”</a> which means the EA App is not required to play the game on Valve’s platform. Most EA-published video games <em>do</em> require the EA App, which replaced Origin in 2022, to play on Steam, much to the annoyance of many PC gamers.</p><p>This week, IGN reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-look-at-the-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trophy-achievement-list-if-you-want-to-avoid-spoilers">Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s Trophy / Achievement list</a> hitting the internet (beware of spoilers!). Earlier this month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-its-the-first-game-in-the-series-without-spiders"><u>BioWare confirmed Dragon Age: The Veilguard is the first game in the fantasy action role-playing game series not to feature spiders</u></a>.</p><p>IGN has plenty more on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade"><u>a deep-dive into its development</u></a>, which is well worth a read if you want to know more about how BioWare realized the game.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred | Live Action Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">According to the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24140808/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a>, one of those activities that will be improved is the seasonal Realmwalkers. Currently, they lumber about and slowly spawn enemies. When enough are defeated, the Realmwalker can be slain, after which a portal to the "Seething Realm" is opened where players can gain even more rewards. Come update 2.0.3, the Realmwalkers will be receiving a significant speed buff, and they'll spawn more enemies more quickly. Realmwalkers will additionally have a chance to spawn a Treasure Goblin, and Blizzard notes that other "miscellaneous changes" have been made to make the event progress faster overall. Speeding up the Realmwalkers should mean players get to the Seething Realm, where the meat of the event is, more quickly than before.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kurast Undercity will become more lucrative as well. Blizzard notes that more items will drop from successful runs, with at least one guaranteed Legendary item. The amount of gold dropped in the dungeon will also be doubled. Enemies within the Kurast Undercity have had their health and affixes brought closer in line to that of the game's other dungeons, and the mode's timer--as well as the amount of bonus time earned from slaying elite enemies--will be increased.</p><p dir="ltr">There are plenty of other changes coming in update 2.0.3, including a bug fix that may affect one of the game's more popular Spiritborn builds. The "Evade" build for the new Spiritborn class sees players constantly dodge-rolling using the Evade button, during which they send out huge volleys of feathers that fill the screen and decimate enemies. It turns out players were faster and using it more often than was intended, as a bug for Spiritborn allowed the class to cancel its evade animation mid-Evade. That bug will be fixed in the next update. The fix may slow down the Evade build somewhat but it will likely still be incredibly strong.</p><p dir="ltr">Other changes coming in the update include buffs to a number of Mythic Uniques, a fix for players who didn't receive their Resplendent Spark for defeating the Echo of Lilith, the reimplementation of a number of items that were disabled for the expansion's launch, a mount trophy for reaching Paragon 300. Additionally, tooltips for Masterworking, Runewords, and various crafting materials will be updated for "improved readability."</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>, writer Alessandro Barbosa said the expansion serves as "a great reentry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players," one that delivers on making the game "feel fresh again."</p>

The event, which runs several times a year, gives players a chance to try out demos from a slew of in-development titles. We’ve been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest batch</a></span> to highlight some of the best from the current festival, which runs from October 14 through 21.<br></p><p>Steam Next Fest often gives us our first taste of tomorrow’s indie gems or sleeper hits. Games seen during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698">previous</a></span> Steam Next Fests this year, since released to widespread acclaim, include the religious horror title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indika-steam-pc-nun-narrative-adventure-1851669861" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>Indika</em></a></span>, the <em>Resident-Evil</em>-inspired <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span>, and noir parody <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective</em></a></span>. Here are ten from this month’s event that could very well do the same.</p></div></div><div><p>If you only have time to play one demo during Steam Next Fest, you should make it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2442460/Citizen_Sleeper_2_Starward_Vector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></a></span>. The sequel to 2022’s stunning TTRPG-influenced sci-fi adventure is slated to come out in early 2025 and the demo lets you play the game’s opening hours. I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">previewed</a></span> the same demo a few months back and came away impressed by how <em>Starward Vector </em>retains the sense of risk and reward from the first game while introducing new mechanics like the ability to manage a crew and go out on dangerous missions, as well as a break system that completely changes how the game’s dice rolls work. Fans of the first game will not want to miss out on this demo, and it’s only available until the end of Steam Next Fest so try it out while you can.</p></div><div><p>Everybody has a take on the soulslike genre, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736690/Void_Sols/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Void Sols</em></a></span>’ has to be one of the most unique I’ve seen yet. It’s essentially a minimalist <em>Souls </em>game that distills the tough-as-nails combat and navigation of the genre into a top-down adventure in which the protagonist and every enemy are reduced to basic shapes. While the presentation may throw you off, the core gameplay hews closely to the core pillars of the genre, so you’ll still need to memorize enemy patterns, navigate twisty environments, and level up your stats while trying not to die. So far, <em>Void Sols</em> just proves how mechanically sound the soulslike genre is, regardless of visual presentation.</p></div><div><p>What’s more American than a road trip across the country in a beat-up car? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2756920/Keep_Driving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Keep Driving</em></a></span> is all about the unique charms and troubles that come with life on the open road. Pick a crappy vehicle and set out to see the country while picking up odd jobs along the way to pay for gas and other essentials. <em>Keep Driving</em> feels like one part enthralling management sim and one part <em>Kentucky Route Zero-</em>esque pastiche of the oft-forgotten parts of the country. </p></div><div><p>Earlier this month my colleague Moises Taveras previewed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911610/Windblown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windblown</em></a></span>, the new game from <em>Dead Cells </em>developer Motion Twin, and came away impressed. He <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-preview-rpg-1851533109">praised</a></span> the game’s incredibly fast-paced movement and combat which lets you zip around the isometric roguelike’s world in the blink of an eye. You can now try out the game for yourself during Steam Next Fest, and if you like what you see, you can keep the good times rolling when <em>Windblown </em>enters early access on October 24.</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the best way to describe the unique puzzler that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3083300/Proverbs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Proverbs</em></a></span><em> </em>is by calling it one giant game of <em>Minesweeper</em>. Inspired by Bruegel the Elder’s 1559 painting “Netherlandish Proverbs,” <em>Proverbs </em>drops you into a single giant board made up of over 54,000 individual squares. While solving the puzzle, you’ll also learn more about the painting that inspired the game (and some actual proverbs, too). This is the perfect demo to chip away at while watching TV or listening to a podcast in the background.</p></div><div><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mushroom Musume</em></a></span> you raise your mushroom daughter to be the best woman/funghi she can be, and things only get weirder from there. Part visual novel, part TTRPG, part farming sim, part roguelike, and all old-school fairytale, <em>Mushroom Musume</em> is a one-of-a-kind narrative driven game about parenthood and plants. Like fairytales of old, this game will entice you with beauty and horror in equal measure, and you’ll constantly want to know how your story will unfold. The demo for <em>Mushroom Musume </em>offers a generous taste of the game, so don’t be surprised if you fall down a rabbit hole.</p></div><div><p>Think of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2940440/Are_You_Kidding_Me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Are You Kidding Me</em></a></span> as a cozier version of <em>WarioWare</em>. Gameplay is mostly made up of microgames that ask you to complete a number of wild tasks in a matter of seconds, but there are also a handful of characters to chat with and get to know in the game’s setting of Nowhere Space. If the combination of high-anxiety <em>WarioWare-</em>style games with laid-back character interactions sounds like a bad match, you’ll be pleasantly surprised by how well it works in the game’s demo. It’s also just nice that you can get some of that <em>WarioWare </em>fun outside of a Nintendo platform.</p></div><div><p>It feels like no Steam Next Fest roundup can be truly complete without at least one retro-inspired horror game in the mix. So here’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Heartworm</em></a></span>. It’s a—say it with me now—retro-inspired horror game that bills itself as a love letter to the likes of <em>Resident Evil</em> and <em>Silent Hill</em>. What makes <em>Heartworm</em> stand out is its striking environmental design that always feels somewhere between a dream and reality, as well as the unique use of a camera as a weapon. This last bit clearly has ties to the game’s larger story and themes that the demo only touches on, but it’s a great teaser for a game that horror fans should keep their eyes on.</p></div><div><p>I can explain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2666920/Building_Relationships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Building Relationships</em></a></span> in simple terms but it won’t really do justice to this game’s brand of weirdness. You play as a house on an island full of other homes and structures and your goal is to fall in love. You’ll do this by rolling and jumping through the 3D world and then striking up conversations with potential matches. Also, there is fishing. I told you it was weird. Yet <em>Building Relationships</em> is also delightful, mostly thanks to some great writing that leans into the absurdity of the premise while never detracting too much from some interesting meditations on the struggle of finding love. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Former Horde Warchief Thrall as well as the Lich King will be featured on the Citrus Cherry flavor, while the relatively newer villain, Xal'atath, and elven hero Alleria Windrunner can be seen on the Citrus Blackberry packaging.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-franchise-sells-over-195-million-units-dragon-quest-sales-increasing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1846209551151849788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1846209551151849788%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new post</a> by MauroNL3 on X, it's reported that the Final Fantasy franchise has sold over 195 million units worldwide. Since September 30, 2023, the sales of the franchise have gone up by 10 million units. While this wasn't posted in any announcement made by Square Enix, it can be found in an 'about Square Enix, Inc.' message that is typically posted in press releases and on websites relating to the company or its games. In addition to the number of Final Fantasy sales increasing, it seems that the number for Dragon Quest has equally changed. Dragon Quest has now sold over 91 million units worldwide, which brings their total up by 3 million units as of September 30, 2023. Although these numbers may not be quite what Square Enix wants, it isn't exactly a bad number, either.</p>
<p>Square Enix has come out with a lot of great releases lately, including the Pixel Remasters, which includes Final Fantasy 1-6 in one purchase, as well as finally porting Final Fantasy XVI over to PC, which will have helped boost sales significantly. Despite that, Square Enix has reported their disappointment in their financial reports, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-underperformed-disappointing-profits/">the games still aren't selling</a> as much as they'd like. According to their latest financial report, both Final Fantasy XVI and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth heavily underperformed compared to previous Final Fantasy games, which has led them to make a huge change by working to release future games on multiple platforms rather than having them as PlayStation exclusive. Rumors have been swirling for a long time that they are working on porting recent Final Fantasy games to Xbox. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshi-p-says-xbox-players-should-not-give-up-hope-of-final-fantasy-xvi/">Yoshi-P has commented on this</a>, telling Xbox users not to lose hope.</p>
<p>While Square Enix's main focus is Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest has also been a mainstay franchise. Its first release was in 1986, and the latest release was Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince, which was released in December 2023. However, compared to other games in the franchise, this one didn't perform as well as it could have, receiving relatively mixed reviews. Although it didn't perform well, it still managed to sell a million copies by January 2024.</p>
<p>Games such as Dragon Quest Builders and Dragon Quest Builders 2 continue to perform incredibly well, but it's uncertain whether there are any Dragon Quest games in development at the moment, with Square Enix seemingly being focused on a new aggressive business plan which includes putting Final Fantasy onto other platforms other than just PlayStation 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-gets-first-post-launch-roadmap/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Saber Interactive and Focus Home Interactive have shared the first post-launch roadmap for Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. First and foremost, the first major (and free) update is coming very soon and will add a new Lethal difficulty for the PvE cooperative Operations mode. Moreover, a new PvE Operation titled&nbsp;Termination is being introduced. Here, players will face off against the Hierophant Bio-Titan, the largest threat the Tyranid swarm has up its sleeve. The arsenal is growing larger, too, with the addition of the Neo-Volkite pistol.</p>
<p>Later this year, Season Pass owners are getting new cosmetics based on the Dark Angels Chapter. This includes exclusive new weapon skins for the Auto bolt, rifle, Plasma Pistol, and Power Sword, in addition to a full-body armor skin for the Bulwark class, a new shield, and even more cosmetics.</p>
<p>Future seasons will feature new PvE cooperative Operations, a host of additions to PvP with a new game mode and new arenas, new Tyranid and Thousand Sons enemies, new weapons, a Horde mode, and other Space Marine chapter cosmetics for Gold and Ultra Edition owners via the Season Pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Post-Launch Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-aTR-9RYPu0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a reminder, Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-already-sold-two-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in just twenty-four hours since its launch. European sales data also <a href="https://wccftech.com/space-marine-2-is-the-2nd-best-selling-game-of-2024-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> it was the second best-selling new game in the continent this year after Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> a 7 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>In all, while Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc.1010181/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-officially-launches-today-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-and-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-beta-starts-september-13/">highly anticipated update</a> of New World has been released and is now available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1063730/New_World_Aeternum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a>. This is the first time that both console and PC players will be able to explore the haunting island of Aeternum, where there is a world full of danger and excitement but also plenty of opportunities for players to engage, whether it's as a solo player or grouping up with others. If you want to play the game with others, you'll have the opportunity to play with others using cross-platform online play, meaning you can team up with your friends who may be on a different platform to you.</p>
<p><iframe title="New World: Aeternum - Gameplay Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qK8jtTMHCRU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Those who are playing New World via PC can get New World: Aeternum at no additional cost as long as you have already bought New World and the Rise of the Angry Earth, which was a PC-specific expansion. For those who are on console, you will have to purchase New World: Aeternum, as Rise of the Angry Earth was never available for those on PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X|S, as this is the first time that the game is officially on console. However, with Aeternum now being released on console, players will finally get to experience the full base game as well as the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion.</p>
<p>"Millions of players have explored Aeternum on PC, and we're thrilled to welcome even more to New World: Aeternum with the console release," said Christoph Hartmann, Vice President of Amazon Games. "We have listened to player feedback and taken the time to create an unforgettable adventure that can be enjoyed either as a solo journey or together with friends across consoles and PC. New World: Aeternum is the definitive New World experience."</p>
<p>Aeternum is a major update to the title, as players will be able to explore new raid content where you'll have to explore the Hive of the Gorgons as a 10-person raid group where you have to face off against Broodmother Medusa herself, as she tries to raise an army of Hercyne.</p>
<p>For those who are looking for content that isn't grouping up with each other but rather pitted against each other, there is new PvPvE content where players get to enter the Cursed Mists in Cutlass Keys, where it's every player for themselves as you try to obtain rare loot. However, if you die, other players have the opportunity to snatch your loot away from you and walk away victorious.</p>
<p>If you want to get stuck into this title, New World: Aeternum is available to download digitally on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam for $59.99. If you want the Deluxe Edition, which includes the Corrupted Mauler Bear Mount and the Corrupted Soul Armor Skin, you can purchase it for $79.99.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-pc-specs-global-launch-timings</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-and-global-launch-timings-revealed.1010178/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-pc-specs-global-launch-timings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have revealed what kind of PC specs you're going to need to run&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, as well as the global launch timings for the game.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/specifications-spotlight?isLocalized=true" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new post on its official website</a>, EA says it's designed&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>"with flexibility in mind", a philosophy that extends not only to the game's PC specs but also to its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-accessibility-options">accessibility features</a>.</p>
<p>Two sets of specs are available, one with ray tracing enabled and the other with ray tracing disabled, in order to accommodate both high-end machines and lower-spec PCs. Hopefully, a wide range of PC gamers will be able to play <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>on release.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=iFzHgTwF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-pc-specs-bow.jpg?itok=eDmMdd1o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>has been designed to accommodate a fairly wide range of PCs.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's a quick rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>PC specs BioWare and EA announced today.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that all of these presets require at least 16GB of RAM, as well as 100GB of storage space (for which only the Minimum setting supports an HDD). You'll also need Windows 10 or 11 with 64-bit architecture and DirectX 12.</p>
<p>First up, here are the non-ray tracing presets.</p>
<h3>Minimum (1080p, 30fps, Low settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or GTX 1650, or AMD Radeon R9 290X</li>
<li>4GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1440p at 30fps or 1080p at 60fps, High settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 or AMD Radeon RX 5700XT</li>
<li>8GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>
</ul><p>Next, here are the specs you'll need if you want to play&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>with ray tracing enabled.</p>
<h3>RT Selective (4K at 30fps or 1440p at 60fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On (1440p at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>10GB VRAM</li>
</ul><h3>RT On and Ultra RT (4K at 30fps, Ultra settings)</h3>
<ul><li>Intel Core i9-12900K or AMD Ryzen 9 7950X</li>
<li>Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li>
<li>12GB VRAM</li>

In the grim darkness of the far future, you will not have to worry about getting preyed upon by rival Space Marine chapters whilst duffing up the Tyranids, for there are no plans to add a PvPvE mode to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. That's according to game director Dmitry Grigorenko, who observes that enjoyable PvPvE is the "holy grail" of game design, much-sought and seldom claimed. Balancing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> in which players fight both each other and the bots is tricky, especially in a game as prone to dousing the screen in giblets as Space Marine 2.

The comments in question were delivered unto <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/space-marine-2-no-plans-for-pvpve-saber-thinks-its-a-holy-grail-of-game-design">MP1st</a>. "PvPvE is a holy grail of game design," Grigorenko told the site. "A lot of studios are trying to find it and a lot of them fail. The truth is that it's a very very difficult task. It sounds great on paper, but when you actually start trying, it becomes apparent that it's very annoying when you fight other players only to get backstabbed by an AI opponent.</p>
<p>"This is why most of the games are trying to ensure that PvP and PvE aspects don't intersect that much, i.e. AI opponents are restricted to specific places on maps, etc," he went on. "It's a complicated mode to implement that would change the experience significantly, so I'm afraid there are no plans for it."
</p>
<p>
I've been writing a fair bit about Space Marine 2 and related topics behind the scenes, but I haven't spent any time in the game's PvP, so can't really comment on the reasonableness of all this. Still, it sounds like Space Marine 2 PvP is a lot more claustrophobic than, say, an extraction shooter such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/beautiful-lights-mix-of-stalker-and-hunt-showdown-is-masterfully-eerie-but-i-do-wish-it-wasnt-an-extraction-shooter">Beautiful Light</a>. Slop the PvP and PvE pots together, and I imagine the outcome would be the wrong kind of bloody mayhem. Mind you, this game <span tabindex="0">does have Chaos Space Marines in it</span>. A bit of <span tabindex="0">battle-brotherly betrayal</span> would be perfectly consistent with the plot.

Those majestic trees, those quaint little stores, the rich history, and, of course, a beautiful hotel right on the shores of the lake itself.</p><p>It all makes for a special place for the whole family. Sure, it’s easy to get overwhelmed walking the streets of Silent Hill, but don’t worry; whether you’re new in town, or enjoying a return trip for the first time in years, we’ve got tips for how to enjoy your stay to the fullest.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-recommend-id="image://f5a3f730fe7fad286397f5a5d31d1af7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a fence in front of a tunnel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Silent HIll 2</em> has changed a great deal in the last couple of decades, veterans do still have a minor advantage when wandering through town. The general layout is the same, though many of the stores and shops are now open for business, instead of just having health drinks inexplicably sitting on their doorsteps. If you remember where specific items were, try heading out that way anyway—either there’ll be something new at that location or, in a nice, understated bit of feedback, the game will actually shift to a different camera angle highlighting that location, with an audio sting and an unnerving breathing noise, just as a little nod to the old-schoolers out there.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-recommend-id="image://210c65048cd2ba663e349c2d071a95db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at the back of a car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s important to come to Silent Hill well-prepared and well-hydrated as you stroll through its streets and roads. You, as an eagle-eyed traveler—one whose head might actually turn and face important items in the environment, I should add—might see a local supermarket or fast food joint, but, oh no, they’re not open! Instead of friendly fast food workers serving meals with a smile, you get leggy mannequin monsters serving pain, and <em>hopefully</em> that’s just a vertical smile where the face should be. Thankfully, the good citizens of Silent Hill are more than happy to assist fellow travelers by leaving a goodly supply of nutritional drinks and ammunition in their cars. You may need to bust out the windows to get to your supplies, but, hey, the price is right.</p><p>That doesn’t just apply to cars, though. Don’t get too precious about storefront windows and doors, either. If it’s just a pane of glass between you and some of Silent Hill’s delicious nibbles, feel free to assume the owner won’t mind if you come on in.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-recommend-id="image://91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-recommend-id="image://91a6c7dc8fee45b28eb56ae15b1e5bd1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a chair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The locals of Silent Hill take the problem of light and noise pollution very seriously when it’s dark out. Though city folk might call them a bit nosy when they come poking around in your business, the residents are just trying to keep things pleasant in this special little town. Though as an out-of-towner, sometimes a little noise is unavoidable—for your own safety and well-being, you should consider keeping your lights off and your radios off as much as possible to avoid one of your fleshy neighbors checking up on what’s causing all the commotion.</p><p>And as an added incentive for your cooperation, if you should pick up a radio and immediately turn it off before even encountering a local, there’s a trophy/achievement in it for you.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-recommend-id="image://3af13c100bc85ac96f3bf7144bc9ef35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a dead monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A job worth doing is worth doing right, and that goes for anything, from grocery shopping, to building a house, to beating down an abominable fleshbeast until you start seeing white meat. But how do you really know for sure you did that last bit right, especially in a place where things have a terrible habit of coming back to life? Well, there’s a few things.</p><p>For starters, when it comes to most enemies, you’re going to have a devil of a time getting them down to begin with. Although while every enemy has their particular quirks, virtually all of them are at death’s door if you’ve gotten them off their feet. But your job’s not done yet, heavens no. You should stroll right over and make sure that enemy’s a goner by hitting them while they’re down with a melee weapon (Right Trigger by default). You’ll actually know you’re safe when you stop hitting them with melee weapons, and start stomping instead. If you’re dealing with groups, that single stomp should be your signifier that you can move on to the next problem. It’s as simple as that!*</p><p>*—except for the ones who spit acid because when those guys are down, they vomit more acid and can kill you in seconds—please don’t try to stomp them, they suck.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-recommend-id="image://30a9917604898b99a9248dea8b4b2bc1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1925" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a triangle-headed man through some blinds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Silent Hill has everything you need for some big beautiful fireworks displays launched from the various pistols, shotguns, and rifles scattered throughout the world, but a special thing just doesn’t remain special if it happens all the time. That’s why ammunition for those guns is so scarce around town.</p><p>Though it can be tricky, when faced with one of Silent Hill’s enthusiastic locals, the vast majority of conflicts can be handled with a face-to-face, hands-on conversation instead of a gun, so when a real problem presents itself with, say, the size of someone’s pyramid mask, or a pizza-loving townie decides that murder should be legal, you’ll be well-equipped to deal with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-recommend-id="image://de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-recommend-id="image://de0e158627d03bc5195a8c5b5c6bc23c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring at a lady." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>A stranger is just a friend you haven’t met, and Silent Hill is a great place to meet some new friends and have a great night on the town!

If you’re up close and personal, maybe steer the fight away from them, and be careful if they’re off to your right or left before you take a swing. If it’s a situation where a gun is involved, never fire if there’s a chance they might wind up in your way. They won’t appreciate it, we’re sure, and “one too many cocktails at Heaven’s Night” is <em>not</em> an excuse for poor gun safety.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-recommend-id="image://2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-recommend-id="image://2955e8643a4a5645eb3e8ff6da7b43fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Staring sadly into the middle distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Visitors come to Silent Hill for all kinds of reasons, and while most tourists have a perfectly pleasant experience, it’s very easy to ruin your good time and the good times of others.
