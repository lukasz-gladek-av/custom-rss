			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/673123/ftc-drops-case-microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition">The Verge</a>, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has officially dropped its case against Microsoft over its Activision Blizzard King acquisition. The organization <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/d9412_2025.05.22_commission_order_dismissing_complaint_.pdf">filed a motion to dismiss the case</a> today, May 22, 2025, finally closing the door on the FTC's attempts to block the largest acquisition in video game industry history.</p>
<p>Microsoft first announced its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King at <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">the beginning of 2022</a>, and by the end of 2022, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-microsoft-acquisition-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit/">FTC had filed a lawsuit against Microsoft</a>, and so began the long contest that has continued to stretch on, even <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-deal-free-to-proceed-ftc-pause-rejected-ninth-circuit/">after the FTC lost</a> in its one major change to really stop the deal from happening. At the beginning of this month, it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/662883/ftc-appeal-microsoft-activision-deal-acquisition">lost a final attempt</a> at stopping the deal and has chosen to put its fight to rest.</p>
<p>"<em>On May 7, 2025, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, FTC v. Microsoft Corp...denying the Commission's application for a preliminary injunction to block the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. by Microsoft Corp,</em>" the filing reads.</p>
<p>"<em>The Commission has determined that the public interest is best served by dismissing the administrative litigation in this case. Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Complaint in this matter be, and it hereby is, dismissed by the Commission</em>."</p>
<p>Vice chair and president of Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/BradSmi/status/1925660906702156072">Brad Smith celebrated the dismissa</a>l, saying "<em>Today's decision is a victory for players across the country and for common sense in Washington, D.C. We are grateful to the FTC for today's announcement.</em>"</p>
<p>After losing its initial attempt to stop the deal, Microsoft closed its acquisition of Activision Blizzard King in <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-closes-68-7-billion-activision-blizzard-deal-after-nearly-21-month-long-odyssey/">October 2023</a>, but that didn't stop the FTC from trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-appeal-against-judges-decision-hoping-to-delay-microsofts-closure-of-activision-blizzard-deal/">break it up</a> after the fact. The organization also spoke out against decisions Microsoft has made since the deal closed, like raising the price of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">laying off thousands of employees.</a></p>

            <p>
It's a kung fu kind of week on the Epic Games Store, thanks its latest headline freebie: developer Sloclap's acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a>, which arrives alongside several other free titles for mobile and PC.
</p>
<p>
In total, Epic is giving away three free games across PC, Android, and iOS this week, and they'll be sticking around for the next seven days. The full list looks like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sifu (PC)</li>
<li>Deliver At All Costs (PC)</li>
<li>Gigapocalypse (PC/mobile)</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<p>
Sifu's the biggie, of course, even if it's not the first time it's been <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu">free on the Epic Games Store</a>. For those unfamiliar, it taking players on a cinematic rampage of revenge through the streets of China. It's a game of pulverising, cathartic martial arts action, with the twist being its protagonist gets steadily older each time they're resurrected by their magical pendant upon death, despite the world around them staying the same.
</p>
<p>
"An elegant martial arts meditation on temporality and self-possession", is what Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirwell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">said in his Sifu review back in 2022</a>, and given all the improvements it's seen since then, it's well worth the (free) entry fee.
</p>
<p>
Epic's other two PC freebies this week come in the form of the newly released <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/deliver-at-all-costs-a30c8d">Deliver At All Costs</a> - a game of bizarre delivery missions across highly destructible environments, set somewhere in the 1950s - and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/gigapocalypse-fdc53b">Gigapocalypse</a>. This latter title sees players customising their own giant monsters, Kaijū style, and then setting out on a mission of mass destruction for an adventure developer Goody Gawewoks calls "loud, punk, metal, anarchy and a lovely homage to the game and movie classics."
</p>
<p>
Gigapocalypse is also available for free on iOS and Android via Epic's mobile store, but you'll need to be in the EU to access it on Apple devices.
</p>
<p>
All the above are available to download and keep via the Epic Games Store right now and will remain so until next Thursday, 29th May. After that, a fresh batch of (still mysterious) freebies will take their place.

But now, Valve <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1B71-EDF2-EB6D-2BB3">explicitly provides instructions</a> for getting that image working on a Legion Go or ROG Ally, even as it warns that “support for all devices that is not officially ‘Powered by SteamOS’ is not final.”</p><p>But even if you don’t care about rival handhelds, SteamOS 3.7 has a <em>lot</em> of improvements for the Steam Deck. I’ve been asking Valve to let me use my Bluetooth earbuds’ microphone since <em>launch</em>, and it’s finally happening in desktop mode (sadly not gaming mode yet) thanks to HFP/HSP profiles. You can turn on your Steam Deck LCD from across the room with a Bluetooth controller, a feature previously exclusive to the OLED model, which comes in handy when you’re docked to a TV.</p><p>Speaking of leaving it docked, you can now set a Battery Charge Limit to 80 percent for longevity’s sake if your handheld is always plugged in, you can frame-limit variable refresh rate displays, and control the P-state frequency of certain AMD CPUs.</p><p>It’s all underpinned by new versions of Arch Linux, new Mesa graphics drivers, a much newer version of the Plasma desktop mode, and more. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1675200%2Fview%2F820329049655084700" rel="sponsored">Here’s the full SteamOS 3.7.8 changelog</a>.</p><p>And, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamos%2F" rel="sponsored">an updated SteamOS FAQ</a> seems to suggest that Valve is ready to expand SteamOS beyond Lenovo and the Steam Deck. “We’re currently working with select partners on officially licensed Powered by SteamOS devices. Please reach out to us at <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=mailto%3Apoweredbysteamos%40valvesoftware.com">poweredbysteamos@valvesoftware.com</a> for more information about licensing SteamOS for your device,“ one answer reads.</p><p>But the industry is still waiting for Valve’s other shoe(s) to drop. Rumors are still heating up that we’re close to the launch of Valve’s wireless VR headset “Deckard,” and that it might be pointing the way towards a SteamOS-powered living room console too. Valve has been moving slow and steady, but it seems like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">a master plan for Steam Machines could finally be coming into focus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Unfortunately, 'bricking' personal devices to limit users’ rights and control their behavior is nothing new," Electronic Frontier Foundation attorney Victoria Noble told Ars Technica. "It would likely take selective enforcement to rise to a problematic level [in court]," attorney Richard Hoeg said.</p>
<p>Last year, a collection of 17 consumer groups <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/research/group-letter-ftc-software-tethering">urged the Federal Trade Commission</a> to take a look at the way companies use the so-called practice of "software tethering" to control a device's hardware features after purchase. Thus far, though, the federal consumer watchdog has <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/closing_letters/nid/160707nestrevolvletter.pdf">shown little interest</a> in enforcing complaints against companies that do so.</p>
<p>"Companies should not use EULAs to strip people of rights that we normally associate with ownership, like the right to tinker with or modify their own personal devices," Noble told Ars. "[Console] owners deserve the right to make otherwise legal modifications to their own devices without fear that a company will punish them by remotely bricking their [systems]."</p>
<h2>The court of public opinion</h2>
<p>In the end, these kinds of draconian bricking clauses may be doing their job even if the console makers involved don't invoke them. "In practice, I expect this kind of thing is more about scaring people away from jailbreaking and modifying their systems and that Nintendo is unlikely to go about bricking large volumes of devices, even if they technically have the right to," Loiterman said.</p>
<p>"Just because they put a remedy in the EULA doesn’t mean they will certainly use it either," attorney Mark Methenitis said. "My suspicion is this is to go after the people who eventually succeeded in jailbreaking the original Switch and try to prevent that for the Switch 2."</p>
<p>The threat of public backlash could also hold the console makers back from limiting the offline functionality of any hacked consoles. After citing public scrutiny that companies like <a href="https://www.jalopnik.com/tesla-remotely-removes-autopilot-features-from-customer-1841472617/">Tesla</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/keurig-stock-drops-10-percent-says-it-was-wrong-about-drm-coffee-pods/">Keurig</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/01/john-deere-relents-says-farmers-can-fix-their-own-tractors-after-all/">John Deere</a> faced for limiting hardware via software updates, Methenitis said that he "would imagine Nintendo would suffer similar bad publicity if they push things too far."</p>
<p>That said, legal capacities can sometimes tend to invite their own use. "If the ability is there, someone will want to 'see how it goes.'" Hoeg said.</p>

            <p>
The Six One Indie Showcase is a bit of a new kid on the block when it comes to video game presentations, but it's certainly working hard to justify itself. Early today the latest showcase was held showing off a huge range of indies, 48 in total, some of them being brand new reveals, others smaller showcases. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's honestly too many showcases around these days, to see a show with a lot of games that made me go "oh I'm going to put that on my wishlist" is a treat. So, here's just a few I think you should check out, because I'm just one freelancer on the night shift and I can't do them all, but I'd like you to take a look anyway.
</p>
<p>
First up was a proper reveal of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3239830">Truth Scrapper</a>, the next games from the dev behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-stars-and-time">In Stars and Time</a>. This one's a scrapbooking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-10-best-visual-novels-on-pc">visual novel</a> where your memories reset every day, but there's a mystery that you need to solve. Did I mention there's toxic lesbians? Instant winner.

I've had my eye on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1864000/Artis_Impact/">Artis Impact</a> for a little while now, an incredibly stylish pixelart turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> set in a world overrun by AI. Sounds a bit too relatable right now, but I'm still in.

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1141260/1000_Deaths_Thousand_Deaths/">1000 Deaths</a> is a "gravity-bending 3D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> where your choices matter", and also a game that looks like graphics card box art from the '90s and 2000s. To be clear, this is the highest of compliments I can hand out.

Okay, this one isn't a game per se, but it does also involve the number 1000. Last year's seminal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/1000xresist">1000xRESIST</a> is getting a <a href="https://www.veryokvinyl.com/?srsltid=AfmBOoq3PvLKTRCWUK91CwpewlE4CQNnP7ZMmMReUMB9c6eXcMP0Ktst">ridiculously gorgeous looking vinyl</a> set that comes in two versions - one with one set of sisters, one with another. The recent fanzine for the game (which you can download for free on <a href="https://0x0ada.itch.io/blue-communion">itch.io</a>) is getting a physical edition too!

Then we've got <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3414580/Forbidden_Solitaire/">Forbidden Solitaire</a>, a "card-slashing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game about unearthing the contents of a cryptic 1995 CD-ROM that should have never existed." This one's for the card game weirdos (I am card game weirdos).

<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2946390/Jump_the_Track/">Jump the Track</a> mixes choice based visual novels with pachinko, following an ambitious slacker called Sam who doesn't understand why we're supposed to spend our lives working awful jobs while the rich get to live it up.

I think you just need to watch the trailer for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727660/GlitchSPANKR/">GlitchSPANKR</a>, I think any approach I take to explaining it will get it wrong.

And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2681870/Kidbash_Super_Legend/">Kidbash: Super Legend</a>, a very charming and nostalgic-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> action-platformer set in a "world of forgotten game characters as a hero with no memory of his past."

The Six One Indie Showcase really did just have what looked like banger after banger, it'll be worth your time to go and <a href="https://youtu.be/adI4uizTYN4?si=VLceKYiRPwY-JyPj">watch the full thing</a> and get wishlisting anything else that catches your eye.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The first item I ever picked up in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon that wasn’t clothing or weapons was smut. I know what you’re thinking. “Will, you degenerate, <em>of course</em> it was smut. We know all about you, bro.” Listen. I didn’t know it was smut. But I learned <em>real quick</em>. I found it in what looked like the guard’s break area after I was busted out of my cell. I don’t remember what happened next; there was a drawing of a very pretty woman, and then I read the phrase “love apples” and blacked out. But I’m getting ahead of myself – let me back up a bit and tell you about my experience with this fun but familiar open-world RPG so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon is a reimagining of Arthurian myth. When his homeland is overwhelmed by a plague known as the Red Death, Arthur leads his people to Avalon, conquers the island, and (with Merlin’s help) cleanses the land of the Wyrdness – a chaotic, primordial force capable of reshaping the landscape and the beings in it. That was 600 years ago. Now, the old legends are gone, the Wyrdness has creeped back into Avalon, and the Red Death has returned. You play as a no-name prisoner of the Red Priests, who are desperately searching for a cure. It's a cool setup, and one that gives you everything you need to know while preserving Fall of Avalon’s greater mysteries.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief cutscene that lays all of this out, you’re dropped into a character creator. What’s here is fine, but it’s kind of hard to make a character that looks particularly good, mostly because everyone’s skin looks like it was made out of Play-Doh. Everything else about the process is fine, though, and certain things, like the hair, are really impressive. Besides, you’re going to spend basically all of Fall of Avalon in first-person anyway, unless you opt for the optional and (by the developer’s own admission) not-very-polished-and-mostly-intended-for-accessibility third-person mode. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’re done creating your doughy hero, you’re dropped into a jail cell. Now, if you’re a person who has only ever played <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-review">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>, you’re probably getting huge Oblivion vibes from this. Fall of Avalon does clearly owe a debt to The Elder Scrolls throughout, but don’t let that sense of familiarity fool you — it’s definitely a game with its own ideas. One thing I appreciated was the decision to have your character’s starting stats allocated by how you respond to an interrogation by a guard. I wanted to specialize in ranged combat with a trusty bow and arrow, so I told him I was hunting before being taken in, and then I used what I bagged to make clothes. That meant boosts to the associated stats. I wasn’t even out of prison yet, and I was already making something of myself. Who says rehabilitation doesn’t work?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As far as first-person melee combat goes, this feels pretty good.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not going to spoil how you get out of your cell, but you do get out (I like to think of it as time off for good behavior), and the first tooltip I got as I navigated the prison told me how to parry. An ominous sign, to be sure, but as far as first-person melee combat goes, Fall of Avalon feels pretty good. Hits have weight and impact, and when you block an attack, you’ll often stagger a bit. Even weapon choices matter. I used a club early on, but once I got my first knife, I could immediately feel the difference when I hit some poor guy. Less impact, but a very nice slicing sound. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I haven’t landed a single parry yet (the window is pretty tight, or at least it feels that way to me), but I’m glad that I really haven’t <em>had </em>to so far either. Blocking works just fine and you’ve got a nice backstep if you need to quickly disengage. This combat probably isn’t going to win any awards for re-defining what first-person RPG fights look like (although hey, I’m early, who knows?), but it’s engaging enough to keep my attention.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon 1.0 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Otherwise, a lot of the 5 hours I’ve played of Fall of Avalon so far has been spent exploring, accidentally picking up smut, talking to people, and so on. This is a pick up everything, speak to everybody, the world exists to be your playground kind of game, and if you’ve played The Elder Scrolls, you’ll probably be right at home. Yes, I need to pick up that bucket, and the one next to it. Why wouldn’t I? I might <em>need it</em>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m still very early in Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon. This is a <em>big</em> RPG, and I have a lot more to see and do before my final review, but I dig what’s here as someone who’d read way too much Arthurian literature. Nothing I’ve seen really feels incredibly unique yet, but what’s here is at least <em>interesting. </em>Now I just have to avoid killer rabbits. I’ll bet you anything there’s one around here somewhere.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The dark sci-fi spin on a typing teacher was shadow-dropped during a series of announcements made during the latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls Showcase</a>. Also shown was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rG19wrCGR5g">trailer for <em>Boltgun 2</em></a>, a sequel to Auroch Digital’s first-person shooter the new typing game is based on.</p><p><em>Words of Vengeance </em>follows in the footsteps of games like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/30/5046068/play-this-typing-of-the-dead-overkill-sequel-released">Typing of the Dead</a></em> where you type on-screen prompts as quickly and as accurately as you can to defeat enemies and progress in on-rails levels.

But as much as I love <a href="http://monkeytype.com/">Monkeytype</a> or <a href="https://www.keybr.com/">Keybr</a>, an actual typing game offers a different kind of fun. The thought of going full boomer-shooter with my proper grammar and punctuation exercises just has me more stoked than ever. Plus, it’s free. </p><p>Brother! It’s time to get those fingers moving. More blood for the blood god!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to Ultron, a new playable character, there's a new map, a new limited-time mode, and a ton of balance changes.</p><p>Despite his character history of destruction and conquest, Ultron is a strategist, Marvel Rivals' healer class. He's also the first healer who can fly, placing him among the ranks of characters like Human Torch and Iron Man. Based on what we can see in the trailer, his primary fire is a laser that ends with a burst of damage, and he can both heal allies and grant them shield.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUSbKQO674w"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUSbKQO674w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Ultron will be accompanied by a new map, Arakko. "Once Krakoa's sister island, Arakko has lost all its vitality," creative director Guanguang says in the video update. It's been overrun by a somehow-even-more-evil version of Ultron after he combined himself with Cerebro to become X-tron.</p><p>A new limited-time mode called Ultron's Battle Matrix Protocol will be available on June 6. It's a single-player mode where you assemble a roster of computer-controlled heroes to battle enemies while you observe from the sky as one of Ultron's drones. By unlocking buffs and abilities, the battles can get wacky, as the video shows off a massive Venom, a rapidly firing Hela, and a Namor with an army of Monstro spawn turrets.</p><p>Season 2.5 also comes with a smattering of balance adjustments. Groot, Captain America, Emma Frost, Iron Fist, Human Torch, and Psylocke will all receive buffs, while Doctor Strange, Magneto, Squirrel Girl, and Punisher will all receive buffs. Meanwhile, Jeff will receive a "partial adjustment for a fresh experience," reworking several of his key abilities. You can read the specific changes for each character&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250522/41667_1236166.html">here</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtEMrHcLDA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtEMrHcLDA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Team-up abilities, one of the game's most notable features, are also receiving some changes. Team-ups between Hawkeye and Black Widow, Rocket and Punisher, Luna Snow and Jeff, and Spider-Man, Venom, and Peni are all being removed, and Iron Man is no longer a part of the team-up with Hulk and Namor. However, six new team-ups will be added to compensate: Luna Snow and Hawkeye, Jeff and Storm (who combine ultimates to make a Jeff-nado), Jeff and Venom, Punisher and Black Widow, Rocket and Peni, and Iron Man and Ultron. You can find the full details of each team-up and a list of team-ups that are changing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/balancepost/20250522/41667_1236166.html#:~:text=55%20to%2050.-,TEAM%2DUP%20ABILITIES,-NEW">right here</a>.</p><p>Finally, Marvel Rivals will receive some new cosmetic options, including emojis you can use to react mid-game, moods you can add to your character nameplate, and the ability to see your Lord character portraits in the character select screen at the start of the game.</p><p>The season 2.5 update goes live on May 30. For more Marvel Rivals, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/marvel-rivals/a-super-shooter">you can read our review</a>, where we called the game "a culmination of the successful shooters that came before it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As much as I'm up for trying a new one whenever one arrives, I'm not particularly good at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>. It just gets too sweaty for me, I prefer a good single-player shooter above all else because I can actually take down my opponents without the fear of embarrassing myself somehow. And yet here we are again, with the open beta for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a>, which started earlier today, leaving me thinking "well, I could give it a go I suppose."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, I haven't actually had a go yet because, well, I'm a bit busy letting you all know that you can go and play it, and what it contains. Gotta earn a living somehow. Anyway, there's a lot! The biggest thing is The Lab, which is essentially its new map creator that was teased in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-is-almost-ready-for-you-try-it-out-as-the-portal-with-actual-guns-shooter-sets-a-date-for-its-open-beta">initial open beta trailer</a>. This pretty much does what it says on the tin, i.e. you can build your own maps and game modes. Pretty great fit for a game that combines Halo and Portal!
</p>

<p>
Then there's the return of Takedown, a team-based mode where if you kill an opponent your team's respawns are shorter, but if you get killed your respawns take longer. If you manage to down every enemy at the same time, you win! Stadium 2.0, a rework of the map from the original game, arrives with the beta too. There's also new 24-player onslaught maps, for those that like a bit more chaos. 
</p>
<p>
Hunt the Devs will also be returning from the open alpha, which isn't a mode so much as an achievement to set out. If you find a 1047 dev wearing a special flaming disco ball skin, you'll get a Dev Killer skin for the faction they're playing in return.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/1047-games">1047 Games</a> say that "one more massive surprise" is yet to be shown off, planned to be revealed whenever the game enters 1.0. There's no date set for that just yet, but player progression will continue on to the full game, so don't feel like you have to wait around for it. To sign-up to the beta, all you need to do is head to the <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/">game's official website</a>, and pick your platform of choice. Easy peasy!

It’s outrageous. The 1960s TV show has games. The first of Cruise’s movies, 1996's <em>Mission: Impossible,</em> has a game. (No Tom Cruise likeness <em>in </em>the game, though.) Why aren’t I playing the <em>Just Cause-</em>like game<em>&nbsp;</em>based on the franchise right now? I demand answers. But in the meantime, let’s look back at all the games that <em>do</em> exist, and wonder quietly to ourselves if that was actually a good idea.</p></div><div><p>The very first <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, albeit an unofficial one, came out in 1979. And no, that’s not a typo. Scott Adams (no, thank god, not the <em>Dilbert</em> one) and Irene Adams made a series of text adventures after being inspired by Scott’s colleagues who created the seminal <em>Colossal Cave Adventure</em> in 1976. Widely considered to be a joint founders of the entire genre, the Adamses made a series of text adventure games (what you kids now call Interactive Fiction) for the TRS-80 in the late ‘70s, one of which was originally called <em>Mission Impossible </em>(without the distinctive colon that’s officially in the title of the TV shows and movies)<em>.</em></p><p>Things were a bit of a wild west back then, given that there wasn’t really a vast home gaming industry. The game featured a spy called Phelps after the main character of the original show, who begins sat in front of a tape recorder containing a message that begins much like those on the show often did. “Good morning Mr. Phelps. Your Mission (should you decide to accept it) is to prevent this automated nuclear reactor from being destroyed by a saboteur’s TIME BOMB!” Perhaps it’s not surprising that the owners of the TV show  threatened legal action.</p><p>This led to all manner of names ending up attached to the game, the most common being <em>Secret Mission</em>, which was added to the already-printed boxes via a cheaply produced gold sticker. It’s something of a joy that one of the first ever popular text adventures should be such a brazen rip-off.</p></div><div><p>Tempting as it is to include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ivHFP3dJAkM?si=g7NEpA5WDt7Zu3Bf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the fantastic <em>Impossible Mission</em> platform/puzzle games</a></span> of the 1980s in this list, they don’t really count, though they <em>do </em>still feature the greatest somersaults in gaming history. So instead we jump forward to 1990, when the Nintendo Entertainment System was blessed with a game based on the short-lived 1988 reboot of the TV series. </p><p>This time we have an officially licensed game, developed by Konami, that was released just in time to mark the TV version’s cancellation after just 35 episodes. (The original 60s/70s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> ran for 171 episodes, with Leonard Nimoy appearing in 49 of them.) The IMF team is tasked with rescuing Jane Badler’s character, Shannon Reed, along with “Dr. O,” an IMF scientist, all through the magic of top-down 1990 action.</p><p>You could switch between three characters, Max Harte, Grant Collier and Nicholas Black, each with their own skills as they charged through Venice, Switzerland, and all those good Eurozone adventure locations. </p></div><div><p>It’s a year later, and there’s a second licensed game from the franchise! But this time, it’s a graphic adventure! This time <em>published</em> by Konami but developed by Distinctive Software, makers of many a TV/movie tie-in game, this was very much an attempt to muscle in on Sierra’s territory, complete with a near lift of Sierra’s distinctive row of interaction options across the top of the screen.</p><p>It was then made more complicated by playing in real-time, with four characters to control at once as you tracked down terrorists, bugged phones and infiltrated enemy HQs. Only Jim Phelps appears to have made it over from the TV shows, however, with new characters to chose from, including the extraordinarily spelt “Rodger.”</p><p>What’s so surprising about this game is that I’d simply never heard of it, despite being 14 years old at the time of its release and playing every graphic adventure I could get my hands on. However, its midi rendition of the theme tune really should have made it an all-time classic. </p></div><div><p>Slipping subtly past Micro Games of America’s 1996 dedicated handheld game based on the series, we next find the spies appearing in video games in 1998, with the Tom Cruise era of <em>Mission: Impossible </em>now underway. And it’s on N64 (and a year later, PlayStation). Sometimes known as <em>Mission: Impossible - Expect the Impossible</em>, this console game was intended to be a tie-in with the first of the Cruise-led movies. Except, keen chronologers will note, 1998 was two years after 1996.</p><p>This was originally supposed to be created by Ocean, a studio famous for its movie-based games. Think <em>RoboCop</em>, <em>Platoon</em>, <em>Total Recall</em>, and <em>Lethal Weapon</em>, all improbably realized as side-scrolling action games. That wasn’t the plan this time, however—ambitions were far higher. <em>Mission: Impossible </em>was an attempt to create something in the style of Rare’s <em>GoldenEye 007</em>, and, well, it wasn’t going great.</p><p>After three years in development, and the slow realization that the N64 wasn’t powerful enough for their plans, Ocean was bought by Infogrames in 1997, and a whole new team was assigned to the project. Apparently at that time, the game was running <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1998/03/18/men-on-a-mission" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at four frames per second</a></span>. Things were made harder by Viacom, owners of the film rights, refusing to let the game feature too much gun-based violence, and Tom Cruise refusing to allow his face to be in games The new team wound up crunching for months.</p><p>Yet, despite all this, it went on to sell over a million copies, even though its reviews weren’t exactly great. A late ‘90s <em>IGN</em> went as low as a 6.6, which was about as a low a score as the site back then would give. </p></div><div><p>It was four long years between Brian de Palma’s original Tom Cruise movie and John Woo’s somewhat unlikely follow-up. So it was that as late as 1999, the Game Boy Color’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game was still based on that first film. But this time it was as all movie-based games should be: an isometric action game. </p><p>Incredibly, this belated tie-in was the work of developer Rebellion, who that same year brought us the landmark <em>Alien Versus Predator</em> on PC, and are now best known for an infinite number of <em>Sniper Elite</em> games (as well as this year’s <em>Atomfall</em>). There were all sorts of ambitious ideas, including an entirely game-irrelevant Agent Action Kit that let you use your GBC as a calculator, address book, and a notebook that could print stuff out on your Game Boy Printer. Sadly, none of these were part of the game itself, which was deeply mediocre.</p></div><div><p><em>Mission: Impossible - Operation Surma</em> came out in 2003 on PS2, alongside a very different and much worse version on Game Boy Advance. It seems unfair to put them into the same slide, given they’re made by entirely different developers.</p><p>By this point, Infogrames had begun wearing the ill-fitting skin of the long-dead Atari, and like so many games of the era, had two lots of developers make two versions of a game with the same name. For the GBA, it was M4 Ltd, a small UK developer that seemingly only made GBA games based on existing licenses. So alongside <em>Antz World Sportz</em> and <em>Mary-Kate and Ashley: Winner’s Circle</em>, they also created the handheld incarnation of the movie tie-in.</p><p>Set between the events of <em>Mission: Impossibles 2 </em>and <em>III</em>, <em>Operation Surma </em>finds our espionaging heroes trying to stop the evil Surma group from releasing a virus called ICEWORM which can disable any type of security system. As you’d expect, you go all over the world in your efforts, although on the GBA version you do this in painfully static 2D, rather than in the PS2 version’s 3D action. </p><p>This version got an absolute kicking by the press, with <em>Cheat Code Central</em> stating, “I would have had more fun gluing spray-painted macaroni to my ass than playing <em>Mission Impossible: Operation Surma</em> on the GBA.”</p></div><div><p>OK, so this version was far better received, although not exactly widely loved. It was, as you can tell from the video, an <em>entirely</em> different game from the GBA incarnation. (As I say, this was common, but didn’t always end badly. The <em>Tony Hawk</em> GBA games, for instance, were masterpieces.)</p><p>A third-person action game, it was packed with missions, spy tech, and a big cast of characters. And, rather importantly, it was attempting not to recreate the plot of one of the movies, but rather to bridge the time between the second and third films in the franchise.</p><p>Developed by Texan team Paradigm Entertainment, who were best known for the N64's <em>Pilotwings 64</em>,  it was a perfect example of that most damned gaming territories: fine. It was fine. As 7/10 as a game can be. It tried to do loads, it had excellent ambitions, but it all just fell a little flat without ever being bad.</p><p>Yet, as Zack laments, it also marked the last console-based attempt to make a <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game. Why? Perhaps enough average-to-bad games had convinced Atari that the license wasn’t proving likely to get results? Or perhaps people were just fed up with Tom Cruise for being such a bloody spoilsport, and not letting his face or voice appear in any of the games. (Incidentally, Ving Rhames and John Polson showed up to voice their characters in <em>Operation Surma</em>!)</p></div><div><p>That’s right, we get near to the end of our round-up of every <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game ever with 2006's <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the mobile-only tie-in for the 2006 J.J. Abrams threequel. </p><p>Created by Gameloft, who have also brought us <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> and <em>Sexy Poker: Top Models</em> (alongside the <em>Asphalt </em>franchise and a billion other mobile IPs), this game was only ever released for phones, as were numerous other licensed Gameloft games of the era.</p><p>Was it any good? I don’t know! It was released for mobile only in 2006! The game’s in portrait. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-iii/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pocket Gamer </em>liked it at the time</a></span>, though, and while Carolyn here on staff hasn’t played it, she’s heard good things about a number of Gameloft’s mobile-only efforts of the era.</p></div><div><p>I don’t think anyone’s ever even heard of this web-only game from developers Funtactix, and having watched the video above, I think that may be for the best.</p></div><div><p>Glu Mobile’s 2015 tie-in <em>Rogue Nation </em>looks like a visually impressive gallery shooter, at least<em>. </em>In his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation/review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief review of the game for <em>Pocket Gamer</em></a></span>, Ric Cowley says all that probably needs to be said about it: “If you stick with it, there’s a perfectly average game in here. But it’s so repetitive that you’ll have seen everything it has to offer in ten minutes.” </p><p>It’s now been over 20 years since there was a proper <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game for console or PC, despite the movies being such a massive deal. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-tom-cruise-movie-game-1850637210">Zack correctly laments</a></span>, this is a series ripe for a fantastic video game. It’s somehow never received one. Perhaps making that hypothetical, great <em>Mission: Impossible </em>game is the most impossible mission of all.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's been a busy day in the grimdark world of Warhammer 40K, thanks to its latest video game focused <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a>. Not only have we learned a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-dawn-of-war-and-space-marine-1-spruce-ups-are-coming-this-year">couple of classics getting a spruce-up</a>, there's brand-new stuff coming too, including a Boltgun sequel, new tactical RPG Dark Heresy, plus a smattering of fresh DLC.
</p>
<p>
Warhammer 40K: Boltgun 2, which seems as good a place as any to start, is exactly what it sounds like - a follow-up to developer Auroch Digital's acclaimed 2023 retro shooter Boltgun. Details are relatively limited at present, but it'll pick up immediately after the events of the first game, and offer another helping of old-school-inspired FPS action over the course of its branching single-player campaign. There's talk of new locations - "from the colossal heights of a hive city to the impenetrable mangrove swamps of a jungle" - plus new weapons and never-before-seen foes, including the ferocious Bloodletters and their daemonic Juggernauts.

<p>
All that's coming to Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3115160/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun_2/">PC</a> sometime in 2026. However! There's an extra - and more immediate - treat for Boltgun fans in the form of Boltgun: Words of Vengeance. This "first person typer" twist on the retro shooter - in which players must deploy their QWERTY skills for maximum carnage - is entirely free and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3533730/Warhammer_40000_Boltgun__Words_of_Vengeance/">available to download on Steam</a> today.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere in the gloomy world of Warhammer 40K, developer Owlcat has announced Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy, a "narrative-driven tactical RPG" set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. "Players will lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption," the studio explains, "from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary."

There's talk of full voice acting, "intricate investigations", turn-based combat, and "choices that carry grave consequences", all said to build on the ideas introduced in Owlcat's Rogue Trader. And if that sounds intriguing, Dark Heresy is coming to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3710600/Warhammer_40000_Dark_Heresy/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warhammer_40000_dark_heresy">GOG</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-4cf5b0">Epic</a>) at some currently undisclosed future point.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of Rogue Trader, Owlcat has <em>also</em> announced a 24th June release date for the game's second expansion, Lex Imperialis. This introduces a faction of "incorruptible enforcers" known as the Adeptus Arbites, plus a new companion - Solomorne Anthar - across its 15-hour storyline. Additionally, the studio has revealed it's working on a Season Pass 2 for Rogue Trader, bundling together an appearance customisation pack and two more 15-hour expansions - each featuring new quests and a new companion. The first of these expansions takes players to a Necron vault curated by Trazyn the Infinite, where they'll encounter ancient guardians and uncover relics relating to the Von Valancius legacy. The second new expansion promises a "descent into madness and mystery" as they explore a "surreal" voidship graveyard.

<p>
And while we're on the subject of DLC, there's one last bit of business to discuss in the form of Space Marine 2's new Siege mode. This "endless" PvE mode for the acclaimed shooter unfolds on Kadaku, where three players must survive against ever-more-deadly waves of Tyranid and Chaos as they attempt to defend an Imperial fortress. It'll be playable on Steam via developer Saber Interactive's Public Test Server starting 4th June, and it gets its full release across all platforms as part of a free update on 26th June.

<p>
All of which pretty much covers the big Warhammer 40K news, but it's probably also worth mentioning there are currently significant discounts across a huge number of Warhammer games on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as part of today's Warhammer Day celebrations.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-video-game-is-also-a-hockey-training-tool.1196889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been playing hockey for a little more than a year now. I’m not very good, but I am getting better. In between games, I’ve been using an in-development game and training tool called <a href="https://www.dangleverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dangleverse</em></a>, which helps me practice outside of the rink.</p><p>Hockey is an expensive sport. The equipment simply costs a lot, and you’re paying a rink every time you step on the ice.I get out there to practice pretty frequently. I play in either pickup or league games twice a week, practice with a coach, and drop into public skating sessions whenever I can.&nbsp; There are ways to practice at home, and I do that too, like shooting pucks at a net in my garage. Occasionally, I’ll aimlessly stickhandle a golf ball around my living room floor.</p><p>There’s, of course, equipment you can buy to optimize stickhandling practice off-ice, be it training panels that light up or obstacles to move the puck around. These often require the player to look down at the tools; for the complicated trainers that light up as an indicator of where to move up, it’s especially important to be looking directly down at the device. But in hockey, looking up is essential. You need to be able to see your teammates and opponents.&nbsp;</p><p>It requires two devices, but I’m using three — my phone to track the puck, my husband’s iPad to display the video game, and then casting the video game to TV. On the floor, I’ve set up the faux ice panel I typically shoot off of in my garage. That’s what my phone is pointed at, using a macgyvered stand, to track my stick and puck. The puck is essentially the controller, and your stick is your fingers pushing its joystick around. Looking up at the screen, I use my stick to push the puck around and make the on-screen character dodge walls and collect coins.</p><p>It’s quite simple, and I’ve only played it on the easy mode so far. But I can see the value both as a training tool and simply for fun. My husband and I are already trying to prove who’s got the best stickhandling and reaction skills, <em>and</em> I’m working on an essential mechanic while building strength in my wrists. (Stickhandling is really taxing on the arm holding the top of the stick; there’s a lot of quick wrist movements.)</p><p>Nickolay Lamm, <em>Dangleverse</em>’s creator, told me that the idea started as a Peloton for hockey; he and two others actually first built a small miniature hockey rink. But that was too far, something too inaccessible. They started thinking about software and a way to use tracking technology Lamm had been working on to make a stickhandling video game. Lamm said it took about five or six months to make a demo.</p><p>“The risk in this whole little adventure was, <em>What if what you see on this game is too laggy for the speed of a hockey puck?</em>” he said. “That was my risk, because no one had ever made a video game based off a sports object, especially something as fast moving as a hockey puck.”</p><p>It works pretty well, with minimal lag — at least, if you have a good internet connection. Lamm said with a good internet connection, there’s about five frames of lag, “which is actually pretty similar to what you get from a normal joystick.”</p><p>Lamm intends <em>Dangleverse</em> to be fun first, training second. “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/heybarber/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">People like [hockey influencer] Pavel Barber</a>, for example, they’re extremely skilled hockey players,” Lamm said. “They can do things which no one else does, but if you look at their TikTok feeds, there’s no training. It’s all entertainment.” Lamm’s right; Barber’s Instagram page is filled with skits, like one where he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJz6zyzumGe/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attacks a training dummy dressed as ref in increasingly ridiculous ways</a>, another where he takes <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DISeR0JMPSy/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a slapshot using a comically long stick while standing on a Zamboni</a>, or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DG9HJAROfcA/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series where he attempts to Michigan</a> with things that aren’t hockey sticks. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDDr77EGSQE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Michigan is a lacrosse-style move</a> wherein the player scoops up a puck to toss it into the net, rather than shoot it. It’s very hard.)</p><p>“In much of the same way, this product is all entertainment and training is just a side effect,” Lamm said. “You know, kids play hockey all day. And the last thing they want to do is more training at home.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-journals"><h3>Clair Obscur’s Real Heroes Came Before Expedition 33</h3></a><p>The game's journals can be helpful, insightful, or just really funny</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/22/boomer-shooter-sequel-warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Auroch Digital has announced a sequel to their well-received Warhammer 40K boomer shooter. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG19wrCGR5g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Boltgun 2 will follow on directly from the end of the first game, giving your Space Marine a new branching single-player campaign to rampage through, blasting heretics, Chaos Space Marines, demons and everyone else that gets in your way. There’s new Blooletters, demonic Juggernauts and more on the way.</p>
<p>Building on the combat of the first game, you’ll still be able to charge straight into battle with the chainsword in hand, and a wide arsenal of 40K weapons to blast them with. The new campaign will visit new worlds, going from the heights of a hive city to the mangrove swamps of a jungle.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun launched in 2023 and was a great slice of old school FPS action, blended with the increasingly popular Warhammer 40,000 universe. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">our Boltgun review</a>, Dom said, “Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun is a brisk, brutal boomer shooter and another great reason for a visit to Games Workshop’s science fiction theatre.”</p>

<p>The first game is currently available within <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/may-2025s-ps-plus-monthly-games-features-balatro-boomer-shooting-dinos/">PS Plus Monthly Games for May 2025</a>.</p>

		<p>Owlcat Games has announced that their next game, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, is now in development. This CRPG will tell a new story within the Calixis Sector, the same region of space that was featured in their last game, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmfu_Spm-6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s some of the announcement blurb:</p>
<p><em>By the decree of the Holy Inquisition, you have been chosen for a perilous mission that will dictate the future of the Calixis Sector. Become an agent of the Holy Golden Throne and hunt down all those who would dare stray from the Emperor’s light. Hold fast to your duty, eradicate the enemies of the Imperium and battle the horrors of the void in the long-anticipated Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy!</em></p>
<p><em>Explore the Warhammer 40,000 universe like you’ve never seen it before! Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy is an upcoming turn-based CRPG with a unique and thrilling narrative that follows the shadowy agents of the Inquisition. Take on the mantle of an Inquisitor, and use every tool at your disposal to root out corruption, sedition and heresy, bringing the Emperor’s wrath to those who would see the Imperium fall. Hunt down clues, investigate mysteries, and uncover vile conspiracies.</em></p>

<p>Playing as an Inquisitor will afford you extraordinary privileges within the 40K grim dark universe. In particular, Inquisitors have the freedom to align themselves with alien races, if this prove beneficial to your mission. Five companions have been revealed alongside the announcement including the medical specialist Epione Spes, Catachan fighter Haymaar Devos, and the Ogryn Conscript 0-118-B (AKA Cogg). However, there’s also a Kroot warrior, Ra’akhti, and and Eldar Cosair, Laarthyr Cainareth.</p>
<p>If Rogue Trader is anything to go by, this is going to be another vast CRPG from Owlcat, with Rogue Trader promising over 130 hours of game time. Of course, there’s even more game time if you account for the 15-ish hours each in Void Shadows and Lex Imperialis. This second expansion is set to release on 26th June, so the announcement of Dark Heresy is perfectly timed to make the studio’s shift between projects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>SEGA and Relic Entertainment have announced Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition, a remaster of the original Warhammer 40K: Space Marine that initially launched on PS3, Xbox 360, and PC in 2011.</p>
<p>Announced during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4A1s4DH78w">Warhammer Skulls livestream event</a>, this remaster will be arriving on PC and Xbox Series X/S in a matter of weeks on <strong>June 10, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>There's currently no news regarding a potential PS5 launch, though it could just be because this will be a timed console-exclusive for Xbox Series consoles. It'll also be available to play through Xbox Game Pass on day one.</p>
<p>Developer SneakyBox was the studio SEGA chose to work on this remaster, and is a "<em>thoughtful restoration</em>" of the original game, according to SneakyBox producer Vaidas Mikelskas (per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-warhammer-40000-space-marine-gets-surprise-master-crafted-edition-on-pc-and-xbox-game-pass-but-theres-no-ps5-version">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>"<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine - Master Crafted Edition isn't just a technical upgrade - it's a thoughtful restoration. We aimed to preserve the spirit of the original while modernizing the experience for today's players. This is more than just Master Crafted Edition, it's a respectful dialogue between past and present, preserving what made the original special while making it shine for a new generation of players</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7YxYLWIJfP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This new version lets players enjoy the first Space Marine game at 4K with remastered audio, an overhaul to the control scheme, improved character models, textures, and all of it is applied to the original game and every bit of downloadable content it received in the years after launch.</p>
<p>You can add the Space Marine Master Crafted Edition to your wishlist on Steam, Xbox, and the Epic Games Store, and it'll be available on June 10 for $39.99 USD. Last year, the long-awaited sequel, Space Marine 2, was one of the biggest games of the year. Though it might not have reinvented the wheel, it provided a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/">very fun and bloody time, even if it was repetitive</a>.</p>
<p>Following up that success with a remaster of the first game is great news for fans of Space Marine 2, especially those new to the series, as they now have the chance to revisit the first game without having to play the original 14-year-old version.</p>
<p>Also announced during today's Warhammer Skulls event was <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-is-owlcats-next-inquisition-themed-crpg/">Warhammer 40K: Dark Heresy</a>, the next Warhammer CRPG from Owlcat.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relax-on-beach-with-elizabeth-hargraves-newest-game-sanibel</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/relax-on-beach-with-elizabeth-hargraves-newest-game-sanibel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Elizabeth Hargrave is working on a new board game. The same creative mind behind the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wingspan</em></a> and the environmentally minded <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/undergrove-kickstarter-ends-campaign-over-6000-funded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Undergrove</em></a> is working on a mild game about exploring a beach called <em>Sanibel</em>.</p>

<h2>The Sanibel Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Sanibel</em> is a laid-back tile placement board game inspired by summer days on the beach, hunting for shells. Players can explore the shore, putting seashells into a bag and earning points on how they are arranged in the bag. You can also earn points by observing the waves crashing into the shoreline and exploring a nearby lighthouse.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sanibel-board-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=f-kj6C_b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sanibel-board-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=-Ia299nz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At the end of the game, each player will have a collage of beautiful watercolor shells, sand dollars, and shark teeth. Whoever has the most points by the end of their trek on the beach is considered the winner.</p>

<p><em>Sanibel</em> is a cozy, meditative game. One that offers a combination of strategy and and atmosphere for both board gamers, ocean-lovers, and everyone else between. It is similar to journey-focused board game experiences like <em>Tokaido</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/american-tabletop-awards-2025-winners-announced-showcasing-industry-variety" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Tabletop Awards 2025</a> Strategy Game winner, <em>Let's Go to Japan</em>.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Sanibel</em> is a modest continuation of Elizabeth Hargrave's catalog of board games showcasing her love of nature. <em>Wingspan</em> was a game about managing a bird sanctuary, a premise so evocative it got two spin-offs: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/embrace-your-inner-dracologist-with-wyrmspan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Wyrmspan</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/finspan-wingspan-creators-january" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Finspan</em></a>. Hargrave's follow-up, <em>Undergrove</em>, was an insightful experience about mycorhizas, or symbiotic networks of seeds and fungi, in the American Pacific Northwest.</p>

<p>Another of Hargrave's games, <em>Tussie Mussie</em>, is a card game based on Victorian flower languages. It is an I-Split-You-Choose experience where you draw cards with flowers on them and combine them into appealing arrangements. Certain arrangements would earn points based on their composition, using real-world flowers like peonies and orchids.</p>

<p>The <em>Sanibel</em> board game is set to come out some time in early 2026 at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Marvel Rivals : Ultron A New Age Begins Official Character Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Marvel Rivals' new map, Arakko, comes from the House of X-era in the X-Men comics when mutants transformed Mars into a new homeworld. Krakoa's other half, Arakko, settled on the red planet alongside a large population of mutants. However, Ultron has greatly changed Arakko in Marvel Rivals. According to the story update, Ultron has stolen the X-Men's Cerebro unit to become X-Tron, and transformed Arakko into "a cold, merciless mechanical world." To restore Arakko to its former glory, Marvel's heroes will have to unite once again.</p><p>NetEase Games is also making some adjustments to Marvel Rivals' team-up abilities by removing four abilities and adding six new ones. Additionally, Jeff the Land Shark is getting a Jeff-nado team-up ability. Marvel Rivals will also unveil proficiency avatars on the match hero select wheel, including mood and emojis personalization systems.</p><p>On June 6, Marvel Rivals will launch Ultron's Battle Matrix, a limited-time experimental mode. In the battle matrix, players will be able pick their own hero lineups and create unique builds that enhance their characters' abilities. Following those upgrades, players can battle it out against each other. NetEase notes that the dev team is using Ultron's Battle Matrix as a way to let players exercise more control over the characters and their abilities.</p><p>There are still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-marvel-rivals-codes-for-free-skins-and-rewards/1100-6530202/" data-ref-id="1100-6530202">Marvel Rivals codes</a> that can give players free items in Season 2. NetEase has also signaled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-battle-passes-may-not-disappear-for-good-but-theyll-come-at-a-higher-cost/1100-6531509/" data-ref-id="1100-6531509">price hikes for the Marvel Rivals Battle Passes</a> while citing tariffs as one of the reasons for the increase.</p>

		<p>The next big update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> will arrive on 26th June, adding a new Siege game mode, new cosmetics and more. This will be another free update for the game across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Space Marine 2 - Siege Mode Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDScTIUHlnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Siege mode is a new endless PvE challenge. Set on Kadaku, the 3-player game mode pits you against increasingly challenging waves of Tyranid and Chaos enemies as they assault an Imperial fortress. While death and failure is inevitable, fighting for as long as possible is admirable in its own right.</p>
<p>Siege mode will be playable on the Public Test Server on PC from 4th June, with more details coming in the next Community Update.</p>
<p>Alongside the Siege Mode, Patch 9 will also bring two new customisation DLCs for Ultra Edition, Gold Edition, and Season Pass holders. This adds the White Scars Chapter Pack with a new Champion skin and three White Scars inspired weapon skins. Much more popular will be the Blood Angels Cosmetic Pack, with a selection of armour pieces that can be added to any Space Marine classes, as well as heraldry markings for the Blood Angels’ Successor Chapters.</p>

<p>It’s great to see the ongoing support for Space Marine 2, a game that really went down a with fans of Warhammer 40,000. Saber has delivered significant updates with new content and new features (such as this month’s modding SDK). In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2 review</a>, we said, “The best rendition of the Warhammer 40,000 universe we’ve ever seen. Bombastic, brutal and brilliant fun from start to finish, though those who are already invested in Games Workshop’s sci-fi world will get the most out of it.”</p>

		<p>Two classic Warhammer 40,000 games are getting fresh remastered releases this year. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition is coming later this year to PC, while Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition is launching on 10th June for PC, Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass.</p>
<p>Relic Entertainment’s Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War was a fantastic take on the RTS genre when it launched in 2004, with the game receiving four expansions in the years that followed. Dawn of War – Definitive Edition brings all of that together and gives it a technical spruce up to make it more compatible with modern systems and give it a little graphical spit and polish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9CLDiE8OQ1M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will feature 4K support, upscaled textures to 4x the originals, and adds in image-based lighting for increased fidelity. World lighting, unit reflections, and shadows have also been improved, and unit now have gloss and emissive lighting. There’s also an improved gameplay camera and the HUD has been optimised for widescreen.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the game has been upgraded with 64-bit support, making it much more compatible with modern operating systems and CPUs. This should allow the modding community to flourish and take the game to new heights.</p>

<p>. An improved gameplay camera will show the battlefield like never before and the HUD and screen layout have been optimized for widescreen viewing. It has also been upgraded to a 64-bit platform to support the ongoing efforts of the modding community and will be compatible with over 20-years of lovingly crafted community mods.</p>
<p>But it’s really Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 that is still in the forefront of gamer’s consciousness for this grim dark universe, and so the only thing surprising about a Space Marine remaster is that it’s taken Sega this long! Launching on 10th June, the original Space Marine has been enhanced by SneakyBox.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition | Announce Trailer [EN PEGI]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12D1xaoEqGk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine – Master Crafted Edition isn’t just a technical upgrade – it’s a thoughtful restoration,” said Producer Vaidas Mikelskas from SneakyBox.</p>

<p>The game will now support 4K resolutions, has modernised controls and an overhauled UI, there’s also improved character models and remastered audio – Ork models now align with modern Ork factions and have 100 new voice lines added, for example. Also, the game has 64-bit support on Windows.</p>
<p>Best of all, this release still has online multiplayer support, keeping the original 8v8 online servers up and running.</p>
<p>It is quite surprising that there’s no PS5 release, though…</p>

            <p>
The Warhammer Skulls Showcase was full to the brim with, unsurprisingly, lots of Warhammer 40,000 game news, including a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">sequel to Boltgun</a> and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">definitive edition of Dawn of War</a>. CRPG heads were also treated to a reveal of Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a new party-based title from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/owlcatgames">Owlcat Games</a>, the devs behind another Warhammer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>. The reveal came in the form of a nicely partially 2D-animated trailer alongside some brief looks at gameplay, all of which is looking quite good.
</p>

<p>
Much like Rogue Trader, Dark Heresy will feature turn-based combat, with this game "set against the backdrop of the Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star." You'll have "intricate investigations" to complete outside of combat, with both those and combat potentially leading to some "grave consequences." Specifically, you'll be an acolyte of the Inquisition, and it'll be up to you to search out for heresy and ultimately decide what happens to the Calixis Sector.

<p>
As of now, a release date hasn't been set in stone, not even a release year, so you'll have to hold out for now. I imagine it'll be a while away too, as Owlcat Games are actually still working on Rogue Trader right now. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> next expansion, Lex Imperialis, also received a release date reveal of June 24th during the presentation. A second season pass was announced too, revealing two more expansions due out between January and March, and July and September respectively next year.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2186680/Warhammer_40000_Rogue_Trader/">base game is half-off right now too</a>, if you fancy giving it a punt. Our very own Edwin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-review">reviewed it last year</a>, coming away from it with lots of nice things to say about, as well as a few not so nice things that probably would have been easier to deal with in smaller doses.
