			<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-team17-future-games-show-gamescom-2025/">was announced this summer</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, with publisher Team17 and Expression Games bringing its brand of strategic shooter gameplay to a new setting following its initial World War II setting. </p>



<p>Today, Expression Games and Team17 put out a new gameplay trailer, after the more cinematic-focused trailer shown at Gamescom as part of the game's reveal. The trailer shows off a 50v50 battle in this "<em></em><em>war with no front lines</em>" setting.</p>



<p>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will feature six Vietnam maps, including dense jungles to fight through, and some more open and clear battlefields to offer strategic variety in how each match can be approached. You'll be able to hop in a helicopter and deploy troops at different points on the battlefield, take control of patrol boats for a small slice of naval combat, and North Vietnam forces can use a tunnel system to move around the maps for surprise attacks and strategic advantages against American troops.</p>

<iframe title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | First Gameplay Reveal Trailer | World Exclusive with @IGN" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5bwfPLwLwQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>One thing the trailer did not include, however, was a release date, as we're still just looking at a 2026 release window. A press release for the trailer does make it clear that this is in-engine gameplay footage, however, so hopefully, this look at gameplay is a sign that we're not too far off from when a release date will be revealed.</p>



<p>Expression Games has already made it clear that it will continue to support Hell Let Loose once Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is in the public's hands, though a difference worth noting between the two titles is that there's currently no indication that Hell Let Loose: Vietnam will be an early access release like Hell Let Loose before it.</p>



<p>It appears that Expression Games is just ready to release Vietnam as a full 1.0 version. Hopefully, whenever it launches, it'll feel like a full and finished product.</p>

            <p>Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, are marching on despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts">losing staff</a> after Microsoft suddenly pulling funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> amid mass layoffs this summer. Romero says the project isn't <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/romero-games-have-completely-closed-doors-but-theres-still-hope-for-the-doom-creators-new-fps">living on in its previous guise</a>, but is instead having elements pulled from it as part of a near-total redesign into a smaller game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The veteran developer revealed this in an onstage chat at Spanish games show Salón del Videojuego de Madrid spotted by our mates over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring">European Videogameplayer</a>. "So, we survived the cancellation of a huge game," Romero said when asked about what he's currently working on.</p>
<p>The game's been basically completely redesigned," he continued. "The new game has nothing to do with the previous game, but it incorporates a lot of the elements that we had in the previous game. So, we're not starting at ground zero. We have 50 million worth of a game [that] we can take pieces out of and put [them] into a brand new indie game."</p>

<p>"It's a much smaller game," Romero added. "It's more fun for us, because the people working on it were all directors of different departments and they didn't actually get to code or design or whatever - do it themselves - and so now we get to actually do that do the thing that we're really good at ourselves."</p><p>As for what this new game emerging from the old one's ashes will be like, the dev kept his info shotgun close to his chest, outside of confirming that it's still a shooter. "The things that you do in it will be, I'd say, probably new to people [in] the way that going through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience. It was a very crazy place and a different world and it was really cool to explore it and just see 'What is that?' That's the idea behind what we're doing in this game."</p>
<p>It's tough to read much into that last bit in my eyes, but regardless, here's hoping Romero and co's revamped shooty thing can stick the landing whenever it's ready.</p>

            <guid>1378438</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holiday season is a great time to finally make the purchases that feel a little out of budget the rest of the year. If you’ve been eyeing a laptop upgrade for yourself, or want to gift one to someone who really needs to let go of their old machine, now is a great time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">The latest Lenovo IdeaPad in the stunning cosmic blue color, just dropped by 73% on Amazon, which brings its price down to $1,235</a>. It typically sits over $4,000, so this discount puts it in a much more affordable price range. This version comes packed with features that are great for professional use, and apart from the discount, you’re also getting an accessory kit thrown in for free with your purchase. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, as well, meaning you’re getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box. It ships before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to gift it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>For a little over $1,200, you’re getting a machine that flaunts a Cosmic Blue aluminum chassis that’s both refined and rugged. It gives off a premium feel, but meets military grade standards that protect it from everyday wear and tear well. There’s a stunning 16-inch WUXGA (1920×1200) IPS touchscreen offering 300 nits of brightness and an anti-glare finish; both making for an immersive, yet comfortable viewing experience. Integrated Intel Graphics takes care of your late-night streaming sessions, online meetings, creative tasks, and even some gaming with ease, plus is paired with intelligent power allocation that maintains smooth visuals even when things get intense.</p>
<p>You’ll find a high-quality FHD 1080p IR camera with a physical privacy shutter for better video calls. It supports Windows Hello facial login, which adds another layer of security and lets you safely log in to the system even in dim lighting. Speaking of dimmer settings, the keyboard features a bright backlight that makes it easy to type long documents and work your way through projects 24/7; great for those of you who often find themselves pulling all-nighters.</p>



<p>As for power, you’ve got a muscular 10-core Intel Core 7 240H processor capable of hitting speeds up to 5.2 GHZ, and an on-chip AI Boost NPU rated at 18 TOPS. These make the machine more than capable of running resource-intensive programs and handling everyday workload without a hint of lag. The 32GB DDR5 RAM lets you multitask through busy days like a pro, while the massive 2TB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important content and files in a single place. The latter also offers much faster boot and load times, making the whole system snappier from the moment you power it on. What’s more, the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB and 4TB, respectively, so you can always make necessary adjustments as your needs grow.</p>
<p>Wireless connectivity comes from WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. Port-wise, it gets you dual USB-C (DP 1.4 + PD 3.0), dual USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (one Always On), HDMI 1.4b, microSD reader, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6321/">And finally, the accessory kit includes a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, a screen wipe, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.</a> That’s everything you need to get started with work and play right away. Just be sure to snap the deal up fast, as it is likely going to wrap up soon.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and it adds new Mega Evolutions, timed roguelike expeditions, and some more story to tie it all together. However, hidden in all this new stuff is the death of a dream that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans have nurtured for years. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu’s two mega forms</span></a><span> may have been met with celebration from fans, but by finally giving the boy his due, Game Freak put the final nail in the coffin of Pikachu’s original final form, Gorochu.</span></p> <p><span>For those who don’t know, Gorochu was meant to be a third form in the Pikachu evolution line back in the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>days. This mysterious form never saw the light of day, but Game Freak has described </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211108083831/https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/creator-profile-the-creators-of-pikachu/"><span>it in interviews</span></a><span>. While discussing the original Pikachu design process in 2018, artist Atsuko Nishida said that her original parameters for the electric mouse that would become the series’ mascot were that it had to be an electric-type monster that would evolve twice. Nishida designed Pikachu, Raichu, and Gorochu, but this third and final monster never made it into the final game. It had fangs and horns, and Nishida said it looked like “a god of thunder.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the same interview, artist Ken Sugimori says there was “nothing wrong” with Gorochu’s design, and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>designer Koji Nishino said it was ultimately cut for game balance purposes and because there was only so much space on older Game Boy cartridges, so some monsters got cut along the way. In 2020 the original source code for these games leaked, which included <a href="https://tcrf.net/Development:Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Pok%C3%A9mon#Pok.C3.A9mon_Index_175">Gorochu’s back sprite</a>. This is the only “official” look we’ve gotten of the monster, but one of the </span><a href="https://x.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649"><span>most popular pieces of Gorochu fan art</span></a><span> captures </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>Sugimori’s style</span></a><span> so well that many fans believe it to be an in-house artistic rendition of the scrapped monster.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apparently Raichu had an evolution named Gorochu, so I had a go at the design of it. Tried to keep consistent to the first generation of Pokemon's look and style. ⚡️ <a href="https://t.co/U4KrTr1DKW">pic.twitter.com/U4KrTr1DKW</a></p> <p>— VivinkArt (@VivinkArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/VivinkArt/status/993360938613915649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 7, 2018</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>All this mystique has had fans asking for Game Freak to bring Gorochu back and make the Pikachu line the first “four-stage” monster, now that </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver </span></i><span>added Pichu, a pre-evolution to Pikachu. However, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC may have killed this dream, as it gives </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>Raichu two Mega forms</span></a><span>. As AZ lays out in the main game, Mega Evolution is only possible if a Pokémon has reached its final stage of Evolution.

<p>Team17 and Expression Games have released a new YouTube trailer for Hell Let Loose: Vietnam, showcasing the game’s 50 vs. 50 battles.</p>







<p>You can watch the new gameplay trailer of the game below:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At Gamescom earlier this year, Insider Gaming got hands-on with the game, calling it “familiar, but entirely different” thanks to the series’ new setting. You can read our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-hands-on-preview-jungle-warfare-has-never-been-this-immersive-in-a-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full hands-on preview of Hell Let Loose: Vietnam here</a>.</p>



<p>From our perspective, Hell Let Loose: Vietnam is going to be an unforgettable entry into the Hell Let Loose franchise, giving players a fresh and immersive gaming experience that is often overlooked in the first-person shooter scene.</p>



<p><strong>Game features:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Welcome to the Jungle – You and your fellow soldiers will be thrown into dramatic terrains and engage in warfare across 6 new Vietnam maps, featuring dense jungle, twisting deltas, and open clearings that offer unique tactical challenges.</li>



<li>Aerial Units – Allowing&nbsp;fully&nbsp;operational helicopters&nbsp;for troop deployment and fire support.&nbsp;&nbsp;These units play a pivotal role in transporting soldiers to landing zones,&nbsp;delivering supplies to the team in tactical locations,&nbsp;conducting&nbsp;reconnaissance,&nbsp;and offering aerial firepower.</li>



<li>Patrol boats&nbsp;– Take control of heavily armed vessels, such as&nbsp;the iconic U.S. patrol boat, the PBR.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Tunnels –&nbsp;The North Vietnamese forces can construct extensive tunnel networks, offering strategic advantages for surprise attacks and troop movements. This means that mastering tactics will become essential to winning the battle.​&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Holiday season allows everyone to let off some Steam at the end of the year. Steam Wrapped 2025 is the next-best day outside of Christmas, and it’s a time to rejoice at your year-long Steam stats.</p>



<p>Ever wondered how many games you’ve bought in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-indie-game-deals-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> sales? How many hours have you spent in front of your monitor or Steam Deck? Well, Steam Replay 2025 wraps up all of this information into one handy showcase for you.</p>







<h2 id="h-steam-replay-2025-expected-release-date">Steam Replay 2025 Expected Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Steam</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>History suggests the 2025 Steam Replay will release on Thursday, December 18, as this lines up with the last couple of iterations of Steam’s Wrapped.</strong></p>



<p>If you ignore the slight outlier of Steam Replay 2022—made available to all users on December 26—and consider the last two incarnations, the proof is pretty much in the pudding present.</p>







<p>Steam Replay 2023 came out on Monday, December 18, and the year after, the 2024 replay was on Wednesday, December 18. You can see where Insider Gaming is going with this, but logic dictates that the date is the same for the last two years, so why would Steam break a winning habit?</p>



<p>Unless something weird happens or Steam has a Half-Life-sized facility meltdown, Thursday, December 18, seems like a reasonable assumption. Keep checking back on the day to see when Steam Replay 2025 is out.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-steam-wrapped-2025-stats">How To Check Steam Wrapped 2025 Stats</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Valve</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam Wrapped 2025 includes your games played, achievements unlocked, and more, and the way to access this is through clicking a simple link and logging in.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what you’ll probably need to do once it’s out:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Steam’s website.</li>



<li>Log in to your account you want to see the stats for.</li>



<li>Click on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/replay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Replay link</a> (currently, it only shows 2024).</li>



<li>Look through your stats, and feel free to share them wherever!</li>
</ol>



<p>Checking out these Wrapped or Year in Review showcases can be daunting sometimes, so be prepared to see some numbers you didn’t expect. Then, you can do it all over again in 2026.</p>



<p>Once you have your Steam Replay 2025 breakdown, please share it with the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>. It’s free to join, and it would be fun to see what everyone else has been doing.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AMD’s next-gen “FSR Redstone” brings big gains, as long as you’re using a new GPU]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/12/amds-fsr-redstone-upscaling-claims-to-close-the-gap-with-nvidias-dlss/</link>
            <guid>1378414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          
<p>Nvidia, AMD, and Intel have all made high-quality image upscaling a cornerstone feature of their new GPUs this decade. Upscaling technologies like Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR), and Intel’s Xe Super Sampling (XeSS) are all ways to transform a lower-resolution source image into a higher-resolution image, delivering better-looking games without requiring as much graphics hardware as you’d need to render the higher-resolution image natively. Later additions have focused on improving ray-tracing performance and “frame generation” technologies that boost frame rates by creating new AI-generated frames to insert between natively rendered frames.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Nvidia’s DLSS technologies have provided better image quality than AMD’s FSR, but they have only been available on newer Nvidia hardware—the GeForce RTX 20-series or newer for most features, with frame-generation features locked to the RTX 40- and 50-series. FSR’s results don’t look as good, but they have benefited from running on just about anything, including older GPUs, Nvidia GPUs, and even integrated Intel and AMD GPUs.</p>
<p>Today, AMD is trying to shift that dynamic with something called “FSR Redstone,” a collection of ray-tracing and frame-generation features all intended to boost AMD’s image quality while being relatively easy to implement for game developers who are already using FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.</p>
<p>The downside is that closing the quality and feature gap with Nvidia also apparently requires sticking with Nvidia-like hardware restrictions: like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/02/amds-fsr-4-upscaling-is-exclusive-to-90-series-radeon-gpus-wont-work-on-other-cards/">FSR 4 upscaling</a>, FSR Redstone will only be available on AMD’s latest-generation GPUs with the RDNA4 GPU architecture, including the Radeon RX 9070 and RX 9060 series.</p>
<h2>Improvements in FSR Redstone</h2>


<p>FSR Redstone is a collection of four technologies, three of which are new and one that has just been renamed, and all of which can be mixed and matched based on the preferences of the game developer and the user.</p>
<p><strong>FSR Radiance Caching</strong> is a “real-time, neural network-based” system for improving performance and image quality for indirect lighting and global illumination. An AMD-trained lighting model allows the various bounces of light in a scene to be predicted “as soon as the second ray intersection,” according to AMD, saving the GPU from actually having to calculate and render subsequent bounces of light.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, John Romero--the creator of Doom and Quake--announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-and-quake-veterans-new-fps-loses-funding-with-microsoft-seemingly-to-blame/1100-6532939/" data-ref-id="1100-6532939">his next first-person shooter had been canceled</a>. Although Romero and his company, Romero Games, didn't confirm that the project was a victim of Microsoft's layoffs and cutbacks, one of Romero Games' laid-off employees did. However, it appears the still-unnamed shooter isn't completely dead, according to Romero himself.</p><p>During his appearance at <a href="https://youtu.be/-NypZpqoGOI" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Salón del Videojuego de Madrid</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Romero confirmed that the project is back on, and that it's been given a fresh redesign.</p><p>"We're not starting at ground zero," said Romero. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand-new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p><p>Romero clarified that the current incarnation isn't the same exact title as his previous project, but "it incorporates a lot of the elements" and it's a much smaller game in this version. He also played coy about what the gameplay will be like with cryptic hints that he has "never played a game like it," and "the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience ... That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p><p>Although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-doom-devs-confirm-romero-games-is-not-closed-despite-game-cancelation/1100-6533006/" data-ref-id="1100-6533006">Romero Games confirmed its survival</a> last summer, some of Microsoft's internal studios hit by layoffs were not as lucky.

            <p>UK prime minister Keir Starmer has called the firing of 31 employees from GTA developer Rockstar "deeply concerning", adding that ministers will look into the controversial dismissals.</p>
<p>Last month, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-developer-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-after-it-fires-dozens-of-developers">Grand Theft Auto maker was accused of union busting</a> after it fired Rockstar staff who were purportedly involved in union activities. The company, however, claimed the affected staff were fired for gross misconduct. Soon after, UK trade union Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unacceptable-and-unlawful-gta-6-developer-rockstar-hit-with-legal-claim-from-uk-trade-union-following-alleged-unfair-dismissal-of-staff">issued a legal claim against Rockstar</a> for these dismissals, again noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-rockstar-games-staff-were-fired-for-sharing-internal-company-messages-on-an-employee-and-union-only-discord-server-new-report-suggests">all those affected were union members</a>. Meanwhile, over 200 employees from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-north">Rockstar North</a> signed a letter to management, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">condemning its actions</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the topic has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstars-controversial-dismissal-of-31-employees-is-such-a-big-deal-its-made-its-way-to-uk-parliament">arisen once again in parliament</a>, with Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP Chris Murray asking the prime minister if he agrees all companies "regardless of profit size" must "follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union".</p>

<p>Responding to Murray's concerns regarding Rockstar, Starmer said: "It's a deeply concerning case. Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union.</p>
<p>"Our ministers will look into the particular case the member raises and will keep him updated."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Murray met with the IWGB about the dismissals at Rockstar. "This has impacted many residents in varying ways, all have lost their livelihood, all have lost a role which they have invested a combined 200 years of service to, with some residents even now forced to leave the UK due to the removal of their visa sponsor," Murray said. "The consequences of this decision by Rockstar on so many families cannot be understated".</p><p>The Edinburgh East and Musselburgh MP additionally arranged a meeting with Rockstar to question the developer about its actions. "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members," Murray stated, adding he was "not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law". Further, the MP said the meeting with Rockstar did not convince him that the company's course of action was "necessary".</p>
<p>"Alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal," he closed. "The meeting began with us MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed."</p>

<p>Along with the ongoing situation between the affected members of staff and Rockstar, the company also recently also delayed the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, moving the game from May of next year into November. </p>
<p>Publisher Take-Two said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">the most recent GTA 6 delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve"</a>. It added "Rockstar has our full support of course", and that the Take-Two team is "confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

Following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/paramount-makes-rival-bid-for-warner-bros-after-netflixs-usd82-billion-offer-includes-game-studios">Netflix's $82.7 billion acquisition agreement</a> with Warner Bros. Discovery (later challenged by a separate offer from Paramount), Netflix co-CEO, president and director Gregory Peters has said WB Games didn't really factor into the company's decision (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/">Pocket Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">recent earnings call</a>, where Peters and Theodore Sarandos — the other co-CEO — were asked if Warner Bros. assets would "enhance or accelerate" success in Netflix's gaming plans. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space," Peters responded, "we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things".</p>
<p>Peters went on to point out that Warner Bros. has "got great studios and great folks working there," and even noted that its properties have spawned financially successful games in the past. "We think we can incorporate that into what we're offering," he stated, "but just to be clear, we haven't built that into our business model".</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warner Bros. Games includes several big-hitting studios such as NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games and Portkey Games. While the company has been through a rocky number of years following the disappointing performance of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/suicide_squad_kill_the_justice_league">Suicide Squad</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/warner-bros-closes-three-studios-including-team-behind-smash-like-brawler-multiversus">shutdown</a> of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/multiversus">MultiVersus</a>, among other things, there have also been financial successes with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen what the future of Warner Bros' game division might be under Netflix, though with Paramount Skydance launching a rival bid of its own earlier this week, we imagine it'll be a while before we hear anything concrete.</p>

			<p>It's been exactly five years since CD Projekt RED released Cyberpunk 2077. Today, the Polish studio is celebrating the fifth anniversary of its most recent game with a series of initiatives, including a special trailer looking back on the emotional story experienced by the protagonist, V, and the players while in the City of Legends.</p>



<p>It's been a whirlwind for sure, both in and out of the game. Riding on the hype guaranteed by the success of The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the biggest digital game launch of all time</a> based on revenue and units (10.2 million units sold), but the game's bugs and performance issues on previous generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) heavily damaged its reputation, especially when Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-delisted-from-playstation-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove the game from the PlayStation Store</a>, a nearly unprecedented move for such a highi-profile game, until the developer fixed the problems.</p>



<p>CD Projekt RED worked very hard to achieve this, eventually delivering a more refined and expanded experience through various updates (particularly with version 2.0) and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Fans recognized the improvement, and now Cyberpunk 2077 is once again appreciated. Over the past five years, it has sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-eclipses-35-million-copies-sold-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-scales-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 35 million units</a>, and more will be sold this Holiday season thanks to the heavy discounts (up to 65% off) available now across multiple storefronts. The game also has a sequel <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-might-include-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">currently in development</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Meanwhile, Cyberpunk 2077 fans can look forward to the newly announced Cyberpunk Trading Card Game, announced in partnership with WeirdCo. As with most TCGs, a crowdfunding campaign will debut on Kickstarter next year. The Cyberpunk TCG will let players assemble the ultimate edgerunner crew comprising characters from across the franchise, pitting them against opponents in a battle to become Night City legends. Featuring custom artwork, Cyberpunk TCG is designed for trading card players, avid collectors and Cyberpunk franchise fans alike.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Several new partnerships and products were also announced as part of the fifth anniversary celebrations, offering players more ways to engage with the world of Cyberpunk 2077. The Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector’s Set is available to pre-order and gives players the chance to get their hands on secret Arasaka tech.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/841342/amd-fsr-redstone-is-an-exciting-and-confusing-upgrade-for-radeon-pc-gamers</link>
            <guid>1378366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, AMD is soft-launching its latest suite of graphics and performance-enhancing tech, FSR Redstone — and it might take a second to wrap your head around. It certainly did for me.</p><p>The good news is that in <a href="https://gpuopen.com/news/amd-fsr4-over-85-games/">just three months</a>, AMD has more than doubled the number of games that support the flagship machine-learning version of its upscaling tech, FSR4, to over 200 games in all, and it’s launching ML-based frame generation (yes, “fake frames”) for over 30 titles too. You should be able to <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/supported-games.html">find full game lists here </a>sometime today. Both techniques can dramatically increase your framerate while preserving image quality better than FSR 1, 2, or 3 allowed.</p><p>The awkward news is that after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/671961/amd-fsr-redstone-rdna-4">previously promising</a> “FSR Redstone” would arrive in the second half of this year, AMD is fulfilling that promise primarily by absorbing FSR4 into Redstone. FSR 4 is now “AMD FSR Upscaling (formerly AMD FSR4)”, and Redstone is the umbrella brand for the whole current suite of machine-learning product.</p><p>The absorption might be because AMD has only one game to show off its new FSR Ray Regeneration technique — <em><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/11/fsr-redstones-strange-debut-ray-regeneration-tested-in-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></em>, which already launched with it last month — and no games with FSR Radiance Caching, which it now says is available for game <em>developers</em> to bring to their games in 2026.</p><p>The slightly confusing news is that you won’t find options for FSR Redstone (or even FSR 4) inside most of your games. You’ll need to have a Radeon RX 9000-series card, as the company’s still saying the machine-learning versions of FSR are exclusive to those. You’ll also need to go into your AMD Software app to enable “AMD FSR Upscaling” and/or “AMD FSR Frame Generation” under the Gaming &gt; Graphics tab, and then you’ll need to enable AMD FSR 3.1 (or occasionally 4) inside the game itself.</p><p>That’s because the superior ML versions of these techniques need to be enabled on a per-game basis, but AMD can do it for you (and game developers) in the driver, as long as the games already support FSR 3.1 or FSR 4.</p><p>I bought an AMD RX 9070 XT myself <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/672637/nvidia-rtx-5060-review-meddling-gamersnexus-wake-up-call">after the last stunt Nvidia pulled</a>, but adoption of AMD’s latest hardware is still a little slow. They’ve<a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/343558/amd-radeon-rx-9000-series-still-absent-from-steam-hardware-survey"> yet to show up in the Steam Hardware Survey</a>, which could mean less than 0.15 percent of today’s PC gamers currently use them — though a generic “AMD Radeon(TM) Graphics” has gained 0.75 percent share on Steam since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241214073529/https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=name">a year ago.</a></p><p>That could change now that the Radeon RX 9070 and 9070 XT <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/video-card/#c=591,592&amp;sort=price">can finally be found</a> at their original promised MSRP prices. They are good cards for that amount of money; <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gpu-reviews/624423/amd-radeon-rx-9070-xt-review-benchmarks-price">here’s our March 2025 review</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/841342/amd-fsr-redstone-is-an-exciting-and-confusing-upgrade-for-radeon-pc-gamers]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat Suffers Fatality, Gets Dropped From The Biggest Fighting Game Tournament Of The Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/evo-2026-marvel-tokon-mortal-kombat-lineup-2000652123</link>
            <guid>1378360</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The fighting game lineup for Evo 2026 has been revealed and there’s a notable absence: <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></a>. Just three years after it launched, the content-complete sequel is not getting invited back to the world’s biggest annual fighting game event. Johnny Cage and Subzero will instead be making way for <a href="https://x.com/InvincibleVS/status/1996640662255816844"><em>Invincible Vs</em></a> and the <em>League of Legends</em> fighter <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-l-2xko-league-of-legends-riot-games-1851278882"><em>2XKO</em></a>.</p> <p>The Evolution Championship Series, another piece of gaming culture that was recently sold in part <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">to Saudi Arabia</a>, brings fighting game pros and fans to Las Vegas every summer for several days of <a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2025-viral-moment-fatal-fury-meme-kog-go1-2000614619">big stage face-offs</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/meet-the-guy-keeping-x-men-vs-street-fighter-alive-at-evo-2025-2000614410">passion-fueled side-tournaments</a>. While<em> Street Fighter</em> remains king, other fighting games vie for top billing and occasionally circulate out of the main event. Despite having one of the wildest grassroots fandoms around, Nintendo’s <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-ultimate-melee-nintendo-switch-evo-2022-sony-1848598680">was a no-show</a> at Evo 2022 back when the event was owned by competitor Sony.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">EVO Las Vegas 2026 lineup:<br>-SF6<br>-Tekken 8<br>-Fatal Fury CotW<br>-Under Night In-Birth Sys:Celes<br>-Granblue Fantasy Versus Rising<br>-Rivals of Aether 2<br>-2XKO<br>-Guilty Gear Strive<br>-BlazBlue Centralfiction<br>-Virtua Fighter 5 REVO World Stage<br>-Vampire Savior<br>-Invincible Vs <a href="https://t.co/Ar5In2RCNn">pic.twitter.com/Ar5In2RCNn</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1998566054268907575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This year’s big changes see <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> dropped from the lineup while games like <em>BlazBlue Centralfiction</em>, released a decade ago, get called back up to the majors. Some fans are wondering if it will be a wake-up call for NetherRealms, whose reboot of the franchise wasn’t bad but never quite hit the “we’re so back” vibes many were hoping for.</p>

 <p>Other notable swap-ins include the new <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>, which despite some issues and a content-lite launch has marshaled a passionate community around it, and <em>Rivals of Aether II</em>, the 2024 2D platform fighter that some fans argue still feels like an Early Access sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em> is also MIA</h2> <p>Even more notable than what was ditched is what wasn’t added. The Sony-published comic book fighting game <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384"><em>Marvel Tōkon</em></a> has a 2026 release window but won’t be on tap for Evo 2026. That suggests the heir apparent to <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> won’t be out until late in the year. <em>Marvel</em> <em>Tōkon</em> feels like the only recent new fighting game reveal to break through to a more casual audience and gin up excitement outside of the hardcore crowd, so it would have been a neat pick-up for next year’s event.</p> <p>Developer Arc System Works has been using Evo to reveal new bits about the 4v4 fighting game, so it seems likely it’ll still be involved with the tournament series in some way, just not as an esport. The game’s continued to run closed betas that have garnered lots of positive buzz so far. Hopefully it doesn’t get delayed to 2027.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-nintendo-asus-rog-xbox-ally-drops-to-a-record-low-despite-being-a-new-release-with-3-months-of-xbox-game-pass-premium-included-2000651842</link>
            <guid>1378357</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="517">As much as some of us wish for an official handheld Xbox console, I wouldn’t recommending holding your breath. However, Asus is giving us something very close. In partnership with Microsoft, Asus has updated the ROG Ally, adding official Xbox branding. Enter the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, a new handheld gaming device aimed to rival the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch 2. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/">Released less than two months ago, the device is already seeing a solid discount. Originally priced at $600, it’s now 18% off, dropping to $490—a savings of $110 this soon after launch.</a></p>
<p data-start="519" data-end="803">So what makes this model stand out from the previous Asus ROG Ally? For starters, it now features an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and runs on a redesigned Windows OS, both of which promise to deliver a smoother, more seamless experience both while gaming and navigating the interface.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6320/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="805" data-end="837"><strong data-start="805" data-end="837">Play Xbox Games Anywhere</strong></h2>
<p data-start="839" data-end="1315">With the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, your entire PC game library is at your fingertips, and you can boot straight into them from the new Xbox App UI. This handheld lets you stream Xbox games from your console or from Microsoft’s cloud service, and the Xbox Game Bar can be accessed with a press of the dedicated Xbox button on the left side. Beyond just Xbox titles, the device supports Steam, the Epic Games Store, and other platforms, so you’re not limited to Xbox-exclusive content.</p>
<p data-start="1317" data-end="1557">In terms of hardware, the ROG Xbox Ally comes equipped with 16GB of dual-channel RAM and a 512GB PCIe Gen4 M.2 SSD. If that storage doesn’t quite cut it for your game library, the storage is upgradeable, giving you room to expand as needed.</p>


<p data-start="1559" data-end="2051">The device features a 7-inch display with 1080p HD resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, putting it on par with other high-end handhelds like the Steam Deck. At just under 1.5 lbs, it’s roughly the same weight too. The redesigned chassis pulls inspiration from the Xbox wireless core controllers, with contoured grips for better comfort during long gaming sessions. You can play on the go or connect to your TV via the dual USB-C ports, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">To keep you gaming longer, the handheld includes a 60Wh battery that can recharge quickly. Just half an hour of charging gets you back up to 50% battery life.</p>
<p data-start="2053" data-end="2210">With these upgrades, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally series is shaping up to be a strong contender in the portable gaming market, offering versatility, performance, and a solid gaming experience. And right now, it’s down $110 for the holiday season.</p>
<p data-start="2233" data-end="2544">For those seeking more power, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally X is also available, offering an upgraded processor, additional RAM, and a 1TB SSD—doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery for even longer playtime, making it a solid option for those who want a premium handheld experience.</p>

                <p>GameStop has released its <a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001326380/000132638025000098/gme-20251101.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">latest earnings report</a>, shining a light on how the video game retailer is performing in the market--and it was a mixed quarter for the company.</p><p>Revenue came in at $821 million, compared to $860.3 million during the same period last year, and short of Wall Street projections. Profit, however, soared from $17.4 million last year to $77.1 million for the latest period. GameStop's stock price sank after the earnings report came out, with many saying the revenue miss was to blame for the falling price.</p><p>Others, however, have said GameStop's strong profit-growth, along with having more than $8.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (up from $4.6 billion last year) is a sign of health. Additionally, GameStop's Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&amp;A) costs were $221.4 million for the quarter, down from $282 million during the same period last year.</p><p>GameStop achieved the lower SG&amp;A costs through a variety of means, including store closures and layoffs. GameStop closed 590 stores in the US in fiscal 2024 and the company said, "We anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025."</p><p>GameStop made the majority of its money for the quarter that ended on November 1 from hardware and accessories, reaching $367.4 million (down from $417.4 million). Software sales came in at $197.5 million (down from $271.8 million), while revenue from collectibles landed at $256.1 million (up from $171.1 million).</p><p>What's more, GameStop's Bitcoin holdings finished the quarter at $519.4 million. GameStop <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-just-bought-half-a-billion-worth-of-bitcoin/1100-6531856/" data-ref-id="1100-6531856">bought more than $510 million worth of Bitcoin in May 2025</a>, so the value has appreciated, but not by much. Bitcoin is highly volatile, after all. Bitcoin's value crashed from its all-time high price of more than $126,000 back in October 2025. Today, Bitcoin is trading at around $92,100.</p><p>GameStop was also in the news recently for its Trade Anything Day, where people could bring almost anything to a store to trade in for $5.

<p>"If I had a sister, I'd sell her in a second"</p>
<p><strong>Version Reviewed:</strong> North American</p>
</section><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim">Skyrim</a>. Listen, mate. We need to talk.</p>
<p>Back when I reviewed Skyrim's 2022 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/elder_scrolls_v_skyrim_anniversary_edition">Anniversary Edition</a> update on Switch, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">I gave it a 7/10</a> and summarised that, whilst it was amusing that Todd Howard was still signing off on versions of this game, there were enhancements enough, through some new quests and the addition of Creation Club mods (and fishing), that fans would get their money's worth, whilst newcomers were treated to a solid, stutter-free version of an epic RPG. Nice.</p>
<p>With a game this long in the tooth, albeit one folk seem to be unable to stop buying and playing (myself included, although I like to think I'm doing it ironically), I reckon a 'Good' score and a slap on the back for the effort would have been a healthy place to leave the relationship. But no. Oh no. Todd. He back.</p>
<p>You may have already clocked the score at the bottom, so let's get to why I've come down so harsh this time. It's chiefly because Bethesda's taken a game that on Switch, whilst relatively restrained in comparison to some of its fancier ports, got the job done smoothly and competently. Yes, it was 30fps, but it felt nice.</p>
<p>With this Switch 2 upgrade, they've decided to smash a bunch of volumetric effects and graphical enhancements into the situation, as well as upping the resolution. Admittedly, I'm no Digital Foundry boffin, but DLSS is being employed and the resolution has improved. But then why no 40fps, at the very least? Honestly, my friends, Bethesda's crapped out a terrible version of a game they've released hundreds of times already, and I do believe they've done it for Christmas.</p>

<p>I can't think of any other reason to release their precious in this state other than a big rush to make the holiday shelves. The moment you boot into this Switch 2 port, once you've ridden the wave of excitement that is two-second-faster loading times and a slightly better draw distance, you're immediately presented with a game that's not as good at all to play. Quickly, how do I delete and go back to my old version? Well, you'll need to delete this one entirely and redownload the older one, because they haven't even done that bit well.</p>
<p>It still runs at 30fps *gulp*, but now there's also genuinely awful input lag to boot. I'm talking about online-fighting-on-a-Switch-Lite bad at times. Why have they released it like this? Oh, and it's a massive 53GB download as well. That's 40+GBs to make something slightly prettier but ultimately worse, folks.</p>
<p>I've no doubt it'll get fixed up eventually. They may even make it 60fps down the road, and it'll be a lovely version then, especially given that mouse controls are in there now and working just fine. But we're talking about Skyrim here, a game from 2011, not <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition]]></content:encoded>

</figure>
<p>To clarify, this doesn't seem to mean you won't get a <em>Modern Warfare </em>game one year and then a <em>Black Ops </em>game the next; rather, it looks like it means successive years won't see the same sub-franchise launching, so there won't be two <em>Black Ops </em>or <em>Modern Warfare </em>games in a row.</p><p>Activision also says that in the future, it intends to "drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental" when it comes to <em>Call of Duty</em>, and that while it has no more information to share about what that might mean right now, it will share more "when the time is right".</p><p>If you've yet to try <em>Black Ops 7</em> (and <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1990519018537812406" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">sales data suggests</a> you're far from alone if you haven't played it yet), Activision is holding a free weekend for the shooter next week, so you can jump in and try its multiplayer and Zombies game modes for free.</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>launched back in mid-November, and despite its predecessor apparently enjoying the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e8aa163-0fd6-4fc9-a2e0-23799b12215b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">franchise's biggest ever launch</a>, it looks like the game <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/november-2025s-top-new-steam-games" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly been a smash hit</a> for Activision.</p><p>Indeed, it looks as though EA's <em>Battlefield 6 </em>has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f54e66c-a1d7-49c6-a458-a64a557a9323" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">significantly outperformed</a> its rival, at least in terms of initial sales, which is probably why Activision is scrambling to figure out what's gone wrong.</p><p>Whether or not this results in any real change in terms of what's next for <em>Call of Duty </em>remains to be seen, but there's clearly still enough faith in the franchise at Activision HQ to move ahead with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5bcbe900-0a2b-4995-b155-09cc3df0eb7f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paramount-led movie adaptation</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-12-in-1-docking-station-returns-at-black-friday-pricing-after-selling-out-doubles-as-a-monitor-stand-2000651854</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re well into December now. If you still haven’t secured all your gifts for the holidays, the clock’s a-tickin’. Though, you’re not out of luck just yet. We’re well past the big deals days of the season like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but some deals are still holding strong so you can save big.</p>
<p>Take a moment to check out this Anker USB-C docking station, a device that does far more than simply expand the number of ports available on your computer. Anker designed it to function as both a powerful connectivity hub and a practical monitor stand, giving you two essential workspace upgrades in a single piece of equipment.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/"> At the moment, Amazon is still offering a notable 32% discount, dropping the usual $250 price tag down to about $170</a> — a savings of roughly $80 for anyone looking to upgrade their desk setup without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="543" data-end="1179">This model is a 12-in-1 docking station intended to transform a cluttered, cable-ridden desk into a space that feels polished, intentional, and comfortable to work at for long stretches. Its shelf-style construction is sturdy enough to support your external monitor, raising it just high enough to improve your viewing angle while simultaneously freeing up valuable desk real estate. Beneath the stand, there’s plenty of room to slide your keyboard out of the way when it’s not needed—ideal for keeping things tidy when stepping away from your desk or when you want extra space for meals or note-taking.</p>
<p data-start="1181" data-end="1512">Even a slight elevation of your monitor can have real benefits for your posture. By bringing the screen closer to eye level, the stand reduces the temptation to lean forward or slouch, encouraging a more ergonomic sitting position. This can help lessen neck and shoulder tension, especially for those who spend hours at a computer.</p>


<h2>Charge Everything at Once</h2>
<p data-start="1514" data-end="2163">Along the right side of the unit, Anker incorporated an array of ports and connectors that should satisfy anyone who regularly juggles multiple accessories. The Anker 675 includes a 100W-max USB-C upstream port for powering and linking your laptop, three USB-A ports, two additional USB-C ports, a full-size SD card slot, a MicroSD slot, a 3.5mm audio jack, an ethernet port for wired internet, and an HDMI output capable of supporting 4K resolution at 60Hz. Whether you need to transfer files, plug in peripherals, or connect an external display, the station provides instinctive access to almost every type of connection you might need.</p>
<p data-start="2165" data-end="2522">On the top surface, you’ll find a built-in wireless charging pad. This allows you to place your smartphone on the dock and have it recharge while you work, eliminating the need to keep an extra charging cable on your desk. The USB-A and USB-C ports each support data transfer speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is especially handy for moving large files quickly.</p>
<p data-start="2524" data-end="3047" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Underneath the stand is a spacious cable-management compartment designed to hide excess cords and keep your workspace looking clean and intentional. The entire structure is built from durable aircraft-grade aluminum, giving it a premium feel and solid longevity. Anti-slip silicone pads on the feet prevent shifting or wobbling. With dimensions of 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches, the station is broad enough to accommodate most monitors currently on the market while still fitting comfortably on standard desks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-m5-hits-new-record-low-amazon-goes-zero-profit-play-for-christmas-clearance-2000652112</link>

              <p>Roborock earned its reputation as the premium standard in robot vacuums, essentially <strong>becoming the “Dyson” of automated floor cleaning</strong> with advanced engineering. The company’s newest flagship models command prices between $1,000 and $2,000 and target buyers who want the absolute best regardless of cost.</p>
<p>However, Roborock still produces more affordable models that deliver excellent cleaning performance without the premium price tag, and the Q7 M5+ represents this value-focused approach perfectly: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">Amazon has dropped this model to a record low of $219, down from its usual $359</a>, which makes premium automated cleaning accessible at a price that competes with basic robot vacuums offering far fewer features.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction</h2>
<p>The <strong>10,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> is strong enough to pull dirt out of carpet fibers and pick up pet hair that other vacuums leave behind: This vacuum has a lot of suction power, similar to what you would get from many upright vacuums which means that the robot doesn’t just move dirt around but it actually lifts it up and takes it away. The robot makes several passes over high-traffic areas and pulls dirt from deep within the pile where it builds up over time. This strong suction is especially good for carpets.</p>



<p>The dual anti-tangle system solves the most annoying problem with robot vacuums: hair getting stuck in the brushes and needing to be removed by hand. The main brush on the <em>JawScraper</em> actively cuts and channels hair into the dustbin instead of letting it wind around the roller. The <strong>side brush has a zero-tangle structure</strong> that works even in homes with long-haired pets or family members. This design lets you use the vacuum every day without having to flip it over and cut away matted hair every few days.</p>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus station lets the robot empty itself, so it can run for 7 to 9 weeks</strong> without needing any help: The 2.7-liter dust bag collects dirt from dozens of cleaning cycles and after each cleaning session, the robot automatically goes back to the dock to empty its dustbin. Then it goes back out to finish its scheduled tasks. You can almost forget about the vacuum for almost two months because of this longer maintenance period.</p>



<p><em>PreciSense</em> LiDAR navigation makes <strong>detailed maps of your home by bouncing laser beams off of walls</strong> and furniture to measure distances with millimeter accuracy. The robot uses these maps to figure out the best ways to clean that cover every area that can be reached without going over the same spot more than once which lets it finish jobs faster than robots that just bump around. With multi-floor mapping, the vacuum can learn the layout of each level in your home and automatically load the right map for the floor it’s on. You can set up no-go zones around pet bowls, fragile furniture, or places where cables might get caught in the brushes. This will keep the robot from getting into trouble without having to use physical barrier tape.</p>
<p>The <strong>hybrid vacuum and mop feature</strong> lets you remove dry debris and mop up wet areas in one pass: You can change the water flow from light dampening for hardwood to more aggressive mopping for tile and laminate. The <em>VibraRise 2.0</em> technology adds sound vibrations to the mop pad to help it remove stains better and it also automatically lifts the mop when the robot sees carpet, so the pads don’t soak your rugs.</p>
<p>In a market where basic models without docking stations often cost more, paying $219 for a robot vacuum that can empty itself and has 10,000Pa suction is a great deal. Roborock’s usual price of $359 already made this model a good deal, but the 39% discount makes it an impulse buy for families who are tired of vacuuming every day.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem drop is live now, introducing new weapons, mounts, enemies, and more. </p>



<p>The developers of Minecraft have been churning out a lot of content for the game this year. We already received <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-vibrant-visuals-happy-ghast-chase-the-skies-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vibrant Visuals and Happy Ghast</a> in June, and now, we are all set to receive Mounts of Mayhem, the next big content update for the title, which you can learn more about below.</p>







<h2 id="h-minecraft-s-mounts-of-mayhem-update-will-introduce-new-weapons-foes-mounts-and-underwater-exploration">Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem Update Will Introduce New Weapons, Foes, Mounts, and Underwater Exploration </h2>

<h4 id="h-mounts-of-mayhem-weapons">Mounts of Mayhem Weapons</h4>



<p>Starting with the weapons, Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update will add a spear, which is excellent for both hand-to-hand and mounted combat. The weapon’s damage can scale based on the speed of the player. Lunge Enchantment is a new enchantment unique to the spear, which gives players a burst of speed with the jab attack. Moreover, the higher the enchantment level, the farther the player will be able to travel with their attack. </p>



<h4 id="h-zombie-mounts-and-enemies">Zombie Mounts and Enemies</h4>



<p>Then we come to Zombie Mounts, which are not only enemy mobs, but can be tamed to be your own mounts. Zombie Horses are the first; they are passive mobs, but are ridden by spear-wielding zombies. Get rid of them, and the mount is yours. Then we have the Zombie Nautilus, an underwater mob ridden by a trident-wielding drowned. Players will have to tame it by unseating the ride and tempting it with a pufferfish. </p>



<p>The next enemy mob in Minecraft’s Mounts of Mayhem update is Camel Husks. These are passive mobs, but are spawned with two riders, one with a spear and the other with a bow. What’s more, these mobs are immune to sunlight and will provide a daytime challenge to the player. </p>



<p>Lastly, Mounts of Mayhem will allow players to explore the underwater world of Minecraft in the best way possible. There are three types of mounts: the nautilus, zombie nautilus, and coral zombie nautilus. Each of them can be ridden and provides a speed boost while preserving the player’s existing air supply. </p>

                <p>Cyberpunk 2077 fans can now own a piece of tech that feels and looks like something you'd find at Kiroshi Opticals in Night City. To celebrate the game's fifth anniversary, CD Projekt Red partnered with Viture on limited-edition XR glasses themed around Cyberpunk 2077.

Officially licensed collectible editions of tech and gaming products usually cost more than standard models, so it's pretty cool that the Luma Cyber XR Glasses cost $50 less than the Luma Ultra.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620215"></a><figcaption>Viture x Cyberpunk 2077 5th Anniversary Collector's Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620215-viturecyberxr.png"></figure><p>Designed by CD Projekt Red artists, the Luma Cyber XR Glasses feature the Kiroshi Opticals logo on the temples/arms as well as Night City-inspired symbols. The edges and temple tips glow neon yellow when the glasses are active. The black frames are translucent, which allows you to see some of the internal mechanisms and circuitry that powers Viture's high-tech extended reality glasses.</p><p>Viture launched its flagship Luma series in late August, so the Cyberpunk 2077-themed model utilizes the manufacturer's newest tech. The glasses create a private 152-inch virtual display for gaming, watching videos, and productivity. The Luma series uses Sony's latest Micro-OLED display panels and offer 1200p resolution with 120Hz refresh rate. The lenses are coated in electrochromic film to block out light and to prevent people around you from seeing your screen. The virtual display is crisp and bright whether you're outside in natural light or in a dark room.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219" data-ratio="0.486" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620219"></a><figcaption>Cyberpunk 2077's signature shade of neon yellow is prominently featured.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620219-viturecyber3.png"></figure><p>As mentioned, the Cyber XR edition has the lightweight form factor of the Luma Pro with the more advanced tech of the Luma Ultra. The enhanced features include an increase in peak brightness from 1,000 to 1,500 nits, hand gesture support, and 6DoF (Degrees of Freedom). The tracking sensors register head and body movements, which makes the Ultra and Cyber editions better equipped for augmented reality. The Luma Pro, for reference, is limited to head movements (3DoF).</p><p>The glasses can connect to just about any device with USB-C video out, but handheld gaming is the biggest draw for many users. Viture glasses work wonderfully with Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and other Windows handhelds. When connected to iOS, Android, macOS, or Windows devices, you can use Viture's free Spacewalker app to create three virtual displays. This is especially helpful if you plan on using the glasses for work as well as entertainment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262" data-ratio="0.41666666666667" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png" data-ref-id="1300-4620262"></a><figcaption>Viture Pro Mobile Dock is required for Switch 1/2 (sold separately).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4620262-vituremobiledock.png"></figure><hr><p>Viture XR Glasses are compatible with Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, but you'll need an extra accessory to act as the Switch 1/2 Dock Set.
