                <p>Next year will be the 25th anniversary of the original Xbox, the system that marked Microsoft's entrance into the console wars. While Microsoft has yet to elaborate on how the company will celebrate that milestone, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has indicated that 2026 will be "really special" for Xbox fans with returning franchises.</p><p>"When you think about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026/1100-6529698/" data-ref-id="1100-6529698">Fable</a>, when you think about Gears, when you think about Forza, I mean, these are franchises that have been really part of what makes Xbox what it is today," said Spencer on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/podcast/phil-spencer-xbox-games-showcase-interview-the-official-xbox-podcast/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official Xbox podcast</a> following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. "And it's going to be a nice lineup next year. I love the games that we've launched so far in [2025]. I think, as you already went through, we have a strong finish to 2025.

            <p>Nintendo has provided a solution to an issue causing the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>'s battery indicator to display incorrectly.</p>
<p>While some have criticised the new console for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-battery-life-revealed">having a poor battery life</a>, it turns out in some instances the indicator is actually just not showing the correct percentage.</p>
<p>But, there's a fix! <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo">Nintendo has provided steps</a> "for when the battery amount displayed and the actual remaining battery use don't match". It's easy enough, but does require you to access the console's Recovery Mode.</p>

<p>The steps from Nintendo are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Confirm you're using an adequately powerful AC adapter to charge your console (while the original Switch adapter can be used to charge a Switch 2 directly, it is not powerful enough to charge the Switch 2 when docked)</li>
<li>Confirm that your console has the latest system update</li>
<li>Power off the console</li>
<li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, press the POWER Button once to turn the system on.</li>
<li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears. Navigating to this menu should reset the battery level meter.</li>
<li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the POWER Button until it turns off.</li>
<li>Power the console back on and monitor the situation</li>
</ol>
<p>Nintendo notes further that if following these steps multiple times does not resolve the battery indicator issue, the console will need to be sent in for service.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/MetroidFREAK21/status/1932218979956691244">One user on X</a> noted their battery jumped from 85 percent to 91 percent after following these steps, so it's worth double checking on your own console if the battery appears to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>For more details on the console's battery, we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-battery-life-charge-time">guide on the Switch 2 battery</a> explaining more on its life expectancy.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-nintendos-fastest-selling-hardware-ever">Nintendo revealed it has sold 3.5m Switch 2 consoles</a> in its first four days on sale, becoming the fastest-selling piece of Nintendo hardware.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>MindsEye, the game developed by Build a Rocket Boy which launched this week on PC and consoles, is another Unreal Engine 5-powered game that can only hit 60 FPS at 4K resolution using NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation on one of the most powerful GPUs on the market.</p>
<p>A new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> takes a look at how the game developed by the studio founded by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies runs on an RTX 5080 at 4K and 1440p resolution, two resolutions the GPU should be able to handle well in most titles. Unfortunately, the game is another Unreal Engine 5 GPU destroyer, as, at 4K resolution, MindsEye barely hits the 60 FPS mark only with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode and Frame Generation, and it's only with Multi Frame Generation that a sort of high refresh rate experience is achievable at that resolution. Things fare only marginally better at 1440p resolution, but seeing the game running only at around the 60 FPS mark at native resolution suggests how no other GPU on the market besides the beast that is the RTX 5090 can properly handle the game in its current state.</p>
<p><iframe title="MindsEye - Another UE5 GPU Destroyer | RTX 5080 4K, 1440p DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIxNsAQh_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>No one who followed MindsEye until its release should be surprised to see that the game is launching with plenty of issues. Right before launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/">two Build a Rocket Boy chief executives left the studio</a>, and it was widely reported by those who got early copies on consoles that the game was in a very rough state, which the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-releases-statement-warning-a-major-day-one-patch-will-be-missing-from-mindseye-physical-copies-after-early-copies-appear-in-the-wild/">major day one patch</a> improves only marginally.</p>
<p>MindsEye is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

Many of the negative reviews focus on MindsEye’s performance problems, which appear to be hitting PC gamers hard. There are also reports on various bugs, glitches, and NPC behavior oddities.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">My second combat encounter in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MindsEye?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MindsEye</a>...

Patch 3 will be revealed soon, it added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Thank you kindly to all of you who joined us as pioneers on day one! We understand that the current minimum spec requirements are very high, but our engineering team are working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles by integrating the performance improvements in Unreal Engine V5.6. We will provide patch 3 update timing, including these improvements, within the next 24 hours. In addition to the main campaign, we would also value your thoughts on Build.Mindseye.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye, led by former Rockstar North chief Leslie Benzies, has endured a tumultuous run-up to release. Last week, Build A Rocket Boy said fans should wait for MindsEye’s official launch rather than play it before its street date, after early copies made their way into the hands of players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want everyone to experience the story the same way at the same time on day one, without bias," Build A Rocket Boy said in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-calls-on-fans-to-wait-for-official-launch-after-street-date-breaks-a-week-early-confirms-major-day-one-update-for-physical-copies"><u>statement issued in response to early copies being played</u></a>. "This means waiting until the official release date to play through the game firsthand."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mention of bias in the studio's statement sparked speculation that the company was referring back to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>comments made by its co-CEO Mark Gerhard</u></a>, who suggested there had been a "concerted effort" to "trash the game and the studio" with negative social media posts from paid accounts or bots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>IGN subsequently put this claim to Hakan Abrak, boss of Hitman developer IO Interactive</u></a>, the company which is publishing MindsEye. His response: "I don't know. I don't believe that. I don't believe that. I just think the game should speak for itself on June the 10th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Physical copies of MindsEye also needed a “major” update for “key improvements to ensure MindsEye plays as we intended and to meet all the characters at their best.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And just days before MindsEye’s launch, Build a Rocket Boy’s Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>confirmed they had left the company</u></a>, sparking concern from the studio’s fledgling community.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Screenshots May 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam concurrents do not tell the whole story, of course. MindsEye launched on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S as well as PC, so its true concurrent player count will be higher than that reported on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MindsEye carries a $59.99 price tag. At launch, there is a “tightly crafted linear story campaign,” and what’s called “single-player free roam,” but there are also a number of missions: a horde mode mission called “Destruction Site Shootout,” and two combat missions (“Honor Amongst Thieves” and “Friendly Fire”). Also at launch are six races, six checkpoint races, and three drone races. If you get the premium pass, you get an extra horde mode mission and an exotic cosmetics pack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following launch, Build A Rocket Boy said it will deliver a “constant stream” of fresh premium content monthly, “ensuring MindsEye is a living, ever-expanding player experience.” This includes new missions, challenges, and game assets. “The continuous stream of studio-developed content, combined with the very best of the community’s own beautiful creations, means that MindsEye will continue to surprise and delight its players for decades to come,” Build A Rocket Boy added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy also confirmed its 2025 roadmap of content. In the summer there will be community updates, new missions, in the fall new single-player modes, multiplayer, and new missions, and in the winter free roam updates and new missions. Premium pass owners get extra missions and new packs throughout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

For the uninitiated, the Horus Heresy is the Space Marine civil war that took place 10,000 years before the current Warhammer 40,000 setting. It is the foundation of 40K’s grimdark universe, and reveals how the carrion Emperor ended up on the Golden Throne.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is a hugely exciting release for 40K lore fans (the standard edition is available to <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgGjJ?object_uuid=741aa9ae-3a67-4217-a1c4-bdda8e62b07f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">preorder on Amazon</a>), but its special edition is even more enticing. It features a leather-effect cover with gold foil details, gilt page edges, and a metal emblem of a ruined Imperial eagle.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/preorders-jun07-bl-01-eraofruinltd-nkuyovjdyk-1749632718756.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The special edition of Siege of Terra: End of Ruin. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop had signaled the special edition would be available “strictly while stocks last,” and that it would go on sale at 10am UK time on June 10. It also told fans it planned to use a queue system “to ensure fair distribution.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this queue system caused chaos, with fans desperate to pre-order the book unable to make progress. Amid frantic messages of complaint across social media, Discords, and subreddits, Warhammer.com suddenly… stopped. It was offline, and no-one knew why.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anger grew as those who had carved out time to be there for the pre-order launch were left empty handed. Eventually, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WarhammerOfficial/posts/pfbid0NGLkvUafYjdsmFoK6n22Am1hjz3pYwiHczUHdvvT6dXDcF6TPqwzifqyMb2FudFBl?locale=en_GB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Games Workshop issued a statement</a> on the debacle — a rare event in itself — to say it had brought Warhammer.com offline itself because it had noticed scalpers were bypassing its systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Scalpers attempted to use bots to bypass our normal safeguards,” Games Workshop said. “Our eagle-eyed Tech Priests caught this happening in real-time, so we pulled Warhammer.com offline.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/60040181337-blsiegeofterraeraofruin-1749632804963.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Siege of Terra: Era of Ruin hardback remains available. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is that Siege of Terra: End of Ruin is currently unavailable on Warhammer.com, in its place is a page asking for an email for a notification. Games Workshop said the special edition is still coming, “we’re just absolutely determined that real fans get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“All erroneous orders are being purged,” Games Workshop continued. “This is our number one priority. Please forgive us for a delay as we sort it all out.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/11/gw-1749633025785.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Games Workshop's statement. Image credit: Games Workshop / Facebook.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement has gone some way to calm angry fans who had hoped for a smoother launch of the special edition. Some are calling Games Workshop’s actions here a “small victory” over the scalpers, although there is a healthy dose of skepticism about the company’s efforts to truly combat the bots. Some are calling on Games Workshop to use a raffle system, as other companies do for their high-profile products, or, even better, force interested customers to pass a Horus Heresy test to prove their worth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Games Workshop has suffered pre-order problems for years now, and special edition book launches are often plagued by scalpers who go on to sell the products at hugely inflated prices. All eyes are on Games Workshop to see how it handles pre-orders for the Siege of Terra: End of Ruin special edition when they’re eventually re-launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s remember that Games Workshop is no minnow. In fact, the Nottingham, UK company is doing so well that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-maker-games-workshop-is-doing-so-well-its-giving-27-million-to-its-staff">it’s handing out £20 million (approx. $27 million) to its staff as a bonus</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Workshop’s main business is the sale of miniatures fans assemble and paint for use in tabletop wargames, such as Warhammer 40,000. But it is increasingly an IP business, with huge revenue from smash hit video games such as last year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii"><u>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</u></a>, and animations, such as Amazon’s Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level episode. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years"><u>Games Workshop and Amazon recently finalized a deal for Henry Cavill's Warhammer 40,000 Cinematic Universe</u></a>, which will involve the creation of films and television series. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-iii"><u>Space Marine 3 is also in development.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Games Workshop.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

It still has the accursed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-avoid-blue-shells">Blue Shell</a>, of course, which you can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/yep-it-looks-like-you-can-still-dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world">thankfully dodge</a> if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>This weapon has been ruining friendships for years and is one of the many tactics the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">Mario Kart series</a> employs to avoid having a single player dominate the race. When used, it dashes to the front of the pack and takes out the lead driver, evening the odds.</p>
<p>However, have you ever wondered what would happen if you throw a Blue Shell when <em>you're</em> in the lead?</p>
<p>Well, wonder no more, as it has been revealed:</p>

<p>This isn't a new feature, as many of you Mario Kart veterans will be aware—the Blue Shell can be the cause of amusing 'self-owns' in other entries in the series, as you'll see in the video below.</p>

<p>Still, it's fascinating that I haven't even tried this in all the decades I've been playing Mario Kart games, and I started right at the beginning because I'm an old fart.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's news to you, too? Let us know with a comment.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/first-nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings-in-select-backward-compatible-titles.1215327/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-graphics-mods-unlock-framerate-and-increase-graphics-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It will be a while until the doors of the Nintendo Switch 2 are open to actual mods and homebrew software, but even so, it's already possible to mod certain backward-compatible titles to run at max graphics settings and increased framerate.</p>
<p>A new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@nag3030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naga</a> showcases Grid Autosport and Alien Isolation running with graphics mods. The first game runs at 60 FPS in Quality Mode at 1080p resolution without dynamic resolution scaling, MSAA x8, Anisotropic Filtering 16x, maxed graphics settings, and a performance overlay that highlights how the Nintendo Switch 2 handles the racing game with maxed out settings. Alien Isolation, on the other hand, runs at 1080p resolution with disabled dynamic resolution scaling and all graphics settings maxed. Unfortunately, the framerate cap couldn't be disabled with the method used by the modder, which involves importing a modded save file where graphics settings have been changed, something that can be done with all games by Feral Interactive, as they all seem to do the same.</p>
<p><iframe title="Graphics Mods on Switch 2 - 60FPS Unlock / Max Quality" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCVzZTDxdJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 being so popular, having already become <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">Nintendo's fastest-selling system to date at launch</a>, it's not surprising to see people already tinkering with the system to discover what can be done outside of what the manufacturer intended. With overclocking and increased RAM, the original system could run <a href="https://wccftech.com/overclocked-nintendo-switch-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-above-60-fps/">demanding games at higher resolutions and more stable framerates</a>, so it will be very interesting to see if something similar can be achieved on the new generation system once modders get full access to it, which is something that will inevitably happen, no matter how much Nintendo will try to prevent it.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is now out worldwide, with a few exceptions. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Ian Proulx, the CEO of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developers 1047 Games, has apologised for wearing a 'Make FPS Great Again' cap while talking about the game's battle royale mode on stage at Summer Game Fest. As you might have guessed, the hat drew unfavourable comparisons to US president Donald Trump's MAGA hats.</p>
<p>It'd have been a pretty dumb, controversy-baiting stunt for a games company CEO to pull at any point in recent history, but especially hasn't gone over well given the timing. As the SGF show happened, a large number of anti-ICE protests also began in response to violent immigration raids, and later that weekend Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cj93d3r0zz0o">deployed the National Guard onto the streets</a>."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Up until yesterday, Proulx had opted not to apologise for the hat, which he wore while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">taking some shots</a> at the state of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter genre</a> right now, specifically going at the Call of Duty series for repetitive annual releases and wishing for a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a> 3. "I’m not here to apologize but I am here to clarify. This is not a political statement, it is quite literally what it says, so take it at face value," he wrote in a tweet on June 7.</p>
<p>"I don't regret what I said to be candid. I think that I stand by it and my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody," he said of that tweet in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">IGN</a> published yesterday, doubling down on decling to apologise.</p>
<p>Just a few hours prior to that article's publication, however, Proulx u-turned and <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">posted a video apology</a> Splitgate 2's official Twitter account, admitting that the hat was a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>"It is really freaking hard as an independent studio to break through the noise...at our biggest stage, coming out of beta, we needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with," the exec said in the video.</p>
<p>"We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever and I’m not an idiot, obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy," Proulx continued, "But we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth, which is we do want to improve this genre and we are disappointed with the state of the genre.</p>
<p>"You don't have to believe me, but the truth is I am sorry, and the reason I’m sorry is because of what this has done to the community...I hate seeing division, and that's what I'm seeing right now on both sides. There’s division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Towards the end of last month, the co-CEO of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build a Rocket Boy suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">game's negative reactions up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio</a>.

<p>When asked by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">IGN </a>about the discourse surrounding MindsEye's alleged paid-for negative reactions, IO Interactive head Hakan Abrak replied: "I don't believe that.

<p>While the exec did not elaborate on this specific point further, he did state the MindsEye team - as many developers do - are working on patches for the game.</p>
<p>MindsEye released last night, however it has not been an especially smooth launch for the team. Many social media posts have made the rounds online showing stuttering issues, as well as a number of glitches, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorted character faces and unnaturally stretching bodies</a>.</p>
<p>Build A Rocket Boy has said a patch to address performance is in the pipeline, stating its "engineering team are working around the clock"  to implement improvements. We will keep you posted when we know more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you were wondering why Eurogamer has not yet published a review for MindsEye, you can find out more in our aptly titled article: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wheres-our-mindseye-review">Where's our MindsEye review?</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'Concerned Ape' Barone has taken a brief break from working on the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a> to drop a bombshell.</p>
<p>Taking to Twitter with fire at his fingertips, <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458">Barone wrote</a>: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley".</p>
<p>Outstanding. How much bigger Haunted Chocolatier will be than Stardew Valley, what will fill this vast world of hauntings and chocolate, and how players will be able to explore and interact with this world remains a sweet mystery.</p>

<p>The last major update we got for Haunted Chocolatier is from April this year, when Barone announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-promises-no-more-updates-until-haunted-chocolatier-releases">no more major updates would be coming to Stardew Valley</a>. Indeed, the last year of Barone's life has assumedly been spent sitting at the grindstone, hard at work at their next game while thousands of eager fans peek through the cracks in the walls and floorboards.</p>
<p>These long periods of silence should not be a surprise, with Barone previously stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Haunted Chocolatier won't be rushed</a>, and that it was "better to have a good delayed game than a bad game on time". He's right, of course. You can only release Haunted Chocolatier once, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-has-now-sold-over-20-million-copies">given the massive community of Stardew Valley players</a>, it's likely the smart move to make sure everything is made well and with love… Just like chocolate!</p>
<p>So yeah, while making a joke or two is fun, we wish this ape the best of luck with development. It's ready when it's ready!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It's now the third best-selling Street Fighter</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Akuma" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/08ac9e4439953/akuma.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250611.html">has announced</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now sold over <strong>5 million units</strong> since its initial release in 2023; a milestone helped considerably by the recent release on the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>This makes it the third best-selling Street Fighter game of all time at the time of writing. <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a> is currently in the lead with a total of <strong>7.8 million sales</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> for the SNES sits at <strong>6.3 million</strong>.</p>
<p>The company states it "aims to maximize the game’s userbase" by bringing the game to the Switch 2, and has helped to facilitate this by including cross-play, an initiative that allows players to join online fights across multiple console platforms.</p>
<p>The game hasn't arrived without some controversy, however. Like many third-party releases for the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/street-fighter-6-somehow-combines-game-key-card-and-code-in-a-box-on-switch-2">Street Fighter 6 is a Game-Key Card</a>, meaning users will need to download the title from the eShop despite owning a cartridge.</p>
<p>The additional content for the Years 1-2 Fighters Edition also isn't included in the download as standard, but rather via a separate code. It's due to expire in two years too, which means that those who buy the 'physical' release at some point in the latter half of 2027 and beyond won't get all of the content advertised.</p>
<p>Capcom has also confirmed that it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/capcom-is-recording-switch-2-game-key-card-purchases-as-digital-sales">considers sales of Game-Key Cards to be digital sales</a>, which honestly makes sense since users are downloading the game from the eShop.</p>
<p>Despite the controversy, Street Fighter 6 is a damn good fighter for the Switch 2. We're not all too keen on the exclusive like gyro controls, but the core gameplay is excellent. We awarded it a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">well-deserved score of 9/10</a>.</p>

		<p>As pioneering as the Nintendo Switch was in 2017, its hybrid design enabling a much fuller console experience than most handhelds had managed in the past, and laying the foundations for handheld PCs that have flourished in the last few years, the simple fact of is that its adapted mobile chipset was barely powerful enough for most modern games. This gave rise to a slew of “impossible” ports to the console, from Doom to The Witcher 3, while even Switch exclusives could end up seriously compromised.</p>
<p>But now here’s the Switch 2, and just as we’ve seen with Sony and Microsoft’s consoles since 2016, there’s so much potential for the Switch 1’s back catalogue to run better on the new hardware. This comes in a number of forms, with the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">paid Switch 2 Editions</a>, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/16/nintendo-details-12-free-switch-2-game-updates-resolution-frame-rate-hdr-gameshare/">free patches</a>, and then just running basic Switch 1 game code on a more powerful system.</p>
<p><iframe title="How Switch 2 Backward Compatibility fixes a lot of bad Switch frame rates" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds3mP6OMM9w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s this final category that I find particularly interesting and the focus for today. Despite both systems having ARM CPU cores and an Nvidia GPU, there’s enough difference in the hardware such that the Switch 2 doesn’t run Switch 1 games natively. It’s not emulation either, but is instead running Switch 1 games through a translation layer that remaps CPU and GPU calls to the new architecture. It’s the same methodology that allows Windows games to run in Linux via Proton on the Steam Deck. Just as there, Nintendo had to test thousands upon thousands of games <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/18/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible-guide-what-switch-games-cant-be-played/">to find any compatibility errors</a>, then trying to fix those, either with patches or under-the-hood improvements for the Switch 2’s translation layer.</p>
<p>However it’s come to pass, the improvements can straighten out some really wonky games. The focus of our comparisons is on the docked modes of these games – something that’s more viable to capture and compare, so let’s start with a real problem child on the Switch 1.</p>

<p>We’ve loaded up the demo for <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a></strong>, a game that had some pretty obvious problems on Switch 1, barely holding onto 30fps and often going down to the low 20s – and that’s before considering split-screen. On Switch 2? Well, it’s a practical 30fps lock, which just makes the game feel so much better and consistent, allowing the Breath of the Wild art style to really shine.</p>
<p>We’ll jump on over, now, to the <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes</a></strong> demo, which came a couple years later and shows improved optimisation and balance on the Switch 1. In fact, this game came with an unlocked frame rate that very rarely dipped below 30fps. Though… since it’s in the mid-30s most of the time, it really should have had a 30fps cap at the time.</p>
<p>But in 2025, we’re glad they chose not to, because this makes it a fantastic showcase for the Switch 2’s inherent power bump. Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes is a near perfect 60fps on Switch 2!</p>

<p>A similar example is <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/11/dragon-quest-builders-2-review/">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a></strong>. This game could be really, really punishing on original Switch, especially with more complex custom creations shared online from more powerful platforms. Performance was generally acceptable through the campaign though, the open world gameplay being north of 30fps, but maybe in the low 20s for busy towns, flying around and when lots of NPCs are on screen.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this also comes with an unlocked frame rate, and performance is not far off a straight doubling for Switch 2. In sparse scenes you can get 60fps, though those busier areas and if you’re flying rapidly across the world do pull the Switch 2 down to the mid-low 50s.</p>

<p>Those have all been 30fps target games, but what about an unsteady 60?</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/">Bayonetta 2</a></strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/14/bayonetta-bayonetta-2-have-found-a-new-home-on-nintendo-switch/"> was already pretty solid on Switch 1</a>, as a port across from the Wii U. There can be minor dips within the arena combat, and let’s just say that with rare exceptions, Switch 2 evens those minor kinks out quite nicely. It wasn’t quite as smooth in handheld though, and some areas could exhibit noticeable frame rate drops, which have seemingly been ironed out by Switch 2’s increased handheld power as well.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a></strong> was much more ambitious with the Switch 1 as its base platform and, surprise, surprise, it’s nowhere near to PlatinumGames’ usual 60fps target a lot of the time. We’re taking regularly dropping to the low 50s, high 40s, and the most sensational action going all the way down to the 30s – cutscenes were once again rendered at 30fps.</p>
<p>But guess what? Switch 2 brings 60fps through and through, outside of those most cinematic moments where PlatinumGames input a 30fps frame cap.</p>
<p>Another problem child from the first party line up was <strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/11/30/xenoblade-chronicles-2-review/">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></strong>. The worst of the issues in this game emerged when playing handheld where the chip stepped down to lower power modes, the dynamic resolution and upscaling getting <em>seriously</em> blurry, but there are also issues when docked, such as some severe pop-in when loading to a new area and performance that could degrade to below 30fps. Thankfully later games and ports made different technical choices to get better image quality and performance, but Xenoblade 2 has been stuck like this on Switch 1.</p>

<p>Playing on Switch 2 comes with a big improvement thanks to an improved frame rate, a better base resolution that’s noticeable both in handheld and docked, and faster loading of assets.</p>
<p>But the Switch 2 can’t fix or improve everything. If a game was already pretty well attuned to a 30fps cap, then the only improvements can come from better dynamic resolution scaling.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/28/wolfenstein-ii-nintendo-switch-review/">Wolfenstein 2</a>,</strong> for example, is a game that’s designed to target 60fps on PS4 and Xbox One, but was limited to 30fps on Switch and, as Panic Button’s second effort with idtech after Doom, it did a pretty good job of sticking to it. This was achieved by much more than just reducing resolution, the texture detail also being significantly reduced, combining to give gives the game a lot of almost putty-like blurriness. Add in hefty motion blur, which is much more of a smear when at 30fps than 60fps, and it makes playing this game feel compromised, regardless of Switch 1 or 2.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 does boost the dynamic resolutions to help quite significantly with blurriness, but the loss of top end detail and being limited to 30fps just doesn’t feel as good as you’d want from this series.</p>

<p>It’s a shade ironic that the most tuned and optimised game for Switch can’t benefit as much from this kind of improvement on Switch 2, while those less optimised titles come good.</p>
<p>In general, this straight backward compatibility offers a fantastic showcase of how the Switch 2 can apply its raw power to last generation games and deliver some tangible improvements. A game with an uneven frame rate can be smoothed out, something with a low dynamic resolution can be improved, and a lot of the most troubled games on Switch 1 will give a better experience on Switch 2.</p>
<p>However, all of the games here would benefit from a Switch 2 patch or a paid Switch 2 Edition release. It would be fantastic to get Age of Calamity running at 60fps, to have Bayonetta 2 and 3 at 1080p in handheld, and Xenoblade Chronicles 2 and the rest of the series to remastered for higher resolutions. I know a lot of PlatinumGames fans are also pining for an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/astral-chain-review/">Astral Chain</a> patch to lift the 30fps lock, to unchain one of the studio’s Switch highlights.</p>
<p>We have seen these kinds of patches in other games, and the results there can be pretty fantastic as well, but that’s for another article…</p>

<p>In terms of "raw computing power", that is</p>

<figure><a title="Switch 2 / Xbox Series S" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0d9e139a3bed6/switch-2-xbox-series-s.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>They say that comparison is the thief of Joy-Con — or something along those lines — but ever since Switch 2's reveal, people have been clamouring to work out how Nintendo's latest matches up against the other consoles on the market. Before launch, the tech experts over at Digital Foundry suggested the console was roughly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZZAr1c0Wqg">in line with Sony's PS4</a>, but Koei Tecmo has recently estimated that it might be even beefier.</p>
<p>That is according to producer Takuto Edagawa, who, in a recent interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/">wccftech</a> about the upcoming Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts S</a>, estimated that Switch 2 might be closer to the Xbox Series S in terms of "raw computing power" than Sony's last-gen system.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of characteristics when it comes to raw computing power, so it's difficult to generalise," Edagawa told the outlet, "but I think it can be thought [of] as closer to the Series S".</p>
<p>We suspected that Switch 2 would never be able to stand toe-to-toe with the likes of the PS5 and Series X, but hearing that developers understand it to be roughly in line with the Series S proves that there has been a pretty substantial upgrade under the hood — as if the promise of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> wasn't proof enough.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the wccftech interview, Edagawa revealed that the team has not used NVIDIA's DLSS Super Resolution for the Switch 2 version of Wild Hearts S, though they <em>did</em> implement HD Rumble 2 to achieve "more nuanced vibration without additional costs for adjustments".</p>
<p>Wild Hearts S arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>25th July</strong>, bringing the Monster Hunter-style adventure to the Nintendo hybrid with more beasts and modes, GameChat implementation, and a new four-player multiplayer option.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has confirmed a record-setting launch for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> with over 3.5 million units sold worldwide in the first four days on the market.</p>
<p>This is not only the highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware in the first four days – the original Switch only reached 2.74 million units through its entire launch month of March 2017 – but also seems to dramatically out-pace Sony and Microsoft’s best efforts.</p>


<p>We don’t have an apples-to-apples comparison, but the PlayStation 4 sold 2.1 million within its first two weeks. Sony didn’t provide specifics, noting that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-11-25-ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history">the PlayStation 5 surpassed that</a>, but the PS5 then largely kept pace with the previous generation through the first quarter to ship 4.5 million through the end of 2020 (its first 7 weeks on sale).</p>
<p>So, let’s just say that the Switch 2 is the fastest selling console launch.</p>
<p>This record comes with the caveat that the PS5 launched in the middle of a silicon shortage and Sony struggled to maintain supply for the following year. We don’t know what Sony would have managed to sell if they could fully meet demand at the launch of either PS4 or PS5. Of course, you can only beat the competition that’s in before you, and Nintendo has done exactly that by ensuring that there is all of this Switch 2 supply ready to go for launch.</p>

<p>It also comes despite all of the criticisms over pricing for the Switch 2 and its tentpole launch title, Mario Kart World. The Switch 2 is more expensive than the original console, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> set a new $80 price point that many fear will become another new standard price point for major game releases. Nintendo has softened the blow somewhat by offering a cheaper game bundle with Mario Kart World included, and that has almost certainly been the preferred SKU.</p>
<p>It’s also fair to say that major tech products will sell out no matter what. We’ll have to see if the Nintendo Switch 2 can keep up the pace and continue to sell better than the original Switch and PlayStation’s best through the coming months and years.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> is the company's fastest-selling hardware ever, having sold 3.5m units worldwide in its first four days on sale.</p>
<p>This data has been provided by Nintendo itself, following the console's launch last Thursday.</p>
<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 represents the next evolution of Nintendo Switch, and we're very happy and grateful to see it already being embraced by so many players across Europe," said Luciano Pereña, CEO and president of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-europe">Nintendo of Europe</a>. "We look forward to seeing players connecting through games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, sharing the experience with friends and family whether near or far."</p>

<p>For comparison, Sony sold 4.5m PS5 units globally in its first quarter back in 2020, so Switch 2 has just a million less but in four days. Microsoft has not shared launch numbers of its Xbox Series X/S console.</p>
<p>Yesterday it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-reportedly-nintendos-biggest-uk-launch-but-sits-behind-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs"> reported the console was Nintendo's biggest launch in the UK</a> with the Switch 2 outselling the original Switch by over two to one. However, it's behind the equivalent launches of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>Nintendo has forecast it will sell 15m units from release until the end of the financial year, meaning it's just under a quarter of the way there in four days.</p>
<p>News of these initial sales comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-treehouse-live-viewers-have-very-clear-message-for-nintendo">price of its games and accessories</a>.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch in Japan, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-admits-switch-2-demand-far-exceeds-expectations-in-japan-as-company-president-offers-stark-warning-over-stock">Nintendo warned demand for the console "far exceeds expectations"</a> and warned of stock shortages.</p>

The company stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-considering-switch-2-post-launch-price-rise-if-tariff-situation-worsens">considering a post-launch price rise if the situation worsens</a>.</p>
<p>Despite these issues, then, Nintendo is still celebrating a huge launch of its latest console. Have you got yourself a Switch 2? What do you think so far?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune Awakening</a> has soared past 142,000 concurrent players on Steam following its full public release.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, the game quickly surpassed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-nears-100k-concurrent-players-day-one">peak established during the five day head start</a> for those who bought the Deluxe or Ultimate edition.

So what can we infer from seeing Dune Awakening pull this off? Well, a growth of roughly 40 percent in peak players (on a Tuesday no less) indicates a sizable number of players were waiting in the wings for the cheaper version of the game. It's still possible that the game could hit another peak too this weekend, following the trend established by the early launch.

</p><p>It'll be interesting to see to what degree the end game Landsraad and deep desert map can retain players, especially those who may have grabbed it for a romp with friends or a more single player, solitary experience. When you get to the end game, Dune Awakening does a baton pass from a survival game core to more of an MMO server-wide PvP and politics experience. How many of these initial players stick around for this bit, remains a big question.</p>
<p>To celebrate the full launch yesterday, it looks as though the Funcom team were enjoying mini cupcakes at the office, <a href="https://x.com/Tascharoe/status/1932439203641717162">as shown off on social media by one Tascha Röösli on Twitter</a>. Launching a video game, especially a big online one like Dune Awakening, is a big task. Why not celebrate a little?</p>
<p>Dune Awakening had previously proved so popular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-surpasses-elden-ring-nightreign-on-steams-top-sellers">as to dethrone Elden RIng Nightreign from its perch atop of the Steam top sellers page</a> just before its initial release on the 5th June.</p>
<p>If you're looking to jump into the game, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-now-playing">Eurogamer's Dune Awakening preview</a> - it's "the perfect blend of survival, MMORPG, and house envy". </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>One minute you’re flicking through Steam’s Next Fest demos, and finding one that looks to be included despite having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3068230/view/498320947205375622?l=english">come out in May</a>. The next, you’re desperately firing missiles into the rear end of giant monster truck, a sole red light glaring out from its metallic behind, as though it’s mega-pissed that it seems to have gotten stuck in a cluster of trees. Given that, it should be easy prey for the ordnance strapped to the bonnet of my very <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a>-ish muscle car coated in enough sheets of metal to fence off several allotments.</p>
<p>This is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3068230/Mad_Metal/">Mad Metal</a>, though, an indie game whose murderous enemy cars have minds of their own and move more like automotive animals than simple machines.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The car combat was the thing that drew me to try the demo of solo developer Hakim Elayday’s work-in-progress metal twister, which fittingly looks to have grown from<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieDev/comments/1gxca8h/made_a_vehicle_combat_game_because_i_was_sad/"> its creator’s sadness</a> at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-reportedly-cancels-twisted-metal-live-service-game-as-part-of-mass-layoffs">last year’s reports</a> Sony had canceled an unannounced live-service Twisted Metal game.</p>
<p>I’m a simple man, I see the opportunity to slam the pedal to the metal and fire a machine gun while doing some skids, and I take it. As you can imagine, then I was in my element when pretty much right out of the gate, Mad Metal tasked me with chasing down and stopping a train covered in rusty spikes.</p>
<p>Yelling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3GK_sfPVM">the line</a> from GTA San Andreas as I went, I splattered the engine pulling it with lead until it looked like a chrome colander, and was rewarded with some new car parts. This is the general loop of Mad Metal from what I’ve played of it so far. You drive around an Unreal Engine map that’s mostly hills littered with light shrubbery and patches of woodland, running into groups of two or three hostile vehicles from various gangs at a time.</p>

<p>Then, the great driving dance of death begins. You and your foes that in some instances seem to lurch around more like hostile creatures than cars orbit each other, firing your ordnance and occasionally smashing together, until one of you explodes. It’s an absolute blast most of the time, with the loveable jankiness with which it all happens just adding to the blast you can have with it.</p>
<p>There was one point when I was fighting two “Monster Driller ATVs” - bright yellow armoured 4x4s with three spinning drill bits menacingly protruding from their bumpers - and ended up wearing one as a hat. Its raised suspension meant that my slam into it had wedged me underneath, so I merrily drove around for a bit with my camera clipped into the invisible void of a nonexistent interior, watching as its circular teeth continued to spin away despite their host being out for the count.</p>
<p>There’s a slow time button, which really helps you appreciate fun little touches like the game’s bushes hastily flattening like frightened possums in response to you launching a flurry of bullets at a camper van. There’s also a giant metal eye right out of something like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Portal hovering over you the whole time, providing guidance and dropping memey computer sass like “he needs some milk” when you get exploded.</p>
<p>Overall, at this point Mad Metal’s a bit of a car crash, in both good ways and bad. The core of it’s pretty fun, even if getting a kick out of the more ridiculous jank has definitely played a role in that for me. It’s not got a release date right now, but the demo’s definitely something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> released last night, and within a matter of hours gameplay footage was going viral online. However, this was not because players were sharing their positive experiences. Rather, it was because they were sharing a multitude of glitches and error screens which were appearing as they attempted to make their way through the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Mctannen/status/1932574418397536412">Glitches</a> have ranged from <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932500739999330419">stuttering issues</a> to <a href="https://x.com/SlashLP89/status/1932517088280957096">stretching bodies</a> and distorted character faces (see header image above). Many posts across social media question why the game wasn't delayed, given it has been <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1932547822345126241">released in such a broken state</a>. Others <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1932498253452616032">suggest the game is overpriced for what it delivers</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, MindsEye <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265250/MindsEye/#app_reviews_hash">reviews on Steam</a> currently sit with a "mixed" average, with many again calling out performance issues and assumed lack of prior testing, although there is also praise for its story so far. The MindsEye Discord has similar comments, with discussions about the game's "unfinished state" and inconsistent frame rates.</p>
<p>As for its player numbers, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3265250/charts/">SteamDB</a> shows MindsEye had a launch concurrent player peak of 3,302. At the time of writing, there are only 993 players in the game via Steam. </p> <div>

<p>Developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1l8acbd/update_on_performance/">Build A Rocket Boy released a statement</a> on the MindsEye reddit following the game's launch, stating it was "working around the clock to improve performance on mainstream hardware as well as consoles". The developer said it understood that the current minimum PC spec requirements "are very high". It will be detailing its next patch at some time today.</p>
<p>Plenty still hope that MindsEye can turn its fortunes around with the help of a patch or two. There is some good faith out there that it can redeem itself, and several players have said there does appear to be a decent enough foundation tucked beneath the game's issues.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 console has sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days on the market. The news <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2025/250611.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes</a> from Nintendo itself, which also confirmed that the Switch 2 is now its fastest-selling console ever when considering this timeframe.</p>
<p>This early result certainly won't surprise industry analysts, who have been forecasting that the Nintendo Switch 2 will become the fastest-selling console ever in gaming history. DFC Intelligence <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">estimated</a> that 15 million units could be sold by the end of this year, and that was with the looming shadow of Trump's tariffs. Without that, DFC Intelligence reckoned it could reach 17 million units.</p>
<p>Of course, any console's track record is a marathon rather than a sprint, but the new hardware certainly started off strong. Reception has also been very positive so far. On Wccftech, Chris Wray praised the new system in many ways in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>All in all, I thoroughly recommend the Switch 2. Like the Switch, it's a great console with a mixture of handheld and regular. This feels sturdier, and the quality of life improvements are far stronger than you may think when simply reading about them. Still, even though I overwhelmingly recommend the Switch 2, if you already have a Switch, I would probably hold out for an offer, which you likely will need to, and for a few games to pad out the abysmal launch line-up. Then again, I got this the same day as people buying it did, so I know you're going to have to wait because it sold better than stolen gold at the Swiss Bankers Convention.</em></p>
<p><em>The Nintendo Switch 2 is an excellent console, a clear upgrade from the Switch with some clear quality of life improvements. It also feels like a more professional console, with a larger screen, crisp and clear, and the ability to run up to 4K when docked. For all its benefits, of which there are many, this will be a console to buy; with the major downside at the moment being a non-existent launch line-up and it simply isn't cheap, particularly as you will need an additional MicroSD Express card to make up for the poor storage capacity.</em></p>

<p>On another note, according to Koei Tecmo, the new console is closer to the Xbox Series S than Sony's PlayStation 4.

<p>Game-Key Card releases have been a huge talking point in the lead up to the launch of the Switch 2 – arguably blurring the lines between physical and digital media.</p>
<p>Now that Nintendo's new system is out, it seems Capcom has revealed how it will be reporting game-key card sales. This information comes from a financial briefing Q&amp;A summary, and it's been confirmed the Japanese company will treat game-key cards as "digital sales".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Q. Are key cards for Nintendo Switch 2 (game cards that feature an activaition key necessary to launch the software) recorded as physical or digital units?</p></blockquote><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jpylkr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p><blockquote>
<p>A. They are recorded as digital sales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that's that – game-key cards are classed as digital media by Capcom. It follows a story last week about how publishers are actually thanking Nintendo for this new option, as many companies face "rising costs to make games".</p>
<p>Capcom last week released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> on the Switch 2 as a game-key card release, and while it comes with all of the Year 1 and Year 2 DLC, this part of the game is actually a download code. So the main game is on the game-key card, but you'll still need to input a code on the eShop to access the DLC.</p>
<p>If you were to end up giving away this card in the future, it seems the next user would then have to repurchase the game's DLC.</p>

<p>"I just don't improvise non-Mario phrases"</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Charles Martinet" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0f509946734b9/charles-martinet.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's been some recent confusion on social media and elsewhere online about what the former voice of Mario, Charles Martinet, is allowed to do when it comes to promoting the iconic Nintendo mascot at certain public events.</p>
<p>It stems from a post shared by the online content creator Ricky Berwick, who mentioned how Martinet "wasn't even allowed to do the voice of Mario or any of his iconic character's voices either" at a convention he recently attended. Berwick added to this, claiming Martinet wasn't allowed to do any of this on video, but "off camera was fine".</p>
<p>This led to <a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319">Charles Martinet responding to Ricky's original post</a> – explaining how it's all about maintaining the integrity of the character and it's his call:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Charles Martinet:</strong> "Oh Ricky. I do the Voice for every Fan I meet. I just don’t improvise non-Mario phrases or dialogue. That’s my choice to be sure. I always maintain the integrity of the character. But come and visit me at any Comic Con or Fan expo and you’ll hear super Mario for sure! #woohoo"<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Ricky Berwick:</strong> "As long as it's your choice at the end of the day."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a separate video, <a href="https://x.com/rickyberwick/status/1932157603460911283">Ricky actually shared a video of himself</a> and Martinet – with Charles humming the Mario theme song on camera, but not actually voicing the character.</p>
<p>So, hopefully, it's a bit clearer now – if you do go to a convention to meet Charles, you can still hear him say famous Super Mario lines, but you might not be able to record it on camera, and don't expect him to just necessarily say <em>anything</em>, as it's apparently all about maintaining the integrity of the legendary character he voiced for many years.</p>
<p>Charles Martinet was originally given the title of "Mario Ambassador" in 2023 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/charles-martinet-reveals-his-favourite-super-mario-games-at-nintendo-live-2024">last year made an appearance at Nintendo Live 2024</a>. He's been officially replaced by Kevin Afghani in the video games, who most recently voiced Mario in the Switch 2 title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>

<p>"The fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c5761921612aa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following the Switch 2's launch last week, Nintendo has now officially confirmed its new hybrid hardware has sold "over 3.5 million units worldwide" in the first four days.</p>
<p>The system debuted on <strong>5th June 2025</strong> and this figure happens to make it the "highest global sales level for any Nintendo hardware" <em>ever</em> in the first four days.</p>
<p>This follows the recent news about the Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uk-charts-nintendo-switch-2-annihilates-the-competition-in-its-debut-week">annihilating the competition in the UK</a> with the arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on the same day. Other reports suggest the new system has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-switch-2-is-already-breaking-sales-records-in-france">sold incredibly well in locations like France</a> and Spain.</p>
<p>So that's again "over" 3.5 million units and counting. According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/hard_soft/index.html">official Nintendo data</a>, the original Switch is currently sitting at 152 million units after an eight-year run. Other platforms like the Wii U and GameCube shifted 13 million and 21 million units respectively during their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Mario Kart World appears to be the go-to launch title for the Switch 2 (and has even been bundled as part of a slightly more expensive Switch 2 package), so it will be interesting to see how many sales it's made from the new hardware release.</p>
<p>Based on Nintendo's information here, Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad notes how this technically makes the Switch 2 the "<a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1932629946834563455">fastest selling home video game console of all time</a>".</p>

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z15RK?object_uuid=abc75198-2cb1-4e93-be63-56b515f0fb81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">128GB model is $269.99</a> after a $30 off discount. and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Xd1?object_uuid=abc75198-2cb1-4e93-be63-56b515f0fb81&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">256GB is $349.99</a> after a $50 off instant discount. These discounts are honored at major retailers including Amazon, Target, and Walmart. The Meta Quest 3S is widely considered the best value in VR gaming. Not only is it priced hundreds less compared to most other competitors (including Meta's own Quest3), it's also a standalone untethered gaming system that doesn't require a PC or PlayStation 5 to run,,</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To sweeten the pot even more, every Quest 3S purchase includes a copy of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow VR</a> game and a three-month trial of Meta Quest+. In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">8/10 review</a>, Dan Stapleton wrote that "Batman: Arkham Shadow makes most of the Arkham series' defining gameplay work respectably well in VR, and its mystery story pays off."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Meta Quest 3S VR Headset with Batman: Arkham Shadow</h2><div id="222595" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 256GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><div catalogid="46006467-4f90-4d47-ad0b-ab15ae567c6a" id="207786"><div id="207786" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Meta Quest 3S 128GB VR Headset</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Quest 3S is an improvement over the original Quest 2 in every way and, amazingly, without a price increase. It also adopts many of the same features of the more expensive Quest 3, like the new and improved Touch controllers, the upgraded SnapDragon APU, and support for full color AR passthrough. In IGN's 9/10 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S review</a>, Gabriel Moss wrote that "raw processing power, full-color passthrough, and snappy Touch Plus controllers make the Quest 3S a fantastic standalone VR headset that also brings entry-level mixed-reality gaming to the masses for – arguably – the very first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What really sets this deal above all other VR deals is that the Meta Quest 3S can be played <strong>completely untethered</strong>. That means you can play games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/28/beat-saber-review">Beat Saber</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/08/pistol-whip-review">Pistol Whip</a> without having to own a powerful gaming PC or a PlayStation 5 console. Try to find another standalone VR headset at this price and you'll come up empty.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Is the Quest 3S Different from the Quest 3?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Even at retail price, the Quest 3S comes in at $200, or 40% cheaper than the $500 <a href="https://howl.link/33aavd3s563fo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quest 3</a>. Obviously, some compromises were made to get the 3S to its competitive price point. The spec comparisons are listed below:</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Similarities</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor</li><li>Touch Plus controllers</li><li>120Hz refresh rate</li><li>Mixed reality passthrough (same cameras, different layout)</li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Quest 3S vs. Quest 3 <u>Differences</u></h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Lower per-eye resolution (1832x1920 vs 2064×2208)</li><li>Fresnel lens vs. pancake lens</li><li>Lower FOV (96°/90° vs 104°/96°)</li><li>Smaller storage capacity (128GB vs 512GB)</li><li><strong>Longer</strong> battery life (2.5hrs vs 2.2hrs)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price, the Quest 3S is a better value than the Quest 3, and the best choice for gamers who are just starting out in the world of VR and want to test the waters. It is hands down a major improvement over the Quest 2 that it replaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>Sonic experts are on the case</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last week, SEGA unveiled the first batch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</a> guest characters. This includes not only characters like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hatsune_miku_project_diva_mega_mix">Hatsune Miku</a> but also Steve, Alex and Creeper from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>. There are some other supposed leaks still doing the rounds as well.</p>
<p>Now, the official Sonic social media account has sent Sonic fans into a frenzy once again, with a new piece of artwork apparently featuring a very familiar-looking symbol. The focus here is on what looks exactly like the Triforce from the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Legend of Zelda</a> series.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Before anyone gets excited here, no – it's <em>probably</em> not what you might be thinking. Some <a href="https://x.com/Fantactx/status/1932073396486947161">Sonic fans</a> <a href="https://x.com/NoahAFS/status/1931403746895880421">are convinced</a> the character Espio (who is a ninja) and the symbol are linked, and this is more likely to be a reference to Japan's Hōjō clan. Others acknowledge how <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1l7n72x/so_why_is_the_triforce_in_an_official_sonic/">similar patterns have featured</a> in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fantactx: "It's not a teaser for Link to be in the game, it's a symbol used by the Hōjō clan back in 13th century Japan who were allies with a ninja clan which is why it's near Espio as he himself, is a ninja. A example of this being used for inspiration would be the Triforce."</p>
<p>NoahAFS: "No everyone, that's not the Triforce next to Espio, that's the symbol of the Hōjō clan, a Japanese samurai family. This does not mean Link is coming to CrossWorlds."</p>
<p>Shaddy_the_guy: "This is just a pattern that can exist, y'know. It's all over the walls in Palmtree Panic"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Case closed then, or is it? Stranger crossovers have happened and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds">Sonic Racing</a> series has even hosted some platform-exclusive characters in the past. Link's also starred in a racing game already, so why not another? And while this kind of crossover would have been unimaginable once upon a time, Sega and Nintendo maintain a great relationship nowadays.</p>
<p>So, while we're not completely ruling anything out here (<em>at least for now</em>), we wouldn't suggest you get your hopes up. In some other Sonic Racing news, Sega has confirmed there'll be a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, along with a paid upgrade.</p>
