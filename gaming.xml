			<p>At Gamescom 2024, I got the chance to try <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-and-glowmade-reveal-king-of-meat-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">King of Meat</a>, the debut game of British indie studio Glowmade. The developer was founded a few years ago by former industry veterans who worked on high-profile games like Battlefield, Fable, and Horizon Zero Dawn, and they <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-games-glowmade-horizon-zero-dawn-fable-battlefield-vets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signed</a> a publishing deal with Amazon Games three years ago.</p>
<p>King of Meat is a colorful cooperative action game styled after survival game shows. It is set in the world of Loregok, which seamlessly blends traditional fantasy elements like dragons, trolls, and skeletons with corporate commercialism. Contenders join the so-called Komstruct Koliseum in a risky bid for glory, gold, and fame.</p>
<p>During the game, you race through the dungeons, hacking and slashing against all sorts of monsters while at the same time trying to impress the bloodthirsty crowd with your combat skills. Indeed, every action, such as dealing a certain amount of damage or looting treasure, provides a certain amount of points that go into the tally.</p>
<p>As for the combat itself, it's pretty standard fare for an action title, with light and heavy attacks, dodging, and whatnot.&nbsp;There appears to be a strong focus on various types of environmental traps to avoid, including classics like lava-filled rooms, spinning blades, flaming balls of fire, rotating spikes, and more.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn't too impressed with what I played. At first glance, everything seemed to be a little too vanilla to stand out in today's increasingly crowded lineup of cooperative action titles, but King of Meat does have a feature that could make it much more attractive: user-generated content. It will come with a dungeon editor on all platforms, allowing the whole community to easily create levels and share them with the public. Needless to say, this feature could vastly expand the longevity.</p>
<p>After the brief hands-on, I had the opportunity to speak to Glowmade Studio Head and Co-Founder Jonny Hopper to discuss the studio's inspiration for King of Meat, its feature set, and the post-launch roadmap (in broad strokes). By the way, the game is currently in Pre-Alpha and there's no word on a release window. It will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and even Nintendo Switch, though. Glowmade is taking tester signups <a href="https://www.kingofmeat.com/en-us/tester-sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>, in case you're interested.</p>

<p><strong>How long have you been working on King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>About four years. We signed with Amazon at the end of 2020, although we had been working on it as a very small project for about a year before that.</p>
<p><strong>What was your inspiration for this rather peculiar setting?</strong></p>
<p>We were in the pub, and a few of us were sitting around just talking about the things that we love, the films and stuff that we really enjoyed. Adam, our art director, said he's a big fan of Labyrinth, the David Bowie film with Jim Henson. He loves that, and Mike and Jim were talking about WrestleMania and that kind of over-the-top, spectacular sort of stuff, and then we just felt like, well, what happens if we try and take those feelings and put them into a game?</p>
<p><strong>One of the main features is user-generated content (UGC). Will the ability to create dungeons be available on consoles, too?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. It's fully cross-play on all the platforms, so you can play the levels on any platform and create levels on any platform. The idea is that anything you make on any platform will work on any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Which engine are you using?</strong></p>
<p>It is our own technology. We built the whole engine ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>You said there will be your own levels and dungeons, and the community can create custom ones.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. We're sort of doing that already behind the scenes. The game itself, when it comes out, is going to have about a hundred levels that we made as part of the offering, and we've also got the community behind the scenes building levels for us already.</p>
<p>We've already got people kind of seeding those creations. The idea is that on launch, there's going to be a lot of content. Quite a lot of official Glowmade stuff, but also some community-made stuff ready to go on day one.</p>
<p><strong>Did the community already help you improve the level-making tools in King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, they did. We got such great feedback from them. Also, we get surprised a lot, which is really, really cool because obviously we know exactly how everything works and how all the pieces work, but then somebody will make a level and you don't know how they've done the thing that they've done with the tools, and there's always really amazing moments when you go, how did he do that? There's one level which is a magic library, with all these books flying everywhere, and I know theoretically how it's done, but the complexity that the person pulled off is really amazing. Those are the things that really make us happy, actually.</p>
<p><strong>I guess it's a bit like LittleBigPlanet, where some people made astounding levels.</strong></p>
<p>I worked on the editor for that some 18 years ago, so yeah, they're very much alike. We want people to just actually feel good when they're making levels and feel proud of the things they've made.</p>
<p><strong>How will you feature creators in the game? Will players be able to rate the best levels?</strong></p>
<p>That's such a good question. There's quite a few ways to do this. When you make a level, one of the things you can do is you can use a preset, which consists of different objects and enemies and styles to make certain levels.</p>
<p>When you've published your level, it can then make its way into the sort of main league that the whole public can display as part of their game progress. Also, for every single player, we have this kind of tipping system. Every day as a player, you get like a hundred tips, and the only thing you can do with those tips is give them to creators to reward them. Using that makes you as a creator feel really good because you can see people enjoying what you made, but it also means we can do exactly as you said, feature the creator of the week with the most levels or the most tips. We can do those kind of cool leaderboards and tags and badges or something.</p>
<p>Also, when you were playing in the plaza, did you see the big banners? We can use those banners to be like, the creator of the week is Rebecca because she's got, you know, a 1000 tips or whatever. It lets us show off the people behind the creations and make them feel good and part of the game as well.</p>
<p><strong>With Amazon publishing, I bet it occurred to you that King of Meat could get big on Twitch.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that would be great. It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.</p>
<p><strong>In the past, a few games have implemented Twitch functionality that allowed spectators to interact with the game. Did you think about doing the same?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we've been thinking about that, but we're not going to want to talk about what that is at the moment.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is sort of an obvious good fit for streaming. We've also had a bunch of streamers and content creators play the game already, and they really enjoyed it. They were screaming and laughing and just having a good time. We're really hopeful that it can take off.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Fair enough. As far as what I played in the demo, King of Meat seemed to be a lot about avoiding environmental traps and fighting basic enemies, but will there be any boss encounters?</strong></p>
<p>A boss fight is kind of what you make it. What we've done is we've given the tools to the creators to build bosses. There's a really good example in as a level that you may or may not have played; I think it's called Bombs Galore, and it's got this really amazing boss fight that really feels like a climactic moment. But all we're doing is providing those pieces to let a level creator make that kind of thing in the way they want.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell me about character progression?</strong></p>
<p>In the game, you have something called the road to stardom. You're ranking up through the levels, and as you rank up, you unlock new features, new moves, new weapons, and special moves, and then within that, you can rank up your weapon archetypes, and you unlock various different things there. The core game, even if you don't engage with the UGC side of it at all, making or playing, what we're delivering is a good 30 to 40 hours of campaign and progression.</p>
<p><strong>So there's also a campaign.</strong></p>
<p>There are some single-player campaign levels that you can play, and that's where we can do narrative development and story, as well as the League, which is your progress through growing fame.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned talents, right? Is there a player role system where you can be a support character, for example?</strong></p>
<p>That comes with your loadout. There are different weapons that are better or worse at different roles. You have a system called trinkets, which are like buffs for weapons, and you can also choose your kind of special move loadout as well. The idea here is that you can choose what you like, but then you start a level, and there's also like a little weapon locker, and it's like a vending machine; you can then go and change it once you're in the level if, as a team of four, you think you want to be more of a support type of character. So, it's not a character class thing. But it's more of an organic way to reconfigure your loadout.</p>
<p><strong>I know King of Meat is a co-op game, but what if one player could be the Dungeon Master? Did you think of that type of asymmetrical PvP experience?</strong></p>
<p>It's not the game we're launching with. I think there's loads of game modes and ideas that we plan to do post-release, and we'll talk about that more another time.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking about the game's post-launch live service, what kind of additions can players anticipate?</strong></p>
<p>We've got a roadmap of one, two, and three years out where we've got a content plan for new weapon skins, weapon archetypes, more campaign levels, more example levels and cosmetics and so forth. We know what we want to do and how we want to do it, but we also want to listen to the community and see what they really want us to focus on.&nbsp;Do they want a new feature? Do they want a new creative mode? Are they really passionate about a particular skin or something that we can support?</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about whether these updates will be free or not?</strong></p>
<p>We are not going to delve too much in there at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be an in-game store with microtransactions?</strong></p>
<p>It's only for the cosmetics. We've all been very clear that we're not doing a battle pass, and there is no pay to progress or pay to win.</p>
<p><strong>So you're not adopting a season system?</strong></p>
<p>Not in the battle pass way.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Will you release themed updates, like Halloween, for King of Meat?</strong></p>
<p>That's the plan. We've got an event system in the game where we could have a competition on making the best Halloween level, and then at the end of the competition, we feature those levels on a rotation and then you go into the Halloween event, and you can play all the best levels. We've got a lot of plans for that sort of seasonal content.</p>
<p><strong>With this event system, will you also add themed props, etc., for level creators?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly, that's perfect. Going back to the Halloween thing and maybe there's pumpkins and Jack-o'-lanterns and skeleton outfits.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2012190/view/4595449146464414178" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, which was originally intended to launch in the third quarter of this year, will now be arriving on February 27th, 2025 instead. Overseer says this decision came "after a lot of careful consideration and many days with our thinking caps on".</p>
<p>The studio says that it considered an Early Access release for&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, but that "for a game like&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, we believe it's crucial for players to experience the entire journey in the best possible light".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=p9e_sY0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kaiserpunk-delayed-map.jpg?itok=7veau_He 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to cook.</figcaption></figure><p>Lead designer&nbsp;Danijel Mihokovic goes on to say that even if publishers "don't recognize the potential" of&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>or are "too hesitant to try something genuinely new", he and his studio don't want to compromise their vision.</p>
<p>To that end, lots of new features have been added to&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>'s core design based on player feedback. These features include new biomes, a heritage system, and an "intricate trading system", as well as "significant optimization work".</p>
<p>If you're looking for more information about&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk</em>, Overseer says it will release a series of dev diary-style feature articles that will explore various aspects of the game's mechanics, worldbuilding, and development process.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be an opportunity to playtest&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>at some point in the near future, although Overseer doesn't disclose exactly when that will be. Watch this space.</p>

<p>Developer and publisher Overseer Games is promising the opportunity to build complex production and logistics chains that span "the length of the game", as well as 100 different resources to gather and transform into everything from zeppelins through to bombers.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of games like Paradox's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hearts-of-iron-iv"><em>Hearts of Iron</em></a>, then you'll likely find plenty to love here.&nbsp;<em>Kaiserpunk&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2012190/Kaiserpunk/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> on February 27th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/wild-bastards-review-roguelite-fps-blue-manchu-1851646637<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>iSometimes, when you want a food metaphor for a video game, you reach for a comparison to fine dining. Other times you might allude toward fast food. In this instance, my trite and overused analogy is a great big buffet offering of all your favorite foods, where you just grab handfuls of everything and stuff it in until you’re sick. That, in the best way possible, is <em>Wild Bastards</em>.<br></p><p>Ostensibly a follow-up to developer Blue Manchu’s 2019 game <em>Void Bastards</em>, but defiantly not a sequel, <em>Wild Bastards</em> is a large part old-school FPS action, with a hefty helping of <em>Slay The Spire</em>, and then embellished with tactical strategy. It mimics the behavior of a thousand rogue-lites, but certainly isn’t one, throwing you into super-difficult first-person action sequences that last only a minute or two each and encouraging you to carefully craft elaborate teams of specifically equipped characters, before undoing all your work between every chapter. And it all absolutely works.</p><figure id="" data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-recommend-id="image://41b3fae117d5113fdc4d1b24ea1cbeba" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spider Rosa shoots at an enemy, causing a large spark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s tempting to spend too long comparing <em>Wild Bastards</em> to its predecessor, putting ticks and crosses next to the aspects it shares and doesn’t, but I think this undermines both. And despite the visual similarity, and that both have a branching map of locations leading to FPS-based missions, they are starkly different. So let’s focus on what <em>Wild Bastards </em>is, rather than what it isn’t.</p><p>You begin the game with two characters, the four-armed, somewhat demonic Spider Rosa, and gambling robot Casino. The pair are attempting to escape the Chaste family of twisted evil cowboy types by fleeing through the galaxy in their spaceship. When beaming down to a (tutorial) planet where the two must make their way across a map to reach a spot that lets them beam back to their craft, one of the Chastes, McNeil, destroys the ship and attempts to capture them. At this point, a legendary ship called Drifter swoops in and rescues them, and forces them on a journey to recover the life forces of former colleagues killed by monstrous patriarch Jebediah Chaste. Which is to say, each chapter of the game is about reaching the end of a small, branching sector of space to collect the DNA of the fallen, then revive them and add them to your crew.</p><p>Each point on the sector map you opt to fly to has a planet you must beam down to, and each of these planets has its own map with branching, intersecting locations, points variously filled with pick-ups, stores, and most importantly, battles to win. Each of these battles is a mini-FPS location, where you take on collections of enemies with your crew. Except—and bear with me, there’s a <em>lot</em> of explaining to do here—your gang travels a planet in “bunches,” grouped in ones or twos, with no more than four selected for any drop. You can bunch them as you wish, but when you’re battling, only one is fighting at any time—however, you can switch between either in the group on the fly. You then need to make use of your ears (and the game’s visual representation of sound on the compass) to locate the enemies, who’ll hide but endlessly give themselves away by shouting insults or having conversations with each other…Oh god, this game is so much easier to play than to describe.</p><figure id="" data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-recommend-id="image://0baa18fd7aaad7f7a86912331fb1c90e" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Warping screen, showing your victories." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If a character dies in battle, they’re dead until you either get back on Drifter and revive them with a rare potion, or if you lose everyone and travel back to the beginning of the sector, or succeed without them and move on to the next sector, whereupon everyone is revived. Except, in both instances, you also lose all the many pieces of equipment you’ve won, bought or picked up, and previously assigned among your crew, along with any money, potions, bonus items, or…beans.</p><p>Except, or, or, except, but, or, except, and my goodness. I’ve not even gotten into the Ace cards you pick up that permanently improve a character, or the Juice you find in battles that allows each to perform their special ability, or how you want to make sure you pair up a long-range one-shot shooter like furious robot Judge with a more rapid-fire but less precise crewmember like mysterious alien Roswell, and if it’s a drop where only three can go, use Casino and his Juice ability to instantly kill the enemy he’s facing, or ghostly pastor Preach who wields the ludicrously ammo-heavy Sermon .58 and who has no shields but can use Juice to heal when she kills. Oh, but also, if your&nbsp;battle is going to be against a bunch of Critters rather than humanoids, you’d be crazy to use snake-like Hopalong and his laser lasso, but he’d be perfect if it’s just against a couple of heavy Ironclads.</p><figure id="" data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-recommend-id="image://17c0c15960bf6b147e7e4d45ea28b869" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1064" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A science-fictiony base, with smoke and guns and shooting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I hope, if somewhat laboriously, I’ve made my point. <em>Wild Bastards</em> is extraordinarily involved, layers upon layers upon layers, with tactics to develop for all its elements. The range of characters is elaborate, eventually offering you 12 to pick from, and even <em>this</em> has added layers of complications, as the wonderfully written and voiced crew will have fallings-out with one another at unscripted points, meaning they’ll refuse to bunch with each other until they make up over…a plate of beans. Or they may bond during one of the squillions of conversations that can occur (I’ve never heard the same one twice), and work better together, supporting the other by dropping items into the arena.</p><p>I’ve also failed to celebrate the ever-larger menagerie of enemies to battle, an extraordinary 25 humanoids (Chasteners), 11 animals (Critters), and five types of automated security bots, each with unique behaviors, weapons, and defenses. Let alone that each Bastard on your crew moves subtly differently, some faster, some able to jump higher, one slithering rapidly on his belly. Like I say, this game has taken something from every section of the buffet, and somehow fit it all on one delicious plate.</p><figure id="" data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sector map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-recommend-id="image://93dcbb5045fde5f6e0f7775b8c68824a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1418" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sector map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are, of course, concerns. While the combat is a lot of fun, and even more so for the incredible variety on offer, I do think it lacks punchy impact on hitting enemies. It feels too often like they’re able to run through your fire unharmed, and there’s a lack of satisfying oof when you clip them. It makes things feel a little too ethereal.</p><p>Poison is ludicrously overpowered, and the levels with poison-spitting Rattlers can be miserable to get through until you’ve rescued some of the later crew members, the ongoing damage they deal being far too punishing. The other, rather more significant gripe, is that there’s a missing difficulty sweet spot between Normal and Easy. Normal can be a surprisingly tough choice, especially early on, as the game makes obsessed use of poison as you’re just getting going with two or three characters, and it can feel dispiriting. But Easy is genuinely easy, and lacks enough challenge. (Clearly there are those who’ll excel on Hard and Very Hard, and god bless them.) I wish that Normal were ever-so slightly less punishing at the beginning. I recommend switching back up to it when you’re just breezing through levels, however, because that’s to miss the point.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blue Manchu / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-recommend-id="image://26552c9ad5c3a2c16a037e63545c06dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1426" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shooting at Critters at the general store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other odd decision is to force you to play through the tutorial every run. Even switched to “Off” in the menu, the opening level remains required, and it’s pretty tedious when you’re on your third or fourth run (something made far worse for me by my having hammered through the demo of this multiple times earlier this year).</p><p>Oh, but if you’re an impatient bugger like me, know that hitting Escape will skip you past the grindingly slow beam up and down sequences and post-battle reports. Just don’t ever use it on the conversations, because they’re all brilliant.</p><p>There, I barely compared it to the brilliant <em>Void Bastards</em> at all, although I urge you to play both. It’s tempting to call <em>Wild Bastards</em> an evolution, but that’s unfair to <em>Void</em>, which has its excellent crafting elements and the permadeath of characters (albeit with persistent progress). What’s crucially similar about both, beyond the excellent art and fantastic sense of humor, is that unlike so many roguelite games, they both <em>want you to win</em>. They’re about progressing forward, being able to reach an ending, and then starting all over to try it completely differently. It’s just that in <em>Wild Bastards</em>, there’s so much more that can be different each time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Could the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series be making a comeback in some fashion? In a new episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIEpU0EF0XI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Kitchen</a> released on Thursday, the legendary skateboarder was asked about the future of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater franchise as it celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. </p>



<p>Hawk said that there is definitely “something” planned to celebrate the anniversary. However, he wouldn’t say much more beyond that.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>After a bit more back-and-forth on it, Hawk wrapped up with saying that he believes it’ll be something that “the fans will truly appreciate”.</p>



<p>Whether that is a brand new game entirely or the planned then canceled Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3/4 remake remains to be seen. Back in 2022, Hawk confirmed that the plan was to release another remake before developer Vicarious Visions was absorbed into Activision.</p>



<p>What do you think is next for the Pro Skater franchise? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

      </p></div><div><p>Over a decade after its removal from mobile app stores, Flappy Bird Foundation, a new company that has acquired the official <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark and licensing, has announced that the hit mobile game <em>Flappy Bird</em> will return to various platforms, including web browsers this fall and new dedicated apps for iOS and Android in 2025. Other platforms are to be announced. <span id="more-914080"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game and its rollout plans, via Flappy Bird Foundation:</p><blockquote><p>Often imitated but never duplicated, <em>Flappy Bird</em>‘s return is spearheaded by the Flappy Bird Foundation, a new team of passionate fans committed to sharing the game with the world. The Flappy Bird Foundation Group and affiliates have acquired the official <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark rights from Gametech Holdings LLC, along with the rights for the original game and character Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile title that has long been credited as originally inspiring the iconic bird.</p><p>Planned future releases, including desktop and mobile web browser, and native app versions on iOS and Android are scheduled for 2025. The upcoming expanded <em>Flappy Bird</em> releases will debut new game modes, characters, progression, and massive multiplayer challenges for the world to flap together—with the Flappy Bird Foundation team set to revamp the game’s ecosystem while maintaining the familiarity of the game design that was enjoyed globally.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_914083"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><p>“It’s been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we’re so excited to finally begin sharing <em>Flappy Bird</em> once again with the world,” said a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation in a press release.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Back in 2022, Hawk claimed that Vicarious Visions was working on remasters of those games before it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vicarious-visions-is-no-more-as-merger-with-blizzard-is-now-official/1100-6502400/" data-ref-id="1100-6502400">became a support studio under Blizzard Entertainment</a>.</p><p>"I mean that was the plan, you know, even up until the release date of this [THPS1+2] we were going 3 and 4, and then Vicarious got kind of absorbed, and then they were looking for other developers, and then it was over," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-pro-skater-3-4-was-in-development-before-activision-pulled-the-plug-on-it/1100-6504774/" data-ref-id="1100-6504774">Hawk said at the time</a>.</p><p>While it remains to be seen what Activision has planned for the 25th anniversary of the franchise, EA is also bouncing back into the skateboarding genre with a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-everything-we-know-about-the-skate-reboot/1100-6505591/" data-ref-id="1100-6505591">Skate</a> game.</p><p>The last big development update for the game was a brief sketch headlined by I Think You Should Leave star and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tim-robinson-basically-did-an-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-to-reveal-skates-story/1100-6524066/" data-ref-id="1100-6524066">skateboard enthusiast Tim Robinson</a>, and developer Full Circle recently showed off an overhauled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-dev-explains-new-flick-it-system-and-its-ever-changing-city/1100-6524008/" data-ref-id="1100-6524008">Flick-it gameplay system</a>, a new approach to soundtracks, and lots of customization options for the in-development live-service game.</p>

            <p>Flappy Bird, the infuriating mobile game, is set to make a return later this year.</p>
<p>The game grew to tremendous popularity with over 100 million people playing it, but in 2014 original developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Dong Nguyen removed the game from sale</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>A decade later and Flappy Bird will return this autumn, followed by dedicated mobile apps coming to iOS and Android next year, as well as other platforms.</p>

<p>The game's return is thanks to the Flappy Bird Foundation, a team of fans "committed to sharing the game with the world". Together with affiliates, the team has acquired the official rights from Gametech Holdings as well as the rights to Piou Piou vs Cactus - a mobile game long credited as the inspiration behind Flappy Bird.</p>
<p>The new version will include new game modes, characters, and even multiplayer challenges.</p>
<p>"It's been a decade-long, convoluted journey to get here, but we're so excited to finally begin sharing Flappy Bird once again with the world," said a spokesperson for the Flappy Bird Foundation.</p>
<p>Michael Roberts, the chief creative behind Flappy Bird’s return, added: "We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!"</p>

<p>The developer of Piou Piou, Kek, added: "Today is a milestone not just in gaming but for me personally. It's so cool to see how influential Piou Piou has been for developers and hundreds of millions of gamers over the years. It's incredible to work alongside such a dedicated team of fans and creators who are truly passionate about changing the industry narrative and together bringing the original Flappy Bird back to life."</p>
<p>So <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-the-creator-of-flappy-bird-pulled-the-game-from-sale">why did Nguyen pull the game from sale</a>? "Flappy Bird was designed to play in a few minutes when you are relaxed," he said at the time. "But it happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem. To solve that problem, it's best to take down Flappy Bird. It's gone forever."</p>
<p>Flappy Bird was a viral sensation on release, but its return is certainly a surprise.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft will lay off about 650 people from its gaming division, largely in "corporate and support functions," according to an email from Xbox head Phil Spencer sent to staff today. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File</a> reports that most of the cuts will impact people at Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Spencer called the cuts "part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business" according to his note, published by Game File and other outlets. That acquisition was also cited when Microsoft laid off <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,900 gaming employees</a> back in January, which <em>also</em> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-activision-blizzard-layoffs-survival-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largely affected Activision Blizzard</a>. Both these cuts come following Microsoft's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly $69 billion</a> purchase of Activision Blizzard in October, and as Activision Blizzard continues to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-and-diablo-boost-microsofts-gaming-revenues-but-xbox-sales-continue-to-fall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bolster</a> Microsoft's gaming revenue.</p><p>Spencer wrote that "No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today." This mention is apparently necessary given Microsoft's closure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four Bethesda studios back in May</a>. At that time, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a> reported that there would be more Xbox cuts to come.</p><p>"Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days," wrote Spencer, who is probably having a "challenging" day but is not losing his job, despite the fact that he's laid off <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2,550 people</a> since the acquisition. </p><p>Following this year's layoffs and closures, Microsoft has seen an increase in unionization, with workers at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda Game Studios</a>, on <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft, </a></em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and in Blizzard QA</a><em><a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a></em>unionizing with the Communications Workers of America. While Microsoft signed a labor neutrality agreement with the CWA in 2022, workers at Raven Software <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/microsoft-and-activision-blizzard-accused-of-bad-faith-bargaining-by-raven-software-union-workers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board</a> last month, accusing the company of bad faith bargaining. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-lets-you-unleash-gaseous-destruction.978957/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-chemical-agents-warbond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Arrowhead have revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond for next week, and if you've ever wished you could spray the Terminid hordes with lethal gas, then this one's for you.</p>
<p>Unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond">Warbonds</a>, The Chemical Agents doesn't contain any new primary or secondary weapons. Rather, it offers two new Stratagems, one of which is a weapon, while the other is a new drone to help you clear out the hordes more effectively.</p>
<p>First up, the TX-41 Sterilizer is a new Stratagem weapon that you can use to spray your enemies with chemical gas. Drop this one if you think you're going to be facing off against innumerable swarms of bugs or bots.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=_ovD5qKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-the-chemical-agents-warbond-tx-41-sterilizer.jpg?itok=6jOtdltB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s The Chemical Agents Warbond does exactly what it says on the tin.</figcaption></figure><p>Your second new weapon of choice is the AX/TX-13 "Guard Dog" Dog Breath, a drone rover that uses a corrosive gas sprayer weapon to deal damage. Between that and the Sterilizer, you'll be unstoppable.</p>
<p>If, however, some of the Terminids should happen to break through your gaseous assault, you can use the new G-4 Gas Grenade to seal the deal. Why not go all gas, all the time with your next loadout?</p>
<p>Two new armor sets are also being released: the lightweight AF-50 Noxious Ranger and the medium AF-02 Haz-Master, both of which come with passives that help you resist the gas clouds you'll be spewing.</p>
<p>You'll also find new emotes, new patterns for your vehicles, and more in this Warbond, so get stuck in if you're thinking it's time for a change of strategy (or a change of aesthetic!).</p>

<p>News of the new Warbond arrives after&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339866697736692015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pledged sweeping changes for the game</a> last month, including big balance changes, reworked primary weapons and combat, and improved performance, plus more.</p>
<p>Last week, the studio <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed it was hard at work</a> on this initiative, further promising to rework Armor Penetration and Anti-Tank weaponry, as well as "more effective" Autocannons and Heavy Machine Guns.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see how these efforts pan out. For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its new The Chemical Agents Warbond launches on September 19th.</p>

Thankfully, however, while it’s ultimately uneven and lacking the inventiveness or visual splendor it would have needed to be truly great, <em>T1 </em>manages to have more smarts and depth than it first lets on. It could serve as a setup for better films to follow, now that all the “origin story” table setting is out of the way.<br></p><p>And make no mistake, this is an origin story top to bottom, and we know how it’s going to end even before it starts. Chris Hemsworth’s character may be called Orion Pax by everyone around him, but we know from the moment we first see him, already sporting that iconic blue and red, that he will be Optimus Prime before all is said and done. This is a movie that, you might say, exists in the context of all that came before it, so your own investment in <em>Transformers </em>will inevitably color your experience. For my part, I was already of moviegoing age when that 1986 cartoon hit theaters, and if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/james-earl-jones-dies-dead-rip-darth-vader-93-lion-king-1851644027">the late, great James Earl Jones’</a></span> incredible performance as Darth Vader defined malice and evil for me as a child, Peter Cullen’s work as Optimus Prime defined goodness and virtue just as much. In his acting, he conveyed so much: warmth, compassion, decency, thoughtfulness, a concern with the greater good, a reluctant willingness to sacrifice if that’s what was necessary to do what was right.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-recommend-id="image://e0772e03aa0b5a29f9773e7b9ce50c73" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax watches a holographic archive intently in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When we first meet Orion Pax as he recklessly sneaks into a facility where classified archives are kept, in the hopes of learning something he can use to help end the shortage of precious energon plaguing the robots of Cybertron, it’s hard to imagine him growing into the measured, thoughtful leader we know him to be. He wants to make the world better, sure, but he’s also a bit of a goofball, a bit impulsive. To Hemsworth’s credit, however, he finds a path with his voice performance that reflects how the experiences Orion endures over the course of the film change him. And the screenplay smartly takes him through such galvanizing, radicalizing experiences that we believe he would be forever changed.<br></p><p>The origin story ultimately works because it all feels deeply personal for Orion, and it feels personal because of the relationship at its center. Orion’s best friend is his fellow mining bot D-16, voiced by Brian Tyree Henry, one of the most exciting actors working today. And as surely as we know that Orion will be Optimus before the credits roll, we know that D-16, at first his fast friend, will become his eternal nemesis, Megatron. Together, the two of them—along with Elita and Keegan-Michael Key’s B-127 (who someday will be Bumblebee but for now prefers to refer to himself as Badassatron)—go on a journey, discovering truths that will shake Cybertronian society to its core. It helps that some of those truths come from the wonderful voice of Laurence Fishburne, a welcome presence as a robot named Alpha Trion. In one moment, as he’s illuminating long-lost realities of Cybertron’s past, he suggests that the true meaning of “Transformer” may have less to do with being able to change one’s shape and more with being able to change the world. That’s a pretty cool idea.</p><figure id="" data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-recommend-id="image://32d62f8747ee0d47fdbf78c7d5981c00" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Orion Pax offers D-16 a friendly fistbump in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But how do we go about trying to create that change? How do we react when we learn difficult truths, when we learn that the things we believed in were a lie? It’s natural, sometimes even good, to be angry. Anger can fuel us in our desire to fight for something better. But it can also consume us. The most fascinating thing about the plot of <em>Transformers One </em>isn’t the deep, dark secrets that Orion and his friends discover. It’s the way that Orion learns what kind of leader he wants to be by watching what D-16’s anger over those discoveries does to him, and deciding what kind of leader he <em>doesn’t </em>want to be.</p><p>It’s heartbreaking and a little horrifying seeing how D-16 is changed by the truths he learns and the injustices he discovers. He’s all the more compelling as a villain because we understand why he’s so outraged, and we feel the pain Orion feels in watching his friend lose his way. Near the end of the film, his simmering rage leads him to commit a shocking act of public brutality against another robot, and it’s tragic to see him become a demagogue who uses the rhetoric of dominance and violence to appeal to the basest impulses of those who end up following him–those who become the Decepticons. While Optimus becomes something like a labor organizer, using solidarity to encourage oppressed robots to toss off their chains and arguing that “freedom and autonomy are the rights of all sentient beings,” Steve Buscemi’s Starscream expresses the opposing ideology like this: “The idea of a unified Cybertron is a myth. The only thing that matters is the strength of one bot to dominate all.” It’s an idea that many find seductive at times, but it offers nothing but rot. (I feel like there’s something relevant in this kids’ cartoon to current events but I can’t quite put my finger on it.)</p><figure id="" data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-recommend-id="image://28ed9597ce00afc3aa09e4c4b56d615a" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Megatron threatens another robot with his massive arm cannon in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Anyway, the film’s climax is strong, a showdown which crystallizes the identities of these two friends-turned-adversaries and left me eager to see more of them, now that they are the Optimus Prime and Megatron we’ve known for so long. (It even, to my delight, nods to Optimus’ long history as a kind of Christ figure.) But that’s not quite enough to make <em>Transformers One </em>a great film in its own right. For most of its runtime it’s passably enjoyable, but sorely lacking the kind of ingenuity a film like this needs to establish itself as more than just another piece of corporate entertainment. There are no sequences here on par with the awe-inspiring action of the <em>Spider-Verse </em>films, for instance, nor any imagery as memorable as the unforgettable planet-sized robot Unicron from the 1986 <em>Transformers </em>movie.<br></p><p>I saw the film in 3D, which definitely enhances the film’s visuals, giving the central setting of Iacon City a wonderfully layered depth, but <em>Transformers One </em>never figures out how to make the most of its vistas in its action scenes, which often feel like arbitrary diversions from the story rather than involving sequences that contribute to the film or our understanding of the characters in a meaningful way. An early racing scene, for instance, just kind of happens, offering lots of sensory diversion with plenty of robots zooming really fast, but it’s hard to feel invested in it because it’s not shot in a particularly exciting way and Orion and D-16 just kind of fumble their way through it. It’s not until that final showdown, when the characters are each fighting desperately for what they believe in and the stakes feel truly high, that the action really starts to land. In this emotionally heightened context, a callback (or, I guess, call forward, since this is a prequel) to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlZYeRKy08" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a famous line from another <em>Transformers </em>movie</a></span> feels not like the clunky reference-dropping that <em>Transformers One </em>indulges in a bit too often, but like a real, defining moment in the relationship between these two, and man, it hurts.</p><figure id="" data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Hasbro</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-recommend-id="image://31683c65f39c5d15c4c62d41185be9c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="2875" data-height="1617" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Optimus Prime is seen with a glowing core in the center of his chest in a moment from Transformers One." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like a number of origin stories, <em>Transformers One </em>has the problem of ending right when it feels like things are really getting underway. Now that the dynamic is established and we understand that Optimus Prime and Megatron are two leaders with fundamentally different ideologies and approaches to the idea of making things better for those who’ve been wronged, I can see stronger films following in its wake, direct sequels that continue the story on Cybertron long before the robots make their way to Earth. And if and when those films come, <em>Transformers One </em>may feel more vital and necessary in retrospect, the setup we had to get through so that those films could dig deeper into the versions of these characters that are established here. But for now, at least, <em>Transformers One </em>is good but not great, a film with an involving relationship arc at its core that spends too much time taking jabs at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoBots&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GoBots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rival toy GoBots</a></span> and explaining <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/HherR2qUwI0?si=qmoDKETtzcuoYYU0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/HherR2qUwI0?si=qmoDKETtzcuoYYU0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why Starscream’s voice has always been so annoying</a></span>, rather than giving us great action sequences or truly inventive visuals.

            <p>Hoyoverse has confirmed Xbox players will not need to purchase a Game Pass subscription in order to access <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s online multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>The confusion began soon after Hoyoverse announced Genshin Impact would be making its way to Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass. Initially, the game's <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/genshin-impact/9N7TFFRRZCC9/0010">Xbox store page listing</a> stated: "Online multiplayer on console requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Xbox Game Pass Core (sold separately)."</p>
<p>Those on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-will-seemingly-require-a-subscription-to-game-pass-to-play-multiplayer-online-update-hoyoverse-confirm-that-it-wont-need-any-subs.970548/">ResetEra</a> pointed out this is a different approach to other free-to-play games on the platform, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>

<p>Now, Hoyoverse has removed the wording from Xbox's store page. "Genshin Impact is a free-to-play game. You do not need to purchase Game Pass Ultimate or Core to play the game in Co-Op Mode,"  Hoyoverse shared in a statement with Eurogamer.</p>
<p>"Players with a Game Pass Ultimate subscription can receive in-game bundles upon the game's launch and after subsequent version updates, as well as play Genshin Impact on Xbox Cloud Gaming."</p>
<p>Genshin Impact is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/genshin-impact-gets-xbox-release-date-but-still-no-word-on-switch">make its debut on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass later this year</a>, on 20th November.</p>
<p>Genshin Impact was previously released across PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, iOS, and Android. Despite being announced for Nintendo Switch, we are still to hear any more on that elusive release date - it was first revealed back in January 2020. Another one being held back for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>, perhaps?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-pc-specs-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>PC specs you're going to need to play the game on your machine ahead of its October 4th release, and it looks like a fairly broad range of specs will be supported.</p>
<p>As with many of Sony's other PC releases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-pc-specs"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-system-requirements"><em>God of War Ragnarok</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-system-requirements"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, the PC version of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>will feature advanced customization compared to the console version, so you'll be able to tweak it to your heart's content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=yRZ42DvH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-pc-specs-screens.jpg?itok=66YYU3YR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>should be a pretty nice-looking game on PC, if you've got the hardware for it.</figcaption></figure><p>All of&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>'s presets will require either Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they'll also require 70GB of free space on an SSD, although Sony's High and Ultra presets require an NVMe SSD for best results.</p>
<p>Here are the specs you'll need to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>across its several presets!</p>
<h3>Minimum (720p, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K or AMD Ryzen 5 1500X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 or AMD Radeon RX 470</li>
<li>8GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended (1080p, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>High (1440p, 60fps or 4K, 30fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i5 8600 or AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 or AMD Radeon RX 6800XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra (4K, 60fps)</h3>
<ul><li>CPU: Intel Core i7 11700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
<li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 Ti or AMD Radeon RX 6900XT</li>
<li>16GB RAM</li>
</ul><p>As you can see, if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on a lower-spec PC, you should be able to do so, although you're going to be making some sacrifices in terms of graphical fidelity and frame rate.</p>

<p>As a reminder, this is a remake of the original 2015&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>rather than a PC port of that game. It's landing on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> simultaneously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">on October 4th</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>
Not enough Microsoft jobs have been splayed and flayed atop the Altar of Growth, so High Priest Spencer must once again perform the Rite of Strategic Repositioning. According to a leaked memo, Microsoft are laying off around 650 people "to organize our business for long term success". This is the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">parted with around 1900 employees in January</a>, and the same Microsoft that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsofts-mass-layoffs-will-affect-starfield-halo-infinite-and-gears-of-war-developers">washed their hands of around 10,000 staff in January 2023</a>, all in the name of shoring up the business for future prosperity. That "long term success" is certainly taking its sweet time. Or at least, it is if you're one of the poor saps in the trenches of, in this case, "corporate and supporting functions".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As with the previous round of cuts, this latest bout of belt-tightening is the result of Microsoft needing to recover some of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">that money they spent inhaling Activision-Blizzard in 2023</a> - a $69 billion deal that has necessitated the departure of about 2,550 staff to date.
</p>
<p>
"For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work," Xbox chief Phil Spencer explained to Microsoft employees in an internal memo, sent this week and obtained by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>. "As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming - mostly corporate and supporting functions - to organize our business for long term success." US people let go will be supported "with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition" while the layoff terms will vary outside the US according to location.
</p>
<p>
"With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs," the memo continues. "Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games." Spencer doesn't specify which games have been "impacted", but he does add that "no games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today." 
</p>
<p>
The Acti-Blizz merger appears to have done reasonably well for Microsoft as a whole. According to the company's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">most recent quarterly results</a>, gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, albeit with "48 points of net impact" from the acquisition. I don't quite understand what a "point of net impact" is, and I'm not convinced anybody else reporting on this story does either. But the upshot is that Microsoft executives continue to feel the need to trim the books. Back in May, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-shutting-down-the-studios-that-made-redfall-and-hi-fi-rush">announced the closures</a> of Prey developers Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developers Tango Gameworks, though Tango and Hi-Fi Rush were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pubg-owner-krafton-have-acquired-tango-gameworks-and-the-hi-fi-rush-ip">rescued by Krafton</a> in an 11th hour deal.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">one unofficial tracker</a>, there have been over 11,000 games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a> in 2024 so far. If you're one of the people affected by this week's reductions, best of luck with it all.

Episode five is one of the more potent examples of the prequel series setting the stage for events that take place in both <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, weaving together plot threads that felt like they were blowing in the breeze for the last few weeks. <strong>Spoilers to follow!</strong><br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Episode five begins with dwarf king Durin using the ring bestowed upon him by the elves to find where to dig in order to restore the sun shafts to Khazad-dûm, which collapsed a few episodes back, threatening the city’s livelihood. He doggedly insists that the dwarves dig into a foundational wall, which immediately gives way to a massive ray of sunlight, justifying what his own son believed to be an act of folly. As the episode progresses, it becomes more and more clear that the ring is negatively affecting Durin, causing him to become angrier and more paranoid, and to enact a city-wide tax called, simply, the Ring Tax. His son, concerned with how much his father has changed, heads to Eregion to ask Celebrimbor what the hell kinda demon shit he put into this ring, but not before we see how Durin’s doggedness will lead to Khazad-dûm’s, well, doom. </p><p>You see, years ago, Durin set restrictions on how far down the dwarves could dig for a variety of structural and logical reasons. But thanks to the ring’s dark urges, he wants to ignore those restrictions and dig deeper into the mountain’s rock. Any self-respecting <em>Lord of the Rings</em> fan knows what happens soon after, and the episode gifts us with ominous growls just in case you forgot: The dwarves will soon awaken a Balrog that will destroy the kingdom of Khazad-dûm, also known as Moria. The same Balrog that the Fellowship of the Ring encounters when cutting through those mines to get to Mordor. </p><p>In another bit of foreshadowing, soon after Durin demands the dwarves dig wherever he says, we see the elves putting the finishing touches on a magical door that will be installed at one of the entryways to Khazad-dûm. Known as “Durin’s Door,” it can only be visible in the light of the moon, and can only be opened with a password told “to friends.” These are the very same glowing doors that the Fellowship struggles to get past in the first <em>Lord of the Rings</em>—though they eventually open after Frodo (or, in the books, Gandalf) figures out the password. </p><p>Along with the imminent demise of the dwarves of Khazad-dûm, episode 5 also lays out a path for the fall of Middle-earth’s men to the allure of Sauron’s rings. Still disguised as an elf, Sauron convinces Celebrimbor (after much deception and gaslighting) to create nine more rings for men, despite the latter’s concerns about the quality of their character. We know that men will not be able to resist the dark allure of the rings (Isildur fell victim to their power, and Boromir nearly did as well), and as the episode flits back and forth between the elves, dwarves, and humans of Númenor, we see why—many Numenorians, still reeling from the recent coup against Queen Miriel, are being persecuted by the new king’s men, who are callous and careless of the people’s religious beliefs. A surprise death hammers a message home: Men are capable of great cruelty, but so are dwarves, and so are elves, despite their holier-than-thou stance. <em>The Rings of Power</em> finally feels like it’s crafting a cogent tale of how Middle-earth came to be so broken. </p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season two episode six airs September 19 on Amazon Prime. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The remaining 96 titles belong to the EA Play library, which is not included in Xbox Game Pass Standard.

In his memo, below, Spencer makes it clear that the cuts are related to the acquisition.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/spencer-1724249575303-1726137427625.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox boss Phil Spencer speaking at gamescom 2024. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Phil Spencer’s email to staff is reproduced in full below:</p><blockquote>For the past year, our goal has been to minimize disruption while welcoming new teams and enabling them to do their best work. As part of aligning our post-acquisition team structure and managing our business, we have made the decision to eliminate approximately 650 roles across Microsoft Gaming — mostly corporate and supporting functions — to organize our business for long term success.</blockquote><blockquote>I know that this is difficult news to hear.  We are deeply grateful for the contributions of our colleagues who are learning they are impacted. In the U.S., we’re supporting them with exit packages that include severance, extended healthcare, and outplacement services to help with their transition; outside the U.S. packages will differ according to location.</blockquote><blockquote>With these changes, our corporate and supporting teams and resources are aligned for sustainable future growth, and can better support our studio teams and business units with programs and resources that can scale to meet their needs. Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games. No games, devices or experiences are being cancelled and no studios are being closed as part of these adjustments today.</blockquote><blockquote>Throughout our team’s history, we have had great moments, and we have had challenging ones. Today is one of the challenging days. I know that going through more changes like this is hard, but even in the most trying times, this team has been able to come together and show one another care and kindness as we work to continue delivering for our players. We appreciate your support as we navigate these changes and we thank you for your compassion and respect for each other.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><p>These cuts follow the already eye-watering <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 layoffs Microsoft made to its gaming business</a> earlier this year, and continue the video game industry's torrid time of late. Microsoft closed Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin as part of those cuts. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">Speaking to IGN in June</a>, Spencer said: "I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>While Spencer has insisted Microsoft's video game franchise "are getting stronger", and Xbox console players "are as high this year as they’ve ever been,” the gaming business is now bringing a number of its games to rival platforms, including PlayStation 5.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales">Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to the company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up). Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue faired better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5">Spencer said that Xbox’s multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one. It is heavily rumored to be preparing an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">Xbox handheld</a> for release, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-moving-full-speed-ahead-on-next-gen-console">has announced plans to release next-gen Xbox consoles</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> launches on PC and Xbox this December, with a PS5 release set to follow soon after.</p><p><em>Image credit: Microsoft.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

        <p>Aside from adaptive charging for your controllers, all PlayStation 5 system update features mentioned in this blog post are available for all PlayStation 5 models. Let’s take a deeper look at what’s included in this update:</p><p><strong>■ Newly Announced Features</strong></p><p><strong>Welcome Hub</strong> (phased release)</p><p>We are introducing a new personalized space in your PlayStation 5 home screen called Welcome hub—a dedicated space you can customize with widgets, allowing you to see information at a glance before you begin your gaming sessions. For players in the U.S, Welcome hub will replace the current Explore tab with enhanced customizability and an upgraded user experience.</p><p><iframe title="PS5 Welcome Hub" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLUvxgY2wd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>You can easily customize your Welcome hub by selecting from a variety of widgets, including console storage, battery levels for accessories, online friends, trophies, and many more.

You can change the size of your widgets, expanding or shrinking them to give more focus to the features that are most important to you.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PlayStation%205-Update_09-12-24_001.jpg"></a></figure><p>In addition, you can also change your Welcome hub’s background. Choose from a range of designs, including some with cool animated effects, or pick out a screenshot from your own Media Gallery for a truly personal touch.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Welcome hub will become available to select users in the U.S. starting later today.

Recipients can open the link on their mobile device and seamlessly join the party on their PlayStation 5 or from PlayStation App.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>In the coming weeks, we will also release an update for PlayStation App which will allow you to similarly generate a shareable party link from your mobile device.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>PlayStation 5 Beta Features Rolling Out Globally Today</strong></p><p>Here’s a closer look at some of the PlayStation 5 beta features that are rolling out globally today, including personalized 3D audio profiles for headphones and earbuds, the ability to enable Remote Play access for individual users, and adaptive charging for your controllers.</p><p><strong>Personalized 3D Audio Profiles for Headphones and Earbuds</strong></p><p>In this generation, 3D audio is one of the key ways that creators have enhanced the immersive quality of games. As individuals, we all hear sounds differently based on the size and shape of our head, ears, and ear canals.</p><p>We’re pleased to introduce a feature that lets your PlayStation 5 console create a personalized 3D audio profile just for you. With a set of headphones or earbuds, you can run through a set of sound quality tests to analyze a vast number of factors to create an audio profile that best fits your hearing characteristics. For example, your personalized 3D audio profile may enable you to better sense the positions of characters and objects in a game world more clearly than before, making the experience more immersive.</p><p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PS5 UI | Personalised 3D Audio Profile setup" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QhZzPyc-Zas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To create a personalized 3D audio profile for your headphones or earbuds, go to [Settings] &gt; [Sound] &gt; [3D Audio (Headphones)] on your PlayStation 5 console, and follow the steps displayed on the screen. Your audio profile will be saved on your PlayStation 5 per user, and you can also still select from 3D audio presets like before.</p><p>This feature builds on the 3D audio enhancements we’ve introduced to PlayStation 5 since launch, including 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers and support for compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled audio devices. These features give you additional options to immerse yourself more deeply in the rich variety of soundscapes in PlayStation 5 games, powered by Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p><p><strong>Enable Remote Play for Individual Users</strong></p><p>You can now adjust Remote Play settings per user and choose who is allowed to connect to your PlayStation 5 console using Remote Play. So, if your friends or family members come over and sign in to your PlayStation 5 console with their account for PlayStation Network, you can easily modify who can continue to access your PlayStation 5 console using Remote Play when they leave.</p><p>To adjust these settings, go to [Settings] &gt; [System] &gt; [Remote Play] &gt; [Enable Remote Play], and choose which user you want to enable access to your PlayStation 5 console through Remote Play.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/PS5-Update_09-12-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Adaptive Charging for Your Controller</strong> (for the slimmer PlayStation 5 model and PlayStation 5 Pro)</p><p>Adaptive charging for the DualSense wireless controller, DualSense Edge wireless controller, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [201 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a> Sense controllers, and Access controller is now available for the slimmer PlayStation 5 model, when the console is in rest mode (and will also be available for PlayStation 5 Pro when it launches).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony is rolling out a new PS5 system software update that adds a "new personalized space" to the console's UI in the form of the Welcome Hub, plus more besides.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub replaces the Explore tab, which was previously exclusive to US PlayStation users. Sony says it's rolling out "globally over the next few weeks", and select players in the US will get the new hub today.</p>
<p>The Welcome Hub lets you customize your home screen with widgets including accessory battery levels, trophies, and online friends, plus "many more". It comes with a range of presets you can use to quickly switch your widget layout, and you can arrange and resize widgets, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=iOTcJgmC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-system-software-update-welcome-hub.jpg?itok=TVCa62KY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new PS5 update brings with it a brand new Welcome Hub that's packed with widgets.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've been hankering for a return to the old days of PS4 wallpaper, you'll be pleased to know you can also change your Welcome Screen's background, and you can even use one of your own screenshots if you want.</p>
<p>According to Sony, US players will get the Welcome Hub update first, followed by Japanese players, then European gamers, and finally everyone else around the world. Hold tight, it's coming!</p>
<p>It's not just the Welcome Hub, though. The new Party Share feature is also getting a phased release with this update, and it'll let you send PS5 party chat links via any social media or messaging app thanks to the magic of QR codes.</p>
<p>Other new features rolling out as part of this PS5 update include personalized headphone and earbud 3D audio profiles, Remote Play settings for individual users, and adaptive controller charging (although only for selected models).</p>

<p>News of this update comes just a couple of days after Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">announced</a> the PS5 Pro, a mid-generation refresh console that features improved technical performance and increased storage capacity.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro is one of two PS5 models that can take advantage of adaptive controller charging, alongside the Slim models that were introduced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-slim-officially-announced-coming-this-holiday-season">towards the end of last year</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out a full breakdown of everything that's coming with the new PS5 system software update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/12/ps5-system-update-adds-welcome-hub-party-share-personalized-3d-audio-profiles-adaptive-controller-charging-and-more/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>. Elements of the update roll out today, and a phased global rollout will take place over the next few weeks. Stay tuned for more.</p>
