            <p>Sellers of revamped retro PC games and also newer PC games GOG have been accused of using AI-generated artwork to promote their store's new year sale. Meanwhile, a job listing the Polish company have recently posted for a senior software engineer to work on their desktop app <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gog-galaxy">GOG Galaxy</a> lists among the role's responsibilities that they must "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Delving into the alleged use of AI art first, that was spotted by Reddit users and subsequently reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">GamingOnLinux</a>. The artwork in question appears to be the New Year Sale header which - as of writing - is <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/new-year-sale">still up on GOG's storefront</a>, and does feature some weird blurring towards the bottom of it.</p>
<p>Discussion of the artwork on the GOG forums has garnered <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/post69/?staff=yes">a response</a> from a user with the handle KosmicznaPluskwa, who appears to be a senior graphic designer on the GOG team. Declaring that they're "not a company spokesperson" and were only offering a personal opinion, they wrote: "To clear the air - current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work.</p>
<p>"This is all I can say on this," KosmicznaPluskwa continued. "My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be - it's possible to find job offers descriptions from less than a year ago and 5+ years ago to compare, if anyone is curious."</p><p>If you do go looking through GOG's job listings, you'll find a <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/work/senior-software-engineer-c-gog-galaxy">recently posted one</a> for a senior software engineer on GOG Galaxy. As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/hooray-linux-is-gogs-next-major-frontier-oh-no-it-wants-to-actively-use-and-promote-ai-assisted-development-tools/">Please Call Gamer</a>, the gig's requirements include "active use of AI tools in daily development workflows, and enthusiasm for helping the team increase adoption". Furthermore, the day-to-day reponsibilities section mentions a need to "actively use and promote AI-assisted development tools to increase team efficiency and code quality."</p>
<p>I've reached out to GOG for comment about both the artwork and the job listing.</p>
<p>All of this follows GOG changing ownership just before 2025 morphed into 2026, with Witcher developers CD Projekt opting to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">sell the storefront to original GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński</a> in a deal worth about £18.6 million. To this point, Kiciński's been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">making a lot of reassuring noises</a> about GOG's future direction and plans, conveying a desire to grow while sticking to the platform's established preservation and anti-DRM strengths. Needless to say that I don't recall any chatter about aiming to do a bunch of AI bollocks as part of that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airpods-pro-3-already-have-old-school-pricing-after-a-sudden-price-drop-2000663959</link>
            <guid>1419454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The holidays are a mere blip in our collective rearview mirror now, so why are <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Apple’s newest and arguably best AirPods still at their all-time low price of $199 at Amazon</a>? Don’t know, don’t care, don’t want to jinx it — we just want to get there before somebody looks at the calendar and removes this $50-off deal on the AirPods Pro 3 altogether.</p>
<p>The Pro 3 were one of the biggest audio tech drops of 2025. As hard as it is to believe, it’s been less than six months since they hit the market and sent waves of audiophiles scurrying to get some of the first pairs. Next-level active noise cancellation at twice the level of the AirPods Pro 2 is an awfully good start for a sales pitch, but Apple packed so many more upgrades and innovations into the AirPods Pro 3 that it’s worth revisiting them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better for Longer</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation is a notorious battery hog for wireless earbuds and headphones, yet somehow Apple doubled the level of ANC from the AirPods Pro 2 to the Pro 3 and still boosted the battery life to 8 hours of listening time with ANC and 10 hours without. The redesigned MagSafe charging case now has a built-in speaker that makes locating them with the Find My app far easier.</p>
<p>The earbuds themselves received a very subtle but very effective facelift. They’re more streamlined, and the redesign was aimed at a more secure fit in your ear. That’s huge if you’re planning on making the AirPods Pro 3 your go-to source of entertainment while you’re working out, running, or otherwise physically active. The new foam-infused ear tips now come in five sizes, including a new XXS version, which addresses the unpredictability of ear shapes and sizes. Workout and exercise fans will also appreciate the health-monitoring upgrades, including real-time heart-rate monitoring and calories burned count that you can see on your iPhone.</p>



<h2>Sound Investment</h2>
<p>It’s really about the sound, of course, and the AirPods Pro 3 are now packing spatial audio and updated, vastly improved bass. That’s on top of the potent active noise cancellation, so your entire listening experience is getting an upgrade from the Pro 3 earbuds. The hearing aid and hearing test features and live translation? More icing on a really tasty audio cake.</p>
<p>It’s not as if Apple or Amazon are needing to unload a lemon with this deal — the AirPods Pro 3 are very possibly Apple’s best-yet wireless earbuds, and the reviews have been nearly unanimously great. Don’t waste time pondering why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they’re still at a record-low $199 at Amazon a full month after the holidays</a> — just go buy yourself a pair.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has finally acknowledged the never-ending deluge of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed: Black Flag</a> remake leaks, after yet another slip-up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/looks-like-an-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-statue-just-leaked-via-vinted">collectible statue featuring the game's hero Edward Kenway bizarrely popped up for sale</a> on used clothing app Vinted. The item appeared to be the under-wraps tie-in teased last year by merchandise maker Pure Arts — and now, Ubisoft has effectively confirmed that this is the case. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on Twitter / X, Ubisoft used its official Assassin's Creed account to <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2016531108486095252%7Ctwgr%5Ee6e1977daeaec6ece2a62381c01171e2fdc43ba0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fah-s-here-we-go-again-ubisoft-acknowledges-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-leak-responds-with-gta-meme" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">respond</a> to the original post that shared photos of said statue, replying with the classic GTA San Andreas meme showing that game's protagonist Carl Johnson wearily stating: "Ah s***, here we go again." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/IRDhrgCPAp" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IRDhrgCPAp</a></p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 28, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The statue's appearance online follows a hint by collectible company <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-swirl-as-collectible-maker-admits-there-is-something-going-on">Pure Arts last year suggesting it had something in the works for Black Flag</a> which would surface in the not-too-distant future as "there is something going on." Its Vinted listing gave no clue to its origins, though stated that it was due for release in 2026. A detailed close-up of the statue's base shown in photos displayed logos for Ubisoft and Pure Arts, with a copyright mark registered for 2026. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this now out there, alongside everything else that has leaked about the game, it's perhaps unsurprising that Ubisoft has now given up pretending there's nothing going on. While clearly a humorous response, this also marks the first time Ubisoft has ever commented on anything to do with the Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake, despite a long, long string of reports and leaks surrounding its existance.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most notable confirmation of the project came from Edward Kenway's own voice actor, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-edward-kenway-actor-alleges-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-for-hinting-at-black-flag-remake">initially teased the project</a> before later suggesting he'd been told by Ubisoft in no uncertain terms to stop talking. Finally, last month, the game popped up on the PEGI European ratings board website revealing what looks to be its final title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-is-the-name-of-ubisofts-long-awaited-pirate-remake">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Ubisoft has only referred to the game's impending launch by acknowledging it had an unannounced game due to arrive before the end of its current financial year on March 31. Last week, however, this game was then delayed into the coming financial year (ending March 31, 2027) due to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-6-projects-including-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-closes-2-studios-and-confirms-further-layoffs-in-major-company-restructure">company's major recent reshuffle of teams, projects and studios</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

That includes some of the most popular items from a new Pokémon card set, such as the Elite Trainer Box, Booster Bundles, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The delayed booster set features a promo card with either Erika’s Tangela or Larry’s Komala, a metallic coin featuring the chosen Gym Leader, and two booster packs from the <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-product-showcase" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mega Evolution - Ascended Heroes expansion</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The only new booster set available in release week will be the Ascended Heroes Tech Sticker Collection, featuring Charmander and Ghastly as a foil promo card, plus a sheet of tech stickers featuring Mega Charizard Y and Mega Gengar, plus three Ascended Heroes boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's already been hard to come by Ascended Heroes preorders, and undoubtedly this delay won't make it any easier for fans after release day. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Ascended Heroes ETBs</a>, for example, are currently averaging around <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOjX3M?object_uuid=3e050d85-f909-4c14-bed0-d0f49191e04d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$115-120 on resale markets</a> - around a 135% markup from its MSRP of $49.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes' Booster Bundles are also looking a little steep right now, and sit at $79.10 market price. That's a fair lot more than its $26.94 list price, roughly a 194% markup, and almost triple the cost for what accounts for just six boosters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a similar story across the board, with fans likely to find it tough to find boosters from the new expansion outside of retailers like TCGplayer. That's also consistent with the follow up expansion for Mega Evolution, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-perfect-order-sealed-products-are-up-for-preorder-at-tcgplayer">Perfect Order</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ascended Heroes being hard to come by won't be surprising for most fans. The scarcity of the Mega Evolution series isn't exactly an outlier for Pokémon TCG, with stock issues, lack of common availibility, and delays plaguing the world's most popular trading card game for the past couple of years, at least, and stretches back through its Scarlet and Violet series as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson, Senior Commerce Editor, and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

</section></header><div><section>

<p>It's been a cracking start to the year for Nintendo-themed LEGO sets, and one of the builds we're the most excited about is the upcoming 'Final Battle' diorama, inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>'s grand finale.</p>
<p>The set itself launches on <strong>1st March 2026</strong> for <strong>£99.99 / $129.99</strong>, packing in three Minifigures for Link, Zelda and Ganondorf, plus a big 'mech' build for ol' boar-form Ganon. Naturally, there are a handful of little easter eggs sprinkled in for fans as well, like a tiny Navi that accompanies Link in his airborne pose, and a hidden Megaton Hammer in the ruins of Ganondorf's Castle.</p>
<p>Before it hits store shelves, however, LEGO reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino">Tiago Catarino</a> has gone hands-on with the set and provided a five-minute deep dive into its intricacies to give us our best look at it yet. The video provides a closer look at the stunning Zelda and Ganon Minifigs (the Link remains the same from the Deku Tree set), and the big Ganondorf build.</p>
<p>It also lets us get up close and personal with the diorama design itself, showcasing the castle backdrop without any of the characters in it, and the secret 'trapdoor' hatch from which Ganondorf can spring out for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather neat — and not as pricey as we'd expect, after seeing the Deku Tree and recently-revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/lego-pokemon-reveals-first-sets-launches-february-2026">Pokémon sets</a>. Gosh, we're going to have to clear some shelf space, aren't we?</p>

            <p>Comcept, the studio behind Mighty No.9, has shut down for good. This corporate dissolution was announced via Kanpo, the Japanese business newspaper-of-record earlier today.</p>
<p>The company, which was founded in 2010 by Mega Man lead  Keiji Inafune, was eventually merged into Level 5 Comcept in 2017.</p>
<p>Years later in 2024, Level 5 Comcept was taken over entirely by Level 5 following Inafune's departure from the company, becoming part of Level 5's Osaka office. This final destruction of the Comcept brand today marks a true death for the ill-fated studio.</p>

<p>Despite its illustrious pedigree, Comcept was best known for the poorly-received Mighty No.9, which was funded via Kickstarter in 2013. Upon release, critics and fans alike had issues with its gameplay, narrative, technical performance, and lack of content among other things. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mighty-no-9-review">You can read Eurogamer's review of Mighty No.9</a> for a blast from the past.</p><p>This news does spit on the foolish hopes of those still betting on receiving their Mighty No.9 3DS copies, for some reason. This was a Kickstarter stretch goal that was reached, but never actually produced despite over $4m in funding. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1ht1lk7/the_dream_is_dead_preorders_of_mighty_no_9_for/">Pre-orders for 3DS copies of Mighty No.9 were canceled last year</a> so the chances of actually receiving this were close to nil. If you were praying for a miracle though, put your hands down.</p>
<p>Comcept wasn't all bad. As part of Level 5 Comcept, the studio created Recore, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/recore-review">which received middling reviews too</a>. Ah well, rest in piece Comcept.</p>

            <p>Keeley Hawes - known for the likes of Spooks, Bodyguard, Line of Duty, Ashes to Ashes and many, <em>many </em>more - has been spotted on the set of Amazon's upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to her extensive film and television career, Hawes voiced Lara Croft for over a decade, with mainline entries Tomb Raider Legend, Anniversary and Underworld, as well as spin-offs Lara Croft: Guardian of the Light, Temple of Osiris and Reloaded, all featuring her crisp English accent and grunts of exertion.</p>

<p>Now, Hawes looks primed (pun intended) to star in Amazon's upcoming Tomb Raider series, with many speculating she will play Lara's mother, Lady Amelia Croft. While at the time of writing nothing has been officially announced by Amazon, if this does prove to be the case it would be a rather charming little Easter egg for series fans.</p>
<p>In Hawes' Tomb Raider Underworld, Lara is searching for her mother, who following a plane crash many years prior was supposedly sent to Helhiem, an afterlife location in Norse mythology. Having her now play Lara's mother would feel rather like a touching passing of the torch.</p>
<p>As for how her character looks in the show, British tabloid <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/38027622/keeley-hawes-amazon-prime-lara-croft/">The Sun</a> took a photo of Hawes on the Tomb Raider set, where she was being flanked by two figures in dark clothing and masks (see below).</p>

<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge - who along with Fleabag is also known for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, Killing Eve and Crashing - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-film-and-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-at-amazon">will serve as the show's creator</a>, writer, executive producer and co-showrunner.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Genre fusion</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Arc System Works' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/damon_and_baby">DAMON and BABY</a> didn't particularly grab our attention when it was teased back in the busy release schedule of last November, but the game's new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/damon-and-baby-switch/">eShop page</a> — and accompanying <strong>25th March</strong> launch date — encouraged us to take a closer look. And it's got to be said, there's some funky mechanical fusion going on in here.</p>
<p>DAMON and BABY is part action/adventure game, filled with puzzles and platforming, and part twin-stick shooter, filled with... well, twin-stick shooting. It's not a combination that we hear about all that often, so we respect how much this game appears to be flitting between the two.</p>
<p>Take the above trailer as an example. One second, we're looking at moving platforms and colour-changing wall tiles, the next, the dulcet tones of the narrator are running us through the weapon upgrade system and the huge arsenal that the titular demon king has at his disposal. Weird, right?</p>
<p>It gets weirder, fear not. The story follows said demon king, Damon, who forms an unlikely alliance with a human baby to break a curse that binds them together. Plot details are still pretty slim, but we <em>do</em> know that there's a local co-op option that lets P2 play as Damon's adorable little pooch — <em>win!</em></p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Arc System Works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>■A NEW TAKE ON SHOOTING ACTION AND IN-DEPTH EXPLORATION<br>
Experience a new type of action adventure, featuring a fusion between exploration within an expansive world and highly technical twin-stick shooting. At your home base, power up the demon king Damon and make purchases. During the exploration phase, defeat enemies to complete each area. The story progresses as you alternate between the two phases.</p>
<p>■STRATEGIC BATTLES WITH A VAST ARSENAL OF WEAPONS AND GIMMICKS<br>
The battle mechanics include both close-ranged attacks with handguns as well as long-ranged attacks with machine guns and more.<br>
You can find more powerful weapons as you explore.<br>
During the boss battles awaiting within each stage, a strategic approach making use of the area gimmicks will prove crucial.</p>
<p>■CUSTOMIZATION AND OUTFIT CHANGES<br>
Damon grows throughout the adventure, learning to master various weapons and skills. You can customize your set of skills to match your play style. You can even choose from a variety of outfit options to change Damon's appearance.</p>
<p>■JOURNEY TOGETHER WITH TWO PLAYER CO-OP<br>
Take control of Damon's canine companion to help him in combat in various ways, such as collecting items.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While the EU eShop listing is yet to materialise, the NA page suggests that we can expect to see this one towards the end of March with a <strong>$19.99</strong> price tag attached.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Leon Is a “Hot Uncle’ in Resident Evil Requiem Because of the Work of CAPCOM’s Female Developers]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/leon-hot-uncle-resident-evil-requiem-capcom-female-staff/</link>
            <guid>1419409</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The confirmation that <strong>Leon S. Kennedy</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/hes-really-here-leon-finally-confirmed-for-resident-evil-requiem-with-a-playstation-store-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was indeed a playable character in <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></a>, as promised by CAPCOM leaker Dusk Golem, was a soothing balm for series fans - especially after they saw what he looks like in the game.</p>



<p>Requiem takes place much further in the timeline. Thirty years have passed since the bombing of <strong>Raccoon City</strong>, when Leon was a rookie police officer who had a very bad first day at the local Police Department in <strong>Resident Evil 2</strong> (canonically set in 1998) and barely escaped with his life. He later appeared in <strong>Resident Evil 4</strong> (canonically set in 2004) as an elite agent reporting directly to the president of the United States, and in <strong>Resident Evil 6</strong> (which takes place in 2013, according to the official timeline), he's still providing security for the president. </p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set in 2028 in the game's canon. Leon is now 51, so he's much older than when we last saw him, and yet <strong>his 'hot uncle' appearance was very well received by fans</strong>. How did that come about, though?</p>



<p>Automaton recently <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">participated in a joint media interview with CAPCOM</a>, where Game Director <strong>Koshi Nakanishi</strong> revealed <strong>it had a lot to do with the female staff taking care of his design</strong>.</p>



<p><em>We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals. Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details, like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, the women developers at Capcom did a really good job (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone’s heart throb</em>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leon is officially a イケオジ" width="422" height="750" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYdN1DDYeeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Of course, the development team did not just focus on making him look good even at his age. They also had to come up with their own take on how his personality developed over the years; on that note, Nakanishi said <strong>every staff member had their own ideas on what Leon would and would not do in a given situation</strong>. Many discussions ensued, and eventually the developers agreed on how he should behave. </p>



<p>It won't take long before fans can judge this aspect, too. Resident Evil Requiem <strong>is out in less than a month</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/resident-evil-requiem-everything-we-know-about-the-new-game-in-capcoms-beloved-horror-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read our comprehensive info roundup here</a></strong>; if you need more Leon footage, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-new-leon-gameplay-ps5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check this story</a>.</p>

            <p>Bloober team has teased something mysterious on a brand-new website, leading the horror-enthusiasts on the internet scratching their heads.</p>
<p>The website, <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">which you can see yourself here</a>, doesn't contain much. It has a countdown to Valentines Day, a jumbled URL, a rose that bleeds when you hover your mouse cursor over it, an audio reading of the William Blake Poem 'The Sick Rose', and the following words: "Some things never leave the walls. They only learn to wait.”</p>
<p>This has spurred speculation in a variety of directions. First, following a common interpretation of William Blake poem and its commentary on the corruption of innocence and beauty. This, as well as Bloober's prior work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, has led some to believe this is a Silent Hill 1 Remake. The plot of that game, focusing on both Cheryl and the beauty of childbirth itself being corrupted / tarnished by the nasty Dahlia, could be applicable.</p>

</figure>
<p>Another theory is quite a simple one.<a href="https://x.com/BlooberTeam/status/2006515753176953244"> In a social media post</a> released by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> alongside this website, this phrase is written: "RemosdNeulSerorehsoOvamCeyerd". Taking the capital letters from that, you can spell the word Cronos, which some are taking as a hint that whatever will be announced in February will be a DLC for Bloober's latest game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>.</p><p>Alternatively, some have seen the rose and have immediately gone to Rule of Rose, the legendary and quite controversial horror game released back in 2006 was at the heart of a moral panic across Europe, and totally cancelled in the UK. Now, what governmental bodies assumed was an obscene experience was actually just a pretty okay horror game that has since grown to have a cult following.</p>
<p>Looking behind the curtain a bit, we know that Bloober Team is working on something dubbed "Project F" thanks to a business blog it posted last year. That's being created under the Broken Mirror Games brand, but aside from that we know sweet little about it. There's also Project M, also scheduled for a reveal some time this year.</p>
<p>So those are the three main theories: Silent Hill 1 Remake, Cronos DLC, and Rule of Rose Remake. It could, of course, be something totally different. Maybe a selection of spooky Valentines Day cards. Who knows. We'll have to wait until next month (or someone exceptionally smart) to learn the truth of it!</p>

            <p>Oop, beefy boy alert. I know that's a bit of a rude way to introduce <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a>'s freshly released Steam demo, but to be fair said demo is asking for about 70GB more of my precious drive space than the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3 and Dark Ties demo I grabbed last week. Well, at least progress made in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nioh">Nioh</a>'s not small demo will carry over to the full game when it comes out next week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Developers Koei Tecmo have confirmed as much a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3681010/view/498344415661655985?l=english">nice little post</a> introducing the demo, which you can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">here</a>, adding that it's comprised of "the opening stages of the game from the very beginning" and supports online multiplayer for up to three people. Completing it by February 15th will net you a Twin-Snake Helmet to rock in the full game, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3s-release-date-reportedly-leaks-via-amazon-japan-ahead-of-playstation-state-of-play">arrives on PC February 6th</a>.</p>
<p>Just to warn you, this Nioh 3 demo asked for 81.15GB of install space on my machine, so you might need to do some clearing out if your drives are fairly stuffed at the moment. For context, Steam tells me that the full version of not tiny RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> with Phantom Liberty is currently taking up around 85GB of my space. Though, beefy demos don't look to be uncommon for Koei, with the one you can grab to give <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wo-long-fallen-dynasty">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>'s complete edition a go demanding 46.94GB of space - significantly less than Nioh, but still a chunk bigger than the the 11.2GB Kiwami 3 demo I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Anyway, all of that beefy boy alerting aside, here are a couple of reviews you might fancy reading while you wait for the demo's many gigs to byte. First up is Adam Smith (RPS in peace) on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-review-pc">the original Nioh's Complete Edition</a>, and second is Ed Thorn (also RPS in peace) on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which he described as "a streamlined Nioh with an encouraging spirit". Bonus points if you also read Ed's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-big-pigs-are-the-best-kind-of-boss-fight">supporter post</a> extolling the virtues of battling BIG PIGs.</p>
<p>Now we wait to find out on February 6th just how many BIG PIGs Nioh 3's packing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/dispatch-out-nintendo-switch-2-but-nintendo-censored-it/</link>
            <guid>1419373</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The excellent adventure game <strong>Dispatch</strong> has just launched on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as we already knew from last month's Australian eShop listing</a>. However, users quickly noticed that the game featured a lot of censorship mandated by platform holder Nintendo.</p>



<p>Those who played the game know that, at a certain point, protagonist <strong>Robert Robertson III</strong> (played by <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> and also known as <strong>Mecha Man</strong>) helps fellow hero and potential love interest <strong>Blonde Blazer</strong> with fitting a dress when a rogue nipple slips out of it. Well, that's censored in these versions of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Blonde-Blazer-Censored-Nipple-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<p>That's far from the only occurrence. Nintendo even censored curse words, 'bleeping' them out, and <strong>there is no way for an adult gamer to override the censorship</strong>, which is very disappointing. Users have pointed out that Nintendo has hentai games on its eShop, and yet this game is being censored for no real reason. </p>



<p>In the launch press release, Dispatch developer <strong>Ad Hoc Studio</strong> only provided this statement:</p>



<p><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em></p>



<p>Dispatch <strong>is a fantastic game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dominated our Wccftech Awards '25 in the Best Adventure Game category</a></strong>, but if you own any other platform, we'd recommend playing it there instead to get the full experience.</p>



<p>If you do absolutely need to buy it on Nintendo platforms, though, know that there is a free upgrade from Switch 1 to Switch 2. The latter version features a substantial boost in visual clarity, as you'd expect, <strong>offering 1440P resolution and 60 frames per second</strong>, while the Switch 1 is <strong>locked at 720P resolution and 30 frames per second</strong>.</p>

<p>To kick off the new year, Arc System Works has announced it will be releasing a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/river_city_saga_three_kingdoms">River City Saga</a> game.</p>
<p>It's currently being referred to as <strong>River City Saga: Journey to the West</strong>, but the official English title hasn't been revealed just yet. It will be coming to the Switch and multiple other platforms at some point in 2026 and according to a rough translation is described as an "absurd and thrilling comedy action game".</p>
<p>Here's the rest of the PR description (via Gematsu), and above is the first official artwork for the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sun Wukong, Zhu Bajie, Sha Wujing, Sanzang!? All of the main cast are <em>Kunio</em>-style characters! This is an absurd and thrilling comedy action game where everyone sets out to reach India! Following <em>River City Saga: Three Kingdoms</em>, <em>River City Saga: Journey to the West</em> is a new title themed after the Chinese myth <em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>
<p>"In the turbulent era of the Tang dynasty, monsters run rampant, and there is no hope for salvation. Saddened by the state of the world, Sakyamuni seeks to save it through the teachings of Buddha. And so he establishes the “Journey to Obtain the Scriptures,” sending them on a journey to the far western land of India to retrieve the Buddhist scriptures. The skilled Sun Wukong becomes a disciple of Sanzang and, in order to atone for his past sins, sets out on the journey to obtain the scriptures while protecting his master. The cheerful and easily carried-away Zhu Bajie and the earnest monk Sha Wujing also join as disciples, and the Sanzang party continues its journey west once again. The road to India stretches 108,000 miles. What kind of journey awaits them now…?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The title is currently playable at the Taipei Game Show, and although gameplay hasn't been officially shared just yet, you can catch an incredibly brief glimpse via <a href="https://youtu.be/V8vonn3ShWc?t=611">a YouTube upload</a>.</p>

<p>It was officially dissolved earlier this month</p>

<figure data-uuid="1421921698a16"><a title="Mighty No. 9" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1421921698a16/mighty-no-9.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>The video game company Comcept, originally founded by Keiji Inafune in December 2010, has been "officially dissolved by a shareholders' resolution" earlier this month on 13th January 2026.</p>
<p>A notice was published about this today in Japan's government gazette Kanpo (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>If you're a tad confused based on previous reports and updates, Gematsu's creator and editor Sal Romano has provided a bit more context about what exactly has taken place here (<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/comcept-shuts-down.1419268/page-2#post-150647608">via ResetEra</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LEVEL-5 never actually acquired Comcept. Early reports of the LEVEL5 comcept establishment came from Japanese blogs reporting on it from Weekly Famitsu, and mentioned comcept becoming a subsidiary of LEVEL-5, but this was actually a misunderstanding.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132nmxsyg&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The official announcement later posted here --- <a href="https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">https://www.level5.co.jp/news/20170615_02/</a> --- only mentions that a new company called LEVEL5 comcept was established, and that it is a fully owned subsidiary of LEVEL-5. It still refers to Inafune is comcept's CEO, as well as a co-CEO of LEVEL5 comcept with Akihiro Hino. It even mentions that titles currently in development by comcept at the time would continue to be managed by comcept (and not LEVEL5 comcept).</p>
<p>It's mentioned in the article, but LEVEL5 comcept was already dissolved and taken over by the newer LEVEL-5 Osaka Office following Inafune's departure from LEVEL-5 in mid-2024. This is the studio that made FANTASY LIFE i.</p>
<p>However, comcept as a separate company still existed. Until now that is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Comcept made headlines over the years for its troubled release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mighty_no_9">Mighty No. 9</a>, which originally started life as a Kickstarter project. Before founding his studio and his eventual "departure from Level-5 in mid-2024", Inafune worked at Capcom on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamegear/mega_man">Mega Man</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/onimusha_2_samurais_destiny">Onimusha</a> and multiple other well-known video game series.</p>
<p>Apart from Mighty No. 9, the studio helped out with games such as <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/soul_sacrifice">Soul Sacrifice</a> and <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/recore">ReCore</a>. As for Level-5's Osaka office, it most recently worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fantasy_life_i_the_girl_who_steals_time">Fantasy Life i</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>.</p>

<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Here's how it holds up</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition</a> speeds onto the Switch 2 this week, and it just might be the best-looking game to date on Nintendo's new hybrid system.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/grid-legends-on-switch-2-an-excellent-racer-stacked-with-graphics-options">Digital Foundry has now taken a look</a>, and here's exactly what you can expect when it comes to the game's performance and resolution across the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The docked graphics mode runs between 1080p and 1440p at 30fps, and docked performance mode is 792p to 1080p and maintains a smooth 60fps.</p>
<p>As for the handheld experience, GRID Legends has four options on the Switch 2. This includes performance, battery saver, balanced and graphics modes. In graphics mode, the game runs between 792p and 1080p at 30fps, and in performance it's 684p to 828p at 60fps. The battery saver and balanced modes result in lower resolution and frame rates of 30fps and 40fps.</p>
<p>So, what's the best way to play? Here's Digital Foundry's recommendations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"For the docked experience, we're going to have to give the nod to the 30fps graphics mode simply because so much of the visual experience is stripped back to give you that 60fps alternative that the game loses a lot of its graphical appeal - and we have to wonder why the option for a 40fps balanced mode that traded some resolution for features didn't make its way into the shipping game. For mobile gaming, it's perhaps no surprise that we've opted for that 40fps alternative: resolution is OK, a 25ms per-frame refresh still looks good on the VRR panel and while you don't get volumetric lights, the return of screen-space reflections is worth it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">our review here on Nintendo Life</a>, PJ O'Reilly recommended the "smooth performance" option and was still blown away by how great it looked on the big screen. He was also impressed with the range of graphics options and just how "solid" they were across both the docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>If you want to find out even more details about the Switch 2 version's graphics, performance, added extras and how it compares to other platforms, check out Digital Foundry's video review above and its website for a more comprehensive breakdown.</p>

Players must utilize cooperation between the protagonist and his companions, as well as powerful special moves, to take on formidable foes.

Outside of swift movement, it can also be used to launch a surprise “raid attack” on enemies from above. Raid attacks make it easier to fight off enemies, allowing you to aim for a quick victory.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_030.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_031.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Warning Signal</strong></p><p>When an enemy is about to attack, a warning signal will shine. By swapping Genome Arms at the right moment in response to the signal, you can parry the enemy’s attack. This prevents damage and enables a strong “deflect counter” right after. There are also counters that can be used by successfully dodging at the right moment, and counters that allow you to blow back after being sent flying by the enemy’s attack. <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ter these various counters to respond to the enemy’s attack in any situation.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_033.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_034.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Editions</strong></p><p><strong>Standard Edition</strong> (8,580 yen on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,286 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,675 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,247 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>; 9,680 yen on <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [912 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li></ul><p><strong>Special Edition</strong> (17,380 yen on PlayStation 5 and Switch; 18,480 yen on Switch 2)</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Villion-Code_2026_01-28-26_044.jpg"></a></figure><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Visual art book</li><li>Digipack soundtrack CD</li><li>Wide-color-gamut art prints (x2)</li><li>Lottery ticket application card for an extra large (727mm x 606mm) canvas board (10 winners will be selected)</li></ul><p><strong>Digital Deluxe Edition</strong> (10,780 yen on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Switch; 11,880 yen on Switch 2)</p><ul><li>A copy of the game</li><li>Digital soundtrack</li><li>Digital visual book</li></ul></div><p><em>Villion: Code</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, and Switch on May 25 in Japan.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

<p>We weren't expecting this!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo released a major update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> this week, and in case you missed it, it adds health bars to the game.</p>
<p>This has come as a real surprise to Splatoon players, as up until now, the enemy's health in multiplayer was displayed through visual cues. As Nintendo notes, the remaining health of opponents will now be shown above their heads for "a few seconds" when they're visible. Certain abilities can also make this bar visible.</p>
<p>Here's Nintendo's official description about the implementation of health bars in multiplayer:</p>
<h2>Health bar</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"With version 11.0.0, it’s now possible to see an opponent’s remaining health when they’ve been hit. Previously, you could only see how damaged an enemy was by looking closely at how much ink they were covered in – not so easy to do in the heat of battle!</p>
<p>"Now, their remaining health will be shown in a bar above their head for a few seconds, provided they’ve not ducked behind cover or dived into their ink. Though if the opponent is visible via abilities such as Thermal Ink or has been marked by things like a Point Sensor or Wave Breaker you’ll be able to see it even then!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned by Nintendo, it's not always the easiest to see "how damaged an enemy" is in the heat of the battle, so this update will no doubt help, even if it arguably removes some of the uniqueness and charm of the team-based squid-shooter.</p>
<p>Nintendo also mentions how you can now also see the health bars of your teammates when they've taken damage, which may allow you to save them before they're wiped out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"You’ll also be able to see the health bars of your teammates if they’ve taken damage. Keeping an eye on these health bars is a great way to support your allies or chase down weakened foes – even if you’ve teamed up with Inklings and Octolings you’re not familiar with."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from these updates, Nintendo has also highlighted some other notable updates, including a new state known as "Flow Aura", updates to the game's hit detection, and stealth jump. You can find out more about all of this in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/splatoon-3-ver-11-0-0-update-launches-this-week-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">official patch notes</a>.</p>
