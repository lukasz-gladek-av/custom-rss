            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Among the finest action role-playing titles ever crafted, possibly even the finest, and a game that absolutely no RPG fan should miss."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote, from our 2009 review of the 1995 action-RPG, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/terranigma">Terranigma</a>, should give you <em>some</em> idea of just how highly we regard the third slice of what's known as the "Gaia Trilogy" — that's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/illusion_of_gaia">Illusion of Gaia</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/soul_blazer">Soul Blazer</a> and then this bad boy — all developed by Quintet.</p>
<p>Whilst some experiences, especially when it's been three decades since the game first released, tend to crumble and fade with time, Terranigma (and its predecessors) looks and plays as fantastically as ever. They're all-timers this lot, and Terranigma might just be the best of the three. Facts.</p>
<p>Quintet's third slice of Earth-resurrecting action sees players assume control of Ark, a young lad who, as things tend to go in action-RPGs of the anime/manga style, soon becomes embroiled in some very serious, world-altering business. As the very first human to leave his village to explore the "underworld" Ark is off on an absolute cracker of an adventure, one in which he must seek out and resurrect the continents of a long-lost surface world, in a narrative that serves up some real emotional gut punches.</p>

<p>Of all three games in the trilogy, Terranigma is the most emotional, unafraid to deal with death, loss, and our own mortality. The existentialism and philosophising gets you properly hooked into what's happening; the game also gives you loads of variety in its locations as you progress and, most importantly of all, the combat still holds up.</p>
<p>Ark is a surprisingly capable little scrapper who can easily go toe to toe with Link circa <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">A Link to the Past</a> (a game that's very similar in its combat overall). Our red-headed hero is perhaps a little more nimble than Link, and there's lots to explore in special attacks and different gear as you go. It's got all the good bits where they need to be.</p>
<p>It's also an adventure that continues to benefit greatly from the SNES's graphical style and fancy Mode-7 effects. This stuff just hit a real sweet spot in never looking old. Its style refuses to be diminished by the years passing, and it therefore sits with the likes of A Link To The Past, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, and the rest of the games in this trilogy, lest we forget, in belonging to a very special reserve of properly timeless Super Nintendo titles.</p>
<p>If you've never played it, you might want to sort that out, is what we're trying to say basically (easier said than done in the US, we know).</p>

<p>There's also the small matter of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9H29TkDkjM">a soundtrack</a> that gives Chrono Trigger (this writer's number one choice of SNES score) a very close run for its money. It really does sound that great, and it's a fitting backdrop for writing, characterisation and a sense of scale and adventure that's as good as anything you'll play on the 16-bit console.</p>
<p>It's mad, then, that Terranigma never released in the US, arriving in Japan this very day in 1995, and a year later to Europe and Australia. Therefore, loads have never played it. Even folks who've been around since back in the day. It's just one of those games that ended up being unavailable a lot of players whom we reckon, should they find the time to fit in a playthrough in the here and now, might just earn themselves a brand new SNES favourite.</p>
<p>As the conclusion of our 10/10 review back in 2009 puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There are honestly very few role-playing game experiences quite as enjoyable or engrossing as the one found in Terranigma. It does for action RPGs what games like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger did for the more traditional RPG market. And while it might not have the brand recognition of the aforementioned titles, it's one of those RPGs that once you play it, you'll never forget the experience. It's also the kind of game that will remind you why you love RPGs in the first place and one you'll find yourself coming back to time and time again."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well now. Excuse us as we head up into the loft to hook up the old Super Nintendo...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A good Bluetooth speaker is one of those things that everyone should just have. Whether you’re heading to the park with some friends and planning to listen to some music while you hang or are just at home folding laundry and catching up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, you’re gonna want a solid speaker. The JBL Clip 3 isn’t the latest model, but it still produces quality sound at an inexpensive price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/">Amazon has the Bluetooth speaker on sale right now so you can get one for 16% off</a>. It’s normally listed at $45, but for a limited time you can grab yours for just $38. That’s not too steep of a savings, but hey, $7 is still $7.</p>
<p>JBL has a built a name for itself in the world of portable Bluetooth speakers. With the JBL Clip 3, you can expect big sound from a small speaker that can clip onto your bag or belt. Yes, that’s where the name comes from. This ultra-compact speaker has a carabiner clip built into the side of it so you can hang it on your person or perhaps the back of your beach chair so it doesn’t have to sit in the sand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Great Sound Anywhere</h2>
<p>Take it to the beach or even poolside as the JBL Clip 3 is waterproof. No need to worry about a little splash, spill, or rain. Heck, the whole thing can even be fully immersed in water and come out fine. The exterior is made with a durable fabric material and a rugged rubber house to protect it, even if it gets dropped onto hard concrete.</p>
<p>Battery life is reliably long. It wouldn’t be that great of a portable speaker if it had to spend most of its time plugged into an outlet. Well, the rechargeable lithium ion battery can hold onto a full 10 hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>If you want to take a call form your phone, you can do so while connected to the Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 3 even has noise and echo-cancelling so when using it as a speaker phone, the folks on the other end will be able to hear you crystal clear.</p>
<p>JBL speakers come in a large assortment of colors and the JBL Clip 3 is no different. A couple are out of stock, but you can still pick between gray, blue, red, sand, white, yellow, green or even camo patterns in both black or green. All of which are currently on sale for the low price of just $38.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/has-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-when-does-the-playtest-end.1329418/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no secret how popular ARC Raiders has been all year. The extraction shooter has undergone a bunch of playtests and betas, and the Server Slam open beta arrived just before launch. If you’re wondering whether the latest ARC Raiders playtest is still going, when it ends, and if there’s another on the way, we’ve got answers to every question.</p>



<p>You only have to look at how many playtests Embark Studios has conducted this year to see how steadfast the developer is in its desire to get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> right. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Escape From Tarkov is finally ready for its 1.0 release</a>, but this has possibly been pushed forward by the success and interest in ARC Raiders—its new extraction shooter competition.</p>



<p>If you’ve enjoyed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a> and want to play more, we’ve got details on the beta and the game’s future.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-over">Is The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest Over?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You don’t have to look over your shoulder for a while. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The ARC Raiders Server Slam Playtest officially ended on October 20, and confirmation came from official ARC Raiders social media to end all hopes of the beta being extended.</strong></p>



<p>There’s always an optimistic instinct in all of us that we might get more. An extra day off, a bit more money in a paycheck, or anything equivalent. That was the feeling in the ARC Raiders community with the Server Slam test. Even though this was a last-minute beta before launch, the thought of waiting nearly two weeks for the game is probably an eternity.</p>



<p>We’ve seen people frantically looking up to see if the playtest had been extended. This is where we break your heart and say that this particular beta has conclusively ended.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-there-be-another-arc-raiders-playtest">Will There Be Another ARC Raiders Playtest?</h2>



<p><strong>Embark Studios’ stance is that the Server Slam playtest was the final beta of any sort before ARC Raiders finally launches on October 30.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s what the official <a href="https://x.com/arcraidersgame/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> account on X had to say: “The Server Slam has now officially ended. Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day. Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders!”</p>



<p>As you can see, there’s no mention of a final final playtest. It’s safe to say we’re ready to go for launch. It’s been a long journey to get there—what the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-delay-explained-embark-game-not-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay</a> and all—but, hopefully, it’s all worth it!</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📡The Server Slam has now officially ended.<br>Thank you so much for joining us to test the servers before the big day.</p><p>Speranza awaits you on October 30th, Raiders! <a href="https://t.co/U3rCPTjctn">pic.twitter.com/U3rCPTjctn</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1980191120442441772?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Could the team spring one final playtest on us as a tease? If they do, you know where to go to find out: Here on the Insider Gaming official website, or by keeping up with the wider IG community via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Biggest Changes In Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p>
      </div>
<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," Hamaguchi said to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ScreenRant</a>. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play--so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly. As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Development on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3</a> kicked off at full speed following the launch of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth in 2024. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-get-proper-high-quality-part-3-despite-rebirths-disappointing-sales/1100-6535048/">Square Enix is aiming to deliver a "high-quality" finale</a>, and the game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">expected to launch for multiple platforms</a>. Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-release-date-confirmed/1100-6534646/">will be launching for Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> early next year, with Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth arriving at a later date that has not yet been revealed.</p><p>Meanwhile, PS5 owners who haven't checked the games out yet can preorder the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-REBIRTH-Physical/dp/B0FVGHMMMQ?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="nofollow ">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</a> ahead of its release on December 4.</p>

<p>They're very good, y'know?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="5376a2b039629"><a title="Absolum / Ball x Pit" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5376a2b039629/absolum-ball-x-pit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> recently launched on the Nintendo Switch, and they're both bloody brilliant.</p>
<p>They're very different games, mind you, with the former being a self-described 'rogue 'em up', blending roguelike mechanics with classic beat 'em up action, and the latter being a very deliberate cross between <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> and <strong>Breakout</strong>.</p>
<p>Folks seem to be lapping them up, however, as both have recently posted solid sale milestones, with BALL x PIT surpassing 100,000 sales, and Absolum surpassing 200,000. Well done, both!</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lugosm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>


<p>A great start, then, but we sincerely hope this is just the beginning of something special. They genuinely fantastic games, and they deserve to see sales in the millions. We reckon word of mouth will do them both a world of good.</p>
<p>As for BALL x PIT specifically, it's possible some may be holding off for the Switch 2 version, which has been confirmed to be in the works, but has yet to receive a firm release date. Thankfully, the game runs very well on the original Switch, so you're in for a treat no matter where you play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Emily “Emiru” Schunk says she’s pressing charges and won’t be returning to TwitchCon after being assaulted by an attendee in a security lapse that’s bringing renewed scrutiny to Twitch’s safety and security policies for its biggest event of the year. “Twitch security is nowhere near me,” she said in a statement after the incident went viral on social media. “I can see them, but they don’t do anything.”</p> <p>Emiru, an online creator with over a million subscribers best known for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pwSsUVn3Ws">her cosplay livestreams</a>, was in the middle of a fan Meet and Greet at TwitchCon 2025 over the weekend when a man seemingly cut in line and grabbed her before leaning in toward her face. Footage shows her personal security running over to grab the individual and get him away from Emiru, at which point the man walks away from the Meet and Greet area.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So some freak just assaulted Emiru at <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitchCon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TwitchCon</a> . This behavior is fucking disgusting. I’m amazed that she still came back to finish the Meet and Greet line, honestly she deserves the utmost of respect. THIS HAS TO STOP!!!<a href="https://twitter.com/EmiruUpdatess?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmiruUpdatess</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/emiru?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@emiru</a> <a href="https://t.co/pyO2QHQ9Pv">pic.twitter.com/pyO2QHQ9Pv</a></p> <p>— BaconCrumbz 🥓 @TwitchCon SD (@BaconCrumbz) <a href="https://twitter.com/BaconCrumbz/status/1979387279149068577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>She said her first thought when the assault occurred was that it may have been a Twitch staff member coming to tell her something about the event but once he grabbed her she knew something was wrong. “I’m still, like, freaked out because he grabbed me,” Emiru <a href="https://x.com/emiru/status/1979602519967060414?">said in a video</a> released after the event. “That’s not normal. And then he grabs my face and he leans in and lips puckered tries to kiss me and I start screaming. You can’t hear it in the clip, but I’m fucking screaming my head off.”</p>

 <h2>Emiru claims Twitch lied</h2> <p>But as bad as the initial incident was, Emiru said Twitch’s response to what happened is what’s made her angrier. “I’m obviously shaken up by what happened and it’s not the first time I’ve dealt with something like this, but to tell you honestly, I am a lot more hurt and upset by how Twitch handled it during and after the fact.” She claimed that Twitch’s first move was to ban the suspect from the platform for 30 days, and it was only after her manager pressed the Amazon-owned platform that it made it a lifetime ban from Twitch and TwitchCon.</p>

 <p>“The safety and security of all those attending TwitchCon is our highest priority,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1979464697364779065?t=tjsgoIXfiG7ec7GXK6uuOg&amp;s=19">wrote in a statement</a> over the weekend. “The behavior displayed by the individual involved in the incident yesterday involving a high profile streamer was completely unacceptable and deeply upsetting.” Emiru also took issue with Twitch’s framing of its response, claiming that no one from security immediately tracked down the suspect to escort him out of the convention.</p>

  <p>“In line with existing TwitchCon security protocols, law enforcement and event security were on site and responded to the incident,” the company’s statement read. “We immediately blocked this individual from returning to the TwitchCon premises, and they are banned indefinitely from Twitch, both online and in-person events.” The statement, published on X, has since been community-noted by Emiru’s fans.</p> <h2>The TwitchCon fallout</h2> <p>The incident comes in the wake of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">Charlie Kirk assassination</a> earlier this year that left some of Twitch and YouTube’s most famous content creators afraid that they could be targeted at public events by violent actors or unhinged fans. Korean TikToker and livestreamer Yoon Ji-ah <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tiktok/korean-streamer-murdered-after-arguing-with-vip-viewer-who-donated-70000-to-her-3264111/">was murdered earlier this year</a> by a stalker who had allegedly donated roughly $70,000 to her under the user alias “‘Black Cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was my 12th TwitchCon and I’m not going to lie it might have been my last. I love seeing friends but it really just doesn’t feel the same. After seeing what happened this weekend I feel better about canceling my meet n greet and going home early</p> <p>— Lulu (@LuluLuvely) <a href="https://twitter.com/LuluLuvely/status/1980015610689171867?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Do you know how much I spent on security to be able to come to this event in the first place?” Emiru said in her latest video. “I’m not just talking about yesterday. I’m talking about my security for like my RV trip that I did with my friends and stuff. I spent over $10,000. Some people who stream on Twitch don’t even make $10,000 in a year. What the fuck are they supposed to do? Like if you watch the clip, the security guard who pushes the guy away is my security. The woman who pulls me to the back, my manager. If you’re a small streamer and you don’t have those resources or&nbsp;someone in your line’s not filming, what the fuck do you do? No one would have known.”</p>  <p>The streamer said Twitch had multiple representatives from Amazon speak with her following the incident but it’s not exactly clear yet how Twitch will revamp security. Multiple high-profile female streamers had previously <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/pokimane-valkyrae-qtcinderella-afraid-to-attend-twitchcon-due-to-safety-concerns-3255650/">shared their fears</a> about attending the event. “It does worry me that it might not be safe and it’d be better to skip out on it,” Imane “Pokimane” Anys told her viewers last month. The comment was in response to both Rachell “Valkyrae” Hofstetter and Blaire “QTCinderella” voicing their own concerns. So far at least, Twitch has only proven just how founded those fears were.</p>

            <p><span>If you’ve played any of the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games, you know the series is a heavily iterative one. Each new game makes some notable (or not so notable) strides over the last that build on, rather than overhaul, what came before.&nbsp; But each new game also finds ways of departing significantly from its predecessors, giving them all their own strengths and weaknesses. This is especially true of </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, which is one of the most significant departures from the old formula that Game Freak has ever put out. So let’s run down the best and worst parts of each </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> game, starting with the original Game Boy games.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-price-explained%E2%80%94will-arc-raiders-be-free-to-play.1329382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios is bringing serious competition to the extraction shooter genre in 2025 with ARC Raiders. The futuristic shooter has all the hallmarks of a classic PvPvE experience, and it would score more points if it were free to play and didn’t have a price to pay. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-steams-most-popular-extraction-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders became Steam’s most popular Extraction Shooter</a> with the release of its final test phase before launch—the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-final-open-beta-server-slam-test-start-date-how-to-play-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta Server Slam Test</a>. Developer Embark Studios (known for The Finals) has worked very hard to ensure it learns from its mistakes and stands a chance of survival at release.</p>



<p>One way to get more people on board is to make ARC Raiders free-to-play. Foregoing a price might be a financial gamble, but there would be benefits. Let’s raid the information cabinet for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-arc-raiders-free-to-play">Is ARC Raiders Free-to-Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Nothing is free in this world. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders will not be a free-to-play online multiplayer experience, and you will have to pay an initial one-time fee to set foot in Speranza and beyond!</strong></p>



<p>There’s a definite line in the sand when it comes to online shooters now: Those that are free-to-play, and those that want a fee upfront. Naturally, games like Concord have only stoked the fires of the debate more. When you have a Warzone, a Fortnite, a Marvel Rivals, or an Apex Legends charging nothing to play the base game, it’s only natural to question if other new releases should follow suit.</p>



<p>However, EA and Embark Studios have decided against making ARC Raiders free-to-play. It doesn’t mean it won’t make the transition in the future, but for now, you need to dip into your pockets to play it.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-price-explained">ARC Raiders Price, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The base edition of ARC Raiders costs $39.99 or £30.99, whereas you need to stump up $59.99 or £49.99 for the more expensive Deluxe Edition.</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, you don’t need to buy the upgraded version, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-deluxe-edition-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deluxe Edition content and bonus rewards</a> are pretty tempting. The Standard Edition offers the thing you’re after the most—the game. If you go early, you might even be able to get your hands on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-pre-order-bonuses-revealed-prices-explained/">ARC Raiders pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s a mini-breakdown of what’s included in each edition of the game, and a reaffirmation of the cost.</p>

That’s enough to make it the sixth most-played game on Steam right now. Only Delta force, Battlefield 6, PUBG, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike 2 are more popular right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Duckov is a PVE top-down looter-shooter game in which you scavenge for resources, build your hideout, and upgrade your gear. “Start from nothing and rise to the top,” reads the official blurb. “Outwit hostile ducks, survive, or make it out alive.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Following its launch on October 16, Team Soda’s game sold an additional 500,000 copies over the weekend. Its Steam user review rating is sitting pretty at 'Overwhelmingly Positive.' “At this moment, the entire dev team is quacking with joy and flapping our wings in excitement!” reads a statement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape from Tarkov, meanwhile, hits Steam on November 15. It will be interesting to see if it beats Escape from Duckov’s concurrent player peak on the platform. A console version is in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooters might be having a moment, particularly on PC. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-ends-server-slam-playtest-with-big-steam-concurrents-suggesting-strong-launch-ahead">Arc Raiders, for example, recently enjoyed big Steam concurrents during its 'Server Slam' playtest</a>, which bodes well for its late October release date. Then we'll have Escape from Tarkov join the fun half a month later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom's upcoming, unannounced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-zero-hd">Resident Evil Zero</a> remake will reportedly launch in 2028 and feature the lead actor from Square Enix's Guardians of the Galaxy video game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, IGN verified a report by noted Resident Evil leaker Dusk Golem that claimed Capcom would continue remaking its classic Resident Evil back catalog with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-at-capcom">new versions of both Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero in development</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MP1st</a> has suggested that the Code Veronica remake is targeting a Q1 2027 release window, while Resident Evil Zero will follow a year after. And there's word, too, of Zero remake's codename — "Project Chamber" — which is also listed on the <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">resume</a> of Far Cry 5 and Guardians of the Galaxy (video game) actor Jon McLaren.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">McLaren's resume describes Project Chamber as an "upcoming AAA video game", for which he is providing performance capture at Beyond Capture Studios. The codename would be an obvious nod to Resident Evil Zero's Rebecca Chambers, while MP1st notes that Beyond Capture Studios was previously used by Capcom for both the Resident Evil 4 Remake and Street Fighter 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Zero originally launched in 2002 on GameCube, and served as a prequel to franchise's classic first entry. It covers the events surrounding the S.T.A.R.S. Bravo Team in the Arklay Mountains, with the player switching between Chambers and escaped convict Billy Coen. (This is, presumably, who McLaren is playing.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This new remake is expected to add fresh scenes to the original game's story — in a similar manner to how Capcom has fleshed out its previous Resident Evil remakes. In Zero, it's reported that this will include a larger role for the conductor in the game's infamous train sequence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's likely still plenty of time to go before fans see anything of Capcom's new Resident Evil Zero remake for themselves, though today's fresh report provides a little more detail of what to expect — and when. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, of course, Capcom is busy getting ready for the launch of next year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> — which is set to arrive on February 27, 2026 in time for the franchise's 30th anniversary. The game is designed to act as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-over-a-decade-resident-evil-requiem-will-return-to-franchises-original-overarching-narrative-featuring-raccoon-city-and-umbrella">something of a send-off for some of the series' long-running plotlines</a>, including the fate of the Umbrella Corporation and Raccoon City. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">But will Leon S.

He's particularly taken with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei"><u>Ghost of Yotei</u></a> at the moment, admitting: "I can't wait to get home to continue playing it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">RPG fans have been on the hunt for news about the next entry in the Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy since its last installment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth"><u>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</u></a>, launched in early 2024. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-in-development"><u>development started as early as June 2022</u></a>, with Square Enix saying last year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-hoping-to-release-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-finale-by-2027"><u>its goal was to see it launch by 2027</u></a>.

Co-director Tetsuya Nomura similarly acknowledged he'd heard the cries for updates on Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iv"><u>Kingdom Hearts 4</u></a> last month, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-director-tells-fans-not-to-worry-about-rebirth-sales-insists-the-trilogy-ender-will-be-a-proper-high-quality-send-off"><u>happily reported that development was “progressing really smoothly.”</u></a> </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait, you can read up <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-we-will-not-cheat-with-final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-airship"><u>why the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 team “will not cheat” when it comes to Final Fantasy 7’s iconic airship</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

As a nod to the past, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a> is adding the Type-35 Needler from the original Halo.</p><p>In the lore of the franchise, Needlers were a weapon that was developed by the alien Covenant and shoot crystalline shards that can track down their targets.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ROG Xbox Ally X Is Good, But Has Issues</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">This is the second time this month that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/future-xbox-consoles-not-canceled-microsoft-says/1100-6535237/">Microsoft has declared it's not exiting the hardware</a> business, specifically in regard to new systems in the future. A rumor bubbled up earlier in October that noted future Xbox console plans were "up in the air." A founding Xbox team member has also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-has-no-desire-to-make-hardware-anymore-founding-team-member-says/1100-6532825/">questioned whether Microsoft has a desire to make new hardware</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Another tantalizing tidbit from the Variety story with Bond is that internally made Xbox handhelds are noted as a possibility as well. In June, it was reported that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-essentially-canceled-report/1100-6532402/">Xbox handheld device was "essentially canceled."</a></p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">raised Xbox prices again in the US</a>. That means the entry-level Xbox Series S now costs $400 (was $380), while the Xbox Series X options start at $600 (was $550). Then, at the start of this month, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">hiked the price for Game Pass Ultimate</a> up to $30 monthly (was $20).</p>

            <p>With the conclusion of the Arc Raiders server slam, players came away telling tales of their daring escapes and close calls. But one shared experience linked many jumpy raiders together: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1o9khke/we_can_all_agree_that_this_is_scarier_than_arc/">getting spooked by tumbleweeds</a>.</p>
<p>It sounds strange, but there's a good reason why. In Arc Raiders and all extraction shooters for that matter, an enemy player getting the jump on you often means certain death. As such you've got to stay on your toes at all times, keeping your eyes and ears on high alert in order to avoid misfortune.</p>
<p>Tumbleweeds move around with the wind at ground level much like enemy players do, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/">and as such were catching players off guard</a>. They also kind of make a noise that could be mistaken for another player moving around in your proximity.</p>

<p>They are common too: any player who found themselves moving around outside during the server slam last weekend would have seen a few bouncing about. These were added to the game recently as part of a wide range of tweaks and improvements to Arc Raiders, so even experienced players who tried the game out previously were getting jumpscared by tumbleweeds.</p><p>Arc Raiders actually has a hefty amount of sound triggers that can give away your location, or just generally add to the stress of strolling across the map. This is true for bushes, flocks of birds resting on the ground, as well as far louder environmental triggers such as opening doors and busting open boxes with your big hammer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-already-has-servers-slammed-by-almost-100000-players-in-two-hours-as-weekend-playtest-starts">Arc Raiders proved to be exceptionally popular during the first few hours of last weekend's final public test</a>, quickly attracting nearly 100,000 concurrent players on Steam alone. The game is set to release in full on the 30th October, at which point players will be able to experience the full scope of the game, tumbleweeds and otherwise.</p>

		<p>Star Trek: Voyager –&nbsp;Across The Unknown gives you the chance to do things a little bit differently. Stranded on the other side of the galaxy with who knows what lying between them and a return to Federation Space, some 70,000 light years away, it’s a journey that tested the crew of the Voyager no end, challenging their ideals, their willingness to do the right thing by Federation standards, and to overcome the dangers in their way. But what if you were slipped into the Captain’s jumpsuit, instead of Kate Mulgrew? It’d probably be a different fit, and you might make some rather different decisions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | &quot;What if?&quot; Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqYgGynR3iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s be honest, Star Trek: Voyager wasn’t the best of 90s Star Trek – that’s Deep Space 9 by a country parsec – and the writers hitting episodic reset button each week on the TV series didn’t let them deliver on the idea of being trapped decades from home and needing to do everything just to persist – something that Battlestar Galactica’s reboot did quite a bit better. But it absolutely had its moments. The strength of Kathryn Janeway’s leadership shone through, the eventual addition of Seven of Nine, and heck, I’m sure there’s a number of strong narrative arcs with the Borg, Species 8472, and more, all building up to a blockbusting conclusion.</p>


<p>Across The Unknown starts at the very beginning of the journey, presenting the entirety of the opening two-part episode, Caretaker, to act as an introduction and tutorial for the game’s take on the story and how Gamexcite has built the narrative around new decision points, ship management and space exploration.</p>
<p>The first element here is really how the narrative is told to you, distilling the original screenplays and episodes into dialogue text boxes and back and forth scenes in the ship’s bridge, amongst other locations, as well as quick narrative paragraphs alongside painterly stills from the TV series. Within that, you’ll often get the ability to choose how to proceed, whether it’s with optional extra dialogue to dig deeper into a subject, a decision on what path to take, or simply coming up to a key story moment and needing to say if you’re ready to go ahead or not –&nbsp;you’re seemingly given plenty of time to prepare instead of being forced into encounters.</p>


<p>Beaming an away team down to the Array, and later on down to the dustbowl planet at the behest of Neelix, you’re able to choose the composition of the group. Tuvok is great as a Security Officer, providing leadership and the ability to blast in and out of a situation with phasers, while Harry Kim is better for science, and Neelix or Kes might bring more local knowledge and options in some situations. You’re clued in on the particular character traits that will be valuable through a series of skill checks, but then at each stage you need to decide which character (or characters) to lean on, aware that they will then be fatigued and less useful for the next story point.</p>
<p>Failure on any of these skill checks comes with consequences big and small. Early on in an away mission it might just be thematic – the Kazon choosing to fire in your direction before backing off if you defy them – but later on it could be that a heated phaser fire exchange sees a character wounded and needing to rest up in the sick bay. Of course, through this opening story section, it feels like the stakes are lowered, but it was interesting that, given the option to try and rescue some of the Maquis from the Caretaker, I ended up with Kim and Torres coming back to Voyager, with Paris and Chakotay kept hostage.</p>

<p>Much of the ship is deactivated and damaged in the opening events of the story, alongside many other parts of the ship, as life support is knocked out across a bunch of decks. Where that can be hand-waved away with some plotting in the TV series, here it’s an integral part of the survival experience. The ship is viewed from the side on like an ant farm or the base view in XCOM, and one of the first priorities for you is to assign maintenance crews to repair existing mission critical rooms, clear debris, and build some emergency crew quarters.</p>
<p>This all takes time and resources, so you’ll be scouring each star system for some of those Star Trek-y elements and compounds. Deuterium is plentiful, but your Warp Core absolutely chews through it to provide power to ship systems, and running out leaves you on battery power alone. Then there’s a few elements needed for construction and repairs, science points for research, and eventually some Borg points.</p>
<p>Even as you’re getting things like phaser banks and the shuttle bay back up and running, you can already start to research improvements and new rooms. Hydroponics will help feed your crew without draining the replicator, an additional cargo bay that’s upgraded can seriously boost the amount of resources you can bank for when you need them, there’s hull upgrades, cycling shields, and more.</p>

<p>You can choose to rebuild Voyager in multiple ways, either looking to embrace science, discovery and research, or arming yourself to defend in combat, and then using this to feed into your decision making through narrative points. I’ve no doubt that the Holodeck taking up a whopping nine spaces on the ship will be a sore spot, when battling for space against</p>
<p>Combat presents you with a pausable abstraction, where you issue commands for who and what part of a ship to target, and make use of your named characters’ abilities. You can set three of these to be active, with Tuvok doubling phaser blasts and Harry Kim able to disrupt enemy shields being a good starter combo. As you chip away at enemy shields, you’ll then be able to manually blast with torpedoes.</p>
<p>This section felt a bit woolly to me, partly because the camera felt a bit too close, and the ship movements a bit too rapid –&nbsp;they should feel like naval ships, gliding past and making graceful arcs, a la The Wrath of Khan – but also because defeating the Kazon fleet didn’t actually cause the ships to blow up or retreat. I just got a victory screen at the end. Hopefully this is cleared up for the full game.</p>
<p>In general, I also feel like the UI needs a bit of sprucing up and rationalising. The ship, system and galactic maps are all quick and easy to flick between, but research is separate in a lightly annoying way and you can only back out by hitting Escape. The success predictor for skill checks also uses two shades of yellow to mean critical success and mild failure in different situations. I also just wish that work crews would be freed up as soon as they’ve finished construction, instead of needing me to acknowledge a room has been cleared. Oh, and can I not just relocate a room, instead of scrapping it?</p>

<p>I think it will be fascinating to see just how much of the show’s seven seasons has ended up being recreated for this game. I expect that most of the highlight episodes found across the many watch lists found online will have been captured, while most of the filler and utter dross like Threshold is left behind. Alright, so it would be pretty funny to leave lizard Janeway and Paris to their new lives as lizard parents, but then who would be Chakotay’s first officer? Harry Kim? Are we sure we really want that?</p>
<p>All in all, I enjoyed this first look and demo for Star Trek: Voyager –&nbsp;Across The Unknown and am certainly intrigued to see how it takes the strong concept and the series’ high points, and forms them into something new and potentially rather different.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie extraction shooter and <i>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</i>spoof <i>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</i>has managed to sell a pretty impressive number of copies since launching on Thursday, developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced.</p>

<p>According to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020/view/617681009992795859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 500,000 since last week's release, an achievement Team Soda says has its developers "quacking with joy and flapping [their] wings in excitement".</p>

<p>The studio promises that every subsequent update for&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>will "live up to your expectations" and reminds everyone who hasn't bought the game yet that it's still available at a 12% discount, so if you are at all interested in&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, now's the time to pick it up.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/escape-from-duckov-sales-500k-inventory.jpg?itok=qzLl0DHj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/escape-from-duckov-sales-500k-inventory.jpg?itok=LxVuLG2v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>has hit a pretty big sales milestone since launching on Thursday.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Duckov</em>'s achievement puts it on par with "anxiety horror" game <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" rel="nofollow">No, I'm Not a Human</a>&nbsp;</i>and cozy RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>&nbsp;</em>in the sales stakes, although it's a very different prospect to either of those games.</p>

<p>It's not a bad figure at all for a game that almost certainly started out as a joke based on its title, so kudos to Team Soda and bilibili for seeing this one through. I'd say they deserve to reap the benefits, especially if the game's Overwhelmingly Positive Steam <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rating</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, it's a top-down extraction shooter openly inspired by Battlestate's popular&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although it's obviously a good deal less realistic than that game.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>bases its core gameplay loop, inventory management system, and general atmosphere on&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>, it's not a multiplayer game; this is a strictly single-player PvE affair, so if you're put off from&nbsp;<em>Tarkov&nbsp;</em>by other players (and its lack of ducks), this one's for you.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> if you're interested in checking it out. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/try-out-the-apple-airpods-pro-2-at-a-32-discount-over-at-amazon-2000636706</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Okay, people. Listen here. Amazon has the Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds on sale for a good 32% off.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/"> It’s not too often we see Apple stuff getting a discount, so now’s a great time to upgrade your earbuds or pick up an extra set as the pair has come down to just $170</a>. These AirPods are usually set at $249 so you’re looking at a $79 discount. The model here is the second generation of the Pro 2, which support a wide range of useful features with the new iOS. So if you plan on listening with these behind your computer at work, sitting on the train, or pumping iron at the gym, these everyday best-selling premium earbuds can help you make that time much more enjoyable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Rich Audio Experience</h2>
<p>Now, this specific set of AirPods Pro 2 have been engineered with the Apple H2 chip. The computational power it provides allow the earbuds to perform intelligent noise cancellation with deep immersive sound. The ANC is twice as powerful as comparable earbuds from other brands. For you, that means less unwanted noise and better focus on what you want to hear. They can drown out the sounds of a plane engine or just keep muzzled the noisy sounds of a busy office. Along with that, you can also watch and listen to select songs, shows, and movies with support for Dolby Atmos. Enjoy high quality and immersive spatial audio.</p>
<p>When the time comes you need to hear your surroundings again, simply flip your AirPods Pro 2&nbsp; over to transparency mode. This will allow outside sounds to come in so your can stay aware of what’s around you. This is great for when stepping outside and walking through a busy street. It’s usually good to here the cars and trucks in that kind of environment for your own safety.</p>



<p>You can choose to use Adaptive Audio which is able to blend between both active noise cancellation and transparency mode seamlessly to give you the best listening experience for whatever your particular situation is.</p>
<p>The AirPods Pro 2 have been made to be able to fit any ear size. In the box, you’ll find additional silicone tips marked as XS, S, M, and L. This way no matter how large or small your ears are, the AirPods Pro 2 will be able to snugly fit, staying firmly in place. This also created an acoustic seal which, in unison with active noise cancellation, keeps out the unwanted sounds.</p>

              <p>Someone definitely unplugged something they shouldn’t have. This morning the worldwide internet saw some major outages after Amazon’s AWS server farms suffered a whoopsie, taking down big-name games like <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-and-fortnite-are-down-and-so-are-many-of-the-worlds-most-popular-games">as <em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>, <em>Palworld</em>, <em>Clash Royale</em> and various Nintendo online services. Most of these have since recovered.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Fortnite has recovered, with multiplayer matches working once again. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/netinfo/en_US/index.html">Nintendo is also back online</a>, after both Switch and Switch 2 network services went offline for about four hours this morning.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">✅ The service provider outage is resolved and Fortnite is back online! Players should again be able to log-in and matchmake without issue.</p> <p>We'll continue to monitor this to ensure service remains stable. 🫡 <a href="https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj">https://t.co/5hhpG5UKfj</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1980249794502082948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>For fans of brainrot, it seems <em>Roblox</em> is now back online, albeit chugging a little. Er, yay?&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980232723060211958"><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is also reporting that it’s back online and multiplayer is working as normal.</a></p>

 <p>However, the most serious outage is still affecting me: I cannot get&nbsp;<em>Connections</em> to run on my&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em> puzzle app, and frankly I’m struggling to cope.</p> <p>It seems the issue has taken place in Northern Virginia, <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">where Amazon reports</a> “multiple services” are down following “increased error rates and latencies.” This all started about four hours ago in Amazon’s US-EAST-1 region, specifically the “DynamoDB endpoint,” which sounds painful. The 4.26 a.m. ET update explained, “Engineers were immediately engaged and are actively working on both mitigating the issue, and fully understanding the root cause,” later noting that the cause was related to “DNS resolution” of said endpoint. Throughout the early hours of the morning, Amazon has continued to update, explaining that issues are being resolved and everything is slowly getting back online, but it’s a slow process.</p>

 <p>Given the speed with which things are being recovered, this doesn’t look like a significant attack or long-term problem, but rather yet another useful example of how just a couple of corporations now control access to the vast majority of the internet we usually take for granted.</p>

 <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.15 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has been updated to say that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> is back online.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 10/20/2025, 9.32 a.m. ET:</strong> The post has once more been updated to report that Nintendo is now back online, and to reframe the post and headline to reflect that the issues are now mostly fixed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-%E2%80%98on-ice%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1329331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has speculated that development of the Final Fantasy 9 Remake may have been put on hold for the time being. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s development has gone through several significant hurdles since we first heard about it. Most recently, we were told earlier this year that the game’s development is ‘in trouble’ and there’s a chance of it being cancelled. Now, more news that fans will not be happy about has surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-9-remake-s-future-is-unknown">Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s Future is Unknown</h2>



<p>Recently, NateTheHate was asked on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1979261183820431479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) whether he had heard anything new about Final Fantasy 9 Remake’s plans. The insider replied that, for now, he assumes “the game is on ice” and that development may have been paused for the title. Moreover, the post states that it is “unknown” whether Square Enix will decide to “return to it or not.” Seems like Final Fantasy 9’s remake is in real trouble. </p>



<p>Things seemed to be looking bright for Final Fantasy 9 Remake earlier this year, when rumours started to heat up with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-rumors-heat-up-with-new-ff9-website-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new website launch</a> for the 25th Anniversary. A few days later, it seemed like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-seemingly-teased-by-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix was also teasing the title</a>, as they posted a quote from the original game’s ending. However, since then we have only been receiving bad news, with it seeming like FF9 remake will never see the light of day. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Twin Pack Physical Edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-twin-pack-physical-edition-pre-orders-now-available-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-orders are now available</a> for PlayStation 5. Additionally, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part’s development <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-development-unaffected-by-xboxs-lack-of-memory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remains unaffected</a> by Xbox’s lack of memory.

<figure data-uuid="6d7c0a9b97f07"><a title="Resident Evil 0" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6d7c0a9b97f07/resident-evil-0.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Rumours regarding a potential remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_0">Resident Evil 0</a> have been simmering for a little while now, but a new report from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">mp1st</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-for-release-after-requiem">Pure Xbox</a>) has added further fuel to the fire.</p>
<p>The remake is supposedly real and currently operating under the codename 'Chamber', which is presumably a blatant reference to protagonist Rebecca Chambers. Voice and performance capture work had reportedly begun in 2024, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_cloud_version">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> actor Jon McLaren taking on a key role.</p>
<p>McLaren's <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">resume</a> makes reference to a 'lead' role in 'PROJECT CHAMBER (Upcoming AAA Video Game)' with Beyond Capture Studios, which had also worked with Capcom on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. While not a definitive lead at this time, it seems possible that McLaren may be taking on the role of RE0's Billy Coen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lugosm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Mp1st also goes on to say that "the remake is expected to expand upon the source material, although the core story will remain the same". Pretty standard for RE remakes, as far as we're concerned. They then dive briefly into a couple of potential new scenes, but we won't relay those details here. You can click through to the article if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<p>According to prominent Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">Dusk Golem</a>, Capcom's current timeline has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> remake launching in 2027 with Resident Evil 0 following in 2028. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next mainline entry in the seres, will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As always, we won't treat this as gospel until Capcom itself provides official confirmation. If the timeline is even remotely accurate, it's likely we won't hear about Resident Evil 0 for a couple of years, at least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>The new PlayStation 5 Pro CFI-7121 model, no</span>w available across Europe, comes with some improvements over the original model, a new teardown conducted by&nbsp;Austin Evans&nbsp;confirmed.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between the PlayStation 5 Pro launch model and the CFI-7121 model is better power efficiency for the 2025 model. In tests conducted running Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, the CFI-7121 model proved to be 2 to 3% more power efficient, even running replays in Gran Turismo 7 which push the system the most with full ray tracing support. Thanks to the better power efficiency, the new system also runs slightly cooler than 2024's launch model.</p>



<p>The CFI-7121 model is also noticeably quieter. In the tests, the new unit proved to be 20% quieter than the launch model, representing a 2-decibel difference. The new fan's slightly lower-pitched sound profile further enhances this reduction.</p>



<p>The differences between the two PlayStation 5 Pro models are minimal for the rest. Changes like slightly different fan from another manufacturer, a plastic fan grid in place of a metal grid, a lighter rear heat sink, the removal of some VMMs from the motherboard and a lighter, possibly more efficient power supply, result not only in the enhanced power efficiency, but also in a lighter weight - 3016 grams against the 3103 grams of the launch model.</p>



<p>The changes for the new DualSense controller revision are even smaller. Aside from some small internal changes and parts produced by a different manufacturer than those in a launch controller, the new DualSense only saw the removal of the back microphone. This is a rather small change likely made to keep manufacturing costs down without significantly impacting the controller's performance and functionality.</p>



<p>You can see the full breakdown of these hardware changes, including the fan and heatsink revisions, in Austin Evans' complete teardown video below.</p>

<p>While it was expected that the new PlayStation 5 Pro model would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">around 3% more power efficient than the launch model</a>, the new DualSense V3 controller revision is minimal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">which is not what earlier reports suggested earlier this month</a>. While this may be disappointing for some, the fact that the changes made to the controller don't impact its functionality and keep its price down should still be welcome amidst consistent price increases that have made both<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"> the regular PlayStation 5 </a>and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/"> Xbox Series X|S systems more expensive</a> since their launch in 2020.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to catch up on some Wizarding World magic, or even better, bring your favorite moments home. Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets for the fans out there, and right now, you can pick one up for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">The Harry Potter Hagrid’s Hut: An Unexpected Visit set is currently going for just $47 on Amazon, after a steep 37% off its regular price of $75</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this set drop to in a long while, but the deal is going to wrap up soon. Whether you’re treating yourself to some weekend fun or introducing your kids to the classics, now’s the time to jump in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Both the Insides and Outdoors</h2>
<p>This set gets you a total of 896 pieces, and it’s designed for children ages 8 and up. You will build Hagrid’s cozy hut, plus the dog house. The hut itself opens up and has a removable roof. The insides have Hagrid’s foldout chair, an umbrella stand, and even a dragon egg. There are also two collectible Hogwarts portrait tiles, which are randomly selected from a set of 14. You can display these inside Hagrid’s hut, or add them to your collection if you’re building one.</p>
<p>Mini figures include Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Hagrid, along with Norbert the dragon and Hagrid’s Dog Fang. You can recreate multiple scenes; maybe have Hagrid relax on his chair inside, while the curious kids look for trouble, or have them all outside preparing to fight the unknown.</p>



<p>The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If that sounds too complicated, you can also download the Lego app on your phone for 3D instructions. You can also track your progress through the app to get started right where you left off.</p>
<p>Altogether, this set is a great option if you want to keep some of your favorite Harry Potter memories close. It’s not just fun to build, but also a little nostalgic, especially for those who grew up watching the movies. The mini figure selection is impressive; you’re getting most of the key characters. You could treat yourself to it, or gift it to a fellow fan this Halloween! Just be sure to grab the set fast, as we don’t expect this offer to last long. It could wrap up anytime now.</p>

            <p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has confirmed Microsoft is working on "next-gen hardware", following rumours it was no longer in console development.</p>
<p>Bond spoke with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a> to mark the release of the new handheld ROG Xbox Ally, but was also asked about the future of Xbox.</p>
<p>"We are 100 percent looking at making things in the future," said Bond. "We have our next-gen hardware in development. We've been looking at prototyping, designing. We have a partnership we've announced with AMD around it, so that is coming. What we saw here was an opportunity to innovate in a new way and to bring gamers another choice, in addition to our next-gen hardware. We are always listening to what players and creators want. When there is demand for innovation, we're going to build it."</p>

<p>Rumours had been circulating on social media that Microsoft would no longer be developing console hardware, rumours which began shortly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly appeared to tie in with not only the forthcoming release of the new handheld in collaboration with Asus, but with Microsoft's own campaign slogan of "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox</a>" and a mission to ensure its games are available on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Yet this statement from Bond confirms hardware remains in the pipeline.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that people have a choice," Bond told Variety. "We want to make sure there's an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what's possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they're a casual gamer, they're a gaming enthusiast, then there's Xbox Allys for them. Giving multiple choices for people, so we can actually meet people where they are."</p>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-rog-ally-handheld-now-available-to-pre-order-but-its-pricier-than-a-home-console">steep price of the handheld</a> suggests it's not particularly suited to casual gamers either.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X review</a> from Tom Orry states it's "an impressive handheld PC wearing an Xbox mask". Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">pining instead for Xbox's "distant heyday"</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly been some confusion over the messaging from Xbox recently and speculation on its future, which hasn't been helped by the Game Pass price hike following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">multiple game cancellations</a> off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs</a>.</p>

            <p>GT-Abe gateway drug <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simpsons-hit-run">The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a>'s status a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-everyone-still-loves-a-20-year-old-simpsons-game">thing people my age remember from their childhoods</a> has earned it a strong modding community, and the latest export to come out of it is a Futurama total conversion designed to mirror an official expansion. It's predictably called Futurama: Hit &amp; Run and has a demo out now.</p>
<p>For free, of course, so attempts to deploy the 'shut up and take my money' meme here are thoroughly misplaced. If you've already said it while reading that first paragraph, please submit to death by snu-snu. No wait, that makes it sound like I'm going to be the one doing the-</p>

<p>Getting back on track, <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</a> devs Slurm Team's recreation of New New York consists of new 3D models built "from scratch". There are four fresh story missions to sink your teeth into while playing as formerly freezered delivery boy Fry, plus a bonus mission. Naturally, the 30th century also has three new street races and a wager-based one. Prepare to eat some dust, pantless space ranger Zapp Brannigan.</p><p>There are six cars with which to bump cartoon pedestrians into t-posey ragdoll falls. four costumes to don, and 25 wasps to awkwardly jump-kick. Amusingly, the modders specify that their work contains exactly ten side-gags, including one elusive secret gag to hunt down. I assume all of them are buttons you press so that Ralph Wiggum says a thing, as all Hit and Run jokes should be.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while a full custom soundtrack's up and running, Slurm Team have made clear they've used "AI-generated dialogue as temporary placeholders" in the demo. "Please note that these synthetic voices are included solely for demonstration purposes," the modders wrote. "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'll wait for that update to materialise before I think about giving the mod a go (I'll also need to acquire a non-PS2 copy of Hit &amp; Run). In a fun twist, the trailer's seemingly caught the eye of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/97899/joe-mcginn/">Joe McGinn</a>, a senior game designer on the original, and he's left a comment indicating he's keen to try the mod out.</p>
<p>To get Futurama: Hit &amp; Run hit and running, you'll need a copy of Hit &amp; Run for PC, plus <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/6">Lucas' Simpsons Hit &amp; Run Mod Launcher</a>.</p>
