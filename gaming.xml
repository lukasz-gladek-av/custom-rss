<p>One of the most popular, albeit controversial, skateboarders of all time is going to be in the next Tony Hawk game after all. According to The Nine Club podcast, Bam Margera will be in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 after all.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenineclub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent episode</a> of the show, host Roger Bagley explained what happened to get Margera into the game after it was noticed at the reveal that he wasn’t part of the roster.</p>



<p>Bagley claims that the game was done and that Margera wasn’t going to be a part of it at all. Hawk himself then reportedly put his foot down to get him on the game’s roster.</p>



<p>“Tony called up Activision and was like ‘hey, we’re putting Bam in the thing’, and they were like ‘hey, we can’t’,” Bagley said. “He goes ‘no, you’re gonna do it’, and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game.”</p>



<p><a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/03/24/bam-margera-featured-tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a> has since corroborated the claims, saying that Activision flew Margera out to Los Angeles recently to do motion capture work for the game. Prior to his, now likely, inclusion in the upcoming remake, Margera had appeared in seven Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater Games starting with the original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 in 2001. His last appearance was in 2007’s Tony Hawk’s Proving Ground.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claim and will update this story should a response be received. </p>



<p>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is set to release on July 11 for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch. It’ll also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC.</p>

<p>Minecraft has been out for over 15 years, and many fans have questioned if the time was right for the game to finally go free-to-play. If you happen to be one of those fans, you’re not going to like the answer.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/minecraft-wont-go-free-to-play-its-the-best-deal-in-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Minecraft executive producer Ingela Garneij said that neither Microsoft nor Mojang have any plans for the game to go the free-to-play route. </p>



<p>“Yeah, it doesn’t really work with the way we built it,” she said when posed with the question. </p>



<p>Garneij continued: “I mean we built the game for a different purpose. So monetization doesn’t work in that way for us. It’s a purchase of the game and then that’s it. For us it’s important that our game is available for as many people as possible. And so I think that’s a very core value that it should be accessible for everyone. It’s the best deal in the world.”</p>

<p>Minecraft first launched on PC in May 2009 before released a full 1.0 release in November 2011. It debuted on console when it released for Xbox 360 in May 2012 and is now available on every major platform.</p>



<p>Since its launch, the game has sold over 300 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video games of all time. The game, alongside its developer Mojang, was purchased in 2014 by Microsoft for $2.5 billion.</p>

<p>Just a week before the full Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event on April 2, Nintendo is expected to hold a separate event sometime this week. That’s according to well-known leaker Nate The Hate.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1904275415075606643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a> on Monday, Nate The Hate said that he’s “heard there is a Nintendo presentation this week”. He added that he believes it will be on or around Thursday, and that “it’ll be a Direct”.</p>



<p>“I’m not 100% certain on the format at present,” he said.</p>



<p>Also unknown is what type of games will be shown during the event, if it happens. Will it focus exclusively on games releasing for the current Nintendo Switch, or will Switch 2 games be teased or shown as well?</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nintendo for comment on the claims, but the company won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>What do you think about a final Nintendo Direct before the full Switch 2 reveal next week? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <p>
A mod putting a playable approximation of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> has run into trouble after Rockstar owner Take-Two issued a copyright removal request to its creator's YouTube channel.
</p>
<p>
The mod, developed by Youtuber Dark Space, was an effort to bring GTA 6's map to life in GTA 5 by building on the work of the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/985670-mapping-vice-city-map-discussion-thread-no-leak-footage-allowed/">Mapping Vice City project</a> - a community led attempt to piece together GTA 6's map by scrutinising all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">currently released official media</a> and combining any discoveries with previously leaked map coordinates.
</p>
<p>
Dark Space began <a href="https://x.com/Dark_SpaceYT/status/1882980876201685289">detailing his progress on social media</a> in January and a version 1.0 release of his mod - built from GTA 5 assets - launched last week. However, the project may already have run aground; Dark Space is reining things in after Take-Two's legal team hit his YouTube channel with a copyright removal request.

<p>
"I spent months building a fan-made GTA 6-inspired map inside GTA 5 - something purely made out of passion, not profit," Dark Space wrote in an introduction to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LmLfJAuR_U">new video detailing the week's events</a>. "But shortly after uploading a video showcasing the project, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> took it down. No warning. No conversation. Just gone."
</p>
<p>
"I've also removed the download link even though they didn't ask me to," Dark Space continued in the video itself. "But I think it's smarter to get out in front of them rather than waiting for their email that will never come... So why did they remove my video?... Well, my guess is that the map is probably a little too accurate.""
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-map-in-gta-5-mod-suffers-inevitable-take-two-takedown-creator-believes-it-was-probably-a-little-too-accurate-and-could-have-ruined-the-surprise">follow-up interview with IGN</a>, Dark Space admitted he'd anticipated Take-Two might respond the way it did based on previous mod takedowns. "I went into this project knowing it was a possibility," he explained, "and the fact that it happened does not surprise me."
</p>
<p>
"I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get," he continued. "If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too."
</p>

Take-Two has long been at loggerheads with the GTA modding community, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-shuts-down-ambitious-mod-that-put-gta-4s-liberty-city-in-grand-theft-auto-5">shutting down the Liberty City Preservation Project</a> - an ambitious mod adding a playable version of GTA 4's map to GTA5. In 2023, however, it hired Cfx.re - the team behind the popular GTA 5 FiveM and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">RDR2</a> RedM mods (and another group that's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-bans-gta5-modders-who-made-their-own-multiplayer">previously faced Rockstar's wrath</a>) - which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-enhanced-official-modding-utility-is-on-its-way">currently working on an official "conversion tool"</a> to bring GTA 5 mods into the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5s-next-gen-upgrades-finally-arrive-on-pc">recently released PC version of GTA 5 Enhanced</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for GTA 6, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">still targeting the autumn 2025 release window previously announced by Take-Two</a>, despite persistent reports of a delay - although a third-party accessories company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-set-for-pc-debut-in-early-2026-accessories-company-claims">recently claimed the PC version won't arrive until early next year</a>.

The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The developer behind Astro Bot has a handbook for all new employees that contains the following phrase: "We aim for quality, not quantity." Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet showed off this slogan at a Game Developers Conference session last week, where he argued, "It's okay to make a small game."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-it-s-okay-to-make-a-small-game-astro-bot-director-nicolas-doucet-says-tiny-ideas-contain-huge-potential" rel="nofollow ">GameDeveloper</a> reports that Doucet shared how this approach helped Team Asobi thrive with Astro Bot, one of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/">GameSpot's 10 best games of 2024</a>. Additionally, the 3D platformer has racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-developers-choice-awards-2025-nominees-revealed/2900-6173/#1">nominations and awards at GDC</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/28th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-revealed/2900-6116/">the DICE Awards</a>. "The prospect of a game you can actually complete is a really, really positive argument [for small games]," Doucet said. "That meant being okay with the game being 12 hours, but if it had been eight hours--and the eight hours were fantastic--we would have settled for that to reach consistent quality."</p><div

For instance, Doucet reportedly told audience members that the game's narrative has fewer than 5,000 words and cinematics top out at roughly 12-and-a-half minutes. This means players are in control over 98% of the time in Astro Bot.</p><p dir="ltr">Making smaller games could also help rein in budgets for developers.

                <p>The Assassin's Creed Shadows development team at Ubisoft has released a heartfelt statement following the launch of the game.

The sheer amount of love and positivity we've received has been incredibly heartwarming," Ubisoft said. "Seeing your excitement, your thoughtful reactions, and your joy has meant the world to us. After years of hard work, there's nothing more rewarding than watching the community connect with what we've created."</p><p>Also in the post, Ubisoft said its staffers won't be able to reply directly to every message, but assured fans that "we're listening."</p><p>"The entire development team has been reading your posts--the celebrations, the feedback, the theories--and it's been inspiring. It fuels us. And it helps us keep improving," Ubisoft said. "Thank you for being part of this journey with us. This is just the beginning for Shadows, and we're thrilled to see the game evolve with you by our side."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1269742301" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Skater and former Jackass star Bam Margera will reportedly feature in Activision's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">upcoming Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 remake</a>, despite being omitted from the publisher's previously released skater roster - supposedly thanks to a last-minute intervention by Tony Hawk himself.
</p>
<p>
Margera made his series debut in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> back in 2001 and has appeared in all subsequent instalments. However, fans quickly noticed his absence when 3 + 4's skater line-up was unveiled earlier this month, with many speculating his omission may be related to the legal issues Margera has faced as a result of his struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, it's been claimed Margera will appear in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> remake after all - albeit as a last-minute addition at Tony Hawk's insistence. That's according to skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley, as <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/">spotted by VGC</a>.

"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a recent livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."
</p>
<p>
Activision hasn't yet commented on the claims, but its currently confirmed skater roster - which includes classic skaters and new additions - is as follows: Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, Bob Burnquist, Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kendrick-lamar-drake-anime-naruto-bleach-one-piece<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A year and some change ago, Atlanta rapper Future and producer Metro Boomin released their collaborative studio album "We Don’t Trust You." As is customary for rap album releases on streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music, the features on the album were not disclosed until a few days after its release to encourage listeners to experience the entire album rather than skip to an artist they fancy, like Travis Scott, The Weeknd, Playboi Carti, and Rick Ross (for his four die-hard fans). Today, it is difficult to recall the other featured artists on the album due to Kendrick Lamar’s "<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/future-metro-boomin-kendrick-lamar-like-that-number-one-hot-100-1234996590/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like That</a>" verse, which stole the spotlight and ignited a generational rap feud between him and Drake.</p><p>We all know what followed: the world rubbernecked from their day jobs to witness the pair drop eight diss tracks against each other between April and May. Many of the tracks dropped so suddenly that only the most unemployed of the music-listening public could rise to the occasion of playing the role of Paul Revere by posting "Kendrick dropped" whenever a new track released. Their hydrogen bomb vs coughing baby feud culminated with Lamar out-rapping the <em>Degrassi </em>star by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/kendrick-lamar-dominated-grammys-not-like-us-1236125989/#:~:text=With%20his%202024%20anthem%20%E2%80%9CNot,video%20and%20best%20rap%20performance." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winning multiple Grammys</a> for his final diss track "Not Like Us," <a href="https://www.nfl.com/videos/kendrick-lamar-s-full-apple-music-super-bowl-halftime-show" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlining the Super Bowl</a>, and getting a packed stadium to sing along to the Canadian rapper being a "<a href="https://x.com/hiphop_communit/status/1803618488696611110?t=t-m1idxOWP7fVqJ6B2Gw8w&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certified pedophile</a>" (<a href="https://x.com/cinesquetv/status/1888766681159283091?t=9VoZnH4MIsELJSMozIpNhQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twice</a>). It was, and forever will be, a good time to be a K Dot fan.&nbsp;</p><p>However, one unacknowledged aspect of Kendrick, Drake, and J. Cole's feud (until <a href="https://variety.com/2024/music/news/j-cole-7-minute-drill-removed-streaming-kendrick-lamar-diss-1235969657/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post-diss clarity hit him</a>, leading him to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/08/arts/music/jcole-kendrick-lamar-diss-apology.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apologize to Lamar</a> and duck out of the beef to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6818Dx0N9k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live a peaceful life</a>) is how one line in Lamar's "Like That" verse breathed life into a long-quelled feud in the anime community over which shonen series is the best of all time: <em>Naruto</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, or <em>One Piece</em>.</p><p>The bar in question was a response to J. Cole’s <a href="https://youtu.be/Xty2gi5cMa8?t=116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“First Person Shooter” verse</a> calling himself, Drake, and K Dot the big three in rap — a claim that’s pretty easy to accept in most rap circles. Lamar, ever the competitive rapper, took playful offense to that, saying, <a href="https://youtu.be/N9bKBAA22Go?t=110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Fuck the big three, it’s just big me.”</a> While the phrase is in reference to the trio, it also carries weight in anime circles as the term dedicated to <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Naruto</em>, and <em>Bleach</em> as the <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big three shonen series</a>. While greener anime fans often mistakenly treat the term as something that can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/vl0rof/the_new_big_three/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">usurped by newer series</a> like <em>Jujutsu </em>Kaisen or <em>Demon Slayer</em>, old heads have gatekept the adulation as a distinction that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can never be duplicated</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as anime fans heard K Dot’s big three bar, they knew <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBKQdJ/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peace among fandoms would be disrupted</a> once again with the resurgence of old internet forum debates. But this time, these debates happened on the new stage of the brainrot social media site TikTok, whose video editors took K Dot’s bar as a sleeper agent activation phrase and went wild making stylish AMVs centering either of the three anime as the one that was “really like that” while their contemporaries' best work was “a light pack.”&nbsp;</p><p>While the rap trio's beef was settled through their ability to craft scathing disses at each other's character, the anime big three TikTok beef was resolved by determining which fandom excelled in creating AMVs with their show as the superior series. The discourse evolved into the rappers being aptly personified as the three anime shows. Kendrick's anime persona was <em>One Piece</em>, as he has garnered an almost religious following of listeners who dedicate their lives to converting others to his fanbase despite the breadth of his discography being more politically charged and intimidatingly dense than his peers. (It also doesn't hurt that <a href="https://aftermath.site/luffy-one-piece-lakers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luffy reps Lamar's Los Angeles Lakers</a>.) Drake's anime persona was <em>Naruto </em>because he is the most popular of the three, garnering an all-encompassing reach thanks to the mass appeal of his songs servicing beginner rap listeners. This left <em>Bleach </em>as J. Cole’s anime persona, which was so uncannily appropriate one could almost call it fate. Like <em>Bleach</em>, J. Cole suffers from middle-child syndrome, often being left out of the conversation as the forerunner of the big three despite having a stylish flow of his own, even if he has not delivered a new flow or cadence in his rap performances since the trio broke into the rap scene over a decade ago.</p><p>Aside from stray anime AMVs, such as those featuring <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBtjSK/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>JJK </em></a>and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2n5HYVT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Ball Super</em></a>, TikTok video editors engaged in widespread friendly competition. My favorite AMVs had its heroes quip catchphrases after K Dot's “big three” bar, such as Naruto saying “baka,” Ichigo saying “bankai,” and Luffy giggling while hitting his Gear 5 pose. Like the Kendrick-Drake rivalry, TikTok AMVs quickly escalated, with <em>Naruto</em> fans readily admitting they were <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBsmwc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">getting their generous ramen-eating asses beaten</a> by the video editors behind <em>Bleach </em>and <em>One Piece</em>’s “Like That” edits outperforming their creative efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering who won the Anime Big Three contest of 2024, it was definitively <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBq82p/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em></a>. Not only did the anime’s supporters work harder on the video editing front, but they also provided empirical data, such as <em>One Piece</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_manga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more volumes worldwide</a> than the other series, as further proof of its superiority. They also cleverly utilized K Dot’s “Prince outlived Mike Jack” bar — comparing his influence to Drake’s comparing himself to Michael Jackson — to emphasize the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT2nBWdFV/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing series outliving <em>Bleach </em>and <em>Naruto</em></a>.</p><p>Did Kendrick Lamar know his <a href="https://youtu.be/NPqDIwWMtxg?t=85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“throw away”</a> big three bar would reignite an age-old anime beef through dueling AMVs at the same time as he was systematically dismantling his lesser? Probably not. But given his <a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/kendrick-lamar-goku-hey-new-mustard-1235885909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Goku-inspired scream </a>in his victory lap GNX track “TV Off,” I’d like to believe the reclusive rapper committed <a href="https://aftermath.site/taylor-swift-britney-spears-poptimism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taylor Swift levels of double entendres and deep-cut bars</a> with his lyrics just to feed the anime fans. I thank him for bringing out the competitive edge of AMV-makers for a new generation to pop out for their favorite series.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-story-yasuke-podcast-revie"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Is Impressive, But Does The Story Work?</h3></a><p>We love how Assassin's Creed Shadows looks and feels, but does it deliver on the story it seeks to tell?

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's upcoming survival MMO set in an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-mmo-will-let-players-team-up-with-characters-who-are-dead-in-the-book/1100-6511909/" data-ref-id="1100-6511909">alternate version of author Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi universe</a>, will buck the trend of many survival games by not launching in an early-access state when it arrives for PC on May 20. Nor will it have any kind of subscription fee, as some MMOs do.</p><p dir="ltr">Creative director Joel Bylos delivered the news in a recent video, diving into Funcom's post-launch plans for the sci-fi survival game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1B7G2SXBDc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q1B7G2SXBDc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"The key things that you need to know about Dune: Awakening's launch are that it will not launch in early access and it will not have a monthly subscription," Bylos said. "It will receive regular free updates, including new content, new features, and quality-of-life improvements."</p><p dir="ltr">Bylos went on to say that the game would also sell optional DLC, which will accompany each major free update and will be able to be bought piecemeal. A season pass that will include four post-launch DLCs will also be available.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening launching in 1.0 is somewhat of a rarity for the survival game genre, which more often than not sees games launch in an early-access state. Releasing in early access lets developers gather more player feedback and slowly add more content to the game over time before eventually launching in full, oftentimes with a price increase.</p><p dir="ltr">That won't be the case with Dune: Awakening, which was first announced to be in the works six years ago and has had multiple closed beta periods over the last year. While Dune: Awakening will launch in a complete state for $50, those willing to pay more will be able to play early as part of what Steam calls "advanced access." Players who buy the $70 or $90 editions of the game will be able to play Dune: Awakening starting five days early on May 15. Both of the game's more expensive additions come with the aforementioned season pass, as well as additional cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sure, this allows people to get into the game early," Bylos said. "But it also helps us to make sure we can balance the server load as people come into the game through launch for the best possible experience. Players who want the fresh start experience will still be able to play on new servers that will launch when the game launches on the 20th of May."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-designed-with-controller-in-mind-despite-launching-on-pc-first/1100-6529238/" data-ref-id="1100-6529238">actually designed with controllers in mind</a>, but will launch on PC first. A Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 version will come at a later date, which has yet to be announced.</p>

		<p>Paradox Interactive has announced that Stellaris Season 9 launches today with the Stargazer<br>
Species Portrait pack out right now. Following on from this release there will be a lot more coming along over the year including two expansions and another pack. That includes the BioGenesis Expansion on May 5th, the Shadows of the Shroud Expansion in Q3 2025, and and the Infernal Species pack in Q4 2025. The Stellaris Season 9 expansion pass is priced at $44.99/€44.99/£37.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellaris: Season 09 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mrj29R5Orw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The full details of the Stellaris Season 9 expansion are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>BioGenesis Expansion (May 5, 2025): Take command of the forces of life itself in BioGenesis. Engineer living ships, terraform entire ecosystems, and wield advanced genetic tools to shape the destiny of your empire. Will you create a utopia of adaptation and growth or weaponize biology to dominate the stars?</em></li>
<li><em>Shadows of the Shroud Expansion (Q3 2025): The psionic plane holds untold power—but at what cost? Shadows of the Shroud is a complete overhaul of the Psionic Ascension path, introducing new moral dilemmas, patron allegiances, and the ever- present temptation of ultimate destruction.</em></li>
<li><em>Infernals Species Pack (Q4 2025): Forge your destiny in the Infernals Species Pack. Adapted to relentless heat and volatile landscapes, you wield the power of extreme environments to reshape the galaxy.

</ul>
<p>Alongside the release of the BioGenesis Expansion will be the free Stellaris 4.0 “Phoenix update, and this will rework the Trade experience as well as adding new population and workforce groups. There has been some controversy around the development of recent Stellaris content, when Paradox Interactive confirmed it was using generative AI for in game assets, including the voice of an AI character.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/tech/634773/alienware-aw2725df-oled-gaming-monitor-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I’m still getting accustomed to seeing 27-inch 1440p QD-OLED gaming monitors for less than $700 — after all, it wasn’t long ago that they were retailing for around $1,000. So imagine the feeling of sticker shock (complimentary) to spot one of Alienware’s models with a fast 360Hz refresh rate for hundreds of dollars off, which is the case <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/apd/210-bljd" rel="sponsored">right now at Dell’s website</a>.</p><p>Originally $899.99, this monitor’s final price plunges to $599.99 when you use promo code <strong>AW27300 </strong>at checkout. With tax, my checkout total rang up to a cool $653.24. An OLED gaming monitor that costs less than a mid-range GPU? Hell yeah. At this price, there’s no need to wait for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date">Alienware’s forthcoming AW2725D</a>, which the company hopes (but isn’t promising) to launch for $549. It’ll have 1440p resolution with a 280Hz refresh rate, so it’s actually slower than Alienware’s discounted AW2725DF.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><p>The AW2725DF has a 360Hz refresh rate, 1440p resolution, and a decent PPI to ensure that text looks clear.</p></div></div><p>In terms of the specs, Alienware’s 27-inch AW2725DF sports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, plus support for VRR via either its HDMI 2.1 port or through either of its DisplayPort 1.4 ports. That’ll ensure that the screen looks smooth and tear-free, even during moments when the frame rate fluctuates wildly. While the panel can achieve up to a 360Hz refresh rate — equating to 360 visible frames per second, if your GPU can keep up — it’s only supported via the DisplayPort. Through HDMI 2.1, the monitor’s refresh rate tops out at a respectable 144Hz.</p><p>The AW2725DF has an anti-reflective coating, but since I haven’t used this exact display, I can’t vouch as to whether it’s fully matte or slightly on the glossy side (the<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623428/dell-alienware-oled-monitor-aw2725d-price-release-date"> newer AW2725Q</a> is more glossy than matte, in turn letting more contrast through). It has 111 pixels per inch (PPI), which should be enough clarity to avoid seeing pixelated text. A low PPI dampened my enthusiasm for other OLED monitors, including the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23509955/corsair-xeneon-flex-oled-gaming-monitor-features-price-hands-on">Corsair Xeneon Flex</a> that I reviewed in late 2022.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The series turns survivor’s guilt into a blood-soaked curse, punishing those who narrowly avoid tragedy with even more elaborate and grotesque ends. And what makes these deaths so chilling isn’t just the gore; it’s how often they begin with something stupidly mundane. A dropped ring. A spilled drink. A loose screw. These micro-moments cascade into horrifying Rube Goldberg machines of death, reminding us that fate doesn’t need a big reason, just a small opening. You survive the plane crash? Congratulations. Now your bathroom rug might kill you.</p><p>With the new film <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613?_gl=1*12jz979*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjYwNTMyMi4yMy4wLjE3NDI2MDUzMjQuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-destination-bloodlines-movie-trailer-1851754613?_gl=1*12jz979*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjYwNTMyMi4yMy4wLjE3NDI2MDUzMjQuNTguMC4w"><em>Final Destination: Bloodlines</em></a></span> on the way, it’s time to revisit the franchise’s most gruesome deaths, not just to relive the carnage, but to rank them by how likely they are to actually happen. A good portion of the most memorable <em>Final Destination </em>deaths are outrageous and defy any semblance of logic, while the most unforgettable ones are indelibly etched in our nightmares because of how they mirror freak accidents we’ve all read about in the news a little too closely. So say your prayers and maybe have a throw-up bucket next to you as we count down the 14 most gruesome <em>Final Destination</em> deaths, from the impossible to the frighteningly probable. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-recommend-id="image://d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-recommend-id="image://d17188136f8d163b2356f8cd87fd60f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man being strangled" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The bathtub strangulation in the original <em>Final Destination</em> is the franchise at its most implausibly clumsy. After slipping in the tub, Tod Waggner (Chad Donella) becomes entangled in a clothesline that coils around his neck with the perfect amount of force and positioning to strangle him—without snapping, slipping, or triggering any kind of instinctive reaction to save himself. The setup is slow and the death is awkward, relying on a wildly improbable Rube Goldberg sequence that stretches the rules of physics and common sense. Instead of dread, it plays like a parody of what the series does best: grounding the supernatural in the everyday.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-recommend-id="image://be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="255" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-recommend-id="image://be6889e4118cb9df1eb761a3579499ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="255" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man crawling for his life" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The hospital bathtub death in <em>The Final Destination</em> is easily one of the most ridiculous scenes in the entire franchise—an unintentional comedy of errors disguised as horror. Cowboy (Jackson Walker), recovering in a hospital bed, is suddenly crushed by a full-sized bathtub that crashes through the  ceiling after an upstairs unit floods. The idea that a hospital would have an upstairs bathtub, left overflowing long enough to rot the floor and drop it like an anvil, defies every rule of logic, architecture, and basic plumbing. It’s not tension—it’s pure cartoon. The scene sacrifices realism for spectacle so hard, it’s hard not to laugh even as blood sprays across the room.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-recommend-id="image://462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-recommend-id="image://462c748d3ba6d3bb5121d990e832c04d" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking to avoid danger" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The chain link fence death in <em>The Final Destination</em> is peak cartoon violence masquerading as horror. After a tire launch catapults a man into a fence, he’s instantly diced into neat chunks like CGI meat through a wire slicer. It’s flashy, sure—but so absurd it kills any sense of tension, trading plausibility for spectacle and leaving behind the eerie realism that usually makes the franchise hit harder.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-recommend-id="image://467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-format="webp" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-recommend-id="image://467da5bb45fe4c3b939bce5920af541a" data-format="webp" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Man gets head cut by engine" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There aren’t many deaths in the <em>Final Destination</em> franchise that are as hilariously over-the-top as the engine fan kill in <em>Final Destination 3</em>. It plays out like a fever dream of mechanical chaos—an improbable chain reaction involving a falling wrench and an absurdly unstable shelf somehow launches an engine fan across the room with the precision and force of a cannonball. A full-speed headshot that turns a mechanic’s skull into splatter art is how the scene flatly ends. It’s ridiculous not just in execution but in concept, abandoning any pretense of realism in favor of pure shock value. The scene is memorable, sure—but only because it feels like a scene that escaped from a spoof.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-recommend-id="image://ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="801" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-recommend-id="image://ecd0519d6d8f9012d32ca35cdf2b2176" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="801" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eye surgery gone wrong" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a film franchise built on domino-effect demises, the laser eye surgery death in <em>Final Destination 5</em> begins with an unnerving sense of believability. A routine LASIK procedure is already loaded with vulnerability—strapped to a table, unable to blink, a literal laser inches from the cornea. It’s the kind of scenario that taps into real-world anxiety, and for a few moments, the film plays it straight: a malfunctioning machine, a distracted technician, a minor tremor of instability. But just as the audience settles into the discomfort of what could be a grounded medical mishap, the sequence careens into pure ridiculousness. A flailing escape attempt leads to a misstep, sending the victim crashing through a skyscraper window to a glass-shattering death on the pavement below. It’s a tonal nosedive—from claustrophobic tension to Looney Tunes physics. While the laser to the eye flirts with genuine dread, the swan dive into a plate-glass finale reminds us this isn’t a cautionary tale—it’s cinematic chaos wrapped in a thin sheet of plausibility.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-recommend-id="image://e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-format="jpg" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-recommend-id="image://e4956bb1bd28c74537372df11a591054" data-format="jpg" data-width="740" data-height="494" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Man Stranding With A Decapitated Head" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The shrapnel decapitation in <em>Final Destination 5</em> is completely ridiculous—an industrial-strength physics-defying moment where a bolt somehow triggers a pressure blast strong enough to launch a metal shard with sniper-like precision through someone’s neck. It’s over-the-top even by the franchise’s standards, but oddly, it flirts with realism just enough to not feel entirely out of place. In the world of <em>Final Destination</em>, where death has a flair for the theatrical, this one feels like it <em>could</em> almost happen…if every safety protocol failed and the laws of physics decided to no longer matter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-recommend-id="image://87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-recommend-id="image://87331c285ceae8cde840dd6eec0da942" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="338" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman impaled by a flagpole" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the chaos-courting universe of <em>Final Destination 3</em>, the flagpole impalement stands out as a moment in which coincidence wears a clown mask and performs a high-wire act. After a runaway roller coaster premonition sets fate on a kill streak, one unlucky teen finds herself at the mercy of a derailed parade float, slippery asphalt, and gravity’s cruel sense of humor. The scene hinges on a series of increasingly far-fetched missteps: a rogue truck causes a flag to snap loose, the pole arcs through the air like a javelin of doom, and—against all odds—finds its mark mid-tumble. It’s less “freak accident” and more “physics-defying murder ballet,” the kind of kill that asks you to suspend not just disbelief, but every principle of probability. Still, buried beneath the theatrical absurdity is a kernel of nightmare fuel: the idea that a simple misstep in a seemingly harmless environment—a community celebration, no less—could end in such grotesque finality. Realistic? Only if you assume Murphy’s Law had a vendetta that day. But in the world of <em>Final Destination</em>, that’s just another Tuesday.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-recommend-id="image://14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-format="webp" data-width="680" data-height="382" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-recommend-id="image://14d34b8eac34440b539cfea6832a62cb" data-format="webp" data-width="680" data-height="382" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman dying from tanning bed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The tanning bed death in <em>Final Destination 3</em> is a perfect storm of teenage vanity, dumb luck, and over-the-top horror theatrics. Two high school girls, looking for a golden glow, end up slow-roasting inside malfunctioning tanning booths after a series of mundane mishaps—spilled drinks, a fallen coat, and a jammed door—combine into a lethal trap. The scene is pure sensory overload: crackling heat, blaring pop music, and the eerie glow of UV lights bathing their panic in an almost surreal glow. On the surface, it’s outrageous—like a twisted parody of the dangers of self-care. But beneath the chaos is a sliver of real-world dread. Tanning beds have sparked fires before, electrical systems <em>can</em> fail, and the claustrophobic idea of being trapped with no way out is a universal fear. It’s absurd, yes, but with just enough plausibility to make you think twice the next time you step into a machine that locks from the outside.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-recommend-id="image://b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="272" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-recommend-id="image://b37268527207f7c2bf08d0405002fd2e" data-format="webp" data-width="640" data-height="272" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man's head being crushed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Amid the Rube Goldberg-level madness that defines <em>Final Destination 5</em>, the acupuncture fire death manages to be both absurdly over-the-top and uncomfortably grounded. A man, fresh from a tension-relieving acupuncture session, becomes the victim of a freak chain reaction involving spilled alcohol, a knocked-over candle, and a faulty massage table. It’s ludicrous in design—watching a human pincushion flail around a burning room before being impaled by a collapsing shelf almost plays like dark comedy. And yet, there’s a sliver of plausibility buried under the spectacle: open flames, flammable liquids, and precariously stacked furniture are real hazards. Strip away the theatrics, and you’re left with a scenario that could feasibly make its way into a fire department safety PSA. It’s death by coincidence dialed up to eleven, but it still taps into that primal fear of small mistakes snowballing into catastrophe, and a cautionary tale on why you should never stack heavy objects too high up on a shelf.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-recommend-id="image://eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="974" data-height="408" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-recommend-id="image://eeff67a6752002edd62e8dc9503c4c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="974" data-height="408" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman with a rock in his eye" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Among the franchise’s catalog of elaborate fatalities, the rock-through-the-eye death in <em>The Final Destination</em> stands out for how terrifyingly ordinary it is. A woman, seated casually at a racetrack, becomes an instant casualty when a rogue tire launches a rock that punctures her skull with surgical precision. There’s no suspenseful orchestration or theatrical flair—just a flash of chaos that turns into silence. It’s the kind of moment that feels ripped from a real news headline, a split-second tragedy born of nothing more than unlucky timing and brutal physics. The realism is what makes it linger, reminding viewers that not every horror needs build-up—sometimes, it just happens.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-recommend-id="image://7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-format="webp" data-width="720" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-recommend-id="image://7a5b9ec7aa28860789f2f7616210531f" data-format="webp" data-width="720" data-height="480" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Young boy looking through glass" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Few deaths in the <em>Final Destination</em> series feel as shockingly mundane—and thus unforgettable—as the glass pane kill in <em>Final Destination 2</em>. Tim Carpenter (James Kirk) doesn’t die in some elaborate deathtrap or fiery explosion; he’s crushed in broad daylight by a falling sheet of glass that appears almost out of nowhere. There’s no time to process, no final words—just the deafening crash and the horrifying silence that follows. What makes it so haunting is how easy it is to imagine in real life. Construction mishaps happen. People walk under scaffolding every day. It’s quick, brutal, and indifferent, and that’s exactly why it sticks with you long after the credits roll.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-recommend-id="image://cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-recommend-id="image://cc9197e5765f6ed368f23eaefe3a6dc3" data-format="webp" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woman walking backwards into the street" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The death of Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer) in the original <em>Final Destination</em> is burned into pop culture not because of gore or buildup, but because it feels like something that could happen tomorrow—and probably will. There’s no dramatic score, no final scream, just a bitter argument cut short by a city bus that turns her into a smear on the pavement. The suddenness is the point. Unlike the franchise’s usual mousetrap mechanics, this death doesn’t warn you, it reminds you. It’s fast, brutal, and so grounded in reality that for years, people flinch when standing too close to the curb.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-recommend-id="image://4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->New Line Cinema</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-recommend-id="image://4abb88b735e0030244266ae6d57d7384" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gymnast preparing for practice" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you ever wanted to know why Simone Biles is often considered the greatest Olympian of all time, you can just watch the grim reality of gymnastics displayed in <em>Final Destination 5</em>. Typically, the <em>Final Destination </em>trope of a loose screw or tipped-over cup of water starting a lethal domino effect reduces the deaths that follow to exaggerated murder fantasies. Here, gymnast Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe), fresh off surviving the North Bay Bridge collapse, is swinging on the uneven bars when she gets blinded by the chalk dust blasted in her eye, the result of a fellow gymnast knocking it over after stepping on a falling screw. Unable to gain her balance in mid-air, she falls on her neck, snapping her spine, and dying with her legs twisted over hear ears. In gymnastics, precision isn’t only necessary for entertainment, but also for safety. Only one <em>Final Destination </em>death has felt closer to reality than this iconic one.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cf6a2070ea49911bab5748caf250cb2" data-recommend-id="image://5cf6a2070ea49911bab5748caf250cb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="316" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Police afraid of an incoming log" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Police afraid of an incoming log" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

From there, a motorcyclist gets pinned to death between one of the logs and the bike he flew off of, a driver who survived their car flipping over is instantly set on fire when a truck comes barreling through, and waves of other drivers are killed.
