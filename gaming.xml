<p>A new FAQ from Playground Games has revealed that to play Forza Horizon 5 on the PlayStation 5, players will need a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>The news, which has started to be picked up online (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XboxEra</a>), shows in the <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/03/08/a-microsoft-account-will-be-required-to-play-forza-horizon-5-on-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> that the upcoming port will require a Microsoft account.</p>



<p>It reads, ‚ÄúQ: Do I need a Microsoft account to play Forza Horizon 5 on PlayStation 5?‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúAnswer: A: Yes, in addition to a PSN account you‚Äôll need to link to a Microsoft account in order to play Forza Horizon 5 on PS5. This process begins the first time you start up the game on your console.‚Äù</p>



<p>This isn‚Äôt the first time that an Xbox game coming to the PlayStation 5 has required an account, though, so this isn‚Äôt new. A Microsoft account is needed for the likes of Sea of Thieves and similarly, even for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft.</p>



<p>So fear not, this isn‚Äôt a new requirement just for Forza Horizon. However, we have contacted Xbox in the hopes to receive comment to clear the air just in case this was a mistake. Should clarification be given, we‚Äôll update the article.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 is set to release for the PlayStation 5 on April 25, 2025.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Forza Horizon 5 for the PS5? Let us know down below, and in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-turned-hans-capon-into-a-superstar-streamer-in-one-month.1129101/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hans-capon-superstar-streamer-kingdom-come/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 was released little more than a month ago, storming up the charts and becoming known far and wide as a contender for many Game of the Year awards. It stunned players with its depth, visual splendour, and intense realism, and with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense roadmap ahead</a>, the game has plenty of life left in its medieval lungs.</p>



<p>Since Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 hit the market, one of the game‚Äôs most prolific actors, Luke ‚ÄòLordHansCapon‚Äô Dale, has positively exploded. He has become a superstar streamer in a matter of weeks, pulling in and retaining an audience and securing solid accolades in no time at all.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-content-fit-for-a-lord">Content Fit for a Lord</h2>



<p>Luke Dale portrays Hans Capon in the Kingdom Come universe, and he‚Äôs front and centre as the game kicks off, with many of the second title‚Äôs most pivotal moments revolving around his existence. In the first game, which dropped back in 2018, he was someone to be hated, but in KCD2, he‚Äôs a lovable rogue who you‚Äôll go to great lengths to keep safe.</p>



<p>In the days that followed the launch of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on February 4, Dale kickstarted a streaming campaign that saw his popularity levels skyrocket across Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>In January 2025, the talented actor streamed the first Kingdom Come title in anticipation of the follow-up, netting a peak viewer count of around 350 viewers. Little more than two weeks later, he was picking up peak figures of 20,000 viewers. In one post on social media, Dale revealed he was in the 0.01% of streamers on Twitch by numbers alone.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Dang. I‚Äôm in the top 0.01% of streamers in the world ü´∂ 

Shall we get to number 1? </span><a href="https://twitter.com/KaiCenat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@KaiCenat</a><span> I‚Äôm coming for you bro üëä </span></p></article></div>







<p>It didn‚Äôt end there, though.</p>



<p>Luke Dale, who went so far as to get a Kingdom Come tattoo while live, went from 32,000 subscribers on YouTube when the game dropped to 102,000 subscribers at the time of writing. He racked up 15,000 followers on Twitch in around two weeks and managed to secure a Twitch Partner spot after streaming Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 just <strong>eight times</strong>.</p>



<p>Before 2025, he‚Äôd streamed just three times, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/channels/lordhanscapon/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">according to StreamsCharts</a>. That‚Äôs one hell of a hot streak.</p>



<p>It helps that Dale is genuinely a nice guy with a penchant for performing, and his role as Hans Capon in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is fantastic and bursting with clippable, quality sequences.</p>



<p>If you want to follow Luke Dale‚Äôs latest streams, you can find him on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LordHansCapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/lordhanscapon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a>.</p>

            <p>Players have blasted NetEase for a perceived lack of moderation across Marvel Rival lobbies.</p>
<p>"Forget about loser queue, I want to get out of racist queue," wrote redditor Murkwan on the official Marvel Rivals subreddit. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/forget_about_loser_queue_i_want_to_get_out_of//">post</a> has since been locked and deleted, but not before securing 1400 likes and almost 500 comments, the majority of which agreed with the OP.</p>

<p>Whilst many players seem to get grief merely for playing certain characters (primarily Jeff the Landshark), others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk7gf9/">say</a> they regularly hear racist and sexist slurs, but "haven't gotten a ban notification for weeks" even when they report offending players (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-racism-no-username-moderation-called-out/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>"The problem is that this takes a toll on you," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgj7stz/">explained one player</a>, responding to a suggestion that players should "mute, report, block" and move on.</p>
<p>"As a woman, I don't use mic unless with my friends. If I speak with random teammates I'll always get some insult or disgusting comment. I just ignore, report and block, but it's not nice at all. It's not like 'haha what a loser'. First time maybe. The third game you hear something like that you just want to stop playing even if you love the game.</p>
<p>"So in cases of racism, it's the same," they added. "Yeah, ignore those losers, but reading or hearing insults over and over again makes you really want to not play anymore."</p>
<p>"I'm sick of people telling women what they need to do to counter the harassment they're experiencing like that's their job," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgk4gxa/">added</a> another respondent. "That's just the digital version of telling women not to dress some specific way or they're 'asking for it'."</p>
<p>Black players also contributed to the thread, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjh1br/">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgjornc/">admitting</a> "comms stay off with randoms" completely, even in ranked play.</p>
<p>Other players have taken to X/Twitter, with this commenter writing: "Seriously?? MarvelRivals, wheres the moderation??" asked one player, including a <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878646544142086654">screenshot</a> of a grossly antisemetic username. "Big fan of the game but seeing this mid game is gross."</p>
<p>"Its even worse [because] I can't leave the match without being penalised and having my own gameplay experience suffer, so I just have to play with this person," they <a href="https://x.com/comicyehu/status/1878647306997952674">added</a>.</p>
<p>"When you think about it, it's even weirder when it's in a Marvel game," said u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1j5qv1r/comment/mgkeiwq/">fistfightcrash</a>.</p>
<p>"Stan Lee was pretty clear that what the X-men was originally about was the civil rights movement. This is a Stan Lee quote from the 60s:</p>
<p>'Let's lay it right on the line. Bigotry and racism are among the deadliest social ills plaguing the world today. It's totally irrational, patently insane to condemn an entire race.'</p>
<p>"If you're racist, how could you possibly think this is your space?" they concluded. "Unless you're real old, Marvel was probably vocally anti-racist before you were born."</p>
<p>We've reached out to NetEase for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, NetEase <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-team-hit-by-layoffs-despite-major-launch-success">cut jobs at its US-based Marvel Rivals creative team</a>, despite the game's significant success, claiming the decision was made to "optimise development efficiency". It also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">insisted it "has not wavered in its global expansion plans"</a> amid reports it's unloading "as much as all" of its overseas game companies due to rising costs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On top of this, the game also has a <em>Paper Mario</em>-like timing mechanic to make that combat about more than just picking which attacks and items you use during a turn. Sandfall Interactive is cooking with some excellent ingredients, and the small taste I‚Äôve gotten has me eager to try the full meal. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-preview-turn-based-1851767119">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-recommend-id="image://61efc76c19ac41e8c7ec2de22c65183d" data-format="png" data-width="1219" data-height="685" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Suikoden 1 and 2 protagonists stand at attention.

<p>Update 3 - expected to go live on 20th March - includes a new tutorial and Act 1 Career levels coming in Sandbox Mode, random rotation and scaling for scenery items, the return of the Vector Inverting Suspended coaster from the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a> game, improved staff and guest behaviour, and "a bucket-load of flume improvements".</p>

<p>That's not all, either - Update 3 also brings the "highly-requested" return of the Western theme.</p>
<p>As for Update 4? Frontier's still being coy, but so far it's revealed players will able to build their own restaurants in which you'll have to "satisfy multiple guest needs and tolerances", Frontier Workshop extra features such as a Featured Creators list, alerts, and a What's Hot list, plus career maps in Sandbox mode in Act 2.</p> <div>

<p>We can also expect stock coasters (part 3), an as-yet-unannounced additional ride, plus "franchise mode improvements" and "ongoing stability and performance enhancements". Expect more details as we get closer to April.</p>
<p>The theme park sim sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2s-first-paid-dlc-releases-today-alongside-major-update">received its first major free update back in December</a>, alongside its first paid DLC, whilst <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-roadmap-outlined-bringing-more-rides-and-continued-performance-improvements">February introduced new features like custom video billboards, custom speakers, synchronised coasters, and interchangeable coaster cars</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/625881/suikoden-remasters-classic-rpgs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Suikoden</em> is a game that I‚Äôve been meaning to play for years. A highly regarded roleplaying game from the original PlayStation era, it‚Äôs renowned for its sprawling storyline and huge cast of playable characters. That also makes it pretty intimidating, and I‚Äôve had a copy sitting on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24121232/sony-playstation-vita-steam-deck-switch">my PS Vita</a> just waiting for when I might have the free time to finally dig in. After all that waiting, I‚Äôm now playing a new remastered collection that includes the first two games in the series instead. And it made me realize that, for the past several months, my personal gaming time has been dominated by classic, turn-based RPGs ‚Äî an experience that has really made clear the genre‚Äôs realm of possibilities.</p><p>It started with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">excellent new version of <em>Dragon Quest 3</em></a>, which launched last November. That game was the equivalent of video game comfort food: an exceedingly straightforward fantasy adventure that has been spruced up with gorgeous visuals, a lush orchestral soundtrack, and some very welcome quality of life tweaks. Soon after that, Mistwalker released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24312363/fantasian-xbox-ps5-switch-pc-launch-hironobu-sakaguchi">an updated version of <em>Fantasian</em></a>. It‚Äôs technically not an old game ‚Äî it originally <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad">debuted on Apple Arcade</a> in 2021 ‚Äî but it has the soul of one, with <em>Final Fantasy</em> creator Hironobu Sakaguchi using it as a way to explore new ideas in presentation and combat. Then, to top it all off, the ‚Äúpixel remaster‚Äù version of the very first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295537/final-fantasy-4-apple-arcade"><em>Final Fantasy</em> hit Apple Arcade</a> in January.</p><p>These were all games I had played before, but digging through them again in quick succession made me appreciate their strengths. <em>DQ3</em> and <em>FF</em> embody a true sense of adventure. Both have straightforward stories that are easy to follow (or ignore, if you don‚Äôt care about that sort of thing) but locations and systems that make venturing into towns, dungeons, and the wider world exciting. <em>DQ3</em> made that type of experience incredibly approachable, with its beautiful new presentation and streamlined gameplay, while I‚Äôve discovered that <em>FF</em> is quite possibly the ideal mobile game: something deep enough to keep me engaged but also an experience where it still feels like you‚Äôre making progress when you only have a short window to play.</p><p><em>Fantasian</em>, meanwhile, is like a modern reinterpretation of what a classic turn-based RPG could be. In a lot of ways, it‚Äôs classic <em>FF</em>, from the amnesiac protagonist to the the world that‚Äôs a mix between fantasy and sci-fi. But it also has some clever twists on the formula, like battles that let you aim attacks and a tool for delaying random battles for when you just want to explore. This is all on top of the headline-grabbing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi">visuals made of real-world dioramas</a>. And while I‚Äôm only a few hours into playing <em>Suikoden</em> for the first time, I‚Äôve already been struck by the ambition of its storytelling, which manages to cram a lot of political intrigue into the confines of a traditional RPG structure.</p><p>That‚Äôs all to say that even at a time when there‚Äôs plenty of impressive, big, and modern RPGs like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/611255/avowed-review-xbox-pc"><em>Avowed</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24307786/dragon-age-the-veilguard-full-review"><em>Dragon Age</em></a>, there‚Äôs still something distinct and interesting about the classic turn-based formula, and it‚Äôs exciting to see all the ways that various studios have utilized it over the years. That‚Äôs true whether you‚Äôre replaying a new version of something old or, like me, trying out <em>Suikoden</em> for the very first time. Even better: there‚Äôs still more to come. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24350575/hironobu-sakaguchi-interview-fantasian-neo-dimension">Sakaguchi told me</a> earlier this year, when it comes to his studio‚Äôs next game, their ‚Äúgoal is to create something old but new at the same time.‚Äù</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Buckle up, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a>'s Bleasdale House has had a terrifyingly good makeover.</p>
<p>The farmhouse - one of the first maps to launch with the hit horror in 2020 - gets a whole new look with 10th March's update. With 21 rooms spread across two floors and an attic space, developer Kinetic games said, "Bleasdale is an ideal location for budding ghost hunters to settle in for a potentially horrifying evening".</p>

<p>Following "major alterations", the house now boasts an all-new layout, brand new areas - including a new tea room and trophy room - and a new visual design, although the fan-favourite touches, such as the fireplace, piano, and loop-friendly dining table remain.</p>
<p>"The new dining room will be larger than before, and plays host to a large dining table in the centre, with lots of fragile new items for ghosts to play with," Kinetic teased. "The living room will feature a large fireplace, a grand piano, and some plush red leather sofas, perfect to hide the bloodstains for a cozy night in.</p>

            <p>Parents have filed a proposed class-action lawsuit against <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games for allegedly creating "the illusion of scarcity" and "FOMO" with its store items.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">Polygon</a>, two parents have filed <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/836523849/Epic-Games-Fortnite-Item-Shop-proposed-class-action">a claim with a San Francisco court</a> on behalf of their children, citing "deceptive practices employed on a massive scale in one of the world‚Äôs most popular video games [Fortnite]".</p>

<p>"Some items, such as the ultra-rare Renegade Raider outfit, were offered briefly and have not been offered in more than six years," lawyers wrote. "Others disappear only to reappear weeks later. These offerings and their schedules are subjects of intense interest to Fortnite players."</p>
<p>Taking issue with how the Fortnite Store rotates items on its digital storefront, the complaint reads:</p>
<p>"But, when their countdown timers expired, Fortnite‚Äôs Item Shop products did not disappear or return to full price. They remained available for purchase, often at the same purportedly discounted rate, for many days or even weeks at a time. This was an unlawful scheme.</p>
<p>"Fake sales with made-up expiration times are deceptive and illegal under state statutes proscribing unfair and deceptive trade practices, which prohibit misleading advertisements concerning the reasons for or existence of price reductions and representing that items have characteristics or qualities they do not have. Numerous courts have found that fake countdown timers like Epic‚Äôs run afoul of these and similar prohibitions."</p>
<p>This is likely referring to a similar lawsuit in the Netherlands. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games is currently appealing a ‚Ç¨1.1m (¬£968k) fine levied by the Dutch consumer regulator</a>, which similarly accused the company of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children". At the time of writing, that decision is still pending.</p>
<p>In a statement to press, Epic Games said: "This complaint contains factual errors and does not reflect how Fortnite operates. <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/new-and-upcoming-fortnite-shop-and-locker-changes">Last year we removed the countdown timer in the Item Shop</a> and we offer protections against unwanted purchases. This includes a <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/updates-to-fortnite-purchase-cancellation-and-social-settings">hold-to-purchase mechanic</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">instant purchase cancellations</a>, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_Fortnite/c-Fortnite_Billingandpayment/how-to-refund-or-return-item-shop-purchases-in-fortnite-a000084707">self service returns for shop purchases</a> and an explicit yes/no choice to save payment information.</p>
<p>"When a player creates an Epic account and indicates they are under 13, they are unable to make real money purchases until a parent provides consent. Once they do, we offer industry leading parental controls including PIN protecting purchases. We will fight these claims."</p>
<p>Earlier this week we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-maker-suing-prolific-thief-who-stole-and-sold-player-accounts-on-an-industrial-scale">Epic Games is suing a player accused of stealing and selling countless user accounts</a>, and profiting further by flogging details of his tactics to other wannabe thieves.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/622113/mainframes-review-steam-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>MainFrames</em> is a perfect example of a game with a clever idea that doesn‚Äôt overstay its welcome.</p><p>In the new indie platformer, you play as an adorable floppy disk that traverses computer desktops. The aesthetic is ridiculously charming: the many characters sprinkled throughout the game are<em> so dang cute</em>, and the levels are filled with application windows and desktop icons that serve as bouncing pads or gears to change things in the levels. Everything is overlaid on pixelated landscape computer backgrounds that differ between worlds. And it‚Äôs all backed by a catchy chiptune soundtrack that really sells the vibe.</p><p>It‚Äôs a great premise, and <em>MainFrames</em> takes the idea one step further by regularly letting you manipulate computer windows by clicking or dragging them like you would with an actual mouse. So, for example, if you can‚Äôt reach a far-off ledge, you might be able to hop onto a computer window with a platform and drag that window over to the ledge so you can reach it. You‚Äôll also ‚Äúselect‚Äù certain windows to activate functions like flipping gravity.</p><p>Over the course of the game, you‚Äôll take on progressively more difficult platforming puzzles that require precisely timed jumps and manipulating windows in various ways. There are lots of different approaches for exploring each level, and it‚Äôs worth combing through them to see as much as you can. One of my favorite sections had me retrieving tissues for a clock with a cold. A few times, I ran into a coffee cup making coffee at a coffee machine. Once, I even stumbled on a photo memorializing somebody‚Äôs dog.</p><p>Some of the platforming puzzles are quite difficult. But when you fail a jump or run into an obstacle, you respawn right away, so it‚Äôs easy to throw yourself at a challenge as many times as you need to beat it. I was able to skip through some rooms by being smart about where I was jumping, and while I felt pretty proud of myself, I have a hunch the game‚Äôs developers intentionally designed some of those shortcuts. You can also turn on accessibility features like invincibility or infinite jumps to breeze through anything you just can‚Äôt get past, and I‚Äôm not ashamed to admit that I did so for a handful of areas near the end of the game. </p><p>While playing <em>MainFrames</em>, I kept drawing comparisons to <em>Celeste</em>. Both are smart platformers with great vibes that can get pretty tough, but because reloads are so quick, repeated failures don‚Äôt sting too badly. And both games feel like they play out their ideas exactly as far as they need to. I rolled credits on <em>MainFrames</em> in a little under four hours, and the experience felt just right.</p><p><sub>MainFrames<em> is now available on Nintendo Switch and PC.</em></sub></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In fact, you might have to go back to 2002‚Äôs <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>to find another first-person fantasy role-playing game that so utterly captivated me with its world. I‚Äôve seen some people grouse that it‚Äôs not as full-featured as the likes of <em>Skyrim</em>, but I actually <em>like </em>that about it! Developer Obsidian knew what it wanted to achieve with this game and focused its resources where they mattered most: on creating a world that‚Äôs fun and rewarding to explore; on developing combat that‚Äôs hard-hitting and offers all kinds of player agency; and on a narrative that has deeply developed themes, expressive choices, and the potential to experience significant consequences. I didn‚Äôt realize just how significant until I failed to prevent a catastrophe in the game‚Äôs second area, and you know what? I‚Äôm glad I made this huge mistake.
