            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186503/super-monkey-ball-hack-gaming-controller-tom-tilley<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gamers could get an edge in Sega’s<em> Super Monkey Ball </em>with the help of a unique DIY controller: a <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1805790393927450683">literal monkey in a ball</a> that can be physically rolled around instead of mashing a joystick on a gamepad.</p><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> requires players to tilt and roll a series of complex floating platforms to control the monkey’s movements, so Sega designed the original arcade versions of the game with an oversize trackball controller.</p><p>That wasn’t carried over to the console versions of the game, and since arcade machines typically cost thousands of dollars, developer <a href="https://tomtilley.net/">Tom Tilley</a> decided to design and build a much cheaper solution made from recycled and 3D-printed materials. “I am a software developer, but I worked for about eight years as a fax and cellular phone technician in the late 80’s, so I have some small amount of electronics knowledge that comes in handy with this sort of thing,” Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Tilley, now a software developer in Australia, spent almost 10 years lecturing at a university while living in Thailand, where they also ran a class that challenged students to come up with unique alternatives to game controllers.</p><p>It was there that the idea for a giant trackball made from random recycled parts, an optical mouse, and a basketball, came to fruition. A base made from cardboard holds the basketball in place and allows it to freely roll in all directions with the help of three salvaged roll-on deodorant containers that serve as plastic bearings. Beneath the ball sits an inverted optical mouse upgraded with another deodorant bearing that rolls whenever the ball does, making it easier for the mouse’s sensor to detect its movements.</p><p>The original version of the trackball was built to play a 1986 Japanese arcade game called <em>Armadillo Racing</em>, but it has since been modified by Tilley to play other games, including <a href="https://x.com/DrTomTilley/status/1613846131175469057"><em>Katamari Damacy,</em> with a soccer ball</a>. Using it to play the Nintendo GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> through emulation required an additional modification, Tilley told <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>A 3D-printed recreation of the game’s main character, a monkey named AiAi, rides inside a transparent plastic sphere on a weighted wheeled base that keeps him upright at all times. It’s a charming upgrade, but the clear plastic created a new problem. The sphere’s smooth finish didn’t offer enough friction to move the deodorant roller on the mouse. To fix that, Tilley had to swap that part out for a small rubber ball rolling on metal bearings so the mouse’s optical sensor could detect AiAi’s movements.</p><p>To make the GameCube version of <em>Super Monkey Ball </em>work with a DIY trackball, Tilley uses a scripting tool called <a href="https://andersmalmgren.github.io/FreePIE/">FreePIE</a> (Programmable Input Emulator) that inverts the signals coming from the mouse and maps them to a virtual joystick that’s compatible with the emulator software.</p><p>The first new game in the <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> series in a decade releases on the Nintendo Switch this week. If Tilley can make the DIY trackball work with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/27/24142562/cant-wait-to-be-top-banana"><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em></a>, he just might dominate the game’s multiplayer mode.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> consultant and former Dragon Age executive producer Mark Darrah has published a Youtube video addressing the question: "why do AAA games take so long?" It's a tidy 25 minutes or so, and gets a fair way into the weeds of a variety of topics, from the current enthusiasm for live service "forever games" over 'finite', narrative-led affairs, to the "misleading" announcement of highly-demanded sequels years before they enter full production, in order to pump up a publisher's brand during a dry spell.</p>
<p>One thing I wanted to fish out and drop on your plate is Darrah's discussion of what he terms "the fidelity death cult" - that is, the desire for ever greater levels of lifelike visual detail and "intricacy".</p><!--more-->

<p>"We are also in a period of something I've called the fidelity death cult,"  Darrah explains in the vid, around the eight minute mark. "where a lot of games are trying for hyper-realistic art styles, hyper-high fidelity, hyper-customisation, hyper-intricacy. These things, while they don't contribute to a larger size, while they don't help you make a forever game, they still take a lot more time. When you are concerned about the way people's hair moves on their back, that's going to take time that you in the past wouldn't have done. You would have just spray-painted their hairdo on, or given them a hair cap, or something pretty static. Now, you're introducing new avenues of complexity."</p>
<p>He extends the point to encompass player dislike of things in games they consider to have been "recycled", from chunks of recurring environment to animation systems. "Similarly, we currently see from players quite a bit of pushback on the reuse of systems and assets, so even though I might be making a sequel to a game that came out just a couple of years ago, I might feel within the dev team that we can't reuse any of our assets, because we're going to get pushback from the players. And so while I might have been able to reuse some of those animations, or some of those models, or some of those areas, I might feel the need to recreate them to avoid that backlash. So I'm introducing additional time into the development process that otherwise would have allowed the game to come out sooner."</p>
<p>Interestingly, Darrah notes that while the emphasis on giving players endless things to do, access and consume in "forever games" reflects audience research showing that this makes the game more enticing, the "fidelity death cult" and avoidance of asset reuse comes "more from a fear of backlash, as opposed to any more specific research that says that this is necessary". He suggests that prioritising original asset creation and fidelity is "a trap that dev teams are kind of laying upon themselves", pointing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> as the "perfect example" of a game that has gotten away with downplaying "minor visual fidelity things that at the end of the day, often don't matter that much".</p>
<p>That the creed of ever-quantifiably-higher fidelity sponges up a lot of time and energy without really adding anything to games is a familiar argument, but always worth repeating. To slide into a bit of journalist navel-gazing, I'll add that games that valorise fidelity for its own sake can be boring to write about, albeit partly because enthusiast readerships tend to want us to write about them in a certain way.</p>
<p>The associated traditions of realism and photorealism are, in themselves, complex, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/photorealism-is-crucial">exciting</a> and evolving, but within video game culture, those traditions are typically boiled down to numbers and buzzwords - higher polygon counts, more animated objects per scene, more lens flare per NPC tear, with a corresponding need for more potent, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/examining-the-game-industrys-hidden-impacts-on-climate-change/">dirtier</a> pieces of hardware to run games on. Mind you, if there's a preference for interpreting realism and photorealism this way, that reflects the audience tastes that both "AAA" developers and journalists have cultivated for themselves over the decades, by consenting to the whim of the marketing machine. I've written my share of articles about higher resolutions and posh new species of shader. One thing I'd like to ask Darrah is: how exactly should blockbuster game developers unravel the "fidelity death cult"? How should they persuade more tech-devoted players to get over the sight of some sprayed-on hair?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186644/dead-rising-remaster-capcom-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9ZEfZk">Capcom is giving the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/5/14178650/dead-rising-dead-rising-2-off-the-record-guide-strategy"><em>Dead Rising</em></a> a new remaster, the publisher announced Wednesday in a surprise teaser trailer for <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> — or <em>DR DR</em>. The remastered version of <em>Dead Rising</em> will be available for “the newest generation of platforms,” according to the trailer, likely meaning PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p id="Nc0n0y">Details on <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> are scant, but the remastered game will launch sometime this year, Capcom says in the trailer. The teaser promises an “updated release with a brand-new look.” Indeed, freelance photojournalist Frank West looks completely remodeled — and sounds like he’s sporting a new voice actor. The town of Willamette, Colorado looks much crisper, more detailed, and more overridden with zombies.</p>
<p id="wet5lh"><em>Dead Rising</em>, like the original <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/19/7550887/resident-evil-hd-remaster-review-pc-xbox-one-ps4-playstation-4-360-3"><em>Resident Evil</em></a>, draws inspiration from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23784627/best-zombie-movie-george-romero-day-of-the-dead">George A. Romero’s zombie films</a>, specifically <em>Dawn of the Dead</em>. As Frank West, players spend three in-game days in the zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall, using anything and everything one can find in a shopping mall as a weapon to survive. As Frank investigates the outbreak and snaps photos, he comes to the aid other survivors, helping them escape while fending off hordes of undead and evil humans known as psychopaths.</p>
<p id="U1Y8C5">Created by longtime Mega Man creatives Keiji Inafune and Yoshinori Kawano, <em>Dead Rising</em> was lauded for its unique, real-time gameplay structure and campy combat scenarios. Frank could dispatch the zombie masses with a gun or chainsaw, or battle while riding on a skateboard or wearing a full Mega Man battle suit. Or he could beat zombies into submission with a flaming-hot frying pan from the food court while sporting a Servbot head as a helmet.</p>
<p id="PEKaym">The original <em>Dead Rising</em> was released for Xbox 360 in 2006. An HD re-release followed in 2016, for PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One. Capcom released three mainline sequels to <em>Dead Rising</em>, but we haven’t seen a new entry in the franchise since 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/12/5/13797380/dead-rising-4-review-xbox-one-pc"><em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which also starred Frank West. The studio behind the Dead Rising franchise, Capcom Vancouver, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/19/17878380/capcom-vancouver-dead-rising-studio-closed">shut down in 2018</a>.</p>

One of these is Dagda, and… look, I didn’t play <em>Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse</em>, so I’m not going to pretend I can give a lesson on Dagda’s backstory. However, I’ve read enough comments that end with his catchphrase “kid” to get the picture. While Dagda does return in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, he’s locked behind the new Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC. Let’s break it down.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Holy Will and Profane Dissent is a level 75 quest in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em></strong>. However, you don’t <em>have </em>to be level 75 to complete it, as you’ll meet the raw unlock conditions for the quest fairly early in your adventure. As long as you’re strong enough to defeat Dagda, your level is irrelevant. Much like the other quest you can purchase as DLC, Holy Will and the Profane Dissent adds 15 minutes of gameplay <em>at most</em>. The main reason you’d want to drop $5 for this is to use Dagda, who will join your party once the quest is cleared.<br></p><p>If you’ve purchased the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC, or you own the Digital Deluxe edition of the game, here’s how to access this extra boss fight.<br></p><h2 id="h130944"><a id=""></a>How to unlock the Holy Will and Profane Dissent quest in Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</h2><p><strong>The unlock conditions for Holy Will and Profane Dissent are identical to </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-5-sakura-cinders-of-the-east-1851561744"><strong>Sakura Cinders of the East</strong></a></span>. In fact, if you’re purchased the two packs together, this quest is probably already in your quest list. However, in case you’re the world’s biggest Dagda fan and you purchased this pack a la carte, we can start from the beginning.</p><p>To begin the quest, you’ll have to return to the <strong>Tokyo Diet Building</strong>. If you haven’t gotten to the Tokyo Diet Building yet, then you’re <em>definitely </em>too low level to be doing this quest. Just keep playing and you’ll get there sooner than later.<br></p><p>Once you return to the Tokyo Diet Building, go through the exit on the south side of the Terminal Room. In the next room, keep running down the hallway and go down the staircase. Talk to the Head Researcher, and select the “Offer assistance” option. As long as the Holy Will and Profane Dissent DLC is registered to your account, the Head Researcher should point you towards a Researcher in the same area who will give you the titular quest.<br></p><p>After this, the quest directions become self-explanatory. Follow your quest marker back to the Shiba region in Minato, and ride the Magatsu Rail to where the demon Danu is. Long story short, Dagda did some dimensional hopping to come to this world, and he plans to become a god unshackled by responsibilities like taking care of humans. Danu doesn’t like that too much, and it’s your job to confront Dagda about it.<br></p><p>Follow the new quest marker to the north side of Minato, and you’ll find Dagda there. <strong>Approaching Dagda will begin the boss encounter against him, so make sure to save and finish your battle preparations first</strong>. Also, make sure you have an open slot in your party.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-recommend-id="image://dc5e51e853180a99960a5f19d30f5f43" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

For example, if you’ve long since min-maxed all the challenge out of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>on the Normal difficulty, and you only feel alive when solving turn-based battles above your level, you can easily clear Dagda before you hit level 60. </p><p>I, of course, don’t know anything about this.

Even scarier is the <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability, which effectively enables his <strong>Lost Hit </strong>and <strong>Power Punch </strong>attacks to sleep or instantly KO any party member if he’s charged Magatsuhi (and Lost Hit <em>already </em>has a chance to instantly KO). </p><p>That said, Dagda is very easy to exploit. <strong>His AI heavily biases him towards using Lost Hit and Power Punch</strong>, presumably because they inflict much more base damage than the elemental attacks. Because of this, <strong>the Phys Block spell and Phys Dampener items massively counter Dagda</strong>. His turn will get cut short whenever you nullify his attacks, potentially letting you go the entire battle without ever taking a single hit. That said, you should cover up weaknesses to the elements Dagda can target as a precaution.<br></p><p>To play it even safer, consider saving your own Magatsuhi skills for when Dagda charges <em>his </em>Magatsuhi. Holding abilities that remove a Press Turn icon from the enemy - such as <strong>Fountain of Chaos </strong>or <strong>Tides of Chaos</strong> - will completely prevent Dagda from landing a physical attack through a Phys Block barrier. This, in turn, will eliminate any chance of you getting defeated via an unlucky attack that activates Magic Harp.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-recommend-id="image://d03dbf82486d4be02a145493f3dd8158" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Dagda fight.

After an exchange of words, you’ll be given the choice to either <strong>finish him off</strong> or <strong>stow your weapon</strong>. <strong>There are differences between the two choices, but the end result will remain the same</strong>.</p><p>If you <strong>finish him off</strong>, the Nahobino will deliver a killing blow to Dagda. Danu will approve of your choice, and you’ll find an <strong>Oak Staff </strong>on the ground. After you turn in the quest to the researcher in the Tokyo Diet Building, you’ll be told that the Oak Staff can be studied. The item will be removed from your inventory, but by talking to the Head Researcher afterwards, you’ll see a new menu option. Select this, choose to summon Dagda, and the fearsome foe will instantly join your party. You’ll also unlock the option to fuse him.<br></p><p>If you <strong>stow your weapon</strong>, Danu will explain that if Dagda can run free in this world, then the world will also reject her. Accordingly, Danu will leave, and Dagda will acknowledge that you’ve caught his interest. As a result, he’ll join your party on the spot, and the option to fuse him will appear as well.<br></p><p>In other words, <strong>Dagda can join your party regardless of which option you choose</strong>. The mechanics of how it will happen just differ between the two options. <strong>It’s unclear if this choice affects your alignment, so take that into consideration</strong>. If it does, “Finish him off” is presumably the Law-aligned choice, whereas “Stow your weapon” would be the Chaos-aligned choice.</p><h2 id="h130947"><a id=""></a>Dagda’s stats and abilities</h2><p>Unlike his in-battle counterpart, Dagda’s default moveset features no elemental coverage. Fortunately, that doesn’t matter in the face of Dagda’s sheer power. <strong>Lost Hit </strong>is his unique move, which inflicts severe Physical damage <em>and </em>has a chance to instakill foes. <strong>Hades Blast</strong> inflicts heavy damage to the enemy party, and <strong>Freikugel</strong> deals severe Strength-based Almighty damage with a high critical hit rate. This alone ensures Dagda won’t be stopped by an enemy with Physical resistance or immunity.</p><p>The <strong>Magic Harp </strong>passive ability works exactly as it did in the boss encounter, letting you potentially instakill common foes or put an enemy to sleep if an Omagatoki effect is active. <strong>High Phys Pleroma </strong>boosts his physical damage even further, and <strong>Null Phys</strong> combines with Dagda’s resistances to form a powerful wall of immunities. Luster Candy is a great party buff move, assuming you aren’t using the likes of Idun or Konohana Sakuya to fill that void.<br></p><p>Considering that it’s possible to grab him several hours before you’re intended to by cheesing his boss fight, Dagda offers a frankly insane power boost to your team.That’s good news if <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance </em>is giving you trouble. The bad news is that he might make your team building less exciting when he clearly outperforms so many damage dealers. So whether he’s worth the $5 or not is ultimately up to you.<br></p><p>Personally, I can’t believe Atlus would paywall quality dialogue such as this:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-recommend-id="image://674480b2c8b7889e88062a69bf833108" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A line from Dagda that reads, &quot;can't go calling youa kid.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dan-houser-the-risk-of-a-grand-theft-auto-movie-never-made-sense<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>The former Rockstar boss explains his plan for Absurd Ventures</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Former Rockstar Games head writer and co-founder Dan Houser says that the economics behind a Grand Theft Auto movie "never made sense."</p>
<p>Speaking in a <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">wide-ranging interview with The Ankler </a>(subscription required), the former Rockstar leader discussed the state of Hollywood and his new company's efforts to develop new IP that could eventually turn into blockbuster movies and games.</p>
<p>Houser <a href="https://theankler.com/p/dan-houser-absurd-ventures-hollywood-videogames">told the publication</a> that there were numerous conversations about turning Rockstar's games, such as GTA and Red Dead Redemption, into a movie.</p>
<p>He said: “After a few awkward dates, we’d ask [the executives], why would we do this?”</p>
<p>And those execs would reply that it would be an opportunity to make a movie, which Houser would respond with: "no, what you've described is you making a movie and us having no control and taking a huge risk that we’re going to end up paying for with something that belongs to us.</p>
<p>“They thought we’d be blinded by the lights and that just wasn't the case. We had what we considered to be multi-billion-dollar IP, and the economics never made sense. The risk never made sense. In those days, the perception was that games made poor-quality movies.”</p>
<p>However, Houser said "it's a different time now", which has led to the formation of Absurd Ventures.</p>
<p>The idea of Absurd Ventures, which also includes former Rockstar leaders Lazlow Jones and Mike Unsworth, is to build potentially major franchises via cheaper formats, such as audiobooks and graphic novels.</p>
<p>The firm's first project is the 12-part audio project A Better Paradise, which kicked off earlier this month and stars the likes of Andrew Lincoln and Paterson Joseph. Its second project is called American Caper, which will begin as a crime and political graphic novel. A third project will be 'lighter and more comedic', but little else was shared.</p>
<p>“If one of [these projects] just stops at the graphic novel or audiobook point, but it's still good and made with integrity, that's fine,” he said. “The end goal is always, always to make cool shit, make the next thing as good as it can be. It's only worth doing each bit if it doesn't feel like marketing.”</p>
<p>Of course, the view is that some of these will eventually lead into a video game project that can cross between interactive and linear entertainment.</p>
<p>"Part of why we’re doing the company this way is our belief that [gaming and traditional entertainment] are going to continue to meld and cross-pollinate,” he said. “The question is, can our business model and theirs collaborate?"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/26/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced-with-teaser-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Capcom has revealed Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a remaster of the Xbox 360 game that first launched in 2006. Though the once previously Xbox-exclusive game has since made its way to PlayStation and PC platforms, it remains unclear which platforms this remaster is coming to. And there's no word on when to expect the remaster either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Revealed with a short 47-second teaser trailer, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster looks great, almost more like a remake than a remaster. It's unclear if this is a remaster of the original 2006 game or <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/dead_rising_triple_pack/b/playstation4/archive/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-confirmed-for-september-launch.aspx">the HD version of Dead Rising that launched on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC back in 2017</a>. Regardless, we're stoked to head back into a zombie-infested mall with journalist Frank West whenever this remaster launches.&nbsp;</p>

Bandai Namco has seemingly heard the great hue and cry from reviewers and players alike that <em>Erdtree </em>is far too difficult. In response, the publisher <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-calibration-update-1122">is implementing a “calibration update”</a> that will reduce the level of difficulty by making players stronger. According to the patch notes for this update:</p><div><blockquote><p>The attack and damage negation has been increased for the first half of the maximum amount of&nbsp;blessing enhancements, and the second half will now be more gradual.</p><p>The attack and damage negation granted by the final level of Blessing enhancements has been slightly increased.</p></blockquote></div><p>The key to understanding this update is the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Scadutree+Fragment">Scadutree Fragments</a>. They are DLC-specific upgrade materials that increase a player’s attack and defense. The fragments are scattered throughout the map, requiring considerable exploration to find, but the increased power they grant makes them a high-priority resource. </p><p>There are 20 tiers of Scadutree Blessings in the game. The calibration update will increase the power granted by the first 10 levels, while the power granted by the second 10 will taper off a bit. This means players in the first part of the DLC should see a sharper increase in power, making the early game bosses (including the dreaded <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Rellana+Twin+Moon+Knight">Rellana</a>) a bit easier. Finally, the last blessing will also get a buff ostensibly to help out those struggling against the brutal final boss. I’ll not name that boss here because it’s too soon for a spoiler like that, but rest assured, such a buff is warranted.</p><p>There’s a second note in the update dealing with a bug related to ray tracing settings. Loading a previous save from a previous version of the game might automatically enable ray tracing. The notes suggest that if you have issues with your frame rate, check to see if ray tracing has been turned on accidentally.</p><p><em>Erdtree</em>’s difficulty has been dominating the discussion of the DLC. Game director Hidetaka Miyazaki himself said that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24183692/hidetaka-miyazaki-interview-shadow-of-the-erdtree-difficulty">the difficulty level is intentional</a>, and lowering it could potentially “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">break the game</a>.” Some players, streamers, and reviewers have countered that even for a Soulsborne game, it’s a little too much. There are even <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/most-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-just-make-the-dlc-easier-including-a-journalist-mode-which-lets-you-take-50-less-damage/">mods that artificially lower the difficulty</a>, including one that halves all incoming damage bearing the unfortunate name of “<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5225">journalist mode</a>.”</p><p>Hopefully, this little buff will squash the difficulty discourse but will probably serve only to exacerbate it, as now there will be a class of players who can gloat that they beat the game before the nerf... like game journalists.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The device looked like a miniature Xbox Series S, a small white box that was dedicated to accessing Xbox games over the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service. Microsoft eventually canceled its plans to launch Keystone, but a new patent gives us the best look at what the Xbox cloud console would have looked like.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design"><em>Windows Central</em></a>, the <a href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/dirsearch-public/print/downloadPdf/D1009161">patent reveals</a> that Keystone would have shipped with an HDMI port, ethernet, and a power connector. At the front, there was an Xbox button, a controller pairing button, and a USB-A port. Underneath, Microsoft had a circular “Hello from Seattle” plate that the console sat on, similar to what it uses on the larger Xbox Series X.</p><p>The patent, filed in 2022, is assigned to Chris Kujawski, a principal designer at Microsoft. Kujawski led the design for the Xbox Series S / X consoles.</p><div><figcaption><em>The front and rear of the Xbox Keystone device.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527420/microsoft-xbox-tv-app-streaming-stick-xcloud">first announced</a>&nbsp;it was planning an Xbox streaming device in 2021 but eventually canceled its Keystone device because it couldn’t quite get the price to around $100.

            <p>The studio behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-best-pals-ranked">Palworld</a> never received any formal complaint or threat of legal action from Nintendo or The Pokémon Company despite widespread debate over the open-world ‘Pokémon with guns’ survival game earlier this year.</p>

<p>That’s the claim from Pocketpair CEO Takuro Mizobe in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-takuro-mizobe-interview">GameFile</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">Eurogamer</a>), where the dev was asked about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pokemon-company-statement-on-palworld-copyright-allegations-sounds-a-lot-like-please-leave-us-the-hell-alone">a pointed statement made by The Pokémon Company</a> in the wake of Palworld’s release saying they would “investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon”.</p>
<p>The rare - if indirect - public acknowledgement came amidst <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-palworld-break-pokemons-copyright-we-asked-a-lawyer">endless debate</a> over how closely Palworld toed the line between “inspiration” and straight-up copyright infringement on Pokémon creature designs, inspiring fervent comparisons of character models, concept art and more across the internet following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-monster-collector-with-machineguns-will-launch-in-early-access-this-month">its launch into early access</a> back in January.</p>
<p>Still, despite the strong words, Mizobe said that Pocketpair heard “nothing at all” from the Pokémon makers.</p>
<p>“Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn't say anything to us,” he confirmed.</p>

<p>Mizobe himself worked briefly at Nintendo as part of a training programme in 2020, tasked with creating a unique game design for the dual-screen DS handheld. His apparent takeaway from the experience was that “mak[ing] new things is very hard”, inspiring the developer to instead draw from existing ideas and combine them together - something that can be seen fairly explicitly in Palworld.</p>
<p>“In game development, of course, sometimes we have to do it, but, as much as possible, I try to avoid creating new things,” Mizobe added.</p>
<p>With no legal storm in sight, Palworld’s popularity continues apace, apparently going as far as to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-ceo-says-many-clones-of-pokemon-with-guns-game-are-coming-with-genshin-impact-level-successors">inspire its own Palworld-likes</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186545/warhammer-40k-tank-scale-model-build-night-shift<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="KdKUR9">While fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/warhammer-40k">Warhammer 40,000</a> and other miniatures games like to spend a lot of time on their tiny little war machines, their commitment to the craft pales in comparison to dedicated scale modelers. One such modeler, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/unclenightshift/">Martin Kovac</a>, recently published a video to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels">YouTube</a> that makes that abundantly clear. It also raises the question: Why aren’t hobby painters paying more attention to these incredible artists?</p>
<p id="zCYr9L">A little over a year ago I took a break from painting up a bunch of minis for <em>40K</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23153625/horus-heresy-age-of-darkness-price-availability-release-date-review"><em>Warhammer: The Horus Heresy</em></a> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23580330/painting-warhammer-40k-miniatures-model-airplane">try my hand at a model airplane</a>, my first in nearly three decades. The experience taught me so many things about tools, materials, and organization — lessons that continue to influence my hobby time even today. But the experience also broadened my perspective, adding several scale modelers to my YouTube subscription list. Kovac’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NightShiftScaleModels">Night Shift</a> was among them, and I’ve enjoyed his work on World War II-era armor and dioramas for more than a year now. So color me surprised when he showed up a little over a week ago with a plastic <a href="https://www.warhammer.com/en-US/shop/legiones-astartes-sicaran-battle-tank-2022">Sicaran Battle Tank</a>.</p>
<p id="aSYkyU">In a nearly 30-minute video posted on June 14, Kovac details his entire process from start to finish. In addition to showing how he used oil paints and enamel washes to develop the Sicaran’s delicate patina, he also gives lots of examples of how to add more realistic textures to different parts of the model. I was especially blown away by the handmade weld lines that he created completely from scratch, as well as all the work he put into making the tank’s largest body panels look more like metal.</p>
<p id="ynsm2i">There’s just one catch: Some of the fine detail work that Kovac did at the end makes it so that the final model can’t be touched with bare human hands. So while this tank looks amazing, it’s not at all suitable for play. Regardless, it’s one of the best videos I’ve ever seen about the modern scale modeling hobby. If you have a pile of plastic slowly rising in your workspace, this might be just the dose of inspiration you need to dig back into it. </p>

I did not finish the most recent expansion until just before <em>Dawntrail</em>, rather than in the weeks and months following its 2021 release, even though I started the expansion with everyone else. And that has to do with one of<em> Endwalker</em>’s major flaws: pacing.</p><p>The stakes of <em>Endwalker </em>were incredibly high. It was positioned as the end of the Hydaelan/Zodiark saga that began in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-realm-reborns-ending-was-kind-of-a-letdown-1846382285&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-realm-reborns-ending-was-kind-of-a-letdown-1846382285"><em>A Real Reborn</em></a></span>. While it wouldn’t be the end of the MMO, it did signal the end of an era. That means a lot of story threads had to be tied up in <em>Endwalker</em>, and not all of them are done so cleanly. Jumping from Old Sharlayan to Thavnair to Garlemald to the Moon to the past back to Old Sharlayanand then to the end of the universe is a lot of mileage in one expansion. Each of these locations includes its own characters and stories that depict how the world is preparing for the end times, but none of them get the room to breathe they so desperately need. While moments in Elpis with Venat and the other ancients stand out as a high point in the expansion, my time in the other locations is mostly a forgettable blur. </p><p>The slog is what held me back from completing <em>Endwalker </em>until only recently. After the high of Elpis, players are forced into an extensive marathon in Sharlyan that amounts to the most mundane fetch quests. Elpis ends with a high-adrenaline cascade of story reveals and emotional moments and the player then has to put that on the shelf to go carry boxes. This back-and-forth between engaging design and tedious mundanity makes <em>Endwalker </em>a rough expansion to get through—even if it is a sort of perfect encapsulation of <em>FF14</em>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-recommend-id="image://3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-recommend-id="image://3dca14566eb14a4ecfd328797b998000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1215" data-height="683" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Citizens walk through Old Sharlayan" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3893"><a id=""></a><strong>The end of the world as we know it</strong></h2><p><em>Endwalker </em>boldly tried to subvert players’ expectations for a grand finale. Within the first third of the expansion players do the impossible: Defeat Zodiark. The big bad is gone. But the end of the world is still coming. The rest of the expansion then slowly reveals Meteion as the true villain, a creation of an ancient that has spent years becoming disillusioned with life due to the never-ending suffering and death she has witnessed across the universe. It becomes a story about resilience in the face of the base evils of existence. Essentially it’s <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>’s take on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Myth of Sisyphus</em></a></span>. Yeah, we know life kind of sucks and everything ends, but we still hope and dream that there are better things. </p><p>One moment stands out as the high point in the expansion: The cutscene after players complete The Mothercrystal trial. In it, Hydaelyn reveals that to send players to the end of the universe to face Meteion she will give up her aether, essentially leaving her children alone for the first time. “Long after I have gone, though not even my souls remaineth,” Hydaelyn says in her final goodbye, “My love will be with you forever, my dearest children.” In that goodbye, we can call her by her true name, Venat. We can see her as no longer a god, but a woman finally able to rest at ease knowing we are safe in each other’s hands.</p><figure id="" data-id="d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-recommend-id="image://d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-recommend-id="image://d51864e5d91b89cb24611b64565413c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hydaelyn floats in front of the mother crystal" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sadly I find that the <em>Endwalker</em>’s ending is a messier conclusion that fails to reach that same height. After finally facing down Meteion, players have one last battle against another villain, Zenos that leaves the player tired. I genuinely sighed in exasperation when I had completed the final dungeon, then the final trial, and had to face Zenos in an instanced event. It’s a letdown compared to the operatic encounter with Meteion and it undermines the expansion’s last moments.<br></p><p><em>Endwalker</em> was always going to be a hard expansion to pull off. It was the follow-up to <em>Shadowbringers</em>, generally considered the height of <em>FF14 </em>and one of the best <em>Final Fantasy</em> stories period. In addition, it had to wrap up a decade-long story but not wrap it up so conclusively that the MMO couldn’t continue in later expansions (such as <em>Dawntrail</em>). That’s a lot to accomplish and I’m not sure anything could have lived up to players’ sky-high expectations. And yet within the flawed mess of <em>Endwalker</em> is so much beauty.</p><p><em>Endwalker</em>’s successful moments<em> </em>are owed to the years-long relationship players have built with this world, its characters, and each other. Watching my Warrior of Light face down the end of times with the Scions of the Seventh Dawn pulls at the heartstrings in a way no other game can. The central conflict against Meteion is an extreme test of their (and my) convictions. As heroes of the realm, our mission has always been to find hope even in the darkest of times. <em>Endwalker </em>is the extreme of that. Do I really think going through all these boring quests is worth it to get to the end of the expansion, to save the world, to see these characters earn those happy endings? Yes. I do.</p><figure id="" data-id="2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-recommend-id="image://2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-recommend-id="image://2e13810258964876c1c9a0a9949c9d17" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Scions of the Seventh Dawn pose in a group shot" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I love <em>Endwalker </em>and all of its flaws because I love <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>and all of its flaws. In that sense, <em>Endwalker </em>epitomizes the MMO I love. It also sends it out on a beautiful note.

My love for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> has been reaffirmed by <em>Endwalker</em>, but the stories of the characters I love were wrapped with such a fine bow that I don’t know what else the game can offer me. I think of Venat’s final words about sending her children out into the world without her. They don’t need her anymore. I don’t know if they need me, or any player anymore.</p><hr><p><em>Dawntrail </em>promises to pave the way for new stories to come, only time will tell if they are still worth telling.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In less than a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-4-being-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full day since the announcement</a> of the delisting of Forza Horizon 4, the gaming community has exhibited unprecedented enthusiasm, with players eagerly lining up to dive into the game. Within mere hours of the announcement, Forza Horizon 4 achieved a new all-time player peak record on Steam; learn more below.</p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1293830/charts/#48h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, as soon as the news of Forza Horizon 4 getting delisted surfaced online, players instantly started hopping on to the game, probably to get as much out of the digital copy before the game is eventually removed. Intriguingly, the number of players that have arrived in the past 2 hours has broken Forza Horizon 4’s all-time player peak record set in 2021. At the time of writing, the game’s new all-time peak was set around 2 hours ago, with 48,437 concurrent players, absolutely smashing the previous number of 40,399.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The surge in players clearly demonstrates the community’s love for the title. Not only are old players returning to the game, but new ones are trying it out before it disappears. Additionally, the fact that the game is offered at a whopping <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1293830/Forza_Horizon_4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% discount on Steam </a>helps their case, too. At the same time, it is worth noting that the game will still be accessible through physical copies. However, in today’s digital gaming era, the sudden disappearance of games raises questions about the best approach for game preservation.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Keystone’: Xbox Cloud-Based Console Plans Revealed in Patent Filing]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-keystone-images-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98keystone%E2%80%99-xbox-cloud-based-console-plans-revealed-in-patent-filing.912222/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-keystone-images-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Once upon a time, Microsoft had plans to produce a streaming-based console that would have minimal hardware and rely entirely on a SOIP operating model to play games through Xbox Game Pass. It was later scrapped because of pricing issues – but it was rumoured that it ‘should have’ cost between $100 and $130, coming bundled with a controller. </p>



<p>In a recent discovery, a long-lost patent filing has been discovered bearing some ‘blueprint’ images of Project Keystone, which was the codename for the streaming-based Xbox console.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-small-but-mighty">Small but Mighty</h2>



<p>Windows Central has dug up some documentation that showcases Project Keystone, which would have been small enough to fit under any television set or tuck neatly behind a monitor, relying on nothing more than a controller and an internet connection to stream games.</p>



<p>In the images, we’re treated to a few angles of Keystone:</p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s nothing too stunning to look at, but it does line up quite nicely with the current generation of Xbox consoles. It has the blocky aesthetic of an Xbox Series X|S unit and boasts all the trappings of a low-energy, low-resource gaming device. To the rear of Keystone, there’s a power port, an HDMI port, and an ethernet port – simple. There’s a single USB port on the front of the console to accommodate an accessory or a charging cable for a controller, and that’s it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-that-never-was-our-first-detailed-look-at-the-keystone-cloud-streaming-console-design" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central revealed</a> that this patent was filed in 2022 – but it ultimately fell flat and fell into the abyss, destined to never see the light of day. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-leak-xbox-cloud-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">last year’s massive FTC leaks</a>, it was suggested that Keystone was still on the cards at Microsoft, sitting in a project list and being tagged as ‘Funded’. It’s not known what happened to that claim, but the consensus is that it was outdated information.</p>



<p>Do you think Project Keystone would have been a good idea, or would it have gone the way of Google Stadia and the Ouya?</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When it launches on July 2, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-first-descendant/" data-ref-id="5000-567980">The First Descendant</a> will enter a genre that, lately, has had more failures than successes. High-profile games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/anthem-review-two-halves/1900-6417093/" data-ref-id="1900-6417093">Anthem</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/redfall-review-half-staked/1900-6418062/" data-ref-id="1900-6418062">Redfall</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-loot-world-order/1900-6418174/" data-ref-id="1900-6418174">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvels-avengers-review-/1900-6417560/" data-ref-id="1900-6417560">Marvel's Avengers</a> all operated in the same space that the upcoming loot shooter is hoping to enter, and all struggled to make lasting positive impressions. Even the king of loot shooters, Destiny 2, has struggled--though developer Bungie just put out an acclaimed expansion, the game might have been at its lowest point ever just a year ago. Loot shooter players can be a tough crowd.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently played about an hour of The First Descendant at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, which wasn't enough to get a full sense of whether developer Nexon will avoid the pitfalls that seem to doom so many of these games. It did, however, give a sense of moment-to-moment gameplay that seems to change significantly depending on which of the 14 characters you play throughout the game. The huge amount of customizations that come with guns, characters, and modifications you can make to your loadout suggest that The First Descendant will offer a whole variety in ways to play it. That, coupled with what sounds like a large amount of content at release, including for its endgame, has me cautiously optimistic that The First Descendant can succeed where so many other recent games have failed.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The First Descendant - Xbox Extended Gameplay First Look</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I played as Eseimo in the demo, one of the three new "Descendants" that Nexon is adding to the game at launch, who focuses on using high explosives and tanky, overwhelming force. The demo also included some new content coming at launch, and I was able to jump into one of the game's dungeons on my own and fight through it. The mission sends you into a snowy facility overrun by enemies, culminating with a boss fight at the end. It gave a pretty good sense of Eseimo's high-damage, crowd-controlling capabilities, and how he might contribute in a group.</p><p dir="ltr">The core of The First Descendant is third-person shooting, the kind where you do a lot of running around and dodge-rolling as you fight. The shooting felt solid generally, capturing the same vibes as something like Outriders, with punchy guns that can easily mow down smaller enemies but require a little extra effort against beefier opponents. I mostly used an assault rifle that kept the bullets flying as much as possible, but The First Descendant includes 11 firearm classes that give some variety to players and their loadouts.</p><p dir="ltr">As you might expect, Eseimo's abilities include whipping grenades into crowds--these came in clutch in the dungeon, where tougher opponents joined a flood of enemies. The trek through the facility included a portion in which I had to defend a large room that had a big dome forcefield in the center while waiting for a door to unlock. The room flooded with enemies, including heavy units carrying large medieval-like shields and even larger, tougher enemies that took a lot of fire to bring down.</p><p dir="ltr">You get both a recharging shield and a health bar in The First Descendant, with the latter becoming vulnerable while the former is broken. The recharge on my shields took quite a while, however, which meant that tactical repositioning (running away) is often extremely important to keeping alive as a solo player. It made for a fast and frenetic experience throughout the dungeon, and one that I had a pretty good time with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325192" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325192"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325192-tfd_worldmisson_003.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325194,1300-4325195" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325194-tfd_worldmisson_002.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325195-tfd_worldmisson_001.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">During that fight, success required keeping clear of smaller melee troops while focusing on the shield-bearing troopers to thin out the numbers of tougher, more dangerous enemies, all while being conscious of positioning because characters could pass through the big forcefield, but it would block bullets and other attacks. When things really got tough, I could activate Eseimo's most powerful active ability, which essentially turned him into a truck. You charge forward with a dash move that lets you smash through enemies, but you're unable to stop until you trigger the ability again to let loose a powerful explosion all around you. It was great for cutting through tons of enemies and putting massive hurt on some of the tough-to-kill variants.</p><p dir="ltr">The dungeon culminated in a boss fight that gave me some sense of what mechanical elements The First Descendant will employ to make its gunfights a little more interesting. The seven-foot-tall, minigun-wielding fighter was tough to take head-on and, to make matters worse, was flanked by snipers, more of the roving melee troopers, and enemies carrying shields, which required a lot of running around the arena.</p><p dir="ltr">That arena was also oddly shaped, making the already tough fight even tougher. The boss came up an elevator attached to a cliff face, its path winding around along the side of a mountain. Staying put wasn't an option, as the boss would continuously launch mortars that would stun and pummel you if you didn't clear out before they landed. Yet venture too far to one side and it was a deadly fall. However, if you followed the snaking path upward, you’d reach a position where you could clear out enemies and shoot down at the boss and his minions as they flooded up the path.</p><p dir="ltr">The toughest part of the fight came about halfway through, when the boss summoned a set of drones that shielded him from damage. This was where things got a bit more technical; to destroy the shield, I had to shoot the drones, yet only one was vulnerable at a time and only briefly. Zooming in for a quick sniper shot or two was enough to bring the drones down, but with the constant reinforcements of enemy troops and the mortar and minigun attacks from the boss, a lot of coordination was required just to stay alive. As a team, the boss fight might have been easier, given they used careful coordination to keep everyone alive and fighting. For a single player, however, it could get pretty challenging. However, after two rounds of destroying drones, and several close calls, I finally toppled the boss.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325193" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4325193"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4325193-tfd_dungeon_f05_002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The hour-long demo gave me enough time to mess with one character and complete one mission. What I played felt good, if a little fleeting and hard to pin down. From the sounds of things, though, The First Descendant will offer a lot of different content. A presentation during the demo noted that Nexon has expanded and deepened the story content in the game from what was previously shown in its beta tests, and will be adding specific stories for each of its 14 characters as well.</p><p dir="ltr">For loot shooters like this, endgame is a major consideration--it's the content that will keep players coming back long-term. The dungeon I saw is one of the game's higher-level areas, and Nexon said there will be 16 of those dungeons available at launch. They'll include normal and hard difficulty levels, with the tougher versions dishing out better loot. There are also Void Intercept missions, which are The First Descendant's real claim to fame. These are battles against absolutely massive creatures and look like they have the ability to create some intense, memorable moments that'll help keep The First Descendant interesting over the long term.</p><p dir="ltr">I didn't really get a sense of the loot system in my limited play time, but I was impressed by the level of customization and build-crafting that The First Descendant seems to make available. In addition to all the guns and the many characters with their own special abilities, there are "modules." The First Descendant has something like 560 of these, which you can equip in different combinations to further customize how you play with a series of passive bonuses and alterations to your guns and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, all of that sounds very strong, and I enjoyed my short time with the game and the one mission I was able to play. If nothing else, the demo left me with the impression that The First Descendant is launching with a lot to do, solid third-person shooter gunplay, and character-specific elements that mix things up pretty significantly.</p><p dir="ltr">The First Descendant launches on July 2 for PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PS4.</p>

            <p>Atari 50 was already a fairly comprehensive offering of retro games spanning half a century, launching in late 2022 as a playable museum of sorts charting the classic publisher’s output across arcade machines, the 2600, 5200, 7800 and Jaguar home consoles, 8-bit computers and the Lynx handheld. The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.</p>

</div>
<p>The Expanded Edition of Atari 50 will add the games across two additional interactive timelines, dubbed The Wider World of Atari and The First Console War. As with the collection’s other playable histories, the games will be presented in chronological order alongside various insight into their development in video segments, interviews, advertisements from the time and other “historical artefacts”.</p>
<p>The Wider World of Atari will take up 19 of the games, including Berzerk and a look into the creation of Breakout, while The First Console War will delve into the battle between the Atari 2600 and Mattel’s Intellivision with 20 more games, including several prototypes. Funnily enough, Atari settled the apparent conflict by purchasing the rights to Intellivision earlier this year.</p>
<p>Atari 50’s Expanded Edition will be offered as both DLC for the existing game and a standalone collection by itself. We’re yet to get a full rundown of the games included or how much it’ll cost, but expect a release on October 25th.</p>

			<p>Around three months after the launch of Dragon's Dogma 2, CAPCOM is now asking fans to submit their feedback on pretty much every aspect of the action RPG <a href="https://jp.research.net/r/p_dd2?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via a dedicated survey</a>. Doing so will be rewarded with a new digital wallpaper.</p>
<p>Interested fans will have to vote on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The naturalness, style, and readability of the text for the language you played Dragon's Dogma 2 in</li>

<p>The long-awaited action RPG sequel sold well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking the 3-million milestone</a> and pushing the Japanese publisher to <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announces-upward-revision-for-earnings-forecast-following-favorable-dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revise upward</a> its original sales forecast.</p>
<p>However, Dragon's Dogma 2 definitely has some areas that could be improved. In my review of the game, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>The original Dragon's Dogma was expanded a year later with Dark Arisen, which added a whole new endgame dungeon and more. Given the positive sales of the sequel, CAPCOM could choose to do the same while also improving some of the shortcomings. Stay tuned - we'll keep you abreast of the publisher's plans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NsCbAV">It wouldn’t be a FromSoftware release without some perennial discourse over difficulty, and while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> follows suit, this time, there’s a twist. Players aren’t debating whether or not FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult games should offer an easy mode or better accessibility options, nor is the community sneering and telling people they should simply “git gud” (derogatory). This time, we’re seeing hardcore fans bemoan the grueling nature of the new DLC, if not saying that game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has gone too far. </p>
<p id="RjC3j5"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> employs an unusual mechanic that attempts to mitigate the likelihood of players jumping into the DLC with overleveled characters. While you still retain your base stats when entering the Land of Shadow, the DLC-specific location has new upgrades — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Spirit Ashes</a> — that dictate how much damage you can deal and withstand while in this new realm. The more of these upgrades you have, in other words, the better you’ll do; the game has also recently been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes">updated</a> to make these upgrades even stronger. This system also means that players who have likely spent hours building and optimizing their characters are, in some ways, being forced to start from scratch. Without these new embellishments, run-of-the-mill enemies can and will destroy your character if you’re not careful. The developers warned this would be the case before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> came out, with Miyazaki outright stating he believed the team had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/">“pushed the envelope” of what could be “withstood” by players</a>. </p>
<p id="io9sZZ"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Reviews</a> for the expansion were also published ahead of its actual release, and while many critics wrote about the DLC’s difficulty, as a whole, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> was well received. Right now, <em>Elden Ring</em>’s expansion is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">sitting on a 95 on Metacritic</a>, which the grading system deems to be “universal acclaim.” Despite this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">a Eurogamer review</a> that gave the expansion three stars out of five caused a fan outcry. According to these fans, who again were reading this review before playing the DLC themselves, the critic had made the mistake of saying that the game seemed too difficult this time. Worse, the critic wasn’t sure if they had the motivation to try and trudge through certain parts of it.</p>

<p id="hDMl1p">“This, however, feels like difficulty for difficulty’s sake, turned up to eleven, perhaps because with the added expectations of a DLC having something extra-absurd to conquer even though it technically doesn’t require finishing the core game,” the reviewer wrote of one particularly egregious optional boss fight. “I go through dozens of deaths over a period of several days, and despite taking breaks to go off and do other things and explore other areas, I realise that I just don’t want to do this anymore.”</p>
<p id="842QFq">This admission was not well received by some fans, especially given the larger, ongoing stereotype that game journalists are bad at games and therefore not fit to judge a series where part of the point is to suffer (“Prepare to die” was an official tagline for the first <em>Dark Souls</em>, after all). Replies to Eurogamer’s <a href="https://x.com/eurogamer/status/1803066963595239443">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) linking the review often chastised or tried to humiliate the reviewer for the perceived crime of believing the difficulty had not been well tuned. As of this writing, top responses say things like “It was to hawd fow you?”, “Perhaps stick to something like Mario it might be more your speed,” and of course, the obligatory “get good.”</p>
<p id="8amng9">The irony here is that the review spends a good chunk of its word count expressing frustration with how much the expansion tries to hand-hold the player. Specifically, the reviewer felt that the expansion doesn’t seem to trust the player to figure out what they should do, often signposting in an unusually overt way. This, the reviewer suggests, robs the player from earning a sense of discovery and worse, makes some of the unique obstacles trivial. As an example, the review mentions that the game outright tells the player to not let specific enemies see them, so the reviewer equipped an item that made sneaking around easier.</p>

<p id="3wVXWc">Ultimately, though, 3 out of 5 is not a bad score — and again, as a whole, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has been reviewed well. But for some fans, this didn’t matter. Social media posts questioning the credentials of the reviewer went viral despite the fact that many of these people clearly didn’t read the full review. Then, once players finally got their hands on the DLC, karma reared its judicious head. </p>
<p id="DfvP9w"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">On Steam</a>, the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC dropped down to a “mixed” rating, which is a harsher verdict than the expansion’s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">Metacritic score</a>. Some of these reviewers simply aren’t happy with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s poor performance on their PCs. But an unusual number of the negative reviews on the DLC’s store page admit that for them, the expansion was unfairly brutal. “Filled to the brim with uninspired, unfun boss fights that rely on incredibly annoying features to make them ‘difficult,’” one negative review reads. “I dont mind learning how to fight hard bosses but if you’re simply murdered half the time for missing a roll I think some of the numbers should be re-evaluated,” another states. “Well this game isn’t just hard, it’s artificially hard,” another claims.</p>
<p id="wZz027">The frustration with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s bosses spans beyond Steam players. On Google, negative reviews also cite the outrageous difficulty. “The scaling is ridiculous, every enemy does insane damage whilst you do relatively little damage,” states a one-star review. The top review on that platform deems the DLC to be 8/10, which, while a positive score, also begins with the judgment that the developers “overdid the difficulty.”</p>
<p id="ChgvnN">The most visible repudiation of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> comes from an unexpected source, however: influencers who play games for a living. “I think the DLC is too hard to be fun,” said popular Twitch streamer Asmongold. Notably, Asmongold is an influencer who has such a fraught relationship with gaming journalists, he’s built a community that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/1d386k1/gaming_journalist_cant_beat_a_puzzle_in_a/">often takes pleasure</a> in pointing out when a critic has trouble with a video game — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Asmongold/comments/tkb933/i_found_a_picture_of_games_journalists_whenever/">including FromSoft titles</a>. </p>

<p id="0Vejbq">For some, all of this will come off as a case of people getting a taste of their own medicine; after years of looking down on players who felt defeated by FromSoftware games, these elitist players are finally finding themselves in the same boat. At the same time, much of this phenomenon is transpiring during a pivotal moment for FromSoftware games as a whole. <em>Elden Ring</em> is by far the Japanese studio’s best-selling game, by orders of magnitude compared to its other titles. Arguably, it’s the game that’s brought the genre to the mainstream; even celebrities like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/06/18/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-review/">The Weeknd and Travis Scott were excited for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. </p>
<p id="dr4hQx">Those in the know are aware that FromSoftware games have been hugely influential to the video game industry as a whole, but for a long time, these have been relatively niche games. This means that <em>Elden Ring</em> is likely now being played by a huge group of people who don’t have any of the experience, memories, or baggage that come with the genre and its notorious difficulty. These are fresh faces who haven’t grown tired of arguing over whether or not the games should be this harsh, and they’ve certainly not been privy to judgments from fanatics who have strict ideas about how the games should be played. </p>

<p id="Ij24Hb">As a series that’s built a name for its unforgiving nature, FromSoftware games have attracted a fandom that prides itself on overcoming challenges. Sadly, some of that attitude has gotten warped over time, leading some players to add even more stipulations for what is and isn’t considered admirable. In the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>, conservative players have considered specific play styles less valid than others. Things like using summons, which are NPCs who can help the player during specific moments, or spirit ashes, which are ghostly buddies that can also help the player with certain designated battles and boss fights, have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/qtsyad/are_spirits_this_games_easy_mode/">often been deemed as “easy mode”</a> by players who have spent years beating FromSoftware games without additional help. Many FromSoftware games — including <em>Elden Ring</em> — also have a system for summoning other players to help with various in-game challenges. Again, according to the most intense subsection of FromSoftware fans, using these in-game tools is an admission of weakness.</p>

<p id="G6xYIN">In a way, this restrictive attitude has been implicitly reinforced following the popularity of Twitch streams. In order to stand out, Twitch streamers often make up challenges to beat FromSoftware games. There are players who beat games like <em>Elden Ring</em> at low levels and with basic gear, or with unexpected tools like musical instruments, dance pads, and even brain waves. Twitch streamers who feel pressure to entertain their audiences therefore have a stake in having the games present a challenge, but not one that is so insurmountable that it leads to an unsatisfying viewing experience.</p>
<p id="P7NR9E">Players who review games on Steam or Google because they’re dissatisfied, or streamers who play games for a living, are hardly representative of a community composed of 25 million people and counting. When you look at discussions about <em>Elden Ring</em> outside of these highly specific contexts, the evolution of the community and its attitude is palpable. It’s practically become a meme that players are relying on things like spirit ashes to help them survive the Land of Shadow, especially the Mimic Tear, which creates a copy of the player to take on foes. The Mimic Tear has all of the abilities that the player does, but with fewer weaknesses: It can withstand multiple attacks that would normally kill the player.</p>
<p id="9VdcXK">Even if it’s provided by the game and therefore meant to be used, longtime FromSoftware fans still clearly feel justified in calling spirit ashes “broken.” Despite this, the much larger current community for <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t seem to think less of people who use spirit ashes; if anything, the player base seems to be bonding over it. On Reddit, some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnz7mc/these_bosses_are_beating_my_ass/">most popular</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnrzv9/mimic_tear_haters_after_the_first_weekend_of_the/">common threads</a> are jokes about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnygrs/after_every_boss_fight_in_the_dlc/">seemingly universal</a> reliance on spirit ashes. Rather than looking down on it or ridiculing it, using tools like the Mimic Tear is now outright encouraged by most players.</p>
<p id="QQP5UQ">Even the much-reviled “get good” attitude seems to have shifted. In a video by the popular YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@penguinz0">penguinz0</a>, he doles out some tough love for players who dislike <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s difficulty. He tells people to get good. At one point, this phrase would undoubtedly reflect a toxic, gatekeeping attitude about who gets to enjoy FromSoftware games. Here, it’s merely encouragement to put aside your pride and use the tools at your disposal. “Get good” now means getting familiar with those tools over trying to brute force your way through a game without any aids.</p>
<p id="prRxP2">“Every Souls game has always been a series where it’s as difficult as you make it,” he says. “There are broken builds that you can use… There are full-blown mechanics that are there to help you through difficult challenges. With summoning, you can just use a Mimic Tear to help you go through a boss.”</p>

<p id="cG33gX">Most of the time, when a niche series breaks through to the mainstream, it’s because something about the latest game has become more accessible. Compared to older games, <em>Elden Ring</em> appears to fit that bill. The shift to open-world mechanics means that, unlike in some prior FromSoftware games, you don’t have to repeatedly bash your head against a wall if you’re stuck. You can go and take on something simpler, get stronger, and then come back to that initial challenging section and perhaps overcome it. But rather than doubling down on what made <em>Elden Ring</em> so approachable in the name of catering to these fans, FromSoftware has tried to thread the needle. While <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is, as mentioned by the Eurogamer review, more explicit about where to go or what to do, overall, the DLC is much more punishing on the player, especially when it comes to bosses. Sure, you can hop into a battle with <em>both </em>an in-game summon and your Mimic Tear at the same time, but the foe waiting on the other side of the fog mist still packs a wild multi-hit combo that can one-shot you.</p>

<p id="Ph1ADm">The emphasis on challenge is so pronounced this time that it has encouraged the now larger player base to be softer with one another. Rather than defining this larger community, the vocal assholes are now far more outnumbered and seen for exactly what they are. FromSoftware, meanwhile, gets to enjoy the successes of creating a blockbuster without having to compromise the vision that built the genre in the first place. </p>
<p id="y5aZOB">“If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn’t the right approach,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">Miyazaki told The Guardian in an interview</a>. “Had we taken that approach, I don’t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy – which, in my eyes, would break the game itself.” </p>

This Unique spell will heal your party’s HP, MP, <em>and </em>raise everyone’s stats by one stage whenever it’s used. The MP healing is relatively minor, but it still restores ~35 MP per party member once her <strong>Oath of Plenteousness </strong>passive activates (which technically requires just one cast of Sakura Sakura). This spell is a flat-out upgrade of Idun’s Unique Golden Apple spell, which is already very good. Sakuya Sakura even has the same MP cost, despite also providing MP regen.<br></p><p>The only arguably negative trait of Konohana Sakura is that her Magic stat is good, but less than Idun’s. Also, you’ll likely want to cover her Thunder weakness with <strong>Resist Elec</strong>, which can be hard to access via Essences early on. Otherwise, she’s a very good demon that you’ll almost certainly take with you into the endgame just for the sheer turn economy that Sakura Sakura provides. You certainly don’t need Konohana Sakura to beat <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, but if you have her, enjoy her and the crazy buffs she can apply!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda Softworks did not always publish the beloved post-apocalyptic RPG game series Fallout. The game’s original creators are Interplay Entertainment, and they were responsible for delivering the first title in 1997. Recently, a series co-creator spoke about what it would take to bring him back to Fallout. Learn more about what he said below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timothy Cain, the highly revered American video game developer and one of the co-creators of Fallout, is a passionate advocate for game development. His substantial presence on YouTube is a testament to his dedication, as he regularly speaks about various aspects of game development. His recent videos have touched on making games, cancelling Fallout Van Buren, writing good NPCs, and much more. Notably, Cain published a video yesterday discussing what it would take to bring him back to Fallout.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Would I Work On Fallout Again?" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c21OGTOoxso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cain starts by stating that “Would I work on Fallout again?” has been among his most frequently asked questions in the past few months. He explains that the answer is more “complicated” than we think. The first thing Cain wants to know is whether he will be remaking the first Fallout from a 3D perspective, creating a remake like New Vegas, or maybe Fallout 5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cain explains that every RPG he has worked on till now has had something new and different to offer, which was nothing related to “money, power, authority” or anything along those lines. It was “the game itself” that captivated his interests and got him motivated. He says that was also one of the reasons why he didn’t work on Fallout 2, as it wasn’t adding anything new for him, and he doesn’t like working on sequels. Cain spoke about this before giving examples of what games like Wildstar, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodline, Dungeons and Dragons and more offered him in terms of “something new”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 4 - Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5aJfebzkrM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cain added that he had been approached for several games and decided not to work on them because there was nothing new for him to experience. He has had people asking him to “work on a new IP” or be a “director again”, but that is not something that interests him. Cain also spoke about how money is a factor, and he wants to be paid according to his experience and accolades in the industry. So there you have it; if Bethesda wants Timothy Cain on the next Fallout title, they need to serve him something “new” to get him on board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of Fallout, we recently saw a collaboration between the Bethesda RPG and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-dutys-fallout-update-goes-live-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-next-fallout-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard has stated</a> that they don’t wish to “rush” the next title. What do you think about Timothy Cain’s requirement to return to Fallout? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-meet-the-jans-aka-the-many-alternate-reality-versions-of-yourself-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you ever ran into another version of yourself? What you’d say? How they’d act? What kind of haircut they’d have? Whether or not you’d be proud of them, and vice versa? How their life would be different from yours? Where they live, what they do for work, who they are?</p><p>Well, imagine being stranded on a hostile planet and having to create, manage, and work with several versions of yourself to survive. That’s the predicament Jan Dolski finds himself in in The Alters, the latest from This War of Mine creator 11 bit Studios. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-branching-narrative-explained-ign-first"><u>In a previous interview with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz and lead designer Rafał Włosek</u></a>, we talked about how The Alters handles branching narratives, but what about the alters themselves? Who are they?</p><p>To truly understand The Alters, you need to, well… understand the alters. To do that, we played the Steam demo so we could meet a couple of them in person, and then sat down with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz one more time to get a better idea of who the other Jans were, how many of them there are, and perhaps most importantly, how they interact with you and each other. The interview that follows has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN: We’re going to encounter a ton of other Jans on our journey. Can you talk about building a character whose branching paths could lead to such dramatically different people?</strong></p><p><strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz:</strong> When designing the character of Jan, we really wanted to create the everyman type of character. We felt this way it would be easier for people to relate to him, understand his backstory and the choices that he has made in the past and the choices that shaped him. And it was crucial for Jan's background to have those points of regret, because from these points we can branch into drastically different scenarios of how his life could turn out if he had made some different choices along the way.</p><p><strong>IGN: So far we’ve seen the Technician, the Botanist, the Refiner, and the Miner. How many Jans can we expect to run into in The Alters? How did you go about deciding what these different types of Jans would be, and how they’d impact The Alters?</strong></p><p>We needed to build a variety of Jans, not only for gameplay reasons, but also to create a compelling story of Jan and truly dive into the topic of the “what if?” question. Different alters, have very different skill set that strongly affects your strategy in the game. You can't create all possible alters in a single playthrough. So the decision on who you bring on board will affect the way you handle the base and how you handle your objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Having various sets of characters with very different personalities will strongly affect our story and also create very different dynamics between Jans. When it comes to how many alters we can create, when you look at the cover of the game, there are 11 characters and I think it gives a good sense of magnitude. But we have some surprises up our sleeves about that. So I don't want to spoil the fun, and I think I will leave it at that.</p><p><strong>IGN: Based on the demo, the first Jan you’ll create is the Technician, who is basically just a more competent version of our Jan, despite taking a very different, less traditional path at an early age. Why did you choose to start off with the Technician?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>We decided to start with the Technician because, in many ways, he is the polar opposite of the main Jan and he is more competent in some ways, while at the same time, he can be quite flawed in others. But what's interesting about him is he always keeps challenging our Jan. That's why he's so useful at the very early stage of the game when we are onboarding the player with the whole idea of engaging in the relationship with your alters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Jan and the Technician, they branched out quite early in their life paths. The Technician is someone who stayed with his family. He stood up to their abusive father, something that the main Jan was never able to do. And that's why he's a very important axis of the story of our main Jan because that's one of his biggest regrets that he has.</p><p><strong>IGN: One of the immediate differences between Technician Jan and our Jan is that Technician Jan is a little more standoffish, and much more assertive, which seems like it came from the decision to stand up to Jan’s father, and has influenced a lot of his decisions since. Can you talk about how the decisions each Jan makes influence not only their skills and profession but as a person, and how we might see that play out?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>From the point of branching between Jans, their lives can go in very different directions. It's like this butterfly effect where changing one little decision can affect your entire life and in the end make you a different person. So understanding those differences helps us understand alters as people, and in the end, helps us effectively manage our crew.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Different Jans can react to our decisions in different ways. For example, one of them can expect us to be a very efficient and mission-oriented leader. While the other might want us to be more empathetic towards the rest of the crew. And pleasing everyone won't be easy, if not impossible. </p><p><strong>IGN: As you interact with the Jans, you can see their responses in real-time, and that seems to determine their reactions to what you see and how they view you. Can you talk about how your choices affect your relationships with the Jans or influence their behavior?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>The alters have their emotional state that affects how they work, how they behave. And if it's not managed well, it can lead to some drastic results, including rebelling against us. We can influence their emotions both through economic strategic decisions that we make, and also through interactions.</p><p>A big part of the game is dialogue, and actually, every dialogue choice in the game affects the emotional state of our alters. So it is crucial to understand who they are, and where they're coming from, because different approaches can work better with different alters. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN: The more Jans you get, the more complicated it seems those relationships will become. Can you talk about how the Jans react to other Jans? Do you have to mediate disputes? Do they get jealous if you don’t hang out with one of them enough or become friends with another Jan they don’t like?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>The more Jans we create, the more different dynamics between them are generated, and that can of course lead to fights and arguments. We have a chance to intervene or pick one of the sides. For example, alters can argue about the quality of food in the base. One can think we should invest in a better quality to food while the other thinks that this is a waste of precious resources. So every time we make a promise, we need to make sure we can fulfill it, otherwise there will be consequences.</p><p><strong>IGN: Speaking of getting along, a large part of whether Jan and the other Jans get along seems to be shared experience, which you can track via the quantum computer in the base. Jan bonds with the Technician by trying to recreate the pierogi their mom made when they were kids. Is it harder to relate to the other Jans if your common experiences diverge more drastically, and if so, how do you deal with that?</strong></p><p>The relationship between Jans is always about what we have in common, but also what makes us different. And that can lead to both emerging conflicts, but also it can help us in resolving them. So no matter how far different Jans are from each other on the branches of the tree of life, there is always something we share. There is always something we have in common. It’s just that, sometimes, it will require us to do a little bit more digging to find this common ground.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: Can you tell us about the other Jans, and give us some insight into what we might expect of them? Do you have a favorite Jan that you’re excited for players to meet?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>With Jans you can expect the unexpected. We put a lot of effort into creating these multi-layered characters that you'll uncover piece by piece. At first, when you learn the life path of one of the Jans, you feel like you understand that character just by knowing what he went through. But then you go deeper and deeper and you are uncovering different surprises in not just his outlook on things, but also how he behaves, how he interacts with us, and how he interacts with other alters.</p><p>I do have a favorite alter, although it's a bit like picking your favorite child. [Whispers] It's the scientist.</p><p><strong>IGN: Obviously, it might be a little weird if several Jan Dolskis came back from this mission. Is that something we see the Jans discuss? Does that cause friction in the group? How do they deal with that?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>Between alters, there is this question of “what's going to happen to us?  What is our future? Do we even have a future?” And the closer we get to actually going back home ,this question will raise more and more tension inside the base. Different alters are different people, so they also differ in their outlook on this topic. That will put even more pressure on us as a captain regarding what are we going to do about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: This question may be a bit silly, but can I create multiple versions of the same Jan? Can I have five Technician Jans running around if I want to?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>Something we knew very early on in development was that we don't want to allow to create multiple versions of the same alter. First of all, the game was never really about cloning. So multiplication of the same character, it's an extremely interesting topic, but it's just not the topic of our game. But most importantly, we always wanted alters to feel like real people with real emotions and real stories. We were afraid that making too many of them would make them more of an NPC or a unit in the game rather than a character with his own thoughts and emotions. So we felt that increasing the number of them might, in the end, reduce their significance as individuals.</p><p><strong>IGN: Is there anything we haven’t covered about the Jans that you’d like folks to know about?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> I think the biggest surprises about the alters lie in their backstories, in their storylines, in the situations they can generate. So we really can't wait for the players to start unraveling it all and start making their own decisions about the shape of their crew, about what alters they bring on board, in what order, and most importantly, what decisions they make about the alters and about the fate of our main Jan.</p><p>Our month of exclusive IGN First content is almost over.
