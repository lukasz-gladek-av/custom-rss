<p>In a post on social media, OpTic expressed kind sentiments at everything Kenny has done for OpTic Texas since joining the starting roster, before parting ways with the veteran Call of Duty pro player. In recent weeks, OpTic Texas has struggled immeasurably, securing one of the worst records in COD esports history by hitting a 0-18 map streak before landing a win against LAG M8.</p>



<p>Amidst the losses, Kenny showed up as one of the worst players in the squad. He dropped a 0.3 KD series record against Toronto Ultra a few days back, prompting (more) fans to demand his cancellation from the roster.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been revealed who will be taking Kenny’s spot as Major II approaches.</p>

<h2 id="h-desperate-times">Desperate Times</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas went from a world championship win to the bottom of the table in the last few weeks. The team hit a cursed streak and failed to win a single map out of eighteen straight rounds, prompting major concerns from fans worldwide. Kenny was often found footing the blame, with many critical CDL viewers stressing that he was the catalyst for many of the team’s issues.</p>



<p>Here’s the post from OpTic that surfaced on social media today:</p>



<div><article><p><span>A true World Champion, in and out of the game. We’re grateful for the leadership and legacy you’ve built with OpTic

Thank you, </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Kuavo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Kuavo</a><span> 🦖 </span></p></article></div>







<p>As for who <strong>could </strong>replace Kenny on OpTic Texas, one of the leading suggestions is Cesar ‘Skyz’ Bueno, of LAG M8 fame. It was a few days back that Skyz was benched, being locked out of the starting roster on LAG M8 with an impending drop sitting on the horizon. In the most recent regular match the team played, Skyz was out of the picture, and Lunarz and Priestahhh stood up instead.</p>



<p>During the 2023 season, Skyz was part of the Subliners roster that tore up the CDL, landing Major chips and a world championship title. The grand final of COD Champs was a sweep by the Subliners, with the team securing a 5-0 win over Toronto Ultra in record time.</p>



<p>Who would you like to see replace Kenny on OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

                <p>Despite being more than 20 years old, the GameCube controller remains stubbornly popular with Nintendo fans, especially when it comes to certain games. A new FCC filing by Nintendo has some fans speculating that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> might receive some kind of GameCube controller support, but it's unclear if the connection is valid or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Over at <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/new-fcc-filing-discovered-that-looks-a-lot-like-a-gamecube-nso-controller.12879/#post-1660543" rel="nofollow ">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/switch-2-gamecube-controller-rumours-resurface-following-new-nintendo-filing" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a>), fans reacted to a FCC filing from Nintendo that tackled game controllers. Fans noticed that the model number prefix attached is BEE, which corresponds to the Switch 2. A mockup of a "wireless Bluetooth controller" led one fan to overlay the GameCube controller over it, concluding that the controller may be some kind of wireless GameCube controller for the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Some other fans argued that the mockup could be for the Switch 2 Pro Controller, but the original poster argued that this controller lacks NFC functionality, which a hypothetical Pro Controller would almost certainly have.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Nintendo has already released wireless versions of classic video game controllers for its retro-focused Switch Online subscription service, including the NES, SNES, N64, and Genesis controllers. However, we don't have GameCube games on Switch Online as of yet, making them a possible addition.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unclear if we'll get any answers to this question at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct</a> at the beginning of April, but we'll keep you posted with any updates we get.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/17/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>When you love something a lot, it can be hard to see it change. The Atelier&nbsp;series has held onto a pretty strict and consistent style and vibe for over a decade of yearly entries. Yet, in the opening hours of&nbsp;Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;so much of that has changed. The style is sharper, the vibe is a bit more serious, and the titular alchemist doesn’t even own a giant cauldron! I was shook by these changes at first, since they betrayed that cozy, slice-of-life, Kiki’s Delivery Service-adjacent tone that made me fall in love with the series. Dozens of hours, hundreds of battles, and thousands of alchemy sessions later, I can confidently say that this is an incredible step forward into the exciting unknown for the&nbsp;Atelier&nbsp;franchise.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land - Gameplay Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4HUccrhww6E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the last three entries in the series were a tightly interconnected trilogy focused on alchemist <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/23/atelier-ryza-3-review-alchemist-of-the-end-the-secret-key/">Ryza</a>, the Atelier franchise has more traditionally dropped new protagonists into shared settings and arcs to create its series. Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is perhaps the freshest start the franchise has ever seen. It feels a lot more comparable to the changes you see in-between each main Final Fantasy release. Some minor concepts and iconic creatures remain, but our protagonist Yumia is an entirely different kind of alchemist in an entirely different kind of world. For one, she’s the only known alchemist alive as the art of alchemy previously spiralled out of control, tore the region apart, and the society that rebuilt itself banned alchemy entirely. Official texts on alchemy have been lost or destroyed, and generations have grown up with no knowledge of the art, leading to either suspicion or fear when the subject is brought up.</p>


<p>Atelier games almost always focus on a quirky outcast, but the context behind Yumia’s disconnect from society is so much more dour. It makes it all the more inspiring and endearing when she keeps a bright smile and a goofy sense of humour throughout it all, and seeing her slowly win over and recruit her crew of companions feels so much more impactful because of how distant she is from them at first. Scheming villains, ancient underground constructs, and magic MacGuffins do eventually come up in the story, but at it’s core the game is about researching and rediscovering the ruins of a lost civilization, and helping bring the current community together in the process. That theme of understanding the past to connect with the present is really profound, and even if the game has lost a lot of the silly, slice-of-life charm from prior entries, it still ends up being just as heartfelt and touching.</p>


<p>Now, here’s a secret that nobody is strong enough to admit: the Atelier Ryza&nbsp;trilogy perfected the blend of action combat and turn-based battles. When I first played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/29/atelier-ryza-ever-darkness-the-secret-hideout-review-switch-ps4-pc/">the debut Ryza game</a>, I quipped that it had the fast-paced turn-based combat that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/04/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review/">Yakuza: Like A Dragon</a>&nbsp;deserved. Atelier Yumia proves that this wasn’t a lucky fluke, and that the team at Gust are truly ahead of the game when it comes to developing truly inventive and unique battle systems that blend fluid &nbsp;and fast action with traditional turn-based charm.</p>
<p>In this game, battles take place in a sort of circular setup where your foes are in the middle while you &amp; your party stand in a ring surrounding them. You’ve got different attacks mapped to your four face buttons, along with the ability to either move around the ring or swiftly dodge across it to avoid enemy attacks. You can even step into an outer-ring at any time that changes all of your skills to ranged versions with different properties. At first, it’s all a bit button-mashy, with your only clear goal being to properly dodge enemy attacks and AOE indicators. Eventually the sub-systems at play start to click together – you realise how you can match an attack property to an enemy weakness to stun them, how to swap in party members for dodge assists, and how you can use alchemy items to turn the tide of an otherwise insurmountable battle. Combat is fun and fast, and a refreshing pace-enhancer in-between quiet moments of alchemy and exploration.</p>

<p>Exploration and alchemy in Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land have also seen a significant shift compared to prior entries. This is easily the broadest open-world entry in the franchise to date – regions are massive and sprawling, with sharp cliffs to explore and dense tunnels to investigate. Villages and encampments are spread out across the world map, giving you lots of reasons to explore every corner. With zip lines, triple-jumps, and even an alchemy-powered motorcycle, Yumia has a bunch of tools at her disposal that make the pure act of exploring and traveling satisfying like no other entry in the series. You’ll be gathering items as you explore that can naturally be used in alchemy, a system that has had a major visual revamp.</p>
<p>Yumia alchemizes by swaying her body and combining crystals full of memory and essence, something that turns into a really lavish visual representation of an otherwise familiar item-combination system. Some elements of alchemy, like the stat bonuses you’d traditionally get on an item via certain material qualities, have been moved into dedicated tools like the Trait Blender, making alchemy itself a touch simpler without sacrificing the depth of it.</p>

<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land&nbsp;is a fresh step forward with just as much charm and joy as the rest of the series. It’s a major shift in tone and style, which a lot of day-one fans of the franchise may not be able to acclimate to. Despite all that, though, the charm of the franchise and the heart of it all is still present alongside incredible new combat, endlessly enjoyable exploration, and an iconic cast of characters I never wanted to say goodbye to.</p>

            <p>
Silent Games and Secret Mode have announced that their acrobatic, pensive action-RPG Empyreal will launch on 8th May, with a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1377700/view/511825409340344357?l=english">still available on Steam</a>. I hadn't come across Empyreal before, but I already have Opinions, mostly positive. Firstly, the fonts for damage number pop-ups are... weirdly stringy, given the heft and colour of the character models and environments. There's barely any meat on them. It makes me feel like I'm beating up a checkout machine, not thwacking golems. 
</p>
<p>
Secondly, I quite like the looks of the game's four biomes, which "reflect certain philosophical principles", in the words of game director James Rogers. Going by fleeting glimpses from the below seven minute overview video, there's a Nature world and a Technology world and a dessicated biome that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rime">Rime</a>, with a scalding blue sky that consists of tumbledown hexagonal plates.

The biomes are housed inside a huge alien Monolith. Your job, as an "elite mercenary" equipped with a choice of wizardly halberds, hipfiring railguns and spells on cooldown, is to investigate that monolith and duff up ancient robots while excavating the mysteries of a lost civilisation. The lost civilisation may yet harbour certain lessons for the "modern world", including the idea of history as a journey towards some greater goal. I probably don't need to tell you that it also harbours a lot of loot. Hopefully you'll be able to easily distinguish the stuff you want to smash/turn into shoulder pads from the bits that plug into the grander narrative themes.
</p>
<p>
The third-person combat puts me a little in mind of the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a>, though it doesn't have the latter's real-time physics and destruction. I think it looks fun, though I find certain animations a bit jerky.</p>
<p>The spread of realms, meanwhile, makes me think of Gunfire's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/remnant-2">Remnant 2</a>. Unlike the Gunfire game, however, Empyreal doesn't have procedurally generated environments. The layouts are hand-made, but you can alter their chemistry by means of items called Cartograms, which determine the overall odds and the kinds of enemies and drops you'll encounter, and can be gifted to other players. I like the sounds of this. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> has a similar system involving tarot cards.
</p>
<p>
You can also gift players pieces of equipment through dimensional tears after felling bosses, and stumble upon their kneeling spectres via the asymmetrical online functionality, as in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, but it's a single player experience on the whole. Story seems to arrive by way of the NPCs you'll chat to at your base outside the Monolith - each has their own questline with several endings.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-gets-gruesome-new-details-in-esrb-rating-and-content-warnings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Some not-so-light reading.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">New details about what's in store for the horrors waiting within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> have emerged, and they make it clear that developer NeoBards Entertainment is keeping in step with the series' tone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> The following descriptions contain some gruesome details about the content of Silent Hill f, which will entail possible spoilers and mature content.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami aired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-transmission-march-2025-everything-announced-and-revealed-including-silent-hill-f">its latest Silent Hill Transmission broadcast just last week</a>, sharing more details about the upcoming Silent Hill f. Developed by NeoBards, set in a mountain town in 1960s Japan, and written by Higurashi and Umineko author Ryukishi07, Silent Hill f looks to be an interesting new venture for the horror series.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The broadcast didn't include much in the way of gameplay though. In lieu of that, fans have been poring over the content warnings and ESRB rating for Silent Hill f, both of which are live and provide some surprisingly detailed descriptions of what terrors wait in the town of Ebisugaoka.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the ESRB site, Silent Hill f garnered a Mature 17+ rating for "Blood and Gore, Intense Violence, Partial Nudity." None of that by itself is terribly surprising, but it's the rating summary that offers some more detail:</p><blockquote>"This is a survival-horror action game in which players assume the role of a student confronting supernatural entities in a 1960s Japanese mountain town. From a third-person perspective, players explore the town, solve puzzles, interact with characters, and battle enemy creatures (e.g., humanoid monsters, mutants, mythical creatures). </blockquote><blockquote>"Players use axes, crowbars, knives, and spears to defend against and kill enemy creatures in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as characters are attacked; several areas depict large bloodstains in the environment and near corpses. Some enemy attacks can result in players' character getting impaled in the neck and/or getting their faces ripped apart. </blockquote><blockquote>"Cutscenes sometimes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a character burned alive inside a cage; a woman branded by a hot iron; entrails and sinew displayed on serving platters in fantastical celebration/ceremony; a character sawing off her own arm; a character slicing off portions of a character's face during a ritual. Concept art depicts a nude mannequin-like character, with exposed buttocks and partially exposed breasts; the character appears in a creature-like form throughout the game."</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Faces ripped apart, hot irons, and a character sawing off their arm certainly paint a gruesome picture. Silent Hill f could get pretty gnarly, even by Silent Hill's standards. It is, after all, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-the-first-in-konamis-horror-series-to-get-an-18-rating-in-japan">the first game in the series to earn a CERO:Z in Japan</a>, an 18+ rating; the others have typically garnered CERO:C or CERO:D, which are 15+ and 17+, respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f may also be dealing with some heavy topics and imagery too. For that, we can look at the game's content warning, displayed on both <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/us/en/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official site</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam store page</a>:</p><blockquote>"This game contains depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence. This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved. If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Silent Hill f Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the actual physical horror and tackling these kinds of themes, Silent Hill f certainly seems like it's engaging with the kind of material you'd expect in a Silent Hill. For horror fans, that's hopefully a good sign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill f has no release date at the moment, though having an ESRB rating this detailed certainly suggests it's not far off. It's currently targeting PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC when it does launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Raghoebardajal said in the video the AI Aloy was a prototype designed alongside Guerrilla Games to demonstrate what could be possible with the technology.</p><p dir="ltr">Burch took to TikTok over the weekend to say she had seen the leaked video and that Guerrilla Games had reached out to let her know that the AI tech demo did not use any of Burch's performance data (voice and motion capture) and was not a project that was in active development. But that didn't change the fact that Burch said the video made her worried, not about Guerrilla, Aloy, or her career specifically, but about game performance as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">"I feel worried about game performance as an art form," Burch said.</p><p dir="ltr">She went on to outline why the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), of which she is a member, is currently on strike</a> as they seek protections and compensation for the use of AI in games based on an actor's likeness or performance.</p><p dir="ltr">“I feel worried not because the technology exists," Burch said. "Not even because game companies want to use it. Of course they do. They always want to use technological advancements. I just imagine a video like this coming out that does have someone’s performance attached to it, that does have someone’s voice or face or movement. And the possibility that if we lose this fight, that person would have no recourse. They wouldn’t have any protections--anyway to fight back. And that possibility, it makes me so sad it hurts my heart. It scares me. I love this industry and this art form so much and I want there to be a new generation of actors. I want there to be so many more incredible game performances. I want to be able to continue to do this job. If we don’t win, that future is really compromised."</p><p dir="ltr">Burch went on to say that she was not trying to call out any game company, or Guerrilla, specifically in her video and said the technology in and of itself is not the problem. Instead, she said the problem is that bargaining groups involved in the strike won't agree to "common-sense protections" that would help to protect the longevity of game performance as a career.</p><p dir="ltr">"I believe we deserve to be protected," Burch said.</p><p dir="ltr">Burch's comments come as AI becomes an increasingly hot topic in the game industry. In December 2024, Activision confirmed it had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-character-recast-after-players-expressed-concern-about-new-voices" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recast some members of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Zombies cast</a> amid the ongoing SAG-AFTRA strike. Meanwhile, some game companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-clarifies-its-stance-on-using-ai-in-games/1100-6527867/" data-ref-id="1100-6527867">Remedy Entertainment have issued statements to clarify their stance on AI</a>, with Remedy specifically stating it would not use it to replace creative jobs or actors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/empyreal-action-rpg-to-launch-on-may-8-at-budget-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Secret Mode and independent developer Silent Games have announced the release date of Empyreal. The third-person action RPG will debut on May 8 and will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X for a budget price of £24.99/$29.99/€29.99. It's also the first game to be published by Secret Mode since they split from Sumo Group earlier this month to become an independent publisher.</p>
<p>The news was accompanied by an overview trailer where Silent Games Co-Founder and Creative Director Joseph Rogers explained what players can expect from Empyreal when it comes to the setting and overarching theme:</p>
<p><em>The game begins with your arrival on an unexplored planet to join an expedition that's discovered a monolith built by a lost ancient civilization. You are immediately presented with these grand questions: why is it here? Who built it? What was its original purpose, and perhaps even what power might it still contain? As you progress through the story, you'll explore themes and ideas about humanity's place in the cosmos. Some of these themes have largely fallen out of favor in the modern world, things like duty, sacrifice, a tragic view of life, a sense of civilizational impetus, the idea that humanity is on a journey through history and that there is a purpose to that.</em></p>
<p><em>As you uncover what this ancient civilization managed to achieve, the question you have to consider is whether this still has relevance to the modern world despite all of its technological advancements. Has the modern world forgotten some things that are important to humanity?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rogers also revealed that while Empyreal is strictly a single player action RPG, there are some asynchronous cooperative elements. For instance, after defeating a boss, players have the option to send an item into the Aether so that it might find its way to another player. There is no specific reward for doing this, so it's left to the goodwill of the community to help fellow adventurers.</p>
<p>Our Francesco De Meo recently went hands on with a preview build of the game and relayed positive impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-hands-on-preview-an-arpg-of-a-different-kind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the article</a>:</p>
<p><em>With what seems to be a deep loot system that will allow for the creation of some specialized builds, as highlighted by the three end-game builds that can be used in the demo, and a unique approach to action combat, Empyreal definitely has the chance to stand out among the competition, especially if the developer manages to iron out some issues</em></p>

With more burst maneuverability than any other Strategist (only Loki’s clone teleport offers more instant safety, but it’s on a much longer cooldown), it is common for skilled Rocket players to finish the match with very few deaths (if any) while offering a ton of healing and assists. Use his dash, glide, and wall-climbing abilities to find hard-to-reach places, then shoot healing balls down on allies. You don’t need to be close to heal them.</p><figure id="" data-id="0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-recommend-id="image://0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-recommend-id="image://0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Place buffing machines like B.R.B. out of the way, so they won’t be destroyed, but close enough to objectives to let the resurrected teammate join the battle again quickly.

<p>PlayStation has a new first-party studio under PlayStation Studios called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being led by former Call of Duty Zombies lead Jason Blundell.</p>



<p>The name of the studio was confirmed by Blundell in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Jeff Gerstmann</a> that was published on Monday.</p>



<p>“The studio is called Dark Outlaw,” Blundell said. “We’ve been working away in the shadows for a while, when we’ve got something to talk about we’ll step out into the light.”</p>



<p>As far as the secrecy behind the studio’s creation, Blundell says the story is about the game and not the studio. He added that doing it under the Sony umbrella is a “privilege”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio, Sony doesn’t start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling,” Blundell said while adding that the studio is making new hirings for the development of its first game.</p>



<p>Those new hires could be for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unannounced live service multiplayer game</a> that began making the rounds. According to the recent job postings, this new game is still early in its development—that’s even if it’s the same game at all.</p>



<p>Most details surrounding the studio, aside from its name and who’s leading it, remain…dark.</p>

And so Dark Outlaw Games have been working away in the shadows for a while, and when we’ve got something to talk about, we’ll step out into the light. But you know the story for me is about the game, not about the studio, so the reason why we’re not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, ‘let’s get something,’ right?”</p><p>Blundell continued, “And it’s such a privilege to be able to do it with with Sony as a new first-party studio. You know, Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. So to have to have that privilege is humbling—it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</p><p>As for how far along the studio’s first game is, Blundell remained tight-lipped.</p><p>“[We’re currently] staffing up, keeping it kind of lowkey—been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we’re doing exactly, but it’s like we talked about—getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right, let’s test those—you know, I’m a programmer at heart—so let’s test those assumptions, and you know, ‘is it working?'”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>He went on, “It’s very exciting and I love the fact still, at this point in my career, I’m given these opportunities. And it’s always that desire to want to put that one extra disc on the wall, if you will, and can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs or [something] exciting or dangerous. That makes me jump out of bed every morning.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Silent Games and publisher Secret Mode have announced that its upcoming single-player action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/empyreal/" data-ref-id="5000-651867">Empyreal</a> will be released on May 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. On a distant world where humanity has discovered a strange monolith built by a lost civilization, players will explore this location while mastering various weapons and RPG systems.</p><p>In a developer diary, creative director Joseph Rogers went into more detail on the game, describing it as a third-person game about "transcendental revelations" that players will discover as they venture deeper into the monolith. Thematically, Empyreal asks questions about the human condition, its place in the cosmos, and whether societal systems like duty and honor are still driving forces in humanity's story.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gRQlppV4vM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to gameplay, Empyreal combines action-RPG systems with elements inspired by isometric-ARPG games like Diablo. Similarly to games in this genre, you'll be free to invest in various skills, but you can only have a handful of them available to use at any given time, so you will need to mix and match the abilities to suit your playstyle.</p><p>This works with three distinct weapon types that drastically change combat, as there'll be a big emphasis on constantly fine-tuning your character throughout your journey. Silent Games added that Empyreal will also offer an endgame experience with a substantial amount of content, as well as a New Game Plus mode with features exclusive to a fresh run.</p><p>Other interesting parts of the game include cartograms that can shake up a level and help you chase after specific loot, and there's also the option to be charitable toward fellow players. Defeating certain bosses will result in a rip in the fabric of reality, and if you feel like donating some gear, you can send something through this tear to another player.</p><p>Any item sent through will significantly increase its stats, but this is purely a gesture of goodwill as you'll get nothing from it.

                <p>Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell's first major post-Activision project was the PlayStation-partnered Deviation Games, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-partnered-studio-from-ex-cod-devs-has-closed/1100-6521774/" data-ref-id="1100-6521774">opened and closed without even announcing or releasing a game</a>. Now Blundell is starting a new company with PlayStation.</p><p>Blundell said in an interview with Jeff Gerstmann that he's starting Dark Outlaw Games, which is a new studio inside of PlayStation Studios. "We've been working away in the shadows for a while. When we've got something to talk about we'll step out into the light," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-has-formed-new-studio-dark-outlaw-games-with-call-of-duty-zombies-lead-jason-blundell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LY37_Cenui4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Blundell said it's "such a privilege" to be the newest first-party PlayStation studio. "Sony doesn't start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling," he said.</p><p>As mentioned, this isn't Blundell's first go-around with Sony. In 2021, Deviation Games signed a partnership with Sony to create a new IP that would exclusive to PlayStation. Another Call of Duty veteran, Dave Anthony, founded Deviation with Blundell. However, Blundell left the company in 2022, with a round of layoffs following in 2023, before the company closed its doors for good in 2024 without its first game ever even being announced.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Dark Outlaw is making for Sony. As for Blundell, he was instrumental in the creation of Call of Duty's massively popular Zombies mode during his time at Treyarch. He worked on a number of Call of Duty games over the years, and he directed 2015's Black Ops 3.</p>

            <p>What's going on in the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the NetEase hero shooter that is forecast to get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">two new heroes every three month season</a>, and thus stands to double its starting roster of 33 heroes providing it stays afloat for at least four years? The word on the street is that they're adding new Team-Up skills in Season 2, beginning 11th April - and when I say "the word on the street", I mean it's been officially confirmed by game director Guangyun Chen. I apologise, I will try not to sound like a cool reporter again.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The content for Season 2 is ready and set to go," Chen observed in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-growing-roster-of-heroes-scares-me-but-the-games-director-seems-sure-that-all-is-under-control-everything-is-progressing-smoothly/">Peter Parker Gamer</a>. "The designs for Seasons 3 and 4 have also been completed and are currently under intensive development! Overall, everything is progressing smoothly."</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been progressing smoothly for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">the people they laid off last month</a>, and let's not forget about NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-plan-to-reset-ranks-mid-season-hastily-abandoned-in-the-face-of-player-revolt">suddenly junking plans to reset player ranks mid-season following an outcry</a>. But Marvel Rivals continues to attract droves of players.</p>
<p>The game's first season added the Fantastic Four to the line-up - which, the mathematicians amongst you may notice, is actually double the anticipated rollout speed for new heroes. NetEase have yet to reveal Season 2's offerings - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conspiracy-was-briefly-afoot-in-the-marvel-rivals-community-following-netease-hero-plant-rumours">beware the rumour-mongers</a> - but the game's Gallery Cards suggest that half-vampire Blade is one of the new heroes.</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, than the introduction of new heroes is the addition of new Team-Ups. As the name suggests, these see characters merging their abilities for beaucoup superheroism. I haven't played a lot of Marvel Rivals lately but I'm intrigued by how Team-Ups seem to be serving as a pressure release valve for the balancing. Given the rate at which they're injecting new blood, and given that Marvel's archives harbour thousands of heroes with very mismatched capabilities, NetEase have their work cut out for them ensuring that nobody is either too strong or useless. Team-Ups are helpful here because a weaker hero can still contribute to a match by joining a powerful Team-Up.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are more arcane multiplayer balancing getarounds than this, but I enjoy it regardless. I will attempt to carry on enjoying it when I next sign in and am immediately shredded by a Symbiote Bond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-passes-s1mple-in-major-counter-strike-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike GOAT debate may never end, but French prodigy Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut has reasserted his case, passing a record held by the one and only Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. However, it could very well be CS2’s fastest rising star that eventually claims the record for himself.</p>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-sets-counter-strike-record-for-most-tournament-mvp-trophies">ZywOo Sets Counter-Strike Record for Most Tournament MVP Trophies</h2>



<p>At ESL Pro League Season 21, Vitality added their second trophy of the year to their case, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming IEM Katowice</a> just a month prior. ZywOo was named MVP of both tournaments by HLTV, bringing his MVP career total to 22, passing s1mple’s record of 2021. </p>



<p>To put in perspective how dominant s1mple was in his prime, his most recent MVP award was from IEM Cologne 2022. He hasn’t won an MVP award in more than two years, while ZywOo has won a staggering nine since the start of 2023, and only now has the French superstar finally passed s1mple. S1mple still owns the record for most MVP awards won in a single year, after winning eight in 2021, the same year where he finally won the Major. Both s1mple and ZywOo are also tied with just a single Major win, but ZywOo is in the better position to win a second considering how dominant Vitality is looking to start 2025.</p>



<p>“I’m one ahead of s1mple,” ZywOo <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/41218/zywoo-i-wont-stop-just-because-i-am-one-in-front-of-s1mple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told HLTV</a> after winning ESL Pro League Season 21. “I will just keep going, keep grinding, and I will never stop just because I am one in front. I will just show I can go 25, 30 MVPs.”</p>



<p>Right now s1mple’s career is at a crossroads. The 27-year-old is still officially on the NAVI bench, and hasn’t played in a professional match since November during his loan to Falcons. Either ZywOo will set a standard so high that no one will catch it, or a new contender for GOAT status will emerge. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2s-biggest-superstar-donk-dazzles-in-first-match-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The player many are watching out for is Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</a>, the rising star of Team Spirit, after a 2024 rookie campaign that saw him win a record-breaking Major and five MVP awards. Still, even if he maintains the pace he set last year, it will take him years to catch up to ZywOo’s record, and that’s assuming the French star stops winning. And given that he’s still only 24, I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>



<p>Will any player ever catch ZywOo’s MVP numbers? Is he the GOAT of Counter-Strike? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
