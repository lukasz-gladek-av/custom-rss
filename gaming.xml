			<p>Last week, <strong>Amazon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/">announced that it had cast <strong>Ryan Hurst</strong> to play <strong>Kratos</strong></a> in its upcoming <strong>God of War TV series</strong>. Shortly after that, it confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer</strong> would be playing <strong>Sif</strong> in the series</a>, which gave us more of an insight into how the show is approaching the God of War story. Now, a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">Deadline</a> has confirmed that <strong>Max Parker</strong> will play <strong>Heimdall</strong>, giving us a bit more insight into the show's story. But it seems that a report from <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">NerdBot</a> spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qenyu0/potential_god_of_war_tv_casting_leaks/">Reddit</a>, that correctly identified Parker and Palmer's casting, could also be correct about the casting choices for the show's version of <strong>Thor</strong> and <strong>Mimir</strong>.</p>



<p>Parker is the latest actor to join the cast of the God of War TV series, and knowing that he'll be playing Heimdall further confirms what Palmer's casting as Sif already indicated, that <a href="https://wccftech.com/first-god-of-war-tv-series-details/">showrunner <strong>Ronald D. Moore</strong></a> will be leaning on characters not introduced in the games until <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> to tell this new version of Kratos and Atreus' story.</p>



<p>Which means we likely have more than a few casting announcements yet to come, since we'll likely also get an appearance from characters introduced in Ragnarok like <strong>Odin</strong> and <strong>Tyr</strong>. There's also still characters from <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> that have yet to be cast, including <strong>Baldur</strong> and <strong>Freya</strong>, but if NerdBot is correct, the next announcements we're likely to see will be the casting for Thor and Mimir.</p>



<p>For Thor, the proposed choice is <strong></strong><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong>, who you'll likely recognzie from the hit Apple TV+ show, <strong>Severance</strong>, while for Mimir, it seems that Amazon doesn't want to fix what isn't broken, as the NerdBot report claims that <strong></strong><strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> will reprise his role as Mimir for the show.</p>



<p>Even though NerdBot's report was correct about Parker and Palmer's casting ahead of their reveal, you should still take its other picks with a grain of salt. That said, they're not outlandish or bad picks by any stretch, and in fact make a lot sense, which makes them even easier to believe. Still, it's not official, which is why this is still tagged as a just a rumor for now.</p>



<p>With the show reportedly set <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">to start filming in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>, if that's still the case then we'll likely see official confirmations of more casting decisions soon. While none of these choices have been off the mark so far, the cast from both God of War (2018) and Ragnarok are all stellar performers. Hopefully, Alastair Duncan isn't the only cast member who gets to play their role in both.</p>

            <guid>1412503</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">Despite the performance issues, annoying jokes, and bugs</a>, I’m still playing and enjoying <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>. I’m currently working on my second full playthrough with my wife, who is also a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan, and we’re having a great time. Mostly. Everything is going fine right up until we encounter another damn loot capsule. These things are the worst part of the game and are so bad that they truly baffle me.</p> <p>As you explore the open world of<a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-reviews-gearbox-randy-pitchford-2000634014"><em> Borderlands 4,</em></a> you’ll find side activities and quests to complete. Some of these are elaborate, but other stuff is as simple as killing a specific target or activating a safehouse. One of these supposedly simple and fun little side activities involves Loot Capsules. These are small pods that you can stumble upon and then have to carry back to the nearest safehouse to unlock. Doing so opens the capsule, and you get some loot. Sounds fine, right? Wrong!</p>

 <p>In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> Gearbox created a new mechanic that lets you pick up objects while fighting. This is used in various ways in the looter shooter, and most of the time, it is a nice way to spice up a combat encounter or make solving a puzzle just a bit more interesting. But when you hold something in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you can’t mantle or climb up a ladder, drive your hover bike, aim down your sights, throw grenades, or fast travel with that object. It greatly limits your toolbox, and that’s fine when it’s used sparingly as a momentary wrinkle you have to contend with.</p> <p>Yet that isn’t the case with Loot Capsules, which sometimes require you to walk a very long distance back to the “closest” HQ to get your reward. And you have to walk it. You can’t use your cool bike. You just run back on foot, unable to take most shortcuts because you can’t even use your sick grapple hook when holding an item. It is so fucking tedious. If you get attacked by enemies and have to fight your way out, you’d better hope that nothing happens that dislodges that capsule from your hand, or you could be searching around desperately for it in a moment. Has this happened to me? Yes, why do you think I’m writing this blog? And when you finally get to your HQ, you might have to solve some platforming puzzle that even involves tossing the damn loot pod across gaps. If it lands in an area you can’t enter, like a bottomless gorge that kills you, then it respawns back where you found it. Congratulations, you get to do it all over again.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Gearbox | <em>Go to hell, Claptrap</em></figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and every time you pick it up, Claptrap starts talking. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes, he’ll talk over himself. And there are only so many lines. And they go on and on. I don’t even hate <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/borderlands-claptraps-new-robot-revolution">Claptrap</a> like a lot of people do, but I quickly reached my breaking point after just a few capsules.</p>

 <p>These damn capsules annoy me so much, and I deal with them so often that I’ve started to overthink how they even work. In a sci-fi universe that lets me digitize dozens of guns and store them on my person easily, why the fuck can’t I just store the capsule, too? Why must I lug it back? Why can’t I collect it like all the various shields, guns, and other loot I stuff into my digital trousers with no issue? Who thought this was fun? I’d love to chat with them because I’m genuinely curious how this was left in the game. Truly, it baffles me.</p> <p>Here’s the funniest part about all of this: I’d be fine with the bullshit and the capsules if the reward was worth it. In my experience, this is never the case. I’ve opened close to two dozen of these things or more while playing alone and with friends. I’ve never gotten a single legendary weapon. Never. It’s usually the same crappy loot you often find in random chests, which don’t require a tenth of the effort to open. I’ve talked to friends about it and they’ve reported the same thing: Worthless loot that you trash the second you see it.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’ve started to ignore them when playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> alone. And when I do pick one up, I just gnash my teeth the whole time as I hear the same damn Claptrap line again. At least I enjoy the rest of the game. Mostly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I was listening to a surprisingly combative interview with Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan yesterday and amidst all the usual, expected stuff--like his general AI delusions and bizarre evasion of the question "what video game are you playing right now?"--I was struck by one response in particular, about subscription costs.</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><div><p>Gamers will learn to love AI, says Razer CEO</p><p>Razer’s Min-Liang Tan on AI backlash, partnering with Grok, and the future of gaming.</p><p><span>Nilay Patel</span></p></div></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview?utm_content=buffer84bd2&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bsky.app&amp;utm_campaign=verge_social"><u>Asked by The Verge's Nilay Patel whether he truly sees value in subscribing to AI platforms</u></a>, Tan says he sees value in all kinds of subscriptions. Here's a transcript of the part I'm talking about:</p><blockquote><strong>Patel: Are you seeing signs that the AI stuff is gonna be worth paying for that way? I mean, this is the bubble. We’re gonna spend all this money, we’ll forward invest in all this infrastructure. We’re gonna skyrocket the price of RAM and GPUs, and then at the end of the day, people are going to say, “That’s not actually worth the 20 bucks a month.”</strong></blockquote><blockquote><strong>Tan:</strong> I don’t necessarily see it as AI, per se, but I see the kind of value that I get out of it. So, for example, a ChatGPT subscription, or a Grok subscription, for that matter. I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it. And that’s the way I see it. I don’t see myself as paying for AI, per se. I see it as what am I getting out of a chatbot, for example, that can advise me on travel matters, health matters, whatever it is, my day-to-day, and stuff like that. Is that worth 20 bucks to me?</blockquote><blockquote><strong>Because you’re a billionaire, right?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Sure.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying, the marginal cost is meaningless to you.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>20 bucks is still 20 bucks, that’s right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I’m just saying.</strong></blockquote><blockquote>Right.</blockquote><blockquote><strong>I think for a lot of people, that is meaningful, especially stacked on top of all the other money they pay. Basically, I’m saying, do you see that critique of AI as a bubble? That the investment has not yet delivered the value that will make it so obvious that the investment’s worth it?</strong></blockquote><blockquote>So I see that. I mean, huge amounts of investments are going into it. We are investing in AI, I think, as we speak. But I do see the potential at this point. In many cases, I mean, look at the number of paid subscribers for ChatGPT, for example. People do see the value in terms of whether it’s a chatbot AI, so on and so forth. I do think the potential is going to be realized.</blockquote><p>"Because you’re a billionaire" has stuck with me. Tan is one of many billionaires at the vanguard of the AI push, empty men whose only reference point and purpose in life is seemingly to make a line go up for as long as possible. And that push, as it stands, is almost entirely reliant on platforms like ChatGPT and Grok going from free, idle curiosities<a href="https://www.getmonetizely.com/blogs/the-subprime-ai-crisis-how-ed-zitrons-warning-reveals-the-path-to-sustainable-aisaas-pricing?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>to something millions of people pay a substantial amount of money for every month</u></a>.</p><p>I am not a billionaire, but I am a guy reliant on people paying a monthly subscription for something people used to get for free, and let me tell you: good luck guys. At its height in the 2010s, I was writing for an audience at Kotaku that could number between 20-30 million people every month. I am now co-founder of a website that, asking for $7 in return for video game blogs, has 5000 paying subscribers (<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025/" rel="noreferrer">thank you everyone</a>!).</p><p>That math works out for me because I am a normal person with normal person obligations like bills and groceries.<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/why-everybody-is-losing-money-on-ai/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>It absolutely does not work out for companies that are on the hook for billions in data centre and loans</u></a>, let alone<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-17/musk-seeks-up-to-134-billion-damages-from-openai-microsoft?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>lawsuits and licensing disputes</u></a>. To even entertain the thought that the AI bubble could be propped up in any way by subscription costs, let alone commit your entire business model to it,<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/openai-percent-chatgpt-users-pay?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>is insane to a normal person</u></a>!</p><p>But these aren't normal people. They're billionaires. And hearing Tan say "I do see value in it, and that’s why I pay for it", oblivious to what subscription costs (and fatigue) means to the average person on the street, made me think of this famous (if you're into basketball) line from Dwyane Wade's wife Gabrielle Union, where she explains how the multi-millionaire former pro athlete had no idea how much milk cost when he retired:</p><figure><blockquote>
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/bsjtqz/wades_wife_gabrielle_union_says_he_doesnt_know/?ref=aftermath.site">Wade's wife Gabrielle Union says he doesn't know how much milk costs or what happens at car washes: "He has no idea how much milk costs. He's like 'what is that, like $20?'"</a><br> by
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/deadskin/?ref=aftermath.site">u/deadskin</a> in
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/?ref=aftermath.site">nba</a>
</blockquote>
</figure><p>That's a cute story!<a href="https://www.espn.com.au/nba/story/_/id/40205465/dwyane-wade-inspired-daughter-unveils-new-transgender-youth-support-community?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Dwyane Wade seems like a nice guy</u></a>, and I'm sure he now knows exactly how much milk costs. He was not, like Tan, a billionaire entirely divorced from the common human experience, trying to force a lake-boiling, job-displacing plagiarism machine on the world against its collective wishes.</p><p>There are a lot of ideas going around right now about how we can best curb the power of the billionaire class. Capping personal incomes, increasing taxes and tighter regulation of the share markets are all good places to start, but maybe I can add another one on top (they'd have to do this as well as pay more tax): every person who earns over 999 million has to spend a year stuck with the rest of us, doing what amounts to community service, in so much as it forces them to be part of a <em>community</em>. They have to draw from a median salary, pay a mortgage, feed kids, commute to work and navigate the healthcare system, without their billions or associated support network to bail them out.</p><p>Let's see what dipshits like Tan think about subscription costs for AI slop when $20 is three hours' work. If that job hasn't been replaced with AI already.</p>

		<p>There was a brief period of time where the most charitable thing you could say about the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/01/eight-things-that-look-more-like-sonic-than-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-movie/">Sonic the Hedgehog movie was that Sonic had a face for radio</a>, and maybe that feeling has stuck with the blue blur, because he’s about to feature in the new audio drama Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sonic Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BftIr01R0uU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A collaboration between Sega and Realm, The Chaotix Casefiles will debut on 27th January 2026. It sees Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee of the Chaotix Detective Agency looking to solve a grand mystery. This will lean on classic detective radio dramas for inspiration.</p>
<p>One of the great things about this is that it will feature a bunch of the regular cast members from the video games, including Roger Craig Smith as Sonic the Hedgehog, Keith Silverstein as Vector the Crocodile, Matthew Mercer as Espio the Chameleon, Colleen O’Shaughnessey as Charmy Bee, and plenty more.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this story has been put together by director,&nbsp;Ian Jones-Quartey (OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes, Steven Universe), lead writer Dan Jolley (Transformers, Dying Light, Superman), and a writers’ room with Ian Flynn and Evan Stanley, who have come from the Sonic franchise. Then there’s new music from two-time Grammy and Tony award-winning composer Charlie Rosen, leader of the 8-Bit Big Band. The production team also brings over thirty years of combined Sonic game development experience to the series.</p>

<p>Realm has been exploring this particular avenue with a number of other adaptations into audio series and podcasts, including Harley Quinn and The Joker: Sound Mind, DC High Volume: Batman, and Star Trek: Khan.</p>
<p>“Sonic the Hedgehog Presents: The Chaotix Casefiles is an exciting milestone for the Sonic franchise, allowing SEGA to expand the Sonic universe with a completely new medium,” said Ryan Hamlyn, Senior Director, SEGA Lore &amp; Creative Strategy. “We combined the appeal of a noir detective drama with Sonic’s fun and action-packed style, creating a fresh story that’s both true to the Sonic series and new to fans. Thanks to our collaboration with Realm, listeners can look forward to this immersive mystery adventure anywhere they get their podcasts.”</p>
<p>“We’re honored to partner with the innovative team at SEGA that oversees Sonic and has successfully expanded the story world in so many ways over the last five years. I can’t wait for fans to be able to dive into the world of the Chaotix Detective Agency – they’re in for an action-packed, sound rich adventure.” said Molly Barton, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Realm.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[1348 Ex Voto, an Action/Adventure Game Based in 14th Century Italy, Sets March 12 Launch on PC/PS5 and Cancels Xbox Version]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/1348-ex-voto-action-adventure-game-based-in-14th-century-italy-march-12/</link>
            <guid>1412425</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Independent publisher <strong>Dear Villagers</strong> and developer <strong>Sedleo</strong> have announced that the action/adventure game <strong>1348 Ex Voto</strong> will be released on <strong>March 12</strong>, though only for PC and PlayStation 5, as the Xbox Series S|X version has been canceled. This is far from shocking. Xbox Series console sales have been dwindling for several years now; for small studios, spending resources on the port might no longer be worth the cost. </p>



<p>Anyway, the game itself looks quite interesting. Developed by a team of around 15 Italian developers, it is set in 14th-century Italy, a period marked by political strife and the plague (which raged for a long time). The protagonist, <strong>Aeta</strong>, voiced by <strong>Alby Baldwin</strong>, is a young noble training to become a knight errant. However, her village is suddenly attacked by bandits, who also kidnap <strong>Bianca</strong> (voiced by award-winning actress <strong>Jennifer English</strong>, who played Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3 and Maelle in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33), someone very dear to Aeta. Thus begins her dangerous journey across the Italian peninsula, with environments ranging from medieval villages and castles to the Appennino mountains and even the ruins of classical Rome, to rescue Bianca.</p>



<p>The creators from Sedleo drew inspiration from chivalric story tropes and spent extensive time in rural Italy recording environments to create an authentic, historically plausible world. The 'cinematic' combat system <strong>is inspired by HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts)</strong> and was animated with the help of trained performance-capture actors.</p>



<p>Aeta's martial knowledge will allow players to <strong>strategically choose between two combat stances</strong>: one-handed and two-handed weapons. Skill books have been scattered throughout the environments, and players who can find them will <strong>unlock new combos to personalize Aeta's swordplay</strong> with different weapon parts.</p>

<p>On PC, 1348 Ex Voto will be available for purchase via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895900/1348_Ex_Voto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/1348-ex-voto-251865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>. The official system requirements haven't been revealed yet, but we know that the price will be <strong>$24.99</strong> on both PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How A Headline Gets Written At Kotaku: Battlefield 6 Edition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-a-headline-gets-written-at-kotaku-battlefield-6-edition-2000661912</link>
            <guid>1412422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Consider this the first in a new series of sporadic posts attempting to demystify what goes on at <em>Kotaku</em>, a website about games but also lots of other stuff. We publish many stories here, sometimes well over a dozen throughout the course of a day. Maybe even a hundred by the end of any given week. Likely the first thing you see on any one of those stories is the headline. How do we come up with those?</p> <p>Well, in the case of a recent news post about <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-announce-classic-big-map-returning-season-two-details-2000661857">new content coming to <em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, it went something like this. Staff writer Zack Zwiezen, our resident anti-Pax Armata expert, filed an article summarizing new details on what’s coming to the shooter in season 2 and beyond. It had the working headline “<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield 6</i> Devs Announce A Classic, Big Map Is Returning And Share Season Two Details.” Accurate, informative, helpful.</p>

 <p>But I spilled my soup during lunch and was feeling a bit cranky. The gaming press, myself included, has a tendency to overuse boring phrases like “announces,” reveals,” and “shows off” to convey that a new thing has happened. I pushed for something that sounded different and offered a couple of alternatives. Here’s the conversation in our work Slack that followed:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong><em> Battlefield 6</em> Is Giving Fans A Classic Big Map And More In Season 2<br> <em>Battlefield 6</em> Hears You And Reveals A Classic, Big Map For Season 2.<br> wondering if there’s something more interesting than announces<br> just say what you want to say about what you think about this</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Bringing Back Another Classic Map And Its A Big One</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Season 2 Brings Back A Classic Map But Will It Be Big Enough?</p> <p><strong> Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Well that’s the catch. It won’t be in season 2<br> they have other maps for season 2<br> this is likely 3</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: lol why aren’t they revealing season 2 maps?<br> that seems like a bad sign for big maps in season 2</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: They revealed a season 2 map and teased this OTHER one</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: is it big?</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Bigish<br> lol<br> hence why I think they are teasing this OTHER map</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: that seems more the story</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: It’s something I talk about in the post, yeah<br> can try to build a hed around it</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: wait so the map is confirmed not for season 2?<br> or they just won’t say</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: It will be in a future season</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Petit</strong>: yeah they want to appease the people pounding the tables and chanting BIG MAP! BIG MAP! by saying “we’ve got a big map coming soon, we promise!”</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Will Bring Back A Classic Big Map But Not For Season 2</p> <p><strong> Zack Zwiezen</strong>: That works<br> <em>Battlefield 6</em> Really Wants You All To Know Big Maps Are Coming, Okay? lol</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: As long as it’s still accurate that seems like the story to me</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Yeah your hed is accurate</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> To Concerned Nation: Big Maps Are Coming…Eventually</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Dev Spreads Out Arms Real Wide On Stage And Receives 20 Minutes Of Standing Applause<br> anyway, posting with your hed</p></blockquote> <p>So there you have it. A perfect headline? No. Better than “<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield 6</i> Devs Announce A Classic, Big Map Is Returning And Share Season Two Details?” Maybe! On the site currently? Yes. And that’s how it got there.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Layoffs Hit Payday 3 Developer Starbreeze]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/layoffs-hit-payday-3-developer-starbreeze/</link>
            <guid>1412419</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Layoffs have taken place at Starbreeze Studios, the developer behind Payday 3, marking another difficult moment for the studio following the game’s troubled launch.</p>



<p>Multiple employees took to LinkedIn on Wednesday to confirm that layoffs were taking place. As of writing, Starbreeze has yet to officially announce the layoffs. </p>







<p><strong>“Today, many of us at Starbreeze, Stockholm, got sad news and I’m now seeking a new role and would appreciate your support,”</strong> said QA Alexander Pereswetoff-Morath. <strong>“After over 7 years, the longest I’ve ever been at any company in any industry, my time has (more than likely) come.”</strong></p>



<p>Senior Tech Producer Sabina af Jochnick added, <strong>“Due to the recent layoffs at Starbreeze, my role has been identified as at risk of redundancy, so I’m beginning to look at what’s next.”</strong></p>



<p>Since launching in 2023, Payday 3 has faced a number of problems. It’s launch was so bad with players frustrated and leaving the game altogether that Starbreeze ultimately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/payday-3-developer-starbreeze-fires-ceo-tobias-sjogren/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired its CEO</a> Tobias Sjögren. Starbreeze even announced in late 2024 that it was going to invest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starbreeze-payday-3-less-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“significantly less”</a> in year two content for Payday 3. </p>







<p>Despite the lower investment in the game, the studio had continued to update and support the game. It’s most recent update—Update 3.1—on January 13 included a new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1272080/view/494965447846790101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Shopping Spree” heist</a> along with a number of game balance changes. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Starbreeze for clarification on the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-power-play-card-game-review</link>
            <guid>1412416</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">War. War never changes. What does change, however, are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a>. Those suckers change all the time, with thousands of new ones coming out every year, sometimes in big boxes, others in little ones, and occasionally ones <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">based on a popular property</a>. That’s the case with Fallout: Power Play, a small-area control card game designed by Resurrectionist Games and published by Modiphius Games, currently up for pre-order. It's a small game with some good bones to it, but its compact design is more of a hindrance than a benefit.</p><div id="234620"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234620" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Fallout: Power Play</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play puts two to four players in command of four possible factions, each with their own unique decks and special ability. These are the Brotherhood of Steel (good at completing missions to earn influence and hunkering down in a location), Super Mutants (lots of big and powerful unit cards to deploy at locations), the Enclave (excellent at disrupting other players' turns), and Raiders (thieves, every last one of them). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On their turn, players deploy agents to locations, complete quests to earn rewards, and use their faction-specific ability, all in a bid to earn the most influence in the different places, netting you victory points. Whichever player has their agent holding a location at the end of the turn gains influence over the spot, with the top play considered to be “dominating” and earning a victory point. The first player to reach 10 points triggers the end game and scoring, with whoever has the most points winning at the end of that round.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things get shaken up a bit thanks to the random Wasteland Encounter cards you draw at the start of each round, and unique Power Play cards that each player has in their deck. These events can range from spawning ghouls that attack everyone’s agents to even detonating an Atom Bomb Baby and destroying everything at the location(s) where players have the most influence. That one is a particularly fun card to see safely from the sidelines, as all of your friends’ units are blasted out of existence all at once in the region they were fighting so fiercely over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the encounter cards are the right hand of chaos in Power Play, then the titular Power Play cards in your deck are the left hand of chaos. These cards have the potential to be played not only on your turn, but also in response to other players’ actions. Think an Instant spell in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/magic-the-gathering-trading-card-game">Magic: The Gathering</a>. This resulted in some tense back-and-forth, play-and-counterplay moments with my friends, and I often found myself holding my breath whenever I would put down one of my more powerful cards in hopes they wouldn’t get countered or worse. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While at first glace, Power Play may appear to be more of a simple “bigger number better” <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war game</a>, the more I played, the more nuance and strategy I found in it. Each location only has spots for four agents, and in games with fewer players, this allows for you to allocate multiple agent resources to a location. But regardless of how much you are overpowering the other players in a spot, you will still only gain a single victory point at the end of the round. On the flip side, every round where you don’t have an agent at a location will result in your losing an influence at that location (to a minimum of 1), so it pays to spread out your forces. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This management almost makes Power Play into more of a worker placement game, and I often found myself opting to have one stronghold as my main “VP generator” and then spreading out and setting up at the other locations to pull off big influence gain turns by completing quest cards that would net me a boost in influence for a spot. Whenever I managed to pull off these well-laid plans, it tickled that good spot in my brain and never got old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resurrectionist Games, Power Play’s designer, has put together a card game with solid bones, and its focus on capturing and holding locations reminds me of the hot new TCG <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qm8eKN?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Riftbound</a>. That said, issues surrounding the delivery and presentation of the game blemish and knock Power Play down some notches. The most disappointing of which is that the whole product feels less like a Fallout card game and more like something with the beloved property slapped on the side of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the four factions and other nods to the Fallout universe, I never felt as though Power Play did much with the property. Instead of decks featuring notable characters from the games that fans would recognize, the designers opted for bland and generic fill-ins instead. Taking the Brotherhood of Steel deck, for instance, a group whose Power Armor is arguably just as synonymous with the series as the signature blue-and-yellow vault suits, your forces are composed of no-name cards like “Knight” or “Elder.” Instead of a generic Elder, why not have the lead agent be a character like Arthur Maxson or Sarah Lyons?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The home base locations of each of the factions feel rather soulless and are identical to one another from a gameplay standpoint. While “activate a location” is an option you can take on your turn, there are only two locations that have something to activate, with the others being the starting strongholds of each faction. They are “War Camp” or “Raider Fortress” instead of something memorable from the series, like Nuka-World or even a Vault. I would have appreciated these spots to be two-sided, with a generic, ability-less side and the other having an action associated with it and pulled from somewhere players would recognize if you were in the mood for a more advanced game mode. Alas, no such luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This more uninspired approach extends into the art and even the card descriptions. Keeping on the Brotherhood train, the Initiate and Field Scribe agent cards feature nearly identical character faces, and cards like their “Knight” read as “Each time Knight kills an Enemy…” which feels generic. Do these things impact how the game plays? No. But if you're going to adapt a well-known property, you want it to feel meaningful, and considering the attention to detail I’ve come to expect from Modiphius, especially with Fallout, thanks to the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gX1nn?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fallout TTRPG</a> they also publish, Power Play just doesn’t get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My other main gripe with Power Play has to do with some of the quality control and decisions involved with how the game is packaged. Now, I’m all for a game being nice and compact; heck, one of the most prestigious awards I can give (in my mind anyway) is the Glovebox Award, given to games that are small and fun enough that I always want them with me wherever I go (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/flip-7-card-game-review">Flip 7</a> is an example). It’s rare that I’ve found a game that feels too small – but Power Play does. Inside its box are spots for two decks of cards, with a small gap in between. Now, these two spots aren’t quite deep enough to contain all of the standard-sized cards included, causing some annoying shifting, and unfortunately, you can just forget sleeving your cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play also uses tokens to mark each faction’s influence in the regions and other little reminders. Unfortunately, these tokens are incredibly tiny. And while the faction tokens are at least color-coded, some of the reminder tokens, all of which are about 3/4 the size of a dime and contain text, are barely legible from anything more than maybe six inches from your face, let alone from across a table. Power Play may also be the first board game I have that uses tokens but doesn’t come with a small bag to keep them in. And to make matters more annoying, they easily slip into the small gap between the two decks. Thankfully, my cardboard hobby has granted me extra baggies that I was able to put them in, but beforehand, more than a couple of times, I spent more time than I care to admit trying to get some of these damn cardboard pieces out of the box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout: Power Play is a great example of how a bunch of little missed opportunities and annoyances can add up, and it’s a shame. This is one of those products that I can see potential and promise if Resurrectionist Games takes a bit more care into any future properties they adapt. The underlying game is fun, and I can imagine a day down the road where Power Play becomes the system, and you can buy additional sets, akin to, say, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxADA?object_uuid=2024f377-3b29-410b-b422-66976da1388a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Smash Up!</a>, and you can have the Brotherhood of Steel facing off against the forces of the Borg from Star Trek, or the demons of Hell from Doom pushing back Super Mutants. That's a game I would love to play, and if they put a bit more care into those sets, you can count me in day one. It may even make it into the glovebox.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 21, 2026 7:10 pm</p></div><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Despite some fun mechanics, Fallout: Power Play doesn't do service to the property on its box.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-power-play-card-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> dropped a bombshell of an announcement today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">cancelling six projects, including the long-awaited <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying seven more</a>, and restructuring the entire company into five separate <strong>Creative Houses</strong>. Those are the basic facts of what's changed for Ubisoft. As to how it'll execute and drive this new structure, the answer for Ubisoft appears to lie within <strong>more layoffs</strong>, a <strong>return-to-office mandate,</strong> and increased investments in what it deems to be "<em>cutting-edge technology,</em>" namely investing further in "<em>player-facing <strong>Generative AI</strong></em><strong>."</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, the basic structure of Ubisoft as a company is changing. It's moving to a decentralized model, with five Creative Houses that will sit under Ubisoft headquarters, each with its own financial responsibilities and total creative ownership of the brands and IPs held within each Creative House. Supporting each Creative House is a <strong>Creative Network</strong> of studios to help with production, and supporting everything will be its <strong>Core Services</strong>. You can see the basic breakdown of it all in the image below, from a press release. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Ubisoft-Creative-Houses-Restructure.png"></a><figcaption><em>Ubisoft's new Creative Houses structure. Image credit: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not included in the basic breakdown above are some of the key internal changes that Ubisoft is undergoing that it believes are necessary for the restructure to work. It's already started one of those changes, which is simply <strong>more layoffs</strong>. </p>



<p>"<em>As part of this effort to streamline operations and adapt to evolving market conditions, the Group has already taken decisive actions to adjust its studio footprint</em>," the press release reads. "<em>This includes the closure of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax</a></strong> mobile studio earlier this month and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">Stockholm</a></strong> studio, as well as restructurings at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">Abu Dhabi</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/trials-rising-developer-ubisoft-redlynx-layoff-60-developers-amidst-shift-to-small-screens/">RedLynx</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-entertainment-layoffs/">Massive</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>Unfortunately, these layoffs that we've already seen, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">closure of the <strong>Leamington</strong> studio,</a> which isn't mentioned here but does fall within the restructure timeline previously put out by Ubisoft, are not the end. The third and "<em>final phase</em>" of the restructure is still to come, with more set to be announced on <strong>February 12, 2026.</strong> That said, the third phase of this restructure is "<em>expected to be fully achieved by <strong>March 2026</strong></em>," so there could even be more layoffs announced after the February date. The company is looking to these cuts to drive <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong> in savings. </p>



<p>Along with more organizational cuts, another key part of how it'll execute this new structure is a <strong>return-to-office mandate</strong>. Remote work is being killed off as an option across the company, and instead, employees will have a limited number of days allocated to them to work from home each year, basically equating work-from-home days to vacation or sick days for employees. </p>



<p>"<em>To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to <strong>five days per week on site for all teams</strong></em>, <em>complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days. This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams. In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity, and success in a persistently more selective AAA market</em>."</p>



<p>After the world spent the better part of two years locked in their homes and finding ways to make their jobs and lives work without leaving their dwellings, it's difficult to read claims that in-person collaboration and work are "<em>key</em>" to any process. Sure, being in the same room with others can often be the best way for a team to work, but after we had a slew of stellar titles released in recent years, several of which were made by entirely remote teams, we know that developers don't need to move across the world or commute for hours a day to make a good game. </p>



<p>If these mandates accelerate anything, it's company turnover, as many employees are unable to move to new locations if they suddenly need to be in the office five days a week. It's easier to see them as disguised or soft layoffs, instead of changes meant to better employee collaboration. </p>



<p>"<em>We really want to strengthen onsite collaboration, the collective dynamic across teams</em>," added Ubisoft's senior vice president of studio operations, <strong>Marie Sophie de Waubert</strong>, in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-asking-all-staff-to-return-to-office-full-time-to-boost-the-collective-performance-for-aaa">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. "<em>We know that in-person collaboration and interactions are key enablers of efficiency, creativity, and collective success in this persistently selective market. It's one enabler among others, but it's really one we believe in.</em>"</p>



<p>When pressed by GI.Biz about how this mandate will impact staff turnover, de Waubert said, "<em>the one and only objective is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.</em>" De Waubert also adds, "<em>We will, of course, discuss in due time with the different countries the modus operandi, and the flexibility linked to that evolution of our model. But the objective is really linked to the quality of our games and the quality of our creativity. And it's one enabler among others for the Creative Houses to reconnect with success and team engagement</em>."</p>



<p>Speaking of things not needed to make a good game, one of the final ways in which Ubisoft will try to execute its new structure comes from its new <strong>Core Services</strong> branch, which the company describes as "<em>the backbone of Ubisoft's ecosystem</em>." The teams under the Core Services branch will "<em>focus on delivering scalable technology, production capabilities and operational excellence across the Group</em>."</p>



<p>Among their responsibilities will be production services, i.e quality assurance, localization, playtests and game analytics. Also under the Core Services umbrella is the company's technological infrastructure, including its game engines, online services, IT infrastructure, and most notably, <strong>Generative AI</strong>.</p>



<p>In fact, the press release specifies "<em>player-facing Generative AI</em>," though it's short on what exactly that means. It could result in nothing, as GenAI is still far from <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-ceo-speaks-for-gamers-says-we-dont-want-genai-slop-we-want-ai-tools-that-help-game-devs/">establishing a place in game development</a>, even as major publishers like Ubisoft continue to push for it.</p>



<p>All of these changes, including the new structure, are due to be implemented as of <strong>April 2026</strong>, which means we'll know more about how these changes go as early as the end of this year, as we continue to monitor and cover Ubisoft as it goes through this massive shift.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Will Bring Back A Classic Big Map But Not For Season 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-announce-classic-big-map-returning-season-two-details-2000661857</link>
            <guid>1412398</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/every-battlefield-6-map-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2000647370"><em>Battlefield 6′</em></a>s delayed season two arrives in February, and we finally know more about what to expect in the upcoming season. But EA also teased more of what’s to come beyond season two in a new update on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s future.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">EA and Battlefield Studios shared a new and lengthy update</a> confirming some key details about season two. The biggest news is that EA confirmed season two will include at least two new maps, and it shared a few more details about one of those battlegrounds. Contaminated is one of the new maps arriving sometime in season two, and EA will soon be letting some players hop into the map early via a new round of Battlefield Labs playtesting. Interestingly, EA says it wants to test how the map’s “unique gameplay mechanics function” in a live match. As for how big Contaminated is, EA says its total size lands somewhere between <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547">Eastwood and Mirak Valley</a>&nbsp;and says it is comparable in size to classic maps such as Arras from <em>Battlefield V.</em></p>

 <p>While that sounds like a decent-sized map, I suspect EA knew some fans wouldn’t be satisfied with that announcement, which probably explains the publisher teasing the return of a massive classic map in Wednesday’s post. Golmud Railway, a map first seen in <em>Battlefield 4,</em> will be added to <em>BF6</em> in a “future season.”</p> <p>“Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s <em>Battlefield</em>, not simply ported forward,” explained the devs. “Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in <em>Battlefield 4</em>, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports<em> Battlefield 6</em> systems. Golmud Railway is planned to be the largest <em>Battlefield 6</em> map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.”</p>

 <p>Since before <em>Battlefield 6</em> launched, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">fans have been asking for bigger maps</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-big-large-conquest-map-battle-royale-redsec-golf-course-2000641083">even creating their own using <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale map and in-game creation tools</a>. So it’s great to hear that EA and Battlefield Studios are working on a map that will be bigger than any of the current battlegrounds. Hopefully, fans won’t have to wait too long to get to play it. Maybe season three? We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

 <h2><em>Redsec</em> solo mode update</h2> <p>Meanwhile, <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs confirmed that the Little Bird heli, which was featured in past <em>BF</em> games, will be added in season two. The devs also confirmed they are continuing to work on a solo queue for <em>Redsec</em>, <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode. No release date was shared, and it seems like it could end up never happening if testing doesn’t work out. But for now, it seems like the studios involved in making <em>BF6</em> and <em>Redsec</em> are still working on the fan-requested feature.</p> <p>Here’s the dev’s full update:</p> <blockquote><p>We’re also continuing internal and exploratory testing around Battle Royale Solo play, as we evaluate how different player configurations impact pacing, balance, and the overall Battle Royale experience.</p> <p>This work is focused on understanding where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences. These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s second free season arrives on all platforms on February 17, bringing new maps and, like season one, likely adding more content like new weapons, modes, cosmetics, and more.</p>

I am going to level with you. My awareness of Lort up until this point has been non-existent. Never heard of it before today, it's early access release day! But when you see a game called Lort, well, you at least need to take a little look. And as astronomically silly as the name is, it looks like a pretty neat, silly time, so, my predilection towards the inane has clearly worked out in my favour this time.
</p>
<p>
Lort is one of those trendy affordable co-op games, specifically of the action <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> variety. Think something along the lines of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a>, but with a fantasy setting, alongside some other key differences. While there are different adventurers to choose from, the bigger focus is on the weapons you can pick up, which range from what I think is a squid on a staff, to some fancy looking swords, to quite simply a gun. Or three guns taped to a stick! The Risk of Raininess of it comes back with different powerups you can pick up to help you take down waves of enemies.

<p>
You can play it solo if you like, but the main draw is eight-player co-op, though I can't tell you how enemy difficulty might scale depending on how many people are playing. I do wish that it was maybe a touch less memey on the whole, using words like swole, and chad, and muscle mommy, a lot of which is already pretty dated, but if I ignore the language the gameplay looks goofy in an entertaining way.
</p><p>
Anyway, currently the game is in early access, but it is apparently playable from start to finish. The game's first big update will introduce things like a new, froggish adventurer, a dagger weapon type, and more, with bigger plans for more playable adventures, an endless mode, biomes, and quest types. You can pick it up on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2956680/LORT/">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft major reorganisation brings layoffs, game cancellations including Sands of Time Remake & new ‘Creative Houses’]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/21/ubisoft-major-reorganisation-brings-layoffs-game-cancellations-including-sands-of-time-remake-new-creative-houses/</link>
            <guid>1412335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft has announced a major restructuring of its business, with a new operating model that will place its current teams into five specialised ‘Creative Houses’ with dedicated lead studios, but coming at the cost of another round of layoffs, scaled back remote working, and with game cancellations, including the troubled Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is seemingly safe, though.</p>


<p>Yves Guillemot, Ubisoft CEO, explained the plan and reasoning: “On the one hand, the AAA industry has become persistently more selective and competitive with rising development costs and greater challenges in creating brands. On the other hand, exceptional AAA games, when successful, have more financial potential than ever. In this context, today we are announcing a major reset built to create the conditions for a return to sustainable growth over time. We are transforming Ubisoft’s operating model to produce exceptional quality games on the two core pillars of our strategy, Open World Adventures and GaaS-native experiences.</p>
<p>“At the center of this transformation are our Creative Houses, integrated business units now combining production and publishing and therefore unifying the gamer relationship. Each one is built around a clear genre and brand focus, with full responsibility and financial ownership, led by dedicated leadership teams. It is a radical move, relying on a more decentralized creative organization with faster decision making and best-in-class cross functional core services supporting and serving each Creative House.”</p>
<p>The new structure follows the kind of naming convention that we see at Capcom and Nintendo, with numbered divisions that each specialises in a series or genre. We already saw the first step of this with the co-funded Vantage Studios that now looks after Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, and this is Creative House 1. Each CH will be more independent and ‘decentralised’, and the financial accountability will be within that division as oppose to Ubisoft as a whole.</p>

<p>The new groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>CH1</b> (Vantage Studios), focused on scaling and extending Ubisoft’s largest and established franchises to turn them into annual billionaire brands – Brands including Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</li>
<li><b>CH2</b> dedicated to competitive and cooperative shooter experiences –&nbsp;Brands including The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell</li>
<li><b>CH3</b> designed to operate a roster of select, sharp Live experiences – Brands including For Honor, The Crew, Riders Republic, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones</li>
<li><b>CH4</b> dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes – Brands including Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil</li>
<li><b>CH5</b> focused on reclaiming position in casual and family-friendly games – Brands including Just Dance, Idle Miner Tycoon</li>
</ul>
<p>Six games are being cancelled as a consequence of this, including the Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake and 4 unannounced titles, three of which were new IPs. However, there are 4 new IPs still in development, including March of Giants.</p>
<p>However, to make this happen, Ubisoft is bringing an end to remote working. All teams will need to return to five days a week on site, though there will be an annual allowance of work from home days. Ubisoft says this is because they want more in-person collaboration and constant knowledge sharing, and all that stuff, but doesn’t mention the positives of remote working, like not having to deal with an energy-sapping and potentially costly commute, having more flexibility with home life and work, and not having to be in an office.</p>
<p>Further to this, Ubisoft’s ‘cost reduction initiatives’ are being pushed further to cut €100 million year on year. Their studio in Halifax closed earlier this month, and their Stockholm studio will follow. There’s also restructuring at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx and Massive. A further €200 million cost reduction is set to take place over the next two years.</p>
<p>Oh, but Ubisoft has the cash to throw at the Generative AI money pit, with “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p>
<p>This obviously sucks for those affected, and we wish them all the best in finding new employment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There will be no more remote work—or at least very limited opportunities—for Ubisoft employees moving forward. Instead, Ubisoft employees will be required to be in office on a full time basis.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, the French-based publisher announced major restructuring plans that including a number of games, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>, being canceled. While the announcement also spoke about plans to focus more on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Games-As-A-Service (GAAS) and open world experiences</a>, they also revealed a policy change that will impact all employees within the company. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-wants-all-employees-in-the-office">Ubisoft Wants All Employees In The Office</h2>



<p>According to the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official press release</a>, Ubisoft will return to a full five days on site “for all teams”. Staff will then receive an “annual allowance of working-from-home days.”</p>



<p>“This evolution is intended to strengthen collaboration, including constant knowledge sharing, and the collective dynamic across teams,” they said “In-person collaboration is a key enabler of collective efficiency, creativity and success in a persistently more selective AAA market.”</p>



<p>SVP of Studio Operations Marie Sophie de Waubert&nbsp;told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-reveals-new-creative-house-structure-cancels-games-and-announces-final-round-of-cost-cutting-and-studio-closures-to-drive-200m-savings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a> that the company is still working with “a hybrid model, but spread differently”.</p>







<p>After the news broke, one source reached out to Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw to say that they’d expect the eventual layoffs to be “in the hundreds”. During its conference call to discuss the moves, Ubisoft wouldn’t discuss how many more layoffs would be coming as part of this restructure within the company. </p>



<p>Recently, the company has held layoffs at its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-to-layoff-55-employees-across-the-division-developers-and-stockholm-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Massive Entertainment</a> as well as at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cut-nearly-30-jobs-abu-dhabi-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</a>, the closure of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-closes-halifax-studio-employees-unionized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft Halifax</a>, and more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield Studios is prepping for BF Labs testing by giving fans a first look at content coming to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> Season 2 and beyond, including the reveal of one brand-new map and a returning Battlefield 4 map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The studio discussed its plans to get back on track with behind-closed-doors testing in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond?utm_campaign=gla_bci_ww_ic_soco_twt_battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=88242&amp;ts=1769013330100" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>blog post</u></a> published on its website. It’s a lengthy message from the EA team that comes with a few highlights as it attempts to win back fans who may have been turned off by the recent delay of Season 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/21/battlefield-6-contaminated-1769016546557.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Contaminated Map First Look. Image courtesy of EA.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 players want new maps, and BF Studios wants to deliver. We don’t know how many new maps will be included in Season 2, but the Labs blog post confirms the name of one of the new locations: Contaminated. The studio says that, in terms of size, it falls between Season 1 map Eastwood and launch map Mirak Valley, while also comparing it to Battlefield 1’s St. Quentin Scar and Battlefield V’s Arras.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ll be evaluating how vehicle gameplay and aerial presence interact with infantry combat, alongside cover and asset placement, and objective boundaries,” the post says of upcoming pre-release tests. “We’ll also be testing how the map’s unique gameplay mechanics function in live matches, as well as the tools available to players to interact with them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A first-look, work-in-progress image of the map (above) shows a rocky mountain battleground. Fog and forest both overlook what appears to be a small aircraft runway, with snipers perched between the trees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to pick out one defining feature from the new map with such a limited look, but BF Studios has something a little more familiar planned for the future. Buried in the “On the Horizon” section of the Labs blog post is the announcement that a “fan-favorite” Battlefield 4 map is set to arrive “in a future season.” That location is none other than launch map <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/battlefield-4/Golmud_Railway"><u>Golmud Railway</u></a>, which, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-map-debate-reaches-new-level-as-players-meticulously-measure-70-maps-from-bf3-bf2042-and-more"><u>a few dedicated Reddit users let us know last year</u></a>, stands as not only one of the larger Battlefield 4 maps but one of the bigger Battlefield maps ever.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Battlefield Games</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It is worth noting that Battlefield 6 has brought back maps before, with Operation Firestorm launching alongside the game itself in October. The wide-open desert area featured in the latest installment is actually a smaller version of the same map from Battlefield 3, so it’s unclear if Golmud Railway will receive the same treatment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, BF Studios says this fully rebuilt version of the Battlefield 4 map will be the biggest Battlefield 6 multiplayer map yet, promising to “preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project,” the developer says. “Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of a recent tweak to jet gameplay, fans of air combat have also been hoping to see more love in Battlefield 6. To help meet their desires, BF Studios used the Labs post to confirm upcoming tests will include the rumored return of the AH-6 Little Bird.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect to see the compact helicopter back in Season 2 at an unspecified point in time, with things like the previously promised air radar also set for Labs testing soon. Also still in the cards is a solo queue for REDSEC battle royale, though BF Studios says the long-desired option is continuing as “internal and exploratory” testing. There’s no word on when the mode could come to Labs or if it will ever make its way to the public version of Battlefield 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield global community manager Kevin Johnson <a href="https://x.com/T0TALfps/status/2014006687280091437?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>took to X/Twitter</u></a> with more information about how BF Studios will continue to roll out testing for new content. Much of what was detailed today has no firm release date, but Labs players can go hands-on with at least some of the new content, including Contaminated, “as soon as this Friday.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Battlefield (@Battlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/2011106206014685329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 13, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Alongside that, we want to ensure more ongoing and meaningful action is taken on your feedback - Battlefield Labs will be the conduit for that,” Johnson said. “Things may take time, and we appreciate your patience, but what is in store is going to be a great collaboration moment!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’s found itself in a bit of a bind heading into 2026, with players taking to social media to beg for new content as BF Studios works to deliver its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-2-delayed-to-february-as-ea-tackles-community-feedback-with-an-extended-season-1"><u>delayed Season 2 come February 17</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

The hook is that your mech is your deck, meaning you can swap out parts as desired using your cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">More intriguingly, Turtle Juice says that "every card played is immediately replaced, forcing players to think ahead, position cards strategically, and chain pilot abilities to forge mech-pilot synergies and unleash attack combos that can turn the tide of battle." Lead designer Ernani Rocha said, “With MECHBORN, we wanted to rethink what moment-to-moment strategy feels like in a roguelike deckbuilder. The conveyor-belt card system fundamentally changes how players plan, adapt, and position themselves every turn.” Check out the reveal trailer above and the first screenshots in the gallery below.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MECHBORN - First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are 12 mech pilots with unique skills and backgrounds, allowing you to create all kinds of builds during your runs.

<p>But wait, what does this mean for Animal Crossing’s future? We’re almost six years into New Horizons’ life with no sign of a new game in the series to come. The announcement <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">back in October 2025</a> filled me with a mix of excitement and worry, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-animal-crossing-on-switch-2-has-me-equal-parts-buzzing-and-baffled">just like Jim</a>, because, yay, more Animal Crossing to lose my life to!

<p>Months later, and after a week of decorating hotel rooms, putting together a LEGO-themed nook in my basement, and contemplating terraforming part of my island all over again, I’m a lot less conflicted. In fact, I’m happy to wait for a brand new Animal Crossing, because in a few years' time, it might be the perfect game to experience with my daughter.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7518f7e26c2ea"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Quinn's birthday" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7518f7e26c2ea/animal-crossing-new-horizons-quinns-birthday.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, in 2026, I’m going to become a parent. This has added a whole new layer to how I think about video games. Both my husband and I had parents or relatives who were also into games, who encouraged us to pick up and play and experience the magic of the medium. Now the two of us are talking hypotheticals about which <strong>Dragon Quest</strong> our child should play first, or how we can use video games to teach her about life and love and empathy.</p>
<p>I knew I was expecting a child when the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition were announced, and I was hit with this strange realisation: New Horizons just seems to be there whenever my life is changing.</p>
<p>I don’t need to remind people of 2020, but I’ve found myself slipping back into the familiar rhythms of island life multiple times: when the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">DLC</a> dropped in 2021, I was looking for a new job; in 2023, I started a brand new island as I was packing up my life to move across the Atlantic. And now I’m back again ahead of parenthood.</p>
<p>It’s still the perfect reprieve from everything going on in the outside world, but with our impending new addition, it’s made me rethink how I play Animal Crossing: New Horizons. I couldn’t help but recall <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_6_things_my_three-year-old_taught_me_about_video_games_via_animal_crossing">Roland’s experience with the beginnings of New Horizon with his own child</a>, and the prospect of getting to see my daughter’s face as she helps me play through a completely new game is wonderful.</p>

<p>I’m so used to the mechanics and the way Animal Crossing rolls, but New Horizons is easily the most complex entry so far, even with the handful of QoL updates 3.0 brought with it. There’s no way I could imagine throwing a young child into the game, <em>especially</em> on an island I’ve poured hundreds of hours into. Does she really want me to explain why the museum is surrounded by Japanese-themed decorations, or why I live next to the Able Sisters?</p>
<p>The next game is unlikely to scale back that much, but what it does offer is a chance for a fresh start on an experience that both parent and child will be jumping into, together, for the first time. I can’t really think of anything better than that.</p>
<p>Usually when I play Animal Crossing, I’m a bit of a min-maxer. I like making money, so I’ll spend hours upon hours fishing, catching bugs, trying to farm scorpions and tropical bugs on Mystery Islands. I’ve also been playing this series for 23 years, importing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">the original</a> from North America because I desperately wanted to experience this cosy little life as a kid. I’ve never looked back.</p>

<p>As a result of this feverish love of the series, the slow-life aspect has been somewhat compounded in recent years, so a new game is the chance for me to reset the way I play. I'm guilty of time-travelling and scouring the internet for turnip prices, but now I'm side-eyeing those decisions. I don’t want to do this with my kid. I want to play the game the way <em>she</em> wants me to, and she’ll be the one calling the shots. She will be the reason I’m playing – if that’s what she wants.</p>
<p>I know this isn’t the <em>most</em> child-friendly series given how much there is to do and how much text there is, but my aim would be to act as a guide for my daughter while she delights in designing her own characters or she giggles at the animalese voices. It’ll be a safe haven she gets to design with the help of her parents, not just a digital world she can watch enviously as I mow my way through progression.</p>
<p>Hypothetical thinking is dangerous, I know, and there are many things I can’t predict: for one, she might not like video games at all. She might get bored or frustrated, or she might simply prefer other activities. The world is her oyster. Plus, we might get a new Animal Crossing game in a year — you never know! — and I don’t think a baby would understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>But I’m no longer clamouring for the future, or a faster release schedule. New Marios, Zeldas, and Animal Crossings are nice and all, but you know what’s better? Sharing those experiences with someone you love unconditionally and watching them form their own loves, thoughts, and opinions of those experiences.</p>
