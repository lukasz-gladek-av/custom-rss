			<p>If you are a fan of the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series, you are well aware of how <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is <strong>struggling</strong> in more ways than one. Launched successfully in late February 2025, the game's <strong>low challenge level</strong> and <strong>performance issues</strong> prevented it from capitalizing on its launch momentum.</p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-2-arrives-on-monday-adds-lagiacrus-and-seregios-to-the-hunt/">Title Updates</a></strong> released last year <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-its-expanded-endgame-and-high-difficulty-quests-earlier-than-expected/">addressed the low challenge level</a></strong> of the experience, this wasn't <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enough</strong> for many fans of the series, who <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">returned to previous entries in the series</strong> such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter World</em> to get their hunting fix.</p>



<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-would-appreciate-it-if-you-could-pick-it-up-again-monster-hunter-wilds-director-pleads-with-lapsed-players-to-return/"><strong>producer Yuya Tokuda pleaded with lapsed players to return</strong></a>, but it seems the game's <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">reputation</strong> and the <strong>performance issues that still persist</strong> are not only keeping players away, but are <strong>deterring new ones</strong> as well.</p>



<p>Earlier today, CAPCOM shared <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf"><strong>a list of its best-selling games</strong></a> for the third quarter of the current fiscal year. While <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/"><strong>Street Fighter 6</strong></a></em>, <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/devil-may-cry-5-special-edition/"><strong>Devil May Cry 5</strong></a>,</em> and the <em>Resident Evil</em> series <strong>enjoyed strong sales</strong>, the same cannot be said of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>



<p>The latest entry in the series sold <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">354,000 units</strong> in the third quarter, as opposed to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">453,000 units of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-pc-dont-fear-the-rampage/">Monster Hunter Rise</a></em> and the 431,000 units of its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Sunbreak</em></a> expansion</strong>. This difference in units sold (which may have been helped by the deep discounts of the older games offered during the holiday period), and its status as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">publisher's worst-selling game in the quarter</strong>, further highlight the struggle <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is facing, and can't seem to overcome.</p>



<p><span><em>"Rise selling more than Wilds is pretty damning,"</em>&nbsp;commented <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-q3-fy2025-best-selling-games-re4-1-08m-re-village-717k-sf6-600k-re2-529k-mh-rise-453k-mh-wilds-354k.1417129/post-150569974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ResetERA forums member Gilo</a></strong>, a sentiment that describes well a&nbsp;<strong>baffling and unexpected situation,</strong>&nbsp;a</span>nd that reflects how the gaming community is reacting to <strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' low sales.</strong></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bluetti-mini-portable-power-station-drops-below-black-friday-prices-now-an-affordable-emergency-backup-for-outages-2000663272</link>
            <guid>1417300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power stations make it easy to keep your important devices, as well as essential home appliances, running during outages and off-road trips. If you’re concerned about a winter storm affecting the electricity supply in your area, or just want a reliable backup power solution for your outdoor adventures, a power station can come in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">Now is a great time to pick up a portable option, as Amazon is offering the Bluetti Elite 10 mini at a 43% discount today.</a> You can pick it up for just $113, after saving a nice $86 on its retail price. This offer applies to both grey and meadow green versions of the power station. The only thing to note here is that the offer is only around for a limited time. We highly suggest grabbing it sooner rather than later if you want to avoid paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry</h2>
<p>This power station is truly portable. It fits in your palm, weighs just 4.0 lbs, and features an ergonomic handle that makes the thing incredibly easy to carry around. In fact, it fits within the size guidelines of most airlines, so you can take it with you on flights, too.</p>
<p>As for the power, the Elite 10 is a 128Wh option that’s equivalent to 4 regular power banks. You’re getting a 200W AC outlet, 100W USB-C fast charging, and multiple DC ports to keep multiple devices charged and running. The capacity is more than enough to charge your smartphone more than 6 times and juice a laptop to full twice. You can even power a mini fridge for around 1.8 times, or keep a projector running for a bit. It plays nicely with a wide range of devices, so whether it’s your tech essentials that need a boost or some emergency lights requiring power, it supports them all.</p>



<p>The Elite 10 mini includes a built-in light with three lighting modes with up to 50 hours of illumination, too. These include warm, cool, and SOS, which is handy in low-light situations and emergencies. You can control the power station right through your phone using the dedicated app. It lets you keep an eye on the charging situation, choose light modes, adjust input, and more.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you can power it back up in three ways. The first is 150W AC charging, which helps it hit 100% in just over an hour. The 100W solar charging (best to pair with Bluetti 60W/100W panels), and 100W car charging via cigarette lighter are supported too. What’s even better is that the Elite 10 mini comes with a built-in 10ms UPS and features 350W bypass output, which can keep gadgets running without interruption during outages.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Bluetti Elite 10 mini power station itself, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">You can pick this portable, easy-to-use, but powerful option for $113 at Amazon.</a> This is nothing considering the ease of mind and convenience this appliance brings. Be sure to get your orders in fast, as the deal can wrap up any moment now.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="542">Apple’s Find My app is one of those tools you don’t fully appreciate until the moment you really need it. It’s the safety net for those heart-stopping situations when you realize something important isn’t where it’s supposed to be. Leaving a phone behind at a restaurant, walking away from a laptop at a café, and looking down at your wrist to check the time and being met with a harsh tan line where you watch is supposed to be—all scenarios where Find My proves its worth. It doesn’t always deliver miracles, but even knowing where something last checked in can bring a surprising amount of relief.</p>
<p data-start="544" data-end="1001">The real magic of the Find My ecosystem shows up when you expand beyond Apple’s core devices. AirTags make it possible to track everyday items with the same confidence you’d have with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. These small, lightweight discs can be attached to or inserted into nearly anything you own. Keys, wallets, backpacks, and even tech like handheld gaming consoles can all be added to your digital map with minimal effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="544" data-end="1001">Ease Your Mind When on the Move</h2>
<p data-start="1003" data-end="1401">Travel is where AirTags truly shine. Lost luggage is one of the most frustrating parts of flying, especially when airlines struggle to provide clear updates. Slipping an AirTag into a checked bag gives you a real-time view of where your belongings are, sometimes offering more accurate information than the airline itself. It may not mean you’ll get it back any sooner, but at least you can be confident whether your bag is at least in the same continent.</p>
<p data-start="1403" data-end="1776">For anyone considering adding AirTags to their setup, Amazon is making the decision easier right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">A four-pack that typically sells for $99 is currently discounted to $70 on Amazon. That’s a 29% price drop, bringing the cost down to roughly $17.50 per AirTag</a>. For an accessory that can protect hundreds or even thousands of dollars’ worth of gear, that’s really nothing at all.</p>


<p data-start="1778" data-end="2149">Setup is straightforward. Pairing an AirTag requires nothing more than bringing it close to your iPhone or iPad and following a brief on-screen prompt. Once connected, it appears in the Find My app alongside your other devices. Custom names can be assigned to each AirTag, making it easy to tell at a glance which one is attached to your keys, bag, purse, etc.</p>
<p data-start="2151" data-end="2480">Finding misplaced items around the house is another area where AirTags prove their usefulness. The built-in speaker can be activated through the Find My app, producing a clear sound that helps pinpoint items hiding under furniture or buried in clutter. That can save you a whole afternoon of turning your entire apartment upside down to find your car keys.</p>

            <guid>1417276</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is finally here, and it’s brought with it a fair share of new content. From a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy Display Project</a> to a new Minor Map Condition, it’s a fairly exciting update, but one thing has caught the fanbase off guard—the new Augments.</p>



<p>It wasn’t mentioned anywhere in the build-up to the update, but now that it’s here, two new Epic Augments have been confirmed to have arrived in ARC Raiders. Augments are crucial to planning your loadout, and by the looks of things, these two new ones are about to shift the meta in a major way.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to find out what the two new Epic Augments are in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-january-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, as well as how to get your hands on them.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">What Are The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will they be better than the Survivor Augment? Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The two new Epic Augments in ARC Raiders are the Tactical Mk. 3 Revival and the Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper.</strong></p>



<p>Both Augments are of the Epic rarity, and they each bring some unique traits to the table. Here are both of their unique traits:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Augment Name</th><th data-align="center">Augment Trait</th><th data-align="center">Augment Shield Compatibility</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Tactical Mk. 3 Revival</td><td data-align="center">Restores 1 health every 5 seconds. When damage is taken, the effect is paused for 30 seconds.<br>Augmented Slot has a Defib.</td><td data-align="center">Light</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Survivor Mk. 3 Safekeeper</td><td data-align="center">A Safe Pocket that allows any item to be stored.</td><td data-align="center">Light<br>Medium<br>Heavy</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The star of the show is undoubtedly the Safekeeper Augment; having the ability to store any item in your safe pocket, including guns, is a major benefit to any raider, and it’s immediately one of the best Augments in the game. The Revival Augment, on the other hand, is a slight let down. The integrated Defib is a nice touch, but based on the name, fans were hoping for a self-reviving augment.</p>



<p>Let’s be real, though—everyone is going to want that Safekeeper Augment. But the question remains, where do you find it?</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-two-new-epic-augments-in-arc-raiders">Where To Find The Two New Epic Augments In ARC Raiders</h2>



<p><strong>As is the case with every other Augment in ARC Raiders, there’s no set spawn location to find them; instead, you’ll need to hope you find their Blueprint whilst looting.</strong></p>



<p>That’s not to say there aren’t places you can search to improve your odds of finding one, though. Your best bet is to load into a map during a Major Map Condition, like a Night Raid or Electromagnetic Storm. Once in, head to the High Loot zones, and get searching!</p>







<p>Some of the best containers are usually the Lockers and Cabinets, though Blueprints can be found just about anywhere. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stella Montis</a> is a great map for such looting excursions, but beware, as most raiders are bound to be on the prowl for the same Blueprints—and they don’t always play nice.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hytale">Hytale</a> has had a remarkably strong early access start, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-boss-calls-early-release-the-most-challenging-but-rewarding-experience">despite a number of development hiccups</a> and it broadly not being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">that different to genre-leader Minecraft</a>, so it comes as no surprise modders are already hard at work on all sorts of additions and tweaks.</p>
<p>Last week, we were blown away by one modder who managed to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-modder-puts-minecraft-and-doom-inside-the-world-map">get Minecraft running inside Hytale's world map</a>. Now, we've come across another young developer who might have cracked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-style storms inside the new blocky sensation. User <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper">dattadeveloper</a> shared his creation via X/Twitter on 26th January:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>Alongside the announcement, he also shared a link to <a href="https://builtbybit.com/resources/worldborder-api-included.91496/">download</a> his WorldBorder mod with an API. It's standalone and can be easily thrown into other projects. Border colours are fully customisable and it includes "multiple border shapes" as well as plenty of options to adjust it to each modder or player's needs. For something that's just come out, it's a very notable effort already.</p>
<p>The modder later shared <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014515716989014?s=20">other video examples</a> of WorldBorder in action and its possibilities. It's all impressive, and dattadeveloper appears to be ready to open the floodgates and start collaborating with other modders and event organisers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> veterans may remember how battle royale modes inspired by The Hunger Games popped off more than a decade ago, so we're getting a strong sensation of déjà vu here as Hytale positions itself as the minimal refresh the subgenre needed. Still, it'll take much more to dethrone Xbox and Mojang's behemoth, so we're curious to see how everything unfolds over the course of 2026.</p><p>For now, dattadeveloper <a href="https://x.com/dattadeveloper/status/2016014522025132531?s=20">is already experimenting</a> with his own take on Hunger Games-like modes, so it's just a matter of time before large community efforts around such competitive game modes begin to take shape thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-hytale-mods">Hytale mods</a> like this one.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>You're shuffling through the desert scrub, wondering if the clawed beasts just a few yards away have spotted you yet. You've made sure to pop a Stealth Boy just to be extra safe, and told Raul that if his knees creak at an inopportune moment, he's on his own. Then, you realise you brought Rex along, and he's gotten stuck on a rock several meters behind you. Finally freeing himself, the good boy bounds towards you at full speed. This should be the point in some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a> stealthing that you realise it's brown trousers time.</p>
<p>It isn't, because Obsidian weren't total sadists when they designed the thing. It does take you out of your Mojave roleplay a bit, though. Thankfully, I can report that a modder has taken it upon themselves to ensure that New Vegas now benefits from the finest in sneaking dog technology.</p>

<p>The modder who's cracked the code to covert canines goes by Wombat, and has been doing <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/95967?tab=description">plenty of cool stuff</a> with New Vegas' animations as of late. Their '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/96002?tab=description">Dog Sneak Animations</a>' does exactly what it says on the tin, adding in some extra movements which allow companions like Rex and Dogmeat to drop into a prone crawl whenever your character decides the time is right for stealthy crouch-walking.</p><p>Seriously, just look at Rex go in the video about, tail wagging just enough to betray how happy he is at the idea of pouncing on some unsuspecting raider. Are dogs actually this good at sneaking in real life? As a cat owner, I've got no idea, but if nothing else the animation's cute enough to distract you momentarily if you sneak yourself into a tight spot you're not going to be able to get out of.</p>
<p>The mod should also support modded dog companions, and judging by the comments could potentially be tweaked to include New Vegas' coyote-snake hybrid Nightstalkers, who'd certainly fit as sneaky slithering sidekicks. Wombat also notes that they've already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94901?tab=description">added to some sneak animations</a> to another non-human companion in the form of loveable robot ball ED-E. Though, there's no video preview for that one, so I can't tell you whether it causes the bot to grow limbs and start scrabbling around on his belly like the dogs.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you fancy creeping around with one of the Mojave's mutts, you'll need to grab a few other mods to get sneaking dogs working. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67883">New Vegas Script Extender</a>'s up first, with the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277?tab=description">JIP LN NVSE Plugin</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/71336">kNVSE Animation Plugin</a> to follow, all of which are common New Vegas frameworks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-hard-on-valentines-day-deals-love-sculpture-art-set-hits-its-lowest-price-and-is-selling-out-fast-2000663268</link>

              <p>LEGO has endured for a reason. It’s rare to find a brand that speaks just as clearly to kids exploring creativity and adults rediscovering it later in life. There’s something calming about opening a LEGO box, dropping out all the individual pieces across the carpet, sorting them out, and then getting started with the build. I personally like to pop on music or a podcast as I connect brick to brick, zoning out for a bit and enjoying the break from every day life for a moment.</p>
<p>Though putting together LEGO doesn’t have to be a lonely activity. It’s something you and your partner can do together, perhaps even as a Valentine’s Day date at home. And LEGO has the perfect set for the occasion. This art collectible set spells out in four letters, L-O-V-E to remind each other why you’re doing it. Show you love someone by gifting them this home decor LEGO set, then putting it together with them. It even happens to be one sale ahead of the special holiday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">Normally sold for $80, it’s now marked down 20%. That ends up shaving off $16, bringing the price to just $64 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebration of an Icon</h2>
<p>Now this isn’t just some design LEGO cooked up themselves. This is based on artist Robert Indiana’s iconic pop art. He first created it as a card back in 1964. Later in 1970, he adapted it into a 144-inch tall sculpture, now located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Since then, many different incarnations have been created, finding homes in cities including Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, but now potentially your living room too.</p>
<p>This 791-piece LEGO set is thankfully not as tall as the original. No, this one only measures in at a humble 10 inches tall by 10 inches wide, by 2.5 inches deep. It has the same vibrant red, blue and green colors. Just looking at pictures of this has me wondering when LEGO is going to make a set of the Nintendo 64 start-up screen logo. One day, hopefully.</p>



<h2>Build With a Loved One</h2>
<p>Really leaning into the Valentine’s Day theming of this set, it is even packed with two copies of the instructions, encouraging couples or duos of any kinds to work together on the build.</p>
<p>The set is even popular enough that a number of third party vendors on Amazon are selling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6895/">LED kits custom made to line up with the outer edge of each letter, turning your lovely LEGO set into a cute lamp.</a></p>

            <p>
French unions representing workers at Ubisoft have reportedly voted unanimously in favour of strike action following the company's recent dramatic "reset" and in response to a voluntary redundancy proposal that could see as many as 200 Paris HQ employees lose their jobs.
</p>
<p>
Last week, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">announced</a> a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", resulting in the cancellation of six games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">troubled Price of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> - as well as delays for seven other titles, the closure of its Halifax mobile studio and Stockholm studio, and a mandate for all remaining staff to return to in-office work five days a week.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, Ubisoft is proposing a voluntary round of redundancies as it seeks to further reduce operating costs. The move - which is being organised under the voluntary Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) process, wherein employees can collectively negotiate the mutually agreed termination of a permanent contract - could result in as many as 200 jobs cut at Ubisoft's Paris headquarters. That's reportedly around 18 percent of the company's Paris HQ workforce, said to number approximately 1100 employees in total.
</p>
<p>
"In line with last week's announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives," a Ubisoft spokesperson <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">confirmed in a statement provided to IGN</a>, "Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France."
</p><p>
"At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities," the spokesperson continued. "The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide."
</p>
<p>
In response to the companys's voluntary redundancy proposal, as per French financial publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033">Les Echos</a>, unions representing Ubisoft workers - specifically, Syndicat des travailleurs et travailleuses du jeu vidéo (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, la CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps écologique - have unanimously agreed to strike. The strike is due to run from 10th-12th February, and will reportedly see unions coordinating with their international counterparts in a bid to expand the scope of the action.
</p>
<p>
Following word of Ubisoft's latest "reset", the company's share price <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-reset-wipes-34-off-its-share-price-the-lowest-in-15-years">plummeted 34 percent</a>, resulting in its lowest share price in 15 years.

<p>A new trademark has been filed for the upcoming open-world game mode set to launch with EA FC 27. </p>



<p>The discussions, leaks, and rumours about EA Sports introducing an open world with their upcoming title have been circulating for months now. Back in November 2025, we even saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-ea-fc-open-world-gameplay-has-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay leaks</a> for this mode, with the open world looking pretty similar to NBA 2K’s. Now, the developers have trademarked the name for this mode. </p>







<h2 id="h-ea-fc-27-s-open-world-mode-trademark-surfaces-online">EA FC 27’s Open World Mode Trademark Surfaces Online</h2>



<p>Spotted by Matheus Gamer on <a href="https://x.com/gamer_matheusx/status/2015964505176441211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) via <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/ea-sports-trademarks-name-for-ea-fc-27s-open-world-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a>, EA Sports FC registered the name ‘FC The Grounds’ for their open-world game mode on January 23, 2026. The website, <a href="https://trademarks.justia.com/996/11/fc-the-99611789.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Justia Trademarks</a>, features a description for this patent, which states the following: “The mark consists of the stylized letters’ FC’ set in a triangular shape tilted on an angle, with a small triangle at the left corner and the words’ THE GROUNDS’ in stylized letters.” </p>



<p>For those unaware, an <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-planned-open-world-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive report</a> from FGZ confirmed that EA Sports will introduce its highly anticipated open-world mode in EA FC 27. The new game mode will feature explorable areas known as Districts, each inspired by a prominent footballing nation. Since most EA FC titles are released in September, players can anticipate the next title around that time. Hopefully, an official announcement regarding the new mode should arrive before the release date.</p>

			<p>The Switch was never known as a place for serious racing games. There’s any number of reasons for that – younger audience demographics, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario’s karting stranglehold</a>, it’s lower processing power – but that didn’t stop at least one company dipping their toe in. Admittedly, the GRID series isn’t the most serious out there, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/01/grid-autosport-switch-review/">GRID Autosport</a> was a showcase for what could be achieved on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, handily shrinking down a racing game from yesteryear to run on the go. It’s fitting, then, that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/grid-legends">GRID Legends</a> is arriving on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, once again becoming a beacon for Nintendo-owning racing fans who want to race wherever they are. Oh, and gamers who know that there are racing options that don’t feature moustachioed plumbers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pre-order Now — GRID™ Legends: Deluxe Edition Arrives on Nintendo Switch 2 January 29th!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1xP3-wlwyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/25/grid-legends-review/">GRID Legends originally released in 2022</a>, appearing across the last generation PS4 and Xbox One, as well as the shinier PS5 and Xbox Series consoles. That immediately puts it in a good spot for the Switch 2, with Nintendo’s newest system sitting somewhere between the two, performing comparably to the PS4 in many scenarios, while tapping into some of the latest techniques like DLSS and ray tracing.</p>


<p>As with GRID Autosport, Feral Interactive has taken the high octane reins from original developer Codemasters. Their approach here is certainly successful, especially because they put the game’s performance and visuals directly within your control.</p>


<p>There’s multiple graphics options, split between docked and handheld, and I immediately love that there’s defined options for both, meaning that you can have different choices set up for either situation. Docked is more straightforward. Here there’s a Graphics option, with the game set to 30fps, but with all of the effects and visual eye-candy turned up. You’re getting some lovely reflections here, enhanced weather effects and a higher resolution, sharper image, and it really does look very good indeed, albeit with the odd spot of pop-in here and there.</p>
<p>All that said, the moment you switch to the Performance mode, all of those visual niceties are forgotten. At 60fps the game just feels so much tighter, more accurate and responsive. If you’re truly a fan of racing games, you’d be hard pressed to go back to the solid, but ultimately slower-feeling Graphics option.</p>

<p>Handheld play brings even more choice and granularity. There’s four different options here, and alongside the previous Graphics and Performance, there’s Balanced as a mid-point between the two, and Battery Saver, which tunes down both graphics and performance in order to keep you playing for longer.</p>
<p>You can also toggle enhanced effects on and off too, for a further performance to power option. Crucially, every one of these visual options feels valid in some way. Saber Interactive have given players an amazing suite of options to choose from, and in aping a more PC-like suite of options, they’ve set a new benchmark for Nintendo Switch 2 ports. It could be argued that’s too many options for a fixed platform, but it doesn’t hurt to have.</p>
<p>Even at the lowest Battery Saving mode, the visuals are clean and crisp, and the game is thoroughly playable, though it looks more like the original GRID Autosport than you’re probably expecting, losing all of the visual bells and whistles that you’ll see further up the graphical options.</p>
<p>GRID Legends story mode has aged surprisingly well. The huge, ongoing popularity of racing series like Drive to Survive and Nascar Full Speed, means that GRID Legends documentary-style live action footage and in-engine racing still feels of the moment, and becoming Driver 22 puts you in the midst of it all. You are an unknown rookie, joining the upstart team Seneca Racing, aiming to take them from paddock nobodies to the talk of the track.</p>
<p>It is, admittedly, a little too earnest at times, and it sometimes doesn’t entirely match up with your race performances, but it’s fun, mostly well acted, and lends the game a real sense of drama. You can also become the Leonardo di Caprio pointing meme looking out for the current Doctor Who, with Ncuti Gatwa appearing as one of the race drivers.</p>

<p>Despite being four years old, there’s a lot that feels pulled from Brad Pitt’s big-budget F1 movie, especially the intense, Hans Zimmer-esque music that rises and falls through each race. I can see it being a point of contention for some – you can always turn it off – but if you want to feel like you’re in the middle of an underdog racing story, GRID Legends has it nailed.</p>
<p>One of the other reasons that the Nintendo Switch wasn’t the preferred home for serious racers was the lack of analogue triggers on either Joy-Con or Pro Controller, which are a practical necessity for modern racing games. You can adjust, though. I grew up when all racing game controls were digital, and I still find myself reverting to taps on the stick and triggers rather than small, smooth adjustments. After a moment’s adjustment, I barely noticed when playing GRID Legends. It helps that the handling and ultra-grippy cars make this rather forgiving and intended to be welcoming, and &nbsp;it all comes together really well on Switch 2.</p>

<p>Feral Interactive have built in analogue control options though. The first is to utilise the right analogue stick, giving you precise control over the cars braking and acceleration, though in a way that feels deeply unusual to me and hard to get used to. The easier option? GRID Legends supports the official Switch 2 GameCube controller, which has two, great-feeling analogue triggers. Suddenly, racing games seem a lot more appealing on the Switch 2…</p>

<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161545/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>For serious petrolheads, the Switch 1 wasn't exactly a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/burnout_paradise_remastered">(Burnout)</a> paradise platform. In fact, given the size of the console's library, there's surprisingly little in the way of even semi-serious racing sims for those looking for more than kart racing, smaller-scale experiences that hone in on one aspect and expand (such as the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/art_of_rally">art of rally</a>), or more general arcade fare (like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hot_wheels_unleashed_2_turbocharged">Hot Wheels Unleashed</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/horizon_chase_turbo">Horizon Chase Turbo</a>).</p>
<p>These are all great games, for sure, but even now, with the Switch successor nearly eight months into its life, what are we looking at in terms of sim-styled stuff? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_3">Rush Rally 3</a> and its follow-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rush_rally_origins">Rush Rally Origins</a>, perhaps, but precious little. 2019's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grid_autosport">GRID Autosport</a> still stands out, though.</p>
<p>I know, Codemasters' 2014 racer (brought to Switch by Feral Interactive) isn't really a sim either, not purely, but it's a different level of racing experience to the others I've mentioned. You can have a big, serious career across multiple disciplines, and so it's a game that comes as close to the likes of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_motorsport">Forza</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/gran_turismo_7">Gran Turismo</a> as you'll currently get on a Switch. Indeed, it's the most impressive racing game port I've played on the console, giving you the full-fat package of single-player content to race through local and online multiplayer was added in post-launch updates), and with no major performance issues to speak of. It also looks great, even now.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161546/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Now 2022's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/grid-legends-deluxe-edition">GRID Legends</a>, the most recent series entry, has landed on Switch 2 and it's brought all the same graphics options and tweakable bells and whistles as its impressive predecessor — more about those in a bit — whilst also upping the ante in terms of the depth and scope of its solo content. Nice! However, does it have the bleedin' multiplayer at launch this time?</p>
<p>No, it doesn't. And whilst, yes, it's a shame, I have to say, as someone who owns this game on other platforms, you're not missing much. At all. In fact, given that online leaderboards <em>have</em> made the cut here, I'd go so far as to say you've still got the best and cleanest multiplayer element intact. It's unclear if multiplayer might be patched in later, like its predecessor.</p>
<p>However, Legends <em>is</em> aiming to please primarily by bringing narrative aspects and solo content to the fore. It feels like that rare sort of racer that's been made with single-player racing fans in mind, in fact. Its story and campaign modes are where it sings, mixing a little light drama with racing that can, and does, get fairly explosive on the regular. Also, this Deluxe Edition lands with all previously-released DLC, meaning there's loads more to dig into in these modes.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161547/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's talk about the handling of the cars. The Grid games hit my own personal sweet spot (most of the time) for controls in an arcade-sim/simcade style. It immediately feels very satisfying to put your boot down and tear up a straight; to drift ferociously through corners or handbrake at the last second into a hairpin and swing your back around, ready to rinse and repeat step one. If you've played any modern arcade racer, you're immediately comfortable, and this game feels as good as any of its peers when you're on the track. In fact, I've been on a bit of a racer kick lately, and I can say that this one easily beats out <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/need_for_speed_heat">Need For Speed Heat</a></strong> <em>and</em> <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/need_for_speed_unbound">Need for Speed Unbound</a></strong>. Both lovely games, but this one wins on controls, it wins on content, and it wins on giving solo players loads that they'll feel the need to speed into. (Thank you.)</p>
<p>Now, let's reverse a bit, because I mentioned controls and whilst for some, the lack of a multiplayer suite will be the primary annoyance, it's Nintendo's choice of digital triggers on the Switch 2's controllers that bothers me most for this type of experience. It's not a complete killer, not at all, and I'm sure you've had plenty of experience with it in the past, but it's going to be an issue for some finesse fans who don't want to start considering new control setups or tweaking in order to attain the level of throttle control they enjoy.</p>
<p>Of course, and you'll know this if you've checked out our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-1-and-2-games-with-analogue-trigger-compatibility-that-work-with-the-gamecube-nso-controller">recent guide to Switch 1 and 2 games with analogue trigger support for GameCube controllers</a>, you <em>can</em> also use your snazzy NSO GameCube pad to override this issue and enjoy the wonder of technology that's been around since the late '90s. With the GC controller plugged in, the game shines all the brighter.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161538/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I do also think, on balance, that the lack of analogue triggers on the default controllers isn't quite as important as it could have been. There's no way you're getting me around Monaco in an exacting F1 game with digital triggers, for example — I'm crashing 1000 times on the first bend — but it works fine for what's presented here.</p>
<p>Onto the modes on offer, and Grid Legends brings lots to the table. Besides the main story mode, which I'll get to in a bit, we've got a career that's split up over four unlockable levels, starting with a rookie program and ending in a gauntlet of pro challenges. With a total of nine disciplines to try to master, from touring and electric cars to open-wheeled vehicles, trucks, and high-performance GT stuff (my favourite), there are 128 motors and 137 track routes set in 22 different locations here. Yes, I did say it's a meaty one.</p>
<p>Free play mode then gives you single player quick races, single race events and custom cups for you to set up at your leisure, whilst Dynamic Events mode, as I briefly mentioned earlier, allow you to pit your online times against others via leaderboards.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161539/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the main course, that is the game's 'Drive to Glory' story mode, this roughly seven-hour affair sees you rise up the ranks through events and trials in a tale that's as rote as they come, but it does have an ace up its sleeve! And that ace, my friends, is live-action acting for the cutscenes and all the main parts of rival racers and team members, making for some utterly hammy, totally unnecessary, and really, actually, quite fun cutscenes.</p>
<p>I also vastly prefer the overall style of how this stuff gets delivered here; dropped in casually and quickly as we set up for races and arrive at paddocks, and so on, rather than cutting away for big chunks. It gives you a story, and it keeps you near to the action at all times. So, if you feel like the narrative aspects <em>might</em> get in the way of racing, fear not, as it's a well-balanced thing, and having voices and faces for opponents sure does bring a new level of competitiveness on the track, too. <em>"I really hate that guy!"</em> you'll scream as you ram into their car and make an enemy, or a 'rival', as the game labels it.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161540/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, the racing here once again incorporates the Grid series' slick nemesis system, and it's been improved in Legends, making for some seriously dirty races as you start to make <del>enemies</del> rivals who'll then make sure to get payback by spinning you out on a corner or shunting you at the worst possible moment. I love it, and you can toggle off the rough stuff if you're not a fan, as there are difficulty levels for everyone to enjoy here and options galore.</p>
<p>Speaking of options, this one has got all the graphics modes found in GRID Autosport. So, you've a choice between "Graphics" and "Performance" in TV mode (30/60fps, respectively). In handheld, we get both performance and quality as above, with the addition of a "Balanced" mode and a "Battery Saver" mode.</p>
<p>I've been messing with all of these and the visual quality mode, whilst fine, isn't worth the sacrifice for how smooth performance feels at a solid 60fps. I'll also say I've been pretty blown away by how great the performance mode looks on a big TV screen. There's no need to worry about awful textures and image quality at all with this, it looks fab.</p>
<figure><a title="GRID Legends: Deluxe Edition Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161541/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In handheld, I've landed on the balanced mode after lots of experimenting. It feels that bit smoother than quality and looks sublime on the console's little screen. There are also options to turn on or off enhanced visual effects and to reduce rain intensity, so plenty to muck with, and the game delivers top-notch, highly enjoyable and responsive racing on the go as a result.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you can make peace with a lack of multiplayer outside of online leaderboards, alongside the fact that digital triggers aren't ideal if you're after precision throttle control (grab a GameCube NSO pad to swerve this issue), Grid Legends on Switch 2 serves up an excellent package of slick and satisfying 'simcade' action that looks and plays wonderfully well in both docked and handheld.</p>
<p>With lots of options in terms of graphics and accessibility, and all previously-released DLC included, this is easily the best racing package of this type that's currently available on either of Nintendo's Switches and a real blast for solo racing fans.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Requiem Zombies Are More Unpredictable Than Ever Because They Retain Some of Their Human Memories]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-more-unpredictable-than-ever/</link>
            <guid>1417204</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Throughout the marketing phase of <strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong>, <strong>CAPCOM</strong> kept quiet about a few things. One was famously <strong>the presence of Leon Kennedy as a playable character</strong>, which leaker Dusk Golem swore about for a long time but <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-look-at-leon-s-kennedy-in-resident-evil-requiem-has-arrived-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained unconfirmed until last month</a>. </p>



<p>Another was <strong>the zombies</strong>, the key enemy in the whole series. How would they look? What would they behave like? It was only recently that the developers finally opened up about this. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-zombies-are-unpredictable-in-ways-the-series-hasnt-tried-before/1100-6537627/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a fresh interview with Gamespot</a>, Game Director Koshi Nakanishi unveiled the twist: to make them more unpredictable, CAPCOM <strong>has ensured they retain some of their human behavior</strong>.</p>



<p><em>When making a Resident Evil title, the question of how to present zombies is always something that comes up in discussions. You want to have some variety, but at the same time, if you make too many changes, it doesn't feel like a zombie anymore, so there's always that element or that challenge of designing enemies for a Resident Evil title. In this setting, you're dealing with a lot of zombies who literally just became zombies momentarily or a while ago. It's pretty fresh.</em></p>



<p><em>Part of that fear experience is not knowing what the enemy is going to do when they approach you or when you see them, and so if you just had a standard zombie, you probably by now have an idea of what a zombie's going to do. But if you had these zombies here that retained some of their memories or behavior from their previous life, then there's more of a mystery element. You're not exactly sure what they're going to do.</em></p>



<p>That's certainly an interesting concept. Over the course of the series, zombies did become a bit trite and less scary than they were at first. Will this change in Resident Evil Requiem be enough to make players fear them once again? We'll know in a month when the game will be released across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2).</p>

              <p>As spotted by the fine folks over at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/rumour-switch-online-gamecube-releases-might-have-been-leaked"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, it appears Walmart may have rather given away a couple of big Nintendo secrets. On the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719">Nintendo section of the retail giant’s website</a> there’s a section called “Unlock more” which sells you a $35 gift card unlocking the Nintendo Online Family Membership subscription deal. The image promoting this looks like the usual array of box covers used by Nintendo, except in among them appear two games we didn’t know were on the way, and they’re doozies.</p> <p>Between the likes of all-time classics like <em>F-Zero</em>,&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Country</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 64</em> are GameCube games&nbsp;<em>Pikmin 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime: Echoes</em>. Neither are listed among Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-gamecube-nintendo-classics-switch-2/">GameCube collection</a> for the subscription service, which currently includes just eight games, most recently adding&nbsp;<em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663433"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663433">© Walmart / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>GameCube games are exclusive to the Switch 2 version of the ludicrously named Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so the small number of games added over what’s rapidly becoming the first year of the new console has been pretty disappointing. It certainly offers some stone-cold classics, like&nbsp;<em>SoulCailbur II</em>, <em>The Legend of </em><em>Zelda: Wind Waker</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, but it’s perhaps harder to get overly excited about&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Stikers </em>and&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure!</em> Given Nintendo could already have included <em>Zelda: Twilight Princess</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>, they do seem very odd choices.</p> <p>Of course, a lot of the best Nintendo-published GameCube games become tricky prospects for the company to add, as Nintendo’s endless recycling of its properties becomes a little starkly revealed if it does. <em>Kirby Air Ride</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Party 4, 5, 6 </em>and<em> 7</em>,&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario Power Tennis</em>,&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime</em>,&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>…any of them might eat into attempts to sell either recent remasters or current sequels.</p>

 <p>Even the two Walmart has seemingly revealed are on the edge of this phenomenon, although a <em>Pikmin 5&nbsp;</em>appears to still only exist in Miyamoto’s animation-obsessed mind, and perhaps the addition of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime II</em> suggests we’re not likely to see a remaster of the sequel any time soon. Given just how brilliantly 2023’s <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> worked out, that’s a proper shame if the case.</p>

 <p>Let’s hope these two titles are for real, and not just an over-excited Walmart employee getting slap-happy with Photoshop. Given the image is still up on Walmart’s site many hours after&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Life</em> broke the story it seems Nintendo hasn’t scrambled, although it could be because everyone involved is in bed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Headwinds update for ARC Raiders is here, and perhaps the star of the show is the new Project, the Trophy Display. Similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project-guide-all-requirements-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flickering Flames Project</a> that arrived with the Cold Snap update, it has five stages for you to complete, and if you couldn’t tell by the title, you’ll be hunting a lot of ARC.</p>



<p>It’s not all for glory, though, as there are some genuinely exciting rewards up for grabs this time around. However, it won’t come easily, as it’ll have you pitted up against a whole variety of ARCs; from small Ticks to feisty Leapers, you’ll need to keep your wits about you.</p>







<p>If you don’t want to waste any time and make your raids efficient, then you’re in the right place. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Trophy Display Project in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-arc-raiders-meta-guns-tier-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have to complete it.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It starts off simple enough. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil. </strong></p>



<p>Frustratingly, you cannot cycle through the stages to see what you’ll need down the line, and since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> is so fresh, only the first stage of the Project is visible. However, as more and more of the Trophy Display Project is unveiled, Insider Gaming will be sure to update the guide with the next stages.</p>



<p>For now, though, here’s every known stage of the Trophy Display Project, including the requirements as well as the rewards:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Project Stage</th><th data-align="center">Project Requirements</th><th data-align="center">Project Rewards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stage 1: Roaming Threats</td><td data-align="center">– 3 Rusted Bolts<br>– 15 Pop Triggers<br>– 15 Tick Pods<br>– 5 Surveyor Vaults</td><td data-align="center">– 10 Mod Components<br>– 3 Power Rods<br>– 10 Raider Tokens<br>– 1 Light Gun Parts Blueprint</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Project Completion</td><td data-align="center">Complete all 5 Stages</td><td data-align="center">– Howl Emote<br>– 1 Legendary Jupiter Sniper Rifle<br>– 1 Acoustic Guitar<br>– 5 Energy Clips<br>– 300,000 Coins</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>There’s an incredible incentive to complete the project, with the likes of 300,000 Coins and a Jupiter Sniper Rifle up for grabs—and that’s not including the Blueprints and Raider Tokens along the way! It’s undeniably an exciting Project, but do you need to rush through it to claim the rewards before time runs out?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-arc-raiders-trophy-display-project-end">When Does The ARC Raiders Trophy Display Project End?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You won’t want to miss these rewards. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As things stand, there is no expiry date on the Trophy Display Project in ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>That means you can take as long as you’d like to grind through the Project and earn the rewards, and it’s a welcome change when compared to the rush that was the Flickering Flames Project. Embark Studios also confirmed that progress will not be reset between Expedition resets, so there’s no risk heading out on the next departure if you’re only halfway through the Project.</p>







<p>That doesn’t mean that an end date won’t be added to the Project in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-2026-roadmap-live-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">future</a>, though. It could be months away yet, but it might be best not to leave it too late, especially as it seems like there’s a solid grind on the cards here. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-online-leak-hurts-hope-of-metroid-prime-2-remaster/</link>
            <guid>1417189</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Walmart has leaked two titles coming to the Nintendo Switch Online service, including the addition of Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, damaging hopes that a remake was in the works.</p>



<p>Fans have been clamouring for a remake of Metroid Prime 2 ever since the release of the original Metroid Prime remaster in 2023, with many speculating the absence of the second title on the Nintendo Switch Online service was due to the game being set to receive similar treatment.</p>







<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-2-amp-pikmin-2-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online">Metroid Prime 2 &amp; Pikmin 2 Coming to Nintendo Switch Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leaked. Image via Walmart</figcaption></figure>



<p>An image on the <a href="https://www.walmart.com/brand/nintendo/10030719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Walmart website</a> advertising the Nintendo Switch Online subscription showcases several of the major games available in the service, though two of those have not been officially revealed.</p>



<p>The image shows that Pikmin 2 and Metroid Prime 2 are due to be added to the service, and with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-coming-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Direct being showcased next week</a>, official confirmation could be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 2 would join the slew of titles from the franchise available in the service, though Metroid Prime itself is not available, with those who want to play the title instead having to splash out on the remaster.</p>



<p>Given that Nintendo would be highly unlikely to release a classic version of Metroid Prime 2 into the Nintendo Switch Online catalog if a remake of the title was planned, the news means that, at the very least, a remaster is still a way off, if it’s even in the pipeline at all.</p>

            <p>In a year full of awesome new game releases (many of which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusives), many agreed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders</a> was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">2025's top bangers</a>. Now, a new surprise patch has made it even better.</p>
<p>Players were hoping for meatier post-launch support than what Kirby creator Masahiro Sakurai teased <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">with his no DLC comments</a> back in October. Moreover, he said post-launch development on Kirby Air Riders would end soon as the development team planned to disband.</p>
<p>This is why <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">the 1.3.0 patch</a> is such a pleasant surprise. It dropped on 26th January and added several big new features to the game, with GameShare, a Grand Prix mode, and online matchmaking for two local players being the biggest additions.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/">GameShare feature</a> has been a strange one so far, with the game giant and some third-party developers adding it to some multiplayer-oriented games and skipping others. It essentially allows Switch 2 owners to "share" their game with other Switch systems close by or via GameChat (though there are restrictions for Switch 1 players who are limited to local GameShare). Casual racers are typically go-to games for local play, so Kirby Air Riders getting this extra is a welcome addition.</p><p>The Grand Prix mode is exactly what you think it is, but a bit of a bigger deal for Kirby Air Riders, since the game's regular racers are characterized by how blazing fast they are. A longer "match" that chains a bunch of them together is a great way to allow players to go sweatier and develop rivalries with random racers. Similarly, online play is also gaining a boost by allowing two local players to queue up for quick matches; hopefully, other online modes will be supported at a later date.</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68635">patch notes</a> are rather substantial and include many balance adjustments and fixes, with the market, customisation, and the central-show City Trial mode receiving the most love after the aforementioned additions.</p>

<p>Fur real</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Raptor Claw's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fur_squadron">FUR Squadron</a> rather proudly wore its <strong>Star Fox</strong> inspirations on its sleeve when it flew onto Switch back in 2023, and its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fur_squadron_phoenix">FUR Squadron Phoenix</a>, isn't shying away from things either.</p>
<p>This on-rails space shooter arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>25th February</strong>, and it looks every bit as McCloud-ian as we'd hoped. There's a crew of fluffy pilots, nimble space ships, an interplanetary "system" under threat from an evil force — yeah, this is Star Fox.</p>
<p>Much like its predecessor, however, there's a certain psychedelic sheen over the whole thing that stops FUR Squadron from feeling like a complete retread of things we've seen before. With neon visuals, CRT scan lines and mech battles (!!), there's a pretty intriguing vibe under all of the familiarity.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674650/FUR_Squadron_Phoenix/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A roguelite campaign where every run reshuffles the levels, keeping the action fresh and unpredictable.<br>
- Upgradeable ships, unlockable weapons, and skill trees that let you craft your own path to becoming an ace pilot.<br>
- Massive bosses, dynamic environments, and intense battles across space, air, and sea.<br>
- A dazzling arsenal: unleash power beams, multi-missile barrages, and even a nuke strike. Forget the basics—this is war with style.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raptor Claw claimed that the game was heading to Switch 2 last year, shortly after the console's first tease reveal, and while it will certainly be playable on the new system, Switch 1 owners won't miss out. Based on the studio's reply to a comment on the above trailer, FUR Squadron Phoenix has been designed for Switch 1, but will see "boosted performance" on the new hardware.</p>
<p>With Nintendo showing no sign of releasing a new Star Fox game anytime soon, we'll be relying on projects like this to fill the Lylat-shaped hole in our hearts.</p>

Reader, I am about to venture into that terrible ninth circle of videogame journalist cringe known as pitching your own game in an article. A while ago, I <a href="https://x.com/dirigiblebill/status/1501695516035403780">mused aloud on Xitter</a> that a Batman game (or offbrand spiritual homage) from the perspective of people trying to commit petty crimes in Gotham City would be Interesting and/or Countercultural.</p>
<p>You could portray Batman himself as both a lone vigilante and a pervasive environmental factor - a morbid, hallucinatory tendency of the architecture itself, gradually provoked and intensified by tiny acts of larceny and vandalism. Kind of like the Eye of Sauron, but it’s the Bat Signal, and instead of fighting the urge to wear the Ring, you’re stealing candy bars and writing on toilet walls.

The above “Batman but it’s the pedestrian POV” video from Gaming with Griff Griffin – disclosure, he’s an old colleague of mine from my time at Future Publishing in the early 2010s – isn’t really what I’m talking about. It shows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> from the perspective of random civilians, spectating on fights (with the usual slowmo) or watching the Caped Misbehaver glide and zipline through the cloudy night.</p><p>Still, it’s close enough to my Twitter concept that I’m going to sue the pants off Griffin. Or burst through his window in a latex suit and delete all his browser tabs… then open and close the browser again so that he can’t restore his previous webpages. With any luck, he’ll become the Joker and we can have a proper vendetta. It’s at least two years since I last had one of those.
</p>
<p>
The accompanying voiceover and editing elicit the quickfix reaction energy of TikTok and similar shortform video platforms. It works well enough, not least because Arkham Knight’s city is so sheeny, dirty and convincing. But it leaves me hankering for a longer video or write-up with fewer changes of POV - perhaps *ominous roll of thunder* a diary series like the ones we used to read on RPS before half the writing team got Thanos-snapped or rode off triumphantly into the sunset. I’m thinking of coverage akin to role-playing a peasant in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, treating it like a medieval life sim. But perhaps what I’m really thinking of, again, is a standalone game.
</p>
<p>
How would it feel, to be remotely anti-social and rebellious in a city prowled by Batman? You could lean into the Adam West absurdity of Bruce chasing after kids for sticking gum to park seats. Or you could give your character more of a backstory, and embrace pathos. Maybe you’re breaking into a pharmacy to get medicine for your mum. 
</p>
<p>
You could also use the format to play with the idea that Batman is, you know, kind of a big dirty fascist and one-man militia, deploying his billions to terrorise poor people who are always characterised as loudly dressed freaks or irredeemable hooligans in vests. You could investigate the idea that Batman is absolutely off his rocker, and that his derangement pervades the very stones and skies of Gotham City, sharpening the spires and filling the sewers with bats. You could play with the thought that we are all trapped in Batman’s dreadful dreams.
