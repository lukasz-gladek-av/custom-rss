		<p>Well…. it’s been quite the tumultuous week in the real world, but gaming has provided a pleasant escape. Oh sure, it hasn’t all been super rosy in the games industry at large, but there’s plenty excitement after a couple of great new game announcements and updates on some of the biggest games coming to Xbox (and PS5) later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-out-on-may-15-gets-pc-specs-80-price-no-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got its May 15 release date</a> and proper unveiling at the Xbox Developer Direct 2025, with id Software also providing lots more info to the press in a presentation and Q&amp;A that we reported on <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>So far, the game is officially slated to launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. However, <a href="https://xcancel.com/eXtas1stv/status/1882945918074282253?t=4lqcSUs-rJfJsq3p-rVdoA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Spanish leaker eXtas1s</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages will also be released for the newly announced Nintendo Switch 2. According to him, this particular news is being withheld because Nintendo reportedly has to give the green light for any new game coming to the Switch 2 (rather than the original Switch) before an announcement can happen.</p>
<p>Now, this isn't at all surprising. After all, Microsoft has already shown no problems with supporting Nintendo's platforms and is all-in on increasing multiplatform support. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was just featured in a new video Q&amp;A published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Danny Peña's YouTube channel</a>, where the executive once again teased more multiplatform games and expressed excitement for the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>I want people to be able to experience the games that we build, the services that we offer, on as many devices as we can. Obviously, some of the devices out there, some of the platforms are closed. They don't allow everything that we do to show up on those platforms.</em></p>
<p><em>The thing that I've learned and continue to learn when I'm listening to creators not only our own studios but other teams building games is every creator out there wants to build a game that can</em><br>
<em>find as many players as they want and frankly there aren't many platforms out there that try to build connections to people on so many different screens. It's almost like single platform, single</em><br>
<em>device, single game, and that's kind of the history of our business. We're really taking an approach of we want people to be able to play Xbox on many different screens. Now, not every experience will be the same. </em></p>
<p><em>We obviously love the native experience we have on our own platform and our own hardware and that's something that will continue for us, but we're not going to put walls up around where people can engage with the great games our studios are building or where they can experience Xbox. [...] I</em><br>
<em>want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just PlayStation. We love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's going to continue, we'll do more of it.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] I was exchanging emails with the CEO of Nintendo. I gave him a big congrats. I said, my old eyes appreciate the larger screen. Nintendo with their innovation and what they mean in this industry, I just always applaud the moves that they make. I think they did like a little flash video. I know we'll get more details over time. I'm really looking forward to supporting them with the games that we have and I just think they're such an important part of this industry. </em></p>
<p><em>Who would ever bet against the success of that team? I mean, they are just masterful at what they do. The Switch is a massive success and I think the Switch 2 will be as well.</em></p>
<p>Really, the only doubt anyone could have about DOOM: The Dark Ages eventually getting on the Switch 2 is on a technical level. Then again, 2016's reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-switch-impressive-subpar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched on the original Switch</a> with the help of Panic Button, which also ported DOOM Eternal to Nintendo's hybrid console. As such, the rumor isn't farfetched at all.</p>
<p>Of course, Switch 2 users won't be able to enjoy all the bells and whistles. On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support path tracing and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</a>. We still have to wait for confirmation from Nintendo, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to rumors</a>, the Switch 2 should support NVIDIA DLSS 2 Super Resolution plus Ray Reconstruction (3.5) but not Frame Generation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-aeldari-new-model-review-flying-high<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Flying in from their massive Craftworld ships, the Aeldari are strengthening their forces with new models and a brand new Codex! I got sent both by Games Workshop to check out for review, so read on for my thoughts!</p>

<h2>Asurmen</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-asurmen-.jpeg?itok=CqCyozqQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-asurmen-.jpeg?itok=9khmoe2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Asurmen leads the charge with his Bloody Twins pistols and his Sword of Asur!</figcaption></figure><p>Asurmen is the first of four incredible Leaders I was sent with this mailing, and his abilities are all about amping up the movement of the unit he can be attached to (Dire Avengers), and unleashing a major attack once per battle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Asurmen Stats:</strong> Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Asurmen Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li aria-level="1"><strong>Tactical Acumen: </strong>While leading a unit, this ability allows that unit to make a free 6” move after they’ve shot in their shooting phase.</li>
	<li aria-level="1"><strong>Hand of Asuryan: </strong>Once per battle, you can use this ability on this model when shooting to give its weapon (Bloody Twins) a DMG characteristic of 3 and Anti-Infantry 3+ and Devastating Wounds.</li>
</ul><h3>Asurmen - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Asurmen works best when attached to a unit of Dire Avengers, where he can help them use their already speedy 7" movement to get across the battlefield even faster with his Tactical Acumen ability. I've seen success in playtesting letting him lead a group of Avengers quickly toward an objective, shooting and moving for free. Then, I hunker down on the point with him, and wait for him to use his Hand of Asuryan ability until someone really scary comes along to contest it. And as soon as it's within that sweet 24" range of my Bloody Twins, I unleash hell!</p>

<h2>Baharroth</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-baharroth-model.jpg?itok=bg72KqDe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-baharroth-model.jpg?itok=z0mRYfGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Would it surprise you to learn that Baharroth, with his gigantic, gleaming wings, is a Leader designed to be attached to a unit of Swooping Hawks?&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><b>Baharroth Stats:&nbsp;</b>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Baharroth Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Cloudstrider:&nbsp;</strong>While this model leads a unit, if at the end of an opponent's turn this unit isn't within engagement range of any enemy units, you can remove the unit from play and set it up in Strategic Reserves. Also if using Deep Strike you can use this ability, setting up the unit anywhere as long as its 3" away horizontally from all enemy units (and it cannot charge this turn).</li>
	<li><strong>Cry of the Wind:&nbsp;</strong>Each time this model is set up on the battlefield, until end of that turn, when it makes a ranged attack successful unmodified hit rolls score critical hits.&nbsp;</li>
</ul><h3>Baharroth - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Because both of Baharroth's special abilities rely on him being attached to a unit, he's not really worth it as a solo character. Sure, he's got some heavy hitting weapons, but you can't use his&nbsp;Cloudstrider ability unless he's leading a unit. So best way to go with Baharroth is to attach him to Swooping Hawks, and then bounce around the board all game - getting into important positions, firing with the Cry of the Wind bonus, and truly keeping your opponent on their toes!</p>

<h2>Swooping Hawks</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-swooping-hawks.jpg?itok=mZNibZuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-swooping-hawks.jpg?itok=HxWCydoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Now let's look at the unit Baharroth can lead, Swooping Hawks, who get a nice new sculpt with this new release!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Swooping Hawks Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 4+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Swooping Hawks Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 14” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 4+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Swooping Hawks Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Grenade Pack Flyover:&nbsp;</strong>Once per turn, in your movement phase when this unit is set up on the battlefield or ends a normal, advance, or fall back move, it can use this ability to select one enemy unit with 8" and visible and roll one d6 for each Swooping Hawks model in this unit. On a 4+, that enemy unit suffers 1 mortal wound (max 6 mortal wounds). Can't use grenade stratagem if you've used this ability.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>As with almost all warrior units in this army, you also get an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Swooping Hawks - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Now we're getting spicy! Since that grenade pack flyover includes whenever the model's been set up, you can combo this off with Baharroth's Cloudstrider ability to pop them into position and then, on your turn, move them into range to hit your opponent with a Grenade Pack Flyover. Remember, you won't be able to do the Flyover when you set them up, since Cloudstrider says you set up at the end of your opponent's turn, but it's still a great way to throw in some extra damage each turn on your own terms.</p>

<h2>Fuegan</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fuegan.jpg?itok=Vhto0P8x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fuegan.jpg?itok=Bil6MDEt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fuegan, in his fire-red armor, can lead a group of Fire Dragons into battle!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fuegan Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Fuegan Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Burning Lance:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, you add 6" to the Range characteristic of Melta weapons equipped by models in that unit.</li>
	<li><strong>Unquenchable Resolve:&nbsp;</strong>The first time this model is destroyed, at the end of the phase roll a d6. On a 2+ you get to set him back up on the battlefield as close as possible to where he fell (as long as not within engagement range of enemy units) with his&nbsp;<em>full wounds remaining</em>.</li>
</ul><h3>Fuegan - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>While his Burning Lance ability is HUGE (6" extra added to your Fire Dragons unit is absolutely devastating), this is probably the best leader in this group to run unattached to another unit (if you have to). His ranged weapon, Searsong, has beam and lance firing options, and that Unquenchable Resolve ability makes him one of the toughest units in the entire Aeldari army! Still, if you have a Fire Dragons unit in your army, best to attach him as the leader!</p>

<h2>Fire Dragons</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fire-dragons.jpg?itok=Bo4O5gf0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-fire-dragons.jpg?itok=i5DqvjxA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Speaking of Fire Dragons, let's take a look at how they play in 10th edition, with new model sculpts for these spicy boys as well!</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fire Dragons Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Fire Dragon Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 7” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Fire Dragon Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Assured Destruction:&nbsp;</strong>In your shooting phase, each time a model in this unit attacks a Monster of Vehicle unit, you can re-roll the Hit roll, you can re-roll the Wound roll, and you can re-roll the Damage roll.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>Again, same as with the Swooping Hawks, you also get an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Fire Dragons - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>If you combo this unit with Fuegan, those melta guns are going to go from a 12" range up to a whopping 18" range - that's extremely high for a weapon as powerful as a melta weapon, AND it goes without saying, but since Melta weapons do extra damage when you're within half range of the weapon, adding this extra 6" makes that even more dangerous. Also of note, the Assured Destruction ability is a major upgrade from the last edition, which only let you&nbsp;re-roll a Wound roll of 1 and re-roll a Damage roll of 1. So get in there, get in close, and start melting your enemies!</p>

<h2>Lhykis</h2>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Lhykis Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 2+ (INV 4+) / Wounds: 5 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Lhykis Abilities At A Glance:</h3>

<p><strong>Empyric Ambush:&nbsp;</strong>While this model is leading a unit, that unit is eligible to declare a charge in a turn in which it used its flickerjump ability.<br><strong>Whispering Web:&nbsp;</strong>In your Shooting phase, after this model has shot, select one enemy unit hit by one or more of those attacks. Until end of turn, each time a friendly Aeldari model makes an attack that targets that unit, an unmodified Hit roll of 5+ scores a Crit.</p>

<h3>Lhykis - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>Lhykis is another one of these leaders who thrives when attached to his designated unit (which I'll cover right under this section), and if you shoot with him first while leading a unit, the rest of that unit will benefit from his Whispering Web ability! Important to note that he himself doesn't have the Flickerjump ability, which feels a bit odd!</p>

<h2>Warp Spiders</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-warp-spiders.jpg?itok=2CoYGSQ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40k-aeldari-warp-spiders.jpg?itok=o-W0rR-T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>We're finishing this coverage up with everyone's favorite zippy little dudes, the Warp Spiders!&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warp Spiders Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ / Wounds: 1 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1<br><strong>Warp Spiders Exarch Stats:&nbsp;</strong>Move: 12” / Toughness: 3 / Save: 3+ (INV 5+) / Wounds: 2 / Leadership 6+ / Objective Control: 1</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Warp Spiders Abilities At A Glance</h3>

<ul><li><strong>Flickerjump:&nbsp;</strong>In your Movement phase, each time this unit is chosen to make a Normal move, it can use Flickerjump. If it does, until end of turn this unit is not eligible to declare a charge and its Movement stat is 24". Each time this unit uses this ability, at the end of the phase you roll d6 for each model in the unit. For each 1, this unit suffers 1 mortal wound.</li>
	<li><strong>Aspect Shrine Token:&nbsp;</strong>Once more, with feeling! This unit has an aspect shrine token, which lets you (once per battle) change the result of one hit roll or one wound roll made by this unit to a 6.</li>
</ul><h3>Warp Spiders - How To Play Tips</h3>

<p>How you want to play this unit I think really depends on whether they've got Lhykis attached to them. If they do have Lhykis, I think the best play here is to use your Warp Spiders as super-charging Melee attackers, blasting across the battlefield and then charging their enemies in a flash! If not, you should really consider using them to get into great/interesting positions out the battlefield fast, holding positions of power, and firing down on your enemies from afar.</p>

<p>It's hard to look at this new batch of Leaders for the Aeldari and not appreciate the simple, clean, and efficient synergies at play here. I really feel like 10th edition's decision to make leaders attachable to units has widened that design space significantly. Also, almost all of these units got a physical and rules glow up. These leaders are a must if you've already got the units they lead, but if not - you may not get the full value out of them.</p>

		<p>There is going to be a Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta, with SNK confirming that it will take place in February. The exact dates and timing of the open beta have been set for between February 20th 12 AM PST to February 24, 2025 11:59 PM PST, with those taking part able to choose from eight characters and two control schemes. The beta will be available on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW ｜Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHjjlpCoBOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SNK has not announced which characters will be making the cut for the Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves open beta yet, with those details to be confirmed at a yet unknown later date. The playable modes in the beta will be an offline tutorial mode, and three online modes; Ranked Match, Room Match, Casual Match. The two control schemes have for the game have previously been confirmed as Arcade Style and Smart Style. Arcade Style is a classic multi button input scheme to pull off combos and special moves, while Smart Style uses directional inputs and single button presses to perform special moves. The beta will also give players a proper first impression of the new REV system, which combines a system of REV Arts, REV Accel, and REV Blows to fill a REV meter that will then unleash powerful offensive moves.</p>
<p>The Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves beta will not require a &nbsp;PlayStation Plus or Xbox Game Pass Core/Ultimate subscription, so anyone with an internet connection can experience it. SNK has stated that any save date from this open beta will not be transferrable to the retail release on Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves either. Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves confirmed release date is set for April 24th, 2025. It will get a physical release on PS5 and PS4, with a digital release on all confirmed platforms too. The first season pass will include five additional characters, including Street Fighter’s Ken and Chun Li.</p>

<p>You didn’t read the title wrong. A new live-action reboot of Resident Evil is being made. Let that sink in. After several disastrous attempts, it looks like the franchise will finally get a respectable movie. At least that’s what the names involved in the project indicate.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/resident-evil-reboot-zach-cregger-1236117563/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, the production of the movie will be handled by Constantin Film and PlayStation Productions. PlayStation’s involvement took many people by surprise, after all, this is a Capcom IP.</p>



<p>The project will be written and directed by Zach Cregger. Shay Hatten, who worked on John Wick 4 and Army of the Dead, is co-writer. Cregger is known for Barbarian, a great horror movie. His next film, Weapons, also a horror film, was very successful with test audiences, which explains all the hype surrounding the director.</p>



<p>At the moment, four companies are in a bidding war to secure the rights to the film. According to THR, Netflix and Warner Bros. are leading the bidding.</p>



<p>According to THR’s sources, Cregger already has a vision for the project. He plans to make a horror movie that takes the franchise back to the tone of the first games, released in the 90s. Back then, the games had a strong survival horror vibe. It was a very different approach, without action elements embedded in recent games.</p>

<p>We’ve reached the stage where everyone is already accepting, but an extra confirmation doesn’t hurt.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Danny Peña</a>/Gamertag Radio, Phil Spencer, the head of Xbox, talked about various topics and, among them, the brand’s strategy of launching its exclusives on more platforms.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-xbox-games-will-become-multiplaform">More Xbox games will become multiplaform</h2>



<p>It was during this conversation that Phil confirmed that more Xbox games will be coming to PlayStation, the rival platform. If you read our articles, you already know which games are coming to PS5 in 2025.</p>



<p>Speaking about the first-party titles, Phil said (via <a href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1882965755546788339" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@Shinobi602</a>): ”<em>We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no doubt!</em>“</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Xbox Interview with </span><a href="https://twitter.com/gamertagradio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@gamertagradio</a><span> | Phil Spencer 

On Xbox first party games:

“We love our platform and our hardware but we’re not going to put walls up where people can engage with the great games our studios are building(…)our games will show up in more places, no…</span></p></article></div>



<h2 id="h-why-buy-an-xbox">Why buy an Xbox?</h2>



<p>Listening to the Xbox CEO’s justification, the hosts asked him why gamers should buy an Xbox console since the company seems to be moving away from the concept of exclusives altogether. Phil said:</p>



<p>“<em>I want people to pick hardware based on the capabilities of that hardware and the choices that they want to make about where they want to play. We want our hardware to win based on the capabilities that we have(…)hardware critical and fundamental to what Xbox is – not trying to gatekeep the games off different places</em>“</p>



<h2 id="h-a-magical-year-in-the-making">A magical year in the making</h2>



<p>Like it or not, this is a new era for Xbox. The company’s 2025 promises to be one of the best years in Xbox history, if not the best. With Avowed, DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, The Outer Worlds 2, and perhaps Fable, the players will be very busy throughout the year.</p>



<p>At the Xbox Developer Direct held this week, we discovered that Xbox Games Publishing is responsible for publishing Ninja Gaiden 4, a game that promises to put the franchise back on top.</p>

<p>Premier Season 2 of Counter-Strike 2 has been officially <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/520829437562848128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by Valve, bringing to an end what’s felt like the longest first season of the game’s main competitive mode. When Season 2 begins, a couple new changes to the game’s rifles might shake up the meta.</p>



<p>Full details for Season 2 below.</p>



<h2 id="h-welcome-to-cs2-season-2">Welcome to CS2 Season 2</h2>



<p>With Season 1 coming to an end, active Premier players that earned a rating will “receive a commemorative Premier Season One Medal.” This medal will feature various stats from across the season, including their map distribution, rating history, overall K/D, total multi-kills, and their win/loss record.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The major changes coming to Counter-Strike 2 in Season 2 are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Train-Vertigo substitution in the map pool</a>, and changes to the M4A4 and FAMAS. The M4A4 will get a price reduction down to $2900, which matches its silenced counterpart, the M4A1-S. The FAMAS is getting buffs to its standing and crouching accuracy values, as well as a price cut, which should make it an extremely more viable option during half-buy rounds.</p>



<p>When Season 2 begins, player will need to win 10 matches in Premier in order to refresh their rating. Players will also be able to earn a Premier Season Two Medal, which will have custom colors and bars to represent peak rating and total wins. To be eligible to receive a Premier Season Two Medal, players will have to win 25 matches and have an active rating when the season ends. Season two will end after the BLAST Austin Major, which concludes on June 22.</p>



<p>The only thing missing from the CS2 Premier Season 2 announcement is a start date. Considering how long Season 1 lasted, and given that Season 2 supposedly will end in just 3 months, it has to start sooner rather than later.</p>



<hr>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
There was a brief moment back in 2021 when it seemed like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone might finally be done with his mega-popular farm-life sim - until, that is, update 1.6 was suddenly announced and rapidly took on a life of its own. And now Barone has admitted it's unlikely he'll ever 'definitively close the book' on its development, saying (probably not entirely seriously) he might still be adding things "50 years from now".
</p>
<p>
Stardew Valley was an immediate hit when it released back in 2016, selling over 400K copies in just two weeks. Nearly nine years later, that number has reached the 41m mark, and Barone, somewhat remarkably, has continued to expand the game - most recently in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">last year's 1.6 update</a>, which was originally supposed to be relatively modest in scope when it was announced in 2022, but grew increasingly ambitious as time went on.
</p>
<p>
That's despite Barone having seemingly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-doesnt-know-if-there-will-be-another-update-focused-on-next-game">drawn a line under Stardew Valley's development</a> a year earlier, when he confirmed he'd be focusing his attention on a new game - later <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-reveals-haunted-chocolatier">revealed to be Haunted Chocolatier</a>. But while Barone has now resumed development of his second title following a pause for Stardew Valley's 1.6 update, he's admitted he doesn't think he'll ever necessarily be done with his farming game.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/g-s1-44510/the-legacy-and-future-of-the-farming-game-stardew-valley">NPR</a>, Barone revealed that even though he's now been working on Stardew Valley for more than 12 years, "I don't want to definitively say that the book is ever closed, because I think I will always have a desire to come back and maybe add a thing or two. You know, maybe even 50 years from now, I might add something." 
</p><p>
That doesn't mean Barone doesn't see a natural end point for the title, however. "I think a game can have too much content," he explained. "And I ultimately want Stardew Valley to be the best game it can be. So if I feel like it's starting to become kind of overwhelmed with content to the point where it's detrimental to the game's entertainment factor, I would stop."
</p>
<p>
And for the time being, at least, it does appear Barone has taken a step back from Stardew Valley following the rather lengthy two-year development of its 1.6 update. As he revealed in December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-creator-confirms-hes-back-working-on-next-project-haunted-chocolatier">work has now resumed on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Even though Haunted Chocolatier has only been revealed publicly to a tiny degree," he said at the time, "in my own private world it's a special place, and I'm very attached to the characters, themes, and ideas." It does, however, sounds like its release is still some way off, with Baron explaining, "It's going to be a lot of work still, but it's okay, I'm addicted to the grind."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/nvidia-winding-down-support-for-older-gpus-including-the-legendary-750-ti-and-1060/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nvidia is launching the first volley of RTX 50-series GPUs based on its new Blackwell architecture, starting with the RTX 5090 and working downward from there. The company also appears to be winding down support for a few of its older GPU architectures, according to these <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/index.html">CUDA release notes</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpu-drivers/nvidia-starts-phasing-out-maxwell-pascal-and-volta-gpus-geforce-driver-support-status-unclear">Tom's Hardware</a>.</p>
<p>The release notes say that CUDA support for the Maxwell, Pascal, and Volta GPU architectures "is considered feature-complete and will be frozen in an upcoming release." While all of these architectures—which collectively cover GeForce GPUs from the old GTX 700 series all the way up through 2016's GTX 1000 series, plus a couple of Quadro and Titan workstation cards—are still currently supported by Nvidia's December Game Ready driver package, the end of new CUDA feature support suggests that these GPUs will eventually be dropped from these driver packages soon.</p>
<p>It's common for Nvidia and AMD to drop support for another batch of architectures all at once every few years; Nvidia last dropped support for older cards <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/nvidia-drops-kepler-windows-7-8-8.1-support/">in 2021</a>, and AMD dropped support for several prominent GPUs <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>. Both companies maintain a separate driver branch for some of their older cards but releases usually only happen every few months, and they focus on security updates, not on providing new features or performance optimizations for new games.</p>

As pointed out by the outlet, this latest hiring shows that Lucasfilm and Disney are committed to the project, which was announced back in 2023 alongside two other <em>Star Wars</em> movies. </p><p><em>New Jedi Orde</em>r is set to bring back Daisy Ridley as Rey, who was last seen in the role in 2019's<em> The Rise of Skywalker</em>.

However, by the time Lucasfilm officially announced it at Star Wars Celebration 2023 a new writer, <em>Peaky Blinders</em> creator Steven Knight, was working on <em>New Jedi Order</em>’s story. He dropped out in October 2024 and now Nolfi is writing the movie. </p><p>Despite all the screenwriter changes, documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is still attached to direct <em>New Jedi Order</em>. The movie was supposed to arrive in December 2026, but late last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-star-wars-ice-age-6-release-2026-1236063414/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-star-wars-ice-age-6-release-2026-1236063414/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney delayed it</a></span> and removed it from its upcoming schedule. </p><p>While <em>New Jedi Order </em>struggles to get off the ground, a different <em>Star Wars</em> film will land in theaters next year. <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, which wrapped filming in December 2024, is set to hit screens in May 2026. After that, the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie to start shooting will be Shawn Levy’s project—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got a big shot in the arm earlier this week</a></span> with rumors that Ryan Gosling is joining the cast. </p><p>So it’s very likely that <em>New Jedi Order </em>won’t be available in our galaxy until 2027 at the earliest. And that’s assuming George Nolfi can write a screenplay that Lucasfilm likes. If not, we might see a fifth writer hired to try and get this movie’s script finished and approved.

The fight animations aren’t as meticulously choreographed as they are in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603"><em>Attack on Titan</em></a></span><em> </em>or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-manga-gege-akutami-gojo-satoru-yuji-1851626832&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-manga-gege-akutami-gojo-satoru-yuji-1851626832"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a></span><em>, </em>and the animators typically hide this fact by making it seem like they’re fighting too fast for us to even properly understand the action. A lot of<em> Dragon Ball Super </em>was centered on constantly shifting power dynamics among transformations that cheapened the suspense by simply introducing a random transformation (Super Saiyan Blue Evolved? WTF?). Goku’s an idiot, Gohan is annoyingly nerfed, and Vegeta just keeps losing at everything. This is why <em>Daima</em> is shutting all of that noise up.<br></p><p>In just 15 gorgeously animated episodes, the latest series has returned the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise to its roots. Goku’s Super Saiyan transformation used to be a goosebump-inducing rarity that conveyed the legendary status of its power. It’s not until the fifth episode of <em>Daima </em>that Goku briefly goes through the golden transformation to dispatch King Kadan’s soldiers, and he’s only returned to that form a handful of times over the 10 episodes that follow. Instead, the series has prioritized hand-to-hand combat (with a little Power Pole action thrown in) to ground the fantastical feats in some form of reality. The anime also blew everyone’s minds when Vegeta unveiled his Super Saiyan 3 transformation in episode 12 to win the Dragon Ball from Tamagami Number Two. Not only did that one moment completely rewrite a major flaw in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> series (Vegeta really let Kakarot and Gotenks go SSJ3 but not him?), but it let it be known that the <em>Dragon Ball</em> canon was open to revision in <em>Daima</em>.</p><p>The fight choreography is also some of the best the franchise has seen since the masterclass duel Broly had with Goku and Vegeta in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773"><em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em></a></span> movie from 2018. Goku dodging Tamagami Number Three’s ki blasts only to land destabilizing kicks to its legs, and backflipping in midair to avoid Tamagami’s Thor-like hammer from hitting him before breaking the handle with his Power Pole in one move brought literal tears to my eyes. The fights in <em>Daima</em> feel like they have real stakes and aren’t just throwaways in order to fill time and keep people entertained with dazzling ki blasts. </p><p>The story also does a great job of expanding on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a></span> arcs we love without venturing into the polarizing <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> stories. Let the record show, <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> is wildly underrated, and the Tournament of Power is arguably the greatest story arc in the entire history of <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That being said, Super sometimes delved too deep into the gods controlling everything. The Fused Zamasu vs. Vegito Blue was too astounding for it to be resolved by the newly introduced Zeno, god of all, simply wiping the baddie from existence. <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em> starting right after the fan-favorite Buu saga and expanding upon that without negating what happened in it has been exceptionally done.</p><p>Sure, Goku’s still an idiot and not as stoic as he was when facing off against Cell or Frieza in <em>Dragon Ball Z.</em> Most of the episodes focus more on exploration than fighting. But with the introduction of compelling characters like Glorio, Dr. Arinsu, and Panzy, the trips around the newly explored Demon Worlds feel less like a chore and more like excavations into a <em>Dragon Ball</em> past that was right under our noses the entire time. We may only have one more month left of <em>Daima</em> before its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">season finale</a></span>, so I implore all of you, lovers and haters alike, to have an honest watch of this fantastic series, and then take an honest look in the mirror, because it’s time to admit <em>Daima</em> is exactly what the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise needed and deserved. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/g-o-media-is-publishing-ai-slop-again.1091538/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/quartz-ai-articles-go-media<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, several staffers at G/O Media (which previously employed all of us here at Aftermath) pointed out the proliferation of AI-generated articles on news site Quartz. Written in a style that would get a high school “introduction to writing” student a B for effort, they… I can’t even think of a good way to sum them up, the whole thing just sucks.</p><p>As of publishing, the “<a href="https://qz.com/author/quartz-intelligence-newsroom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quartz Intelligence Newsroom</a>” has written 22 articles today, running the gamut from earnings reports to Reddit communities banning Twitter posts to the Sackler settlement to, delightfully, a couple articles about how much AI sucks. Quartz has been running AI-generated articles for months, but prior to yesterday, they appear to have been limited to summaries of earnings reports rather than news articles. Boilerplate at the bottom of these articles notes that “This is the first phase of an experimental new version of reporting. While we strive for accuracy and timeliness, due to the experimental nature of this technology we cannot guarantee that we’ll always be successful in that regard.”</p><figure><figcaption>Quartz</figcaption></figure><p>The articles, to their credit, do cite where the AI is gathering its information from. But even this is surface level: the <a href="https://qz.com/elon-musk-nazi-salute-hand-gesture-reddit-x-twitter-1851746934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit </a>article, for instance, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3icyeo22i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cites </a>Yahoo and the New York Post, but the Yahoo post is actually a repub from the Daytona Beach News-Journal, and the Post article cites NBC News as its own source. I cannot imagine how this game of telephone could go wrong, especially when letting a robot write news about contentious public figures and rapidly changing events.</p><p>G/O previously experimented with AI-generated articles back in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/8/23788162/gizmodo-g-o-media-ai-generated-articles-star-wars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023</a>, most memorably producing a chronological list of <em>Star Wars</em> entries that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230706053620/https://gizmodo.com/a-chronological-list-of-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-1850592566" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t chronological</a>, and a bunch of <a href="https://defector.com/go-media-bot-blogs-may-be-unreadable-but-at-least-theyre-incorrect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">garbage</a> on The AV Club and Deadspin. None of these sites are owned by G/O anymore; Quartz is one of three sites that are still standing, as well as commerce site The Inventory. Of those remaining sites, Kotaku saw layoffs back in <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-layoffs-go-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November</a>, and The Root recently made the news when, following the death of a writer, the site’s deputy editor <a href="https://www.semafor.com/article/01/08/2025/root-writers-pressed-to-write-more-to-offset-colleagues-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asked staffers to write more to compensate</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of which makes Quartz’s use of AI just more proof–not that you need it–of how little G/O cares about the people who work there, and how little it thinks of its audience’s intelligence. (What self-respecting reader <em>wouldn’t</em> feel their knowledge of the world had been enriched after reading a <a href="https://qz.com/google-uk-fake-reviews-1851747419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line</a> like “By focusing on the elimination of fake reviews, both entities aim to bolster the integrity of the digital marketplace, thereby preserving consumer trust and ensuring fair competition among businesses.”?)&nbsp;</p><p>While I at first vainly attempted to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3lgj3cutphs2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parse</a> the logic behind this, one interpretation is that news stories have the best potential to generate traffic, which could pave the way for G/O to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lgj3jcrhk22d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tout increased traffic numbers</a> to potential buyers and show off the power of its AI technology in the process. As long as a buyer doesn’t look too closely at the actual AI-generated articles, or pay any attention to the response to them (easy to do now that G/O sites no longer have comments), they could fall for the con. </p><p>Anyone tricked into reading this slop (which I suppose now also includes me, hate-reading it), is just helping Jim Spanfeller and his cronies continue destroying a once-beloved network in the most embarrassing way possible. But hey, to quote <a href="https://qz.com/meta-stock-price-target-analysts-mark-zuckerberg-ai-1851747648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an AI article</a> that went up as I was writing this, “The strategic focus on AI by Zuckerberg is poised to potentially influence investor sentiment and may further enhance Meta’s competitive edge.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oscars-emilia-perez-on-cinema-tim-heidecker"><h3>Stop Watching The Oscars</h3></a><p>They're bad, and you don't have to.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s right, it’s Christmas for Tinseltown, the Academy Awards! Another dogshit year where the worst movie you’ve ever seen is likely to sweep the show, leaving you with your head in your hands as you overlook your cheese plate.</p><p>I stopped watching the Oscars a couple years ago. I used to make a <em>huge</em> deal out of it, inviting people over and making a spread of hors d'oeuvres. After many years of disappointments, I learned to stop giving a fuck. Now each year on Oscar night, I watch the <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em> Oscar special instead of the award ceremony. This live comedy special takes place on the same night as the Oscars every year and is the culmination of each season of <em>On Cinema, At The Cinema</em>, a comedy web show produced by and starring Tim Heidecker and Gregg Turkington. I’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/on-cinema-is-funny-because-its-about-everything-but-cin-1838970609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sung the praises of this bizarre program</a> many, many times, but the main appeal is that Heidecker and Turkington express the same level of disdain for the Hollywood establishment that I also have. Their Oscar special has the same level of respect for cinema that Academy voters have, which is to say not much at all. At least Heidecker and Turkington are funny.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Oscar Medley | On Cinema 4th Annual LIVE Oscar Special | Adult Swim" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lei2iNKSeeg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>On this week’s pod, Chris and I spent a lot of time talking about this year’s Oscar frontrunner, <em>Emilia Perez</em>. Despite looking like absolute dookie, this film has been nominated for 13 awards including Best Picture. You may know the film from a bizarre excerpt that keeps going viral where Zoe Saldana sings badly about sex change operations. Yes, that’s right—this movie is about trans people, starring a trans actress, but <a href="https://glaad.org/emilia-perez-is-not-good-trans-representation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a way that feels incredibly transphobic</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Zoe Saldaña - La Vaginoplastia (From Emilia Pérez Oscar Nominee - Best Picture)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kaChl7eJoEk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Chris and I just about lost our minds talking about this stupid fucking movie and the inevitability of it winning Best Picture. If you don’t work in media and are similarly dreading this future, just watch the On Cinema, At the Cinema Oscar Special instead. You will simply have a better time.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>,<a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<p>Activision has just revealed that DreamHack Dallas will serve as the staging ground for the Call of Duty League Major IV tournament. This grand event will unravel between May 23 – 25 at the Kay Bailey Hutchinson Convention Center in Dallas, Texas.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the team has confirmed that DH Dallas will play host to a Challengers Open. This is great news for those competing in the tier <strong>below </strong>the Call of Duty League, as the Challengers circuit has felt a little overlooked in recent months.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-major-first">Major First</h2>



<p>In a statement posted on the Call of Duty blog, Daniel Tsay, the GM of COD Esports at Activision, explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re excited to bring Major IV to DreamHack for the first time in Call of Duty League history.</p>



<p>An event at DreamHack will allow our fans to enjoy this iconic celebration of gaming and esports, and also provide new fans the experience of competitive Call of Duty live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans are excited to see the return of Challengers Opens through 2025. Presently, three have been lined up for the year ahead, with the first one taking place at Major II in Texas. The only CDL Major this year to <strong>not </strong>have any Challengers events will be the upcoming Major I, set to take place next week in Madrid.</p>



<p>Every <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us/news/2025-season-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Challengers Open event</a> will go hand-in-hand with a $100,000 prize pool, with $40,000 being reserved for the first-place team.</p>



<p>This season is one of many firsts in the CDL. Not only do we have the first EU Major in Call of Duty League history, but we now have the first CDL Major to take place at a DreamHack event.</p>



<p>If you’re not in the know, DreamHack represents one of the most well-known and prolific gaming and esports ecosystems in the world. This historic event dates back to 1994, and in the last 30 years, it has travelled the world and played host to many top-tier tournaments.</p>



<p>Last year, the Overwatch Champions Series World Finals event was held at DreamHack Stockholm.</p>

      <div><p>Steamforged Games recently launched their crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hearts-of-iron-board-game-brings-complex-ww2-grand-strategy-to-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game</a> Gamefound. The tabletop adaptation of Paradox Interactive's beloved military strategy game has completely overtaken its funding goal, reaching it 13 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The Hearts of Iron Board Game Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>As the <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/hearts-of-iron-board-game?refcode=v1JUB3G5fUmqA6iMaMS28g#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a> states, the <em>Hearts of Iron</em> board game allows players to re-enact major events during World War II. Two to five players can take on the role of the Allies or Axis powers. Players must manage resources, make political alliances, and keep their nation stable while maintaining political and military strength.</p>

<p>At the end of 2022, VALORANT’s biggest star and hottest free agent was Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker. Arguably the best player during pro VALORANT’s Chamber meta, yay converted his electric season with OpTic Gaming, which included a trophy at Masters Reykjavík, into <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/valorant/cloud9-set-to-sign-valorant-star-yay-from-optic-gaming-report-says-1943658/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a major deal with Cloud9</a> at the start of the partnership era.</p>



<p>What followed yay’s terrific tenure with OpTic was a two year odyssey of setbacks and losing. Yay was dropped from Cloud9 after two matches, with the organization citing “role issues.” Yay played seven matches with Disguised, a tier two NA VALORANT team owned by streamer Disguised Toast, losing all seven matches. He then went across the world to BLEED Esports in the VCT Pacific league, winning just one match in eight matches played.</p>



<p>Yay now finds himself on Evil Geniuses, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eg-coach-potter-says-yay-has-to-prove-hes-not-a-chamber-main/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“a place where every player ends up not by choice,” according to the team’s world champion coach Christine “potter” Chi</a>. After EG defeated FURIA at the VCT 2025 Americas Kickoff, yay’s first win in the Americas league ever, the reborn VALORANT star spoke to Insider Gaming about his new agent pool, his “back” status, and how he’s grown during his tumultuous journey.</p>



<hr>



<p>The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Astra isn’t really an agent that utilizes the Operator very much, but you couldn’t tell by watching your performance today. Do you feel like the best version of yourself is the one that has the Op in your hands?</strong></p>



<p>I would say…yes and no? That’s tough to be honest. I would say my rifle is almost equally as good as my Op. That’s one of my strengths as a player throughout my whole career: I’m able to do both very well. I feel like I can pick up anything to be honest with you.</p>



<p>The Operator is really strong on Abyss in general, and [using it with Astra] is something that potter recommended. Since I’m able to place smokes from anywhere on the map, it’s good to have it in my hands so we can let Icy entry, and then I can just hold anything.</p>



<p><strong>IG: This is the question that everyone has been asking: is yay back?</strong></p>



<p>[Laughs] I would say not yet, but I think as we continue to progress as a team and I continue to work on certain things, I will fully regrow that confidence. This was a big step; getting another win on the board.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the highest level of “back” you think you can reach? Are we talking OpTic yay?</strong></p>



<p>That was a very unique situation in which I was on Chamber for an extended period. I like to believe I [still] have a very high ceiling that extends well beyond Chamber and that whole meta, but I think I need to build more confidence with that. You won’t see the same yay, but you’ll hopefully see something similar [with] a new style. And hopefully some championships as well.</p>

<p><strong>IG: What do you want to accomplish this year?</strong></p>



<p>I would really like to make another international event, at bare minimum. And rebuild a lot of the self confidence I used to have. I think I’m pretty much there, but now it’s about proving it to myself at this point.</p>



<p><strong>IG: You’ve mentioned getting your confidence back a few times now. How badly did those two years away mess with you, personally and on the server?</strong></p>



<p>It was a pretty rough period. It’s a very hard feeling to describe to someone, because you go from the very peak [of VALORANT] to not being able to flat out win anything. It’s something that throughout my entire pro career, even extending back to other games, I’ve never experienced before in my life. To go from such high highs to low lows in such a short time frame, it takes a toll on you, and I’m not gonna pretend that it didn’t.</p>



<p>But I think I’ve done a pretty good job of figuring out and working through that, and I’m excited for the future.</p>



<p><strong>IG: Is that experience something you’re trying to learn from, or one that rather just forget about entirely?</strong></p>



<p>You take what you can from that situation. There’s some things I learned in terms of just being a better human being. Like not relying so much on the results of what’s going on around. For a long period, what defined me was VALORANT, and when results aren’t going well, you feel very bad about yourself.</p>



<p><strong>IG: What’s the most important thing you’ve learned on this big journey?</strong></p>



<p>I’ve learned how to deal with expectations. I put a lot of stock into what the community or what other people thought of me. I’ve learned to realize that what the outside world thinks of you doesn’t really reflect who you are. It’s [more] important to realize what’s important to you and what you stand for. And if I do need to fix something or change I have people I can rely on for that.</p>

                <p>Not every player can experience video games in the same way, especially if they have impairments. That's why Ubisoft is laying out the accessibility options that are included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which may open some doors for players who might otherwise feel excluded. </p><p>One of the key additions to Shadows is that the cinematics will have audio descriptions available, which will be a first for the series.

<section><p>Xbox's latest Developer Direct highlights what makes the company's showcases stand out: its developers.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Long before I was a Games Journalist™ and thus required to watch just about every video game showcase, conference, and direct for my job, I was an eager video game fan doing the exact same thing but without, you know, a professional obligation. Regardless of whether these events required me to rise well before the sun (looking at you, Nintendo), for well over a decade I've been there, buzzing with excitement and ready to preorder things I certainly did not need.</p><p dir="ltr">Chances are that if you're reading this, you too enjoy watching these events. Though you'd be correct in calling what's shown at these conferences glorified commercials, I've often thought of it as us gamers getting our own little "Super Bowl commercial celebration" every month or so, which is pretty neat if you ask me.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the years of partaking in these often-solo watch parties, I've come to associate and expect certain things from certain studios and publishers. Devolver will always offer up a somewhat convoluted but high-value production that leans into the absurd, while Wholesome Direct pairs pastels with short-and-sweet sizzle reels, giving each one of the many indie games it's highlighting a brief time to shine. Of the "big three" video game companies--PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo--Nintendo was the first, in my eyes, to really cultivate a strong, public facing identity. If it ever does away with its quirky voiceovers and charming segues, I'd be heartbroken, to say the least.</p><p dir="ltr">PlayStation, I'd then argue, was the second. When PlayStation comes to play, you know you are getting far more action than talk. Though its State of Plays <em>might </em>feature someone in a suit saying a few words between trailers, the company largely does not indulge in bells and whistles. Instead, you get trailer after trailer, with the company's narrative-heavy prize jewels getting ample screentime. I get this approach and admire it: Sometimes we really should just let the games speak for themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">And that leaves us with Xbox. In more ways than one, Xbox has struggled with an identity problem for years. Is it the catalog of first-person shooters and multiplayer titles that makes it appealing? Should we see it more as a home entertainment ecosystem? Is it the fact that the console now allows you to play in a variety of ways--including not on the actual consoles--that sets it apart? Does the company's greater emphasis on accessibility make it the best way to play? <em>Is </em>Game Pass truly the best value in gaming and a major selling point?</p><p dir="ltr">To be clear, this isn't a dig at Xbox. I think it's wondrous to be ambitious, well-rounded, and ever-changing--the current media and entertainment landscape demands it. But for a while, this led to the company not having a very clear identity. However, Xbox's latest Developer Direct got me thinking about how far the company has come and how, over the past few years, it's made great strides towards establishing a much-welcomed identity.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, Xbox has been all about one thing in particular: the developers. Some of this, of course, has manifested in ways that I don't particularly love, as both Xbox <em>and </em>PlayStation have been quick to identify and acquire seemingly any studio willing to sell. But whereas PlayStation outwardly focuses more on the games and franchises they are acquiring, Xbox feels quicker to highlight the studios and teams.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4433703"></a><figcaption>A still of Hazel from South of Midnight</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4433703-4399828-head.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-all-the-big-announcements/2900-6159/">January 2025 Developer Direct</a>, Xbox spent close to an hour highlighting just five games: Ninja Gaiden 4, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, South of Midnight, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526483/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-an-action-packed-slick-new-turn-based-rpg-revealed-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6524081/" data-ref-id="1100-6524081">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. The company provided plenty of gameplay, allowing unfamiliar but interested audience members a chance to see what they were about, and kept the time spent on each game remarkably equal, despite certain titles having more mainstream awareness. But even more compelling to me was how they gave the studios behind these games ample time to actually talk about themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who is all about dark fantasy and gothic vibes, getting to hear the team behind South of Midnight wax poetic about these topics, and express their reverence for the American Deep South's folklore, was delightful. Though Clair Obscura's turn-based combat lends itself to JRPG comparisons, it was interesting to hear that the team's decision to structure its RPG as such was born out of a deep attachment to the genre and their longing to make something that combined it with their own sensibilities and culture. And id Software--the studio behind Doom--focused on the company's legacy and how they are incorporating the series' staples, such as fast-paced action and metal music, alongside additions like new medieval-style weapons and the ability to control a mech. Lastly, as someone who, for some wild reason, has yet to play the Ninja Gaiden series, I appreciated hearing the developers explain the game's world and what pairing up with Platinum Games means for Team Ninja.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox has said time and time again that it is focused on supporting developers it acquires, not assimilating them into its own ecosystem and way of play. Unfortunately, we have seen the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">not always stick to this</a>, as it shuttered Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, Tango Gameworks, and Roundhouse Games just last year--it would frankly be disingenuous to not point this out and express my disappointment in this. However, this showcase still means a great deal to me and makes me hopeful that these closures will happen less and less going forward: that they will learn how to properly support studios and prevent what even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-reacts-to-redfalls-bad-reviews-explained-what-went-wrong/1100-6513812/">Phil Spencer noted</a> was a failure on the company's part to properly aid developers in executing their vision.</p><p dir="ltr">Another part of why this is so important to me right now is because I firmly believe we are dealing with a large-scale dehumanization crisis. I recently saw <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexaray.bsky.social/post/3lgbksuapq22k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a BlueSky post</a> that really resonated with me, that essentially said that, because games are becoming increasingly affiliated with the tech sector, they are being treated in a more capitalistic way rather than as art. It's plain to see, with one example of this being how many studios are instructed to follow certain trends--such as live-service games--rather than play to the strength of the developer.</p><p dir="ltr">Games are growing larger, more jam-packed, and more technologically impressive than ever before. But are we willing to sacrifice artistic vision and personality for that? This, alongside the push for greater AI usage in ways more ethically questionable than ever before, has me feeling that, in spite of certain game's grand scale and presentation, we are somewhat regressing. When developers are being laid off left and right, and when those who remain's voices feel silenced while others accept accolades off-screen, I can't help but be irked by the way the people who make games are all too often forgotten or dismissed.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox is by no means a perfect company. To be clear, none of these companies are. However, I do have admiration for the way it is tackling its showcases with more humanity and emphasis on developers. It is a trend I hope other studios, big and small, follow, lest we lose the innovation, humanity, and magic that makes my favorite hobby so incredibly special.</p>
