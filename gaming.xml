There’s a lot to see and do in this densely packed world. It can feel a little overwhelming at times. So, before you set off on your journey, here are four tips to get you started in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet.</em></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,197551,197550" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>1. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#scan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#scan">Buy upgrades early</a></span><br>2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#survey&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#survey">Survey often</a></span><br>3. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#research&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#research">Get to researching</a></span><br>4. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;#death&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="#death">Recover your gear after death</a></span></p><hr><h2 id="h16196"><a id="scan"></a>Buy the Scanner and Survey Tool upgrades ASAP</h2><figure id="" data-id="ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-recommend-id="image://ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-recommend-id="image://ceb48ea13746fb08a6449e09efc451d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut scans a tree." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many of the upgrades in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> are unlocked via story progress and are required to complete the game. However, there are some optional improvements you can make early on that’ll make a difference. </p><p>The Scanner and Survey Tool enhancements in the Suit tree are some the most important, as these are vital to your exploration. For the Scanner, you’ll want to grab “Intelli-Visor Upgrade” to improve the range of your Scanner. And for your Survey Tool, make sure you pick up “The ‘Fancy Nancy’ Equipment Tagger” so that using Survey will let you tag nearby Supply Crates and Orange Goo, and “Survey Range Booster” to increase the range you can do so.</p><p>Oh, and don’t pass up “Landing Impact Nullifier” in the Suit tree either, as it’ll completely eliminate fall damage. You’ll be doing a lot of exploring at high altitudes, so you’ll be thankful you don’t take damage when you take a tumble down a mountain.</p><h2 id="h16197"><a id="survey"></a>Survey, survey, survey</h2><figure id="" data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-recommend-id="image://5c99a6fd060999ae369dd56bc898b164" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explorer stands near an alien egg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of the Survey Tool, make sure you’re spamming it as you explore new areas by clicking in the right stick on the controller (or whatever key it is on PC for those of you using a typing device to control a video game). Once you have the upgrades listed above, you’ll be able to tag a lot of nearby collectibles, as well as ping any veins in the vicinity that you can destroy for materials.</p><p>A lot of collectibles are gated off during the early hours due to you not having the necessary upgrades to access them, but they’ll nonetheless get tagged when you survey. You can note which Supply Crates and Orange Goos are accessible to you at any given time on the map by checking to see if they have a small lock on the icon. So, even if you can’t get to them now, you’ll be very happy to have these locations tagged for you when you’re ready to return later.</p><h2 id="h16198"><a id="research"></a>Don’t put off challenges or research</h2><figure id="" data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-recommend-id="image://582de06d48172a721d433630f03632c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows survey information for an alien animal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll sometimes get side-quests in the form of challenges to complete. For instance, one of the earliest of these gives you a handful of tasks to perform out in the world, such as sliding a certain distance or dive bombing into water from high up. While these may seem relatively unimportant at a glance, completing them will actually unlock new blueprints at the 3D printer for some of the best weapon and movement upgrades in the game. So, ya know, don’t let these waste away in your quest log.</p><p>Meanwhile, don’t forget to research your captured creatures! Each creature you capture can be researched using the computer terminal at the habitat, and staying on top of this can earn you stuff like color schemes and upgrades. Make sure you’re checking in frequently to keep the research rolling.</p><h2 id="h16199"><a id="death"></a>Always retrieve your stuff after you die</h2><figure id="" data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic Studios Inc. / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-recommend-id="image://864389683a67f80e175e6f828fbabac6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut journeys through an alien world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, you’re probably gonna die in <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em>. So get used to it. But each time you die, you’ll drop much-needed materials which can set you back quite a bit if you don’t go back for them. When this happens, you’ll receive a quest called “I Take That Back”. Immediately set this as your tracked quest, then return to the biome in which you died.</p><p>Unfortunately, your stuff is frequently not in the exact location you died but rather somewhere in that general vicinity. This can make for a more frustrating recovery, but just play things safe and follow your compass. When you reach the location of your stuff, you’ll find a loot box you can click on to grant you everything you dropped. Whew. </p><hr><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/disney-lorcana-preview-contains-reign-of-jafar-and-fabled-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has released a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a> preview. The card game featuring iconic characters from across 100 years of Disney canon has had a strong two years of support. This preview is proof that support will continue with details on upcoming sets alongside quality-of-life changes for the competitive scene.</p>

<h2>The 2025 <em>Disney Lorcana</em> Preview</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Ravensburger made several announcements as part of a <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview. It opens by recounting the success of the game, releasing seven sets with more than 1500 unique cards for the game since its launch in 2023.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-reign-of-jafar-illumineer-box-artwork.jpg?itok=UPxIA-a_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-reign-of-jafar-illumineer-box-artwork.jpg?itok=0xwb1KP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The press release then touches upon <em>Disney Lorcana's</em> eighth upcoming set: <em>Reign of Jafar</em>. It continues the story introduced in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-disney-lorcana-archazias-island-details-revealed-by-ravensburger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Archazia's Island </em></a>set. Jafar has gotten the Hexwell Crown and has used it to shape the island to his evil will. The island is now packed with dangerous traps and tricky illusions, but a resistance group, including Jasmine and Rapunzel, is trying to steal the crown back.</p>

<p>Part of this set's release includes <em>Illumineers' Quest: Palace Heist</em>. This is a co-op experience where up to four players can hold their own against Jafar's minions. The set will pre-release May 30th with a national release June 6th.</p>

<p>The <em>Disney Lorcana</em> preview also contained new details on the next set, <em>Fabled</em>. First, the set will be the first to include two new rarities to <em>Disney Lorcana</em>: Iconic and Epic. Iconic Cards are extremely rare; only two total are in the set. Iconic cards appear more often than Enchanted rarity cards and feature unique foil treatments.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-goofy-movie-artwork.jpg?itok=Fsr3_p2R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-lorcana-preview-goofy-movie-artwork.jpg?itok=nVulA2ic 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Curiously, the artwork previewed for Disney Lorcana Fabled included Goofy, his son Max, and the musical artist Powerline from the nostalgic, critically revisited animated film: <em>A Goofy Movie</em>.</p>

<p>The launch of Fabled will mark the first time cards will be rotated out of competitive play for Disney Lorcana. The first four sets will be rotated out of the Core Constructed format. But, for those that still want to experiment, a new format, Infinity Constructed, is available. This is a natural result of the game's growing competitive scene and expanding suite of cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Fabled</em> set will release September 5, 2025.</p>

A presentation shed more light on what’s included in <em>Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505?_gl=1*vzb0v6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDgxNzYkbzE3MCRnMSR0MTc0NjU1MzU3NiRqNDMkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505?_gl=1*vzb0v6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDgxNzYkbzE3MCRnMSR0MTc0NjU1MzU3NiRqNDMkbDAkaDA.">besides last year’s excellent <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>DLC</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Famitsu</em> reports</a></span> that among the add-ons are two new classes, one called “Knight of Ides” and the other called “Heavy Armored Knight,” according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a translation by <em>RPG Site</em></a></span>.

The report notes that a Tarnished Pack DLC will be made available for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC, presumably with a price tag in the realm of $10-$20, though FromSoftware hasn’t confirmed that yet. We also don’t know if it will arrive on all platforms at the same time or have a brief staggered release window. <br></p><p>Still, I’m sure the over 30 million players who have already bought <em>Elden Ring</em> will be stoked to know there’s new stuff coming, and while it’s not an entirely new boss or other major piece of content, new classes and items should offer returning players some fun additional tools to experiment with. Somehow I don’t think the open-world RPG has hit its last major milestone. I also don’t think anyone would be put out if FromSoftware decided to keep sneaking out new content here and there, either. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

GTA 6, which is expected to be the biggest entertainment launch of all time, would certainly be an aggressive marketing move from Sony, but you can imagine it’s hoping GTA 6 sells the PS5 Pro in huge numbers in time for the May 2026 release date. Assuming we don’t see a PC release at the same time as console, PS5 Pro will be the most powerful platform for what is expected to be the best-selling game of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, fans are having fun with this PlayStation nod in the GTA 6 trailer, with some joking that it’s an early look at the PS6.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="fr" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games leak la PS6 dans le second trailer de GTA VI. 👽 <a href="https://t.co/liBCpDFJQX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/liBCpDFJQX</a></p>— PXL (@MisterPXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/MisterPXL/status/1919760323231219787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"GTA 6 playable within GTA 6 before GTA 6," joked redditor WillyPepper.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are wondering if previous GTA games will be playable within GTA 6 in a nod to Rockstar's past, perhaps as one of the many mini-games.

                <p>Bungie has revealed its plans for the next long story arc for Destiny 2. The developers have revealed a "multi-year saga" in the form of the Fate Saga. The beginning of this new chapter of Destiny's story, there will be four expansions to start us off known as the Year of Prophecy.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">Starting on July 15, 2025 with The Edge of Fate</a>, players will journey to the mysterious planetoid Kepler and find more questions than answers about the universe at large. After that on December 2, 2025, we will get the expansion Renegades. As per Bungie's new content roadmap plans, there will now be two expansions a year going forward. So now with more densely-packed expansions than what players have seen with Episodes and less waiting time, more content will be seen quickly rather than the 1-2 year gap between expansions as before.</p>

<p dir="ltr">In between each expansion there will also be what Bungie is dubbing "Major Updates," with overhauls to the sandbox, new events, modifier and challenge updates, new gear and Artifact mods, and more. On September 9, 2025, the first major update of the Season of Reclamation, titled Ash &amp; Iron, will release. Then, as part of Renegades and the Season of Lawless, the Shadow &amp; Order update will drop on March 3, 2026. The most-enticing detail here is that each major update will not cost anything, nor will it be vaulted or taken away. Major updates will be free to all Destiny 2 players, and the content they bring will always be part of the game at large. These updates will be approximately the size of the Into the Light seasonal update with lots of events and new content to find.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489333"></a><figcaption>Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4489333-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent1-8-13screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That's not all, as we already have names for the next expansions for the Year of Prophecy going into 2026 as well. Shattered Cycle will launch in Summer 2026. Finally, in Winter 2026 will be the finale of the Year of Prophecy, The Alchemist.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie have said they promise to show lots of new destinations, new gameplay features, and even some returning favorites. Included among all of the massive updates coming starting this July is a customizable difficulty for destinations, which we detail in this article <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/major-destiny-2-reveals-%E2%80%93-metroidvania-exploration-star-wars-lightsabers-new-multi-year-fate-saga.1182489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/news/2025/05/06/major-destiny-2-reveals-metroidvania-exploration-star-wars-lightsabers-new-multi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie today pushed forward an array of new details regarding Destiny 2 and what players can expect to discover in the game over the next year. The scope and range of topics touched upon was extensive, though it’s clear that many of the more comprehensive details will arrive in other formats in the coming weeks and months. Even so, there’s a lot to unpack from what was shared.</p>

<p>Much of the stream focused on The Edge of Fate, an expansion set to arrive on July 15. The Edge of Fate takes players to a new destination – a planetoid floating through the Oort Cloud at the edge of the solar system – called Kepler. Here, players navigate a Metroidvania-inspired destination of mysteries and secrets, fueled by new powers granted through dark matter. Kepler will feature multiple world tiers of challenge that unlock over time as you play. Mysteries and puzzles might be solved one way in an early tier, only to change as you acquire new abilities and power in later tiers.</p>

<p>Kepler will also bring an array of new powers. The premier ability is called Matter Spark, which allows players to use a special pad to transform into a ball of bouncing arc energy and zip about the environment, jumping, electrocuting enemies, squeezing through tight spaces, and rolling along ramps for distant leaps. It was visually reminiscent of Samus Aran’s morph ball feature from the Metroid games.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="7f5f7eb3-dd26-4f18-bbd9-b30a2707c091" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Players also gain other new abilities on Kepler, like a Relocator Cannon that allows for teleportation through the space, and Matter Morph, which allows players to use Strand energy to reshape the environment, creating bridges, revealing secrets, and opening doors.</p>

<p>The Edge of Fate storyline is the opening salvo to a new multi-year saga from the Destiny team which they’ve dubbed the Fate Saga. As The Edge of Fate gets going, players are finally going to get more details about the mysterious entities called The Nine – a group of godlike extradimensional beings that are each individually connected to one of the major bodies in the solar system (eight planets and the Sun). We’ll see returning characters like Ikora Rey play a major role, but also new characters, including a bespectacled new character named Lodi. On a broader level, the Fate Saga appears to deal with the idea that The Nine have their own motivations that have often manipulated the Guardians to a particular fate. The new storyline questions how much the Guardians are able to alter that fate, if at all.</p>

<p>As a lead-up to the new expansion, today, Bungie is launching a new prologue chapter called the Rite of the Nine. The new event includes access to three dungeons, each at three different tiers of difficulty, aiming to be inviting to all player skill levels. The Rite of the Nine includes exclusive rewards, including a new title. And it also serves to reintroduce the Emissary – a prior character from earlier storylines that we still know very little about.</p>

<p>While we learned a good bit about the expansion, we also got a peek in today’s stream into more substantial changes coming to the core game of Destiny 2. The longtime use of “The Director” as a front page to play is being overhauled. Starting with The Edge of Fate, players will be invited to “Open Portal” to jump into a streamlined menu selection of activities, dominated by different ops split into Solo, Fireteam, Pinnacle and Crucible ops.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d8e5a043-f1ec-4b99-9bc1-4b610336f853" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>The overall focus for changes is on providing increased player agency, so these different ops allow for dramatic levels of activity customization, including 50 new modifiers to tweak the gameplay. As an example, we heard about a grapple modifier that gives environment navigation a Spider-Man-like feeling. For those who want a more curated experience, there are also Quickplay selections; most activities also allow for a fireteam finder.</p>

<p>Gear is also changing, including a dramatic reinvention of equipment being dubbed Armor 3.0, which includes set bonuses for armor, and the ability to fully tweak armor perks as soon as an item is acquired. Gear tiers are another major change, which see acquired gear coming in at one of five distinct tiers of quality; players who acquire a Tier 5 weapon (which are the hardest to get) will have a special shader treatment and other features that make them unmistakable as the best in a given class.</p>

<p>We also received a scattering of other info drops about what’s on the way. Some of the most important is the soon-to-arrive new Crucible mode called Heavy Metal, which pits tanks against mech-style brigs in large-scale battles; engage with this activity and you can earn the new Griffin combat vehicle, which can be equipped into your Sparrow slot. We learned of a new permanent feature of the Tower called the Shooting Range, where players can test out their builds against a variety of enemy types. Players were also shown new holofoil treatments that will come on weapons, including a slick ocean wave effect that will be available with Solstice weapons later this summer. We also learned that the new raid will launch only days after The Edge of Fate reaches players; expect to try for that world-first title on July 19.</p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b72e8f02-4375-4a42-832d-f8a28daed823" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Of all the announcements, the most surprising was the reveal of 2025’s second expansion, which we’ll learn more about through a dedicated reveal in September. Renegades is described as a full-on in-lore Destiny expansion that moves the core story forward. But it’s also described as a direct homage to the universe of <em>Star Wars</em>, and appears (among other things) to include crossover elements between the two sci-fi/fantasy properties, including Guardians wielding lightsabers. It’s safe to say that longtime Destiny fans may have strong opinions about such a direct melding of the two popular universes. Regardless, it’s clear that Bungie has robust plans for what’s to follow, as we also learned that the Fate Saga will continue into 2026 with additional expansions titled Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more detail to discover through an in-depth viewing of the event; you can check out <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/year_of_prophecy_reveal_recap">Bungie’s full recap</a>, or watch an archive of the lengthy reveal event below.</p>

            <p>
May is here, and with it comes a fresh batch of additions to Xbox Games Pass' catalogue for Ultimate and Standard tier subscribers. It's quite a busy month too, bringing a number of day-one big-hitters including Doom: The Dark Ages and Revenge of the Savage Planet.
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages is the headline act, of course, giving the series' classic demon-slaying action a medieval twist - including the addition of a great big bonking shield - in an adventure set before events of 2016's Doom. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking pretty promising</a>. Revenge of the Savage Planet, meanwhile, is the follow up to Typhoon Studios' comedic 2020 action-adventure Journey to the Savage Planet; it retains the zany tone of its predecessor, but - as Eurogamer's Robert Purchase wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review">his three star review</a> - is perhaps "not as wild and carefree as it wants to be".
</p>
<p>
And here's everything currently confirmed for Xbox Game Pass in May:
</p>
<h3>Out today:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dredge (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>7th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Dungeons of Hinterberg (Console) – Now with Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn (Xbox Series X/S) – Now with Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>8th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
<li>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>13th May:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (Cloud and Console) – Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<h3>15th May</h3>
<ul>
<li>DOOM: The Dark Ages (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X/S) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>
<h3>16th May</h3>
<ul>

</ul>
<h3>20th May</h3>
<ul>
<li>Firefighting Simulator: The Squad (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
<li>Police Simulator: Patrol Officers (Cloud, Console, and PC) – Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard</li>
</ul>
<p>
But of course, where there's a hello, there's a goodbye, and May sees a number of Game Pass departures to go alongside the above additions.  Microsoft suggests prioritising the following if you've any interest in playing them before they vanish on 15th May - and notes they're available to purchase with up to 20 percent off:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers A Tale of Two Sons (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Chants of Sennaar (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Dune: Spice Wars (Game Preview) (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Hauntii (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Big Con (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>

<p>Phew! That’s a lot of screenshots, right?</p>
<p>A few days ago,&nbsp;Rockstar announced the release date for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gta-6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, but the game won’t be coming out in 2025. Instead GTA 6 will launch on 26th May 2026.</p>
<p>This is both good and bad news for the rest of the games industry. Many companies were looking at late 2025 with trepidation, given that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">Take Two had constantly been stating that GTA 6 was on target for this year</a>, so even big budget games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">the next Battlefield were being tentatively given a movable release window</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, that might have given developers the sense that they could easily slip back to 2026 if they needed the time, and there will suddenly be pressure to try and push for a 2025 release instead. Thankfully, with GTA 6 not coming until May 2025, there’s still a good window from late February through to early April 2026 that could still look like a good launch window for a game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/bugnie-attempt-at-dismissing-copyright-lawsuit-denied-by-court-due-bungies-inability-to-provide-vaulted-destiny-2-content-as-evidence/">Bungie</a> hosted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rh78HmxSq8c">showcase</a> for Destiny 2's next expansion, Edge of Fate, which will launch July 15, 2025. The showcase focused mostly on Edge of Fate, but also announced that the next major expansion to the game, the Star Wars-inspired Renegades, will arrive sometime in December 2025, and that there will be another two expansions coming in 2026, called Shattered Cycle and The Alchemist.</p>
<p>The showcase featured global communications lead Dyland Gafner, assistant game director Robbie Stevens, narrative director Alison Lurhs, art director Dave Samuel and Ben Wommack, the core creative director on the day-to-day experience of Destiny.</p>
<p>There was a lot discussed over the course of the panel, with some major changes coming to Destiny 2 with the Edge of Fate. A key one that players will appreciate, is that Bungie will no longer charge for seasonal content, meaning that when you buy the latest expansion for Destiny 2, you won't have to fork out more when the season kicks off in order to get every bit of narrative content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buh6WERf-zY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Edge of Fate will kick off what Bungie calls <strong>The Fate Saga</strong>, which will unfold over "<em>several years</em>" according to Bungie, with new and old characters at the core of the story like fan-favorite Ikora. It'll center around a group called The Nine, described as celestial bodies that have been around longer than the Traveller, and represented in each of the planets (minus Pluto) and the Sun. Edge of Fate will take players to the edge of the Sol galaxy, to a planetoid called Kepler, where players will find new dark matter abilities to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Bungie is also introducing what it calls a Metroidvania style of play with abilities like Matterspark, which allows you to transform into a rolling ball of electricity and resembles the ball that Samus herself rolls into when she's cutting through tight spaces.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Official Gameplay Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qlylquFX6EE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We also got to see some environmental puzzle gameplay that'll take advantage of Matterspark and Mattermorph, an ability that lets you manipulate the environment around you.</p>
<p>As a narrative prologue to the Edge of Fate in July, three dungeons called Explorer, Eternity and Ultimatum have been made available today, for free, for all Destiny 2 players to check out and get their first glimpse at the larger story that'll kick off in Edge of Fate.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Heresy | Rite of the Nine Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2iy15Z5cRg4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's clear from the showcase that Bungie is doing what it can to continue evolving Destiny 2, specifically regarding its reputation of being too obtuse and difficult to get into if you haven't already been playing for 1,000 hours. "<em>Play your way</em>" and "<em>player agency</em>" were phrases that came up consistently throughout the showcase, and are the driving force behind changes like removing paywalls to seasonal content, gear changes, and the permanent addition of a Shooting Range.</p>
<p>The Shooting Range is a new addition to the Tower, and as the name suggests, it'll be a place where players can test out their new weapons and abilities, with damage trackers and everything you might want to really test out your new loot.</p>
<p>Ending the presentation was our first look at the December 2025 expansion, Renegades, which Bungie confirmed is directly inspired by Star Wars, and will feature lightsabers. It was described as taking the space western vibe of Star Wars and putting it through a Destiny lens, which, at least by the look of the teaser trailer, feels like an apt description.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer [UK]" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6ZeDwkTsKo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pre-orders for the Edge of Fate expansion are available now for players who are keen to jump into what admittedly does look like a new beginning for Destiny, now that the Light and Dark Saga has come to an end.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>The <em><a title="Games > Destiny 2 [46 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>: The Edge of <a title="Series > Fate [66 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a></em> expansion will launch on July 15, <a title="Companies > Bungie [226 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/bungie">Bungie</a> announced. Additionally, the latest <em>Destiny 2</em> update, “Rite of the Nine,” is available today. A second expansion, inspired by <em>Star Wars</em> and titled <em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>, will launch in December. <span id="more-963278"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Release Schedule</strong></p><table><tbody></tbody><thead><!-- AD: content -->
        <tr><th>Release</th><th>Release Date</th><th>Availability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Rite of the Nine</td><td>May 6, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Core Game updates</td><td>July 15, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td>Ash &amp; Iron (major update)</td><td>September 9, 2025</td><td>Available to all</td></tr><tr><td><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em>&nbsp;(expansion)</td><td>December 2, 2025</td><td>Paid</td></tr><tr><td>Shadow &amp; Order (major update)</td><td>March 3, 2026</td><td>Available to all</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong><em>Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate</em></strong></p><p>When <em>The Edge of Fate</em> releases on July 15, players will be reintroduced to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, and face a new threat that predates everything Guardians know about Sol. Two major characters will step into the spotlight: Lodi, a new ally from a distant place, and the legendary Warlock Vanguard Ikora. <em>The Edge of Fate</em> will propel Guardians into a multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions.</p><p>The expansion will take place on Kepler, a new destination inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s dungeons and destination design, which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery.

A "Very Low" option for the game's various display settings have been added to help "improve performance" on some devices, and Bethesda has additionally added support for 32:9 and 32:10 resolutions, as well as more 16:9, 16:10, and 21: 9 resolution options.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the rest of the update, it's largely small quality-of-life tweaks or bug fixes.

		<p>Bungie have just dropped a bombshell as, following the recent Star Wars cosmetic DLC, the upcoming Renegades expansion is going to be based – somehow – on Star Wars, Check out the teaser trailer!</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: Renegades | Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/brUCTPKn6KM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Bungie logo is now animated in the same way as the Star Wars logo, there are familiar sights and sounds and if that wasn’t enough to confirm the Star Wars theme, it’s got a Lucasfilm copyright at the end. Quite how they are going to merge the to universes is unclear but this is going to be a lot more than just cosmetic DLC.</p>
<p>A full reveal of Renegades will happen on September 29th 2025, with the expansion launching in December.</p>

		<p>Update 25.03-11.20.00 has been released for PlayStation 5 consoles and along with the usual “improved system software performance and stability” there’s also something nice, namely the return of the 20th anniversary themes.</p>
<p>Here’s the full details on the update:</p>
<h3>Version:&nbsp;25.03-11.20.00</h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve added audio focus, a feature that supports broader accessibility and allows players to hear quiet in-game sounds and voice chat more clearly.
<ul>
<li>When audio focus is turned on, specific frequencies of quieter sounds are amplified, making car engines, footsteps, in-game character voices, and voice chat clearer. Multiple presets are available to enhance specific frequency ranges.</li>
<li>To use audio focus, go to&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Sound&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Volume&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Audio Focus</strong>&nbsp;and turn on&nbsp;<strong>Use Audio Focus</strong>.</li>
<li>This feature is only available when using headphones.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can now select a design inspired by your favourite PlayStation console generation and apply it to your home screen and other areas.
<ul>
<li>To apply a design, go to the home screen and select&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>System&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Appearance&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Appearance and Sound</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We’ve improved system software performance and stability.</li>

            <p>
I'm a bit of a sucker for weird genre combos. With the amount of games getting released every single day that often combine the same kinds of genres, you start to get hungry for mashups that make you go, "hang on, would that even work?" So when I saw Drop Duchy release yesterday, which mixes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tetris">Tetris</a>, land-grabbing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, deckbuilding and roguelite gameplay, I asked that exact question. Turns out the answer is yes!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Here's the lowdown on how Drop Duchy works: like in Tetris and other falling block puzzle games, you have an area where different shaped pieces fall into. You've got your usual shapes, the long one, the L one, the Z one, everyone's played Tetris, you get it. Except each shape represents a piece of land, similar to what you get in something like Civilization. Here you build paths, building upon those with cards from a deck, to slowly build up an area of control that you then have to send troops to battle on against NPCs.

<p>
Just combining the strategy, deckbuilding, and roguelite elements doesn't feel all that novel, but there's something about the Tetris nature to it that feels quite whimsical and improvisational. You've really got to think about how you're building up that space in quite a unique way. I'm not even a big strategy game player, I just love Tetris and clever ideas.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of that, there's apparently "over 100 unique missions" to make your way through, with three playable factions to choose from. They all come with their own unique quests and rewards too. Just all very neat! And it's got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525310/Drop_Duchy/">10% discount on Steam</a> for the next week or so, best hop on that now.

Bungie isn’t saying just yet. The announcement came as a “one more thing” tease at the end of its Year Of Prophecy showcase focused on what the future of its sci-fi MMO shooter looks like, and there’s no information yet on just how closely it will bleed into the actual <em>Star Wars</em> universe, though the team isn’t being shy about the inspiration.<br></p><p>A full reveal will come in September, but for now here’s the initial teaser trailer:</p><p>Bungie said the expansion, which launches before the end of 2025 pending any delays, will take players to a lawless frontier within the <em>Destiny</em> solar system that channels the sci-fi Western style of the<em> Star Wars</em> universe. Presumably there won’t be any actual fictional cross-over, even if Bungie has been known to do plenty of branded collaborations and multiverse references in the past. </p><p>Players already went hands on with their first taste of <em>Star Wars</em> in the world of <em>Destiny</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-skins-stormtrooper-empire-price-ps5-1851749688?_gl=1*cve0vj*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDY1NDU2ODEkbzc2JGcxJHQxNzQ2NTQ4ODgyJGo0OSRsMCRoMA..">a few months back</a></span> when Stormtrooper costumes and other <em>Star Wars</em>-themed cosmetics were put up for sale in the game. Despite their lore-crushing vibes, live-service games have embraced more and more crossovers in recent years, presumably because despite their grumbling, that’s the stuff players are actually willing to spend money on.</p><p>In fact, the<em> Destiny 2: Year of Prophecy Ultimate Edition</em> even comes with skins for Darth Vader and other <em>Star Wars</em> villains. Yes, there are about to be Darth Vaders running around Bungie’s planet-hopping space wizard playground like it’s<em> Star Wars: Battlefront 2</em> or something.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see how an entire expansion like <em>Renegades</em> walks that tightrope. Maybe it’ll remain a strictly <em>Destiny</em> expansion in <em>Star Wars</em> cosplay, or maybe it’s a chance for Bungie to try something completely different now that a decade of storytelling around its Light and Darkness saga is finally wrapped up following last year’s<em> Final Shape</em> climax. <em>Destiny 2</em>'s next expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em>, will arrive on July 15 and will likely give players plenty to do in the wait for <em>Renegades</em>.</p><p><em>Update 5/6/2025 3:02 p.m. ET: added info about Darth Vader skins. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyclades-legendary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While the myths of ancient Greece bubble through the substrate of many board games – take <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horrified-greek-monsters-board-game-review"><u>Horrified: Greek Monsters</u></a>, for example – there are surprisingly few that place them front and center. Narrow the frame to the way many people think about the age, one of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>conquest, bloodshed and warfare</u></a>, and there are even fewer. Which might partly explain the success of 2009s Cyclades, a clever marriage of myth, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">wargame</a> and more subtle strategic mechanisms. Now it’s back in a spanking new edition with some fun tweaks from its original expansions.</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box?">What's in the Box</h2></p><div catalogid="61832a28-9027-4b8e-8ae8-991e3325cb30" id="219281"><div id="219281" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyclades</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Aficionados of the original Cyclades might recall its big, oblong box, but this new Legendary Edition comes in a standard-sized square package that’s crammed with goodies. There’s no longer a central map board, which has been replaced by board modules that you can rearrange to make different maps of different sizes, depending on the player count. You can even flip them over for a more advanced map variant. The large board to track gods, monsters and heroes still remains. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are punch-out cardboard strips to represent the gods, while the heroes and monsters get a deck of cards each, plus cardboard standees for those that move around the map. Other punch-out tokens include various buildings and upgrades for the map, plus a horde of cardboard coins. Most of this gets tucked away neatly in a treasure-chest like box insert with a flip-up lid, a smart extra design feature to help you organize and pack away the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player gets a screen, a pile of cardboard control tokens, and a mix of wooden army and navy pieces all in their chosen color. There are six to choose from, rather than the original five, plus a seventh set of gray pieces that represent mercenaries, another new inclusion in this edition. These are nicely cut, but nothing to write home about. If you want to make your game pop even more on the table, there are plastic miniature upgrades available separately for the troops and the monsters, plus metal coins to chink satisfyingly in your hand.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays </h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-4-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Cyclades was an early example of a design trying to weave together the chaotic combat that characterized American gaming with the more refined sensibilities found in Germany. You start each round with that more genteel aspect, bidding in an auction for the favor of one of the available gods, which will determine your available actions for the rest of the turn. Some gods are face down, so that there are only as many available as the number of players, meaning someone has to take the weakest – and cheapest – god, Apollo. Each round one of the face-down gods and one of the face-up gods gets flipped, so all of them get cycled through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all the gods are created equal. The war god, Ares, allows you to recruit or move troops, for example, while wise Athena allows you to build universities and recruit philosophers, neither of which have any immediate effect but can, in time, contribute toward victory. To up the ante, the higher bid slots begin to jump in increments of two, then five, while players will still need to consider holding resources to pay for their actions, most of which also cost money. Finally there’s Apollo who, while free, does very little, allowing you merely to up the income from two of your provinces.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-2-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this means competition in the bidding can be intense, depending on the board situation, with winning or losing a particular god having a huge impact on the game state. It’s a fraught, exciting auction when there’s a lot riding on a turn, with various other considerations feeding into the bids. Sometimes it’s worth trying to outbid an opponent just to keep yourself safe from a land or sea attack. Sometimes it’s worth leaving yourself short-changed in terms of paying for actions just to corner a particular deity. It’s a dynamic phase, with plenty of interaction.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Winning or losing a particular god has a huge impact on the game state.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Winning requires you to control three metropolis pieces. You can gain these by swapping four different basic buildings, each of which is granted by a different god, or by cashing in four of Athena’s philosophers. One of the other gods, Hera, allows you to recruit heroes, powerful on-board pieces with special powers that can also be sacrificed for a metropolis. Mighty Ajax, for instance, counts as two armies and can be exchanged for a metropolis if you control seven land spaces. Which brings us neatly onto the last way to gain one: take it off another player via military conquest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal. In a contested land or sea space you tot up the units on each side together with the value of a dice roll with the loser removing a piece. Repeat until only one side remains. While the dice only goes up to three, this can still be a surprisingly swingy affair. Resources, however, keep a cap on the violence. Each player only has eight army and navy pieces and, of course, winning the bid for Ares is the main way to gain and move troops, all of which limits how many campaigns you can conduct.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-3-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In this edition, however, there are sneaky ways round these restrictions. Hera not only allows you to gain heroes but also mercenary troops, meaning you can expand on your paltry tally of eight. And all the gods allow you to make heroic moves, which essentially means you can move and fight with any army that includes a hero. This gives the game a surprising amount of maneuverability, clashing not only over valuable buildings but spaces that provide income, and makes heroes particularly valuable pieces to risk in a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also means turns that feature Hera or Ares can feel heavily weighted in terms of tilting the game state. And if everyone wants a piece of the action, that can very much be the case. Cyclades, however, is a game about taking the rough with the smooth. You can prosper without violence by taking cheaper bids on weaker gods and building up your infrastructure. But everyone around the table has to be okay with a game where your attempt to play economically can potentially be undermined by a burst of conflict. It’s all about knowing when to change tack, balancing the time to strike out with the time to shepherd resources, but having war and peace so close to one another in the same package can sometimes feel jarring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Warfare in Cyclades is short and brutal.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Either approach can really benefit from mythological creatures, which you can purchase with any god other than Apollo, but more peaceable players are more likely to be able to afford them. They’re pretty powerful and so work as an effective balance against big bids on warlike gods. Most are one-shot effects, like the Satyr who lets you steal a philosopher from another player, or the Harpy, who destroys an army. Others, however, get a piece on the board which you can keep and move from turn to turn if you’re willing to sacrifice priestesses, gained by winning the auction for Zeus. These include horrors like the kraken, who simply wipes out all fleets in whatever space it enters. Pushing these beasts around the map is enormous fun, so long as you can afford the priestesses to do so.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/cyclades-6-1746542932748.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aAbZeo?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DXQF894V" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QGgbn8?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oy8G?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Hachette</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QObKNn?object_uuid=f8d258c7-2fd1-487b-965f-8b85510654fd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Kickstarter</a></li></ul></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>May 6, 2025 4:10 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Cyclades is a rare game that succeeds in making both a peace and war viable approaches to victory. Indeed, to really prosper you’ll likely have to do both and learn when one is more appropriate for the other. This is, in turn, also its greatest fault. Wargamers may feel frustrated by its economic elements, while less aggressive gamers may find its bloodshed and trash talk unfair and unbalanced. But for those willing to stand astride both camps, this is a rare pleasure, built to cater for broader sensibilities, and this new edition is a step up in terms of both presentation and content.&nbsp;</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-is-getting-two-new-classes-with-nintendo-switch-2-tarnished-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring is headed for the Nintendo Switch 2 with its Tarnished Edition, and it looks like FromSoftware's massive adventure will have a few new bonuses in tow, including new classes and appearances for Torrent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported on by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/41423" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu</a>, an event called "FROMSOFTWARE GAMES EVENT Spring 2025" was held in Tokyo on May 6. The presentation revealed some new details about what's coming to Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, including two new character classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two classes are, as <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/news/17375-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-will-add-2-new-classes-among-others" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">translated by RPG Site</a>, the "Knight of Ides" and "Heavy Armored Knight." Not many details seem to have been revealed outside a name and a look. Those two sets will reportedly be two of the four new armors in the Tarnished Edition, with the other two available to obtain in-game. More new weapons and skills were also teased.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who care for their steed Torrent, the spirit horse is also getting three new appearances. While this content will be part of Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, which also contains the Shadow of the Erdtree content, FromSoftware has also said this content will come to other platforms via the Tarnished Pack DLC. Per RPG Site, FromSoftware said this DLC pack would be available at a low price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some new classes are an interesting addition, though it makes sense as players will largely be starting new files on Switch 2 and might want to shake things up. Getting a little bit of new content right away might be appealing to those who have already played quite a bit of Elden Ring on other platforms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring has reached a significant number of people, as <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/elden-ring-tops-30-million-sales-worldwide-news-in-brief" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden Ring has officially cleared 30 million sales worldwide</a>. It's an absolutely titanic achievement, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that number climb higher as it hits the Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No release date has been set yet for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition on the Switch 2, or for when the Tarnished Pack DLC will arrive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nintendo-switc-2">other than sometime in 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Last July, SAG-AFTRA authorized <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">a voice actors strike</a> against the major video game publishers, largely over the issue of AI protections. Nearly 300 days later, that's still the final point of contention between both sides. Now, the publishers have released what they characterize as the "best and last" offer for actors. And the actors have fired back with their counteroffer, all in the court of public opinion.</p><p>As noted by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/video-game-actors-strike-saga-aftra-final-offer-1236387081/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, the latest contract proposals between the studios and the actors have found common ground on most of the terms for a new deal. That includes 24% wage increases over the life of the contract. But the two sides' lack of agreement over generative AI continues to prolong the strike.</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game publishers, told Variety that, "We are hopeful the union will not choose to walk away when we are so close to a deal."</p><p>In response, SAG-AFTRA noted that the video game publishers presented their latest offer on April 30, and the actors responded with a counter-proposal on May 2. According to the actors, the publishers didn't respond to that before making the negotiation terms public. SAG-AFTRA subsequently released its proposal online as well.</p><p>"SAG-AFTRA condemns the video game companies' attempt to sow confusion in the community by releasing misleading rhetoric about our ongoing negotiations," said the union through a spokesperson. "The statement suggesting that the union would 'walk away' from negotiations on this contract is absurd and the opposite of the truth. It is the employers who have threatened--through backchannel representatives--to move work to foreign countries and recast performers, in an unsuccessful effort to intimidate our negotiating committee and membership to capitulate to their demands."</p><p>Voice actors from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-resident-evil-actors-discuss-ongoing-strike-and-the-issue-of-ai/1100-6529949/" data-ref-id="1100-6529949">Spider-Man, Resident Evil</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">Mass Effect</a> have previously spoken out about why the performers need protections from AI that could potentially recreate their voices without compensating the performers. Until that issue is resolved, it appears the strike will continue.</p>
