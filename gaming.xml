<p>These icons will be made available between 28th October and 4th November, and you'll need to have a Switch Online membership to redeem them. As you can see, there's Mario dressed up as a pumpkin, and the rest of the Super Mario cast is joining him with their own themed outfits.</p>

<p>As usual, these icons will set you back 10 Platinum Points each, with backgrounds and frames priced at 5 Platinum Points each. This follows on from some NSO Icons for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/marios_super_picross">Mario's Super Picross</a> earlier this month. You can see these particular icons in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/marios-super-picross-has-got-some-rather-lovely-nso-icons">our previous post</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this, Nintendo will also be celebrating Halloween in games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>. Plenty of other titles are joining in on the fun as well, with events and updates.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-ecoflow-delta-3-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-4-7-rated-portable-power-station-2000639124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-ecoflow-delta-3-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-4-7-rated-portable-power-station.1335406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages, camping trips and outdoor events all share one frustrating problem:<strong> you need electricity where there isn’t any</strong> or you can’t rely on the grid to stay up when you need it most. Portable power stations solve this by packing serious battery capacity into something you can actually move around and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/">EcoFlow’s Delta 3 just hit an all-time low of $519 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $699 price</a>. This <strong>1024Wh unit can power 13 devices simultaneously</strong>, charges from dead to full in under an hour, and uses LiFePO4 battery chemistry that’s rated for 4000 cycles over a 10-year lifespan.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5002/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic 1500W Continuous Power</h2>
<p>The Delta 3’s charging speed is what separates it from cheaper alternatives that take eight to ten hours to refill. EcoFlow engineered <strong>this unit to accept up to 1500W from a wall outlet and 500W from solar panels simultaneously</strong> which means you can throw 2000W of combined input at the battery. In practice, this gets you from zero to 100% in just 56 minutes when using both AC and solar input together. Even using just the wall charger alone, you’re looking at about 90 minutes for a full charge.</p>



<p>The battery itself uses LiFePO4 chemistry which is lithium iron phosphate, a different formulation than the lithium-ion cells in your phone or laptop. LiFePO4 cells are more stable, less prone to thermal runaway and significantly more durable over repeated charge cycles. <strong>EcoFlow rates the Delta 3 for 4000 cycles to 80% capacity</strong>&nbsp;which means you can fully charge and discharge this battery 4000 times before it degrades to 80% of its original capacity. That’s 25% more cycles than industry standard portable power stations,<strong> and it translates to roughly 10 years of daily use</strong>. The battery pack carries an IP65 rating, which indicates protection against dust ingress and water jets from any direction.</p>
<p>Capacity sits at 1024Wh. To put that in perspective, a typical laptop draws about 60W so you could run it for roughly 17 hours. A mini fridge pulling 100W would run for about 10 hours. A CPAP machine for sleep apnea averages 30-60W and would operate through multiple nights on a single charge. The <strong>1800W AC output means the Delta 3 can handle power-hungry devices like microwaves, coffee makers, power tools</strong> and space heaters. EcoFlow’s X-Boost technology pushes this even further by supporting resistive load appliances up to 2600W, though with some performance reduction.</p>



<p>The<strong> port options provide a total of 13 outlet options</strong>&nbsp;which come in various types. There are <strong>six AC outlet slots on the front of the unit</strong>&nbsp;which is more than what most of its contemporaries provide. However, this still won’t be enough if you plan on using all of your gadgets simultaneously. The <strong>USB-C port provides a total of 100W</strong> which is enough to provide a rapid charge for your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. There’s also a <strong>12V car outlet</strong> perfect for gadgets intended for use inside a vehicle. Additionally, there’s a DC5521 outlet.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it’s a record low price for the latest EcoFlow power station.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units-2000639122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-quietly-liquidates-xm4-stock-at-new-record-low-amazon-just-sold-10k-units.1335403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Noise-canceling headphones have become essential gear for commuters and travelers who need to block out the world and focus on what matters. Sony just quietly liquidated XM4 inventory on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">dropping the price to $198 from the usual $348</a>, and the timing is interesting because both the XM5 and XM6 are on the market at nearly three times this price.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing though: the technological improvements between these new generations are minimal and most users can’t tell the difference in real-world use. The XM4 delivers the same<strong> exceptional active noise cancellation, 30-hour battery life, multipoint connection, and premium sound quality</strong> that made Sony the leader in this category. Amazon has already moved over 10,000 units at this all-time low price, and it’s easy to see why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Industry-Leading Noise Cancelation</h2>
<p>The core feature that made the XM4 legendary is Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology which <strong>uses microphones on both the outside and inside of each earcup to capture ambient sound</strong>. The <em>HD Noise Canceling Processor QN1</em> analyzes this audio data over 700 times per second and generates inverse sound waves that cancel out unwanted noise. This isn’t passive isolation from thick padding, though the earcups do provide physical noise blocking too: This is active electronic cancellation that targets low-frequency rumble like airplane engines, train noise and air conditioning systems.</p>



<p>The noise cancellation levels on the Sony can <strong>now be adjusted by an additional 20 levels through an app,</strong> and gives you complete control over how much of the environment you can shut out. The ambient sound mode reverses this by letting ambient sound come in through the headphones, which can be useful if you need announcements in an airport or traffic direction if you’re on foot. Again, there are 20 levels of adjustment there. The <em>Quick Attention</em> mode can be activated by resting your hand on top of the right cup which will instantly give you ambient sound while reducing the volume of your music.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery life reaches an impressive 30 hours of non-stop use</strong> with active noise cancellation, which will take you through not one but multiple cross-country flights or an entire week of commuting. The quick charging function is a lifesaver if you remember too late that you need to plug them in before bed. Charging via USB-C will give you an additional 5 hours of use after just 10 minutes of charging. Charging from empty will take a mere 3 hours.</p>



<p>The <strong>touch controls on the right side of the headband</strong> allow all of your playback and calling controls right at your fingertips. Simply swipe up or down to change the volume, swipe forward or backward to skip tracks, tap once to play or pause playback, or tap twice to answer or hang up a phone call. The touch controls take a little getting used to if you’re accustomed to physical buttons, but after a day of using them, they become second nature. The voice assistant compatibility comes with both Alexa and Google Assistant which can be accessed by either giving it the wake-up phrase or by pressing and holding the touch panel.</p>
<p>Wear detection uses a proximity sensor on the left ear cup that <strong>automatically pauses audio playback when you take off the headphones</strong> and resumes playback when you put them on. This conserves battery life as well as ensures that you do not miss anything in your podcast or audiobook. The XM4 headphones come with multipoint technology that allows you to pair two different devices simultaneously. For instance, you can be connected to your laptop as well as your smartphone. The audio automatically switches from one device to another according to which is in use.</p>
<p>At $198, you’re paying less than many mid-tier noise-canceling headphones while getting performance that rivals anything on the market today, regardless of price.</p>

              <p>Professional blowouts at a high-end salon easily run $60 to $100 per session and if you’re getting your hair done weekly, that’s thousands of dollars annually for results that last just a few days. Dyson just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">Supersonic Origin hair dryer to $299 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $419 price</a>, and at this all-time low, you’re paying the equivalent of three to five salon visits for a tool that delivers the same professional-grade results at home for years to come.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This isn’t your average drugstore hair dryer: The Supersonic <strong>packs Dyson’s digital motor V9 that spins at 110,000 RPM</strong>, <strong>intelligent heat control</strong> that measures air temperature 40 times per second, and <strong>Air Multiplier technology</strong> that amplifies airflow by three times.</p>
<h2>Changes the Way You Dry Your Hair</h2>
<p>The key motor element of the Supersonic is Dyson’s digital motor V9: This motor is a brushless DC motor which is much smaller and more lightweight than traditional hair dryer motors. Typical conventional dryers place the motor in the foundation of the unit but Dyson relocated this motor to the handle of its unit. The motor’s speed of 110,000 RPM has more than just show value: This speed powers an impeller which draws air into its chambers. The motor pulls this air into its chambers at a rate of 13 liters of air every second.</p>



<p>The Air Multiplier technology is taken from Dyson’s bladeless fans. The function of this technology is the <strong>induction of air from the motor and then amplifying it through a carefully created hole</strong>. This amplifies the air into a <strong>three times more powerful jet of air</strong> than the motor’s capability, but this air comes from a smooth airflow. For this reason, it becomes capable of drying your hair sections quickly without releasing it all over the place.</p>



<p>The area where the Dyson Supersonic differs from more affordable models is heat control: The unit comes equipped with a glass bead thermistor sensor located in the airflow that t<strong>racks the temperature of the air up to 40 times every second</strong>. This information is then used by the microprocessor to make adjustments on the fly to ensure it does not reach unsafe levels. High temperatures damage hair by breaking down the protein bonds which makes it brittle, dry, and easy to break. The problem with most conventional dryers is that it can often reach temperatures above 300°F which is damaging enough on its own: The <strong>Supersonic keeps its top speed below 230°F</strong>.</p>
<p>Another field that Dyson ventured into is acoustic engineering: The hair dryer is a device that has always been known to generate considerable noise levels. This happens as the motor, along with airflow, produces sound waves of undesirable frequencies that tend to cause irritation in human ears. Dyson’s design of the motor ensures the <strong>generation of sound waves of frequencies higher than 16kHz&nbsp;which cannot be detected by human ears</strong>. Additionally, Dyson provided an acoustic silencer in the airflow path which serves to suppress sound waves. The outcome is a hair dryer that produces less noise than its predecessors.</p>
<p>The Dyson Origin series has only one magnetic attachment which is the styling concentrator. The styling concentrator is used for focusing airflow which enables the user to dry or style his or her hair. The magnetic attachment system is an excellent design aspect of this series: The user can easily switch from one attachment to another without waiting for it to cool down or handling it with hot hands.</p>
<p>For only $299, you will be paying the price of five salon blowouts but you will be gaining so much more than that.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-rival-baseus-100w-usb-c-charger-now-selling-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1335394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modern tech life means juggling multiple devices that all need power at different times, and there’s nothing more frustrating than watching your laptop die while your phone sits at 10% because you only have one charger between them. Baseus just solved that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">headache with their 100W USB-C charger that’s now down to $34 on Amazon, dropped from its usual $49 price tag</a>. This <strong>three-port powerhouse</strong> can charge your MacBook Pro, iPad, and iPhone simultaneously and at this all-time low price, it costs less than what Apple charges for a basic 20W charging brick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two USB-C and One USB-A Ports</h2>
<p>The two USB-C ports support the PD 3.0 protocol which is the current standard for fast charging on everything from smartphones to laptops. When you plug a single device into either the C1 or C2 port, <strong>you get the full 100W output, enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro at full speed</strong>. That means you can go from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes, which is clutch when you’re running between meetings or need to top up before a flight. The 100W capability also covers the Steam Deck, iPad Pro and any other USB-C laptop that draws significant power.</p>



<p>The intelligence comes into play when you’re charging multiple devices simultaneously. Baseus has incorporated their own smart power allocation technology, BPS 3.0, in this charging station. The technology analyzes which devices you’re connecting to each port simultaneously <strong>then allocates the power according to the device</strong>. Let’s say you’re charging your MacBook Pro on port C1, your iPhone on port C2 and your wireless headphones on the USB-A port. The charging station automatically adjusts the power allocation among all three. Your laptop receives more priority and more current, your phone gets charged as quickly as it can, which is its safe charging speed, and your headphones get exactly what they need, which doesn’t mean it gets excess current.</p>



<p>Heat management is where cheaper chargers fall apart, sometimes literally. When you’re pushing 100W through a device the size of a deck of cards, thermal control becomes critical. Baseus uses gallium nitride technology which is a newer semiconductor material that’s significantly more efficient than traditional silicon. GaN components <strong>generate less heat and allow for smaller charger designs</strong> without sacrificing power output. But Baseus didn’t stop there: They incorporated their BCT cooling system (which stands for Baseus Cooling Technology) and it actively monitors the internal temperature in real-time. Better thermal management also extends the lifespan of both the charger and your device batteries, since excessive heat degrades lithium-ion cells over time.</p>
<p>The physical design is engineered well: <strong>The prongs can be folded flat into the device</strong>. As a result, you don’t have to worry about the metal pins damaging your other electronics in a backpack or luggage. Being slightly more than two inches on each side, it doesn’t occupy much space on a power strip. Moreover, it won’t occupy space in other outlets. Otherwise, you would be forced to use a laptop charger that’s the size of a small box.</p>
<p>For only $34, you will be charged less than a single dollar per three watts of its charging abilities, supporting all the gadgets you use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price-2000639086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-laptop-with-office-365-drops-65-now-beats-even-the-cheapest-budget-laptop-on-price.1335379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking for a solid laptop that won’t drain your bank account? HP just dropped one of the most aggressive deals we’ve seen this year on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/">HP 14-inch laptop with a full year of Office 365 included is now sitting at $279, slashed from its typical $799 price tag</a>. You read that right, a 65% discount that makes this machine cheaper than most bare-bones budget laptops on the market. This configuration <strong>packs an Intel Processor N150, 4GB RAM, 256GB total storage</strong> and a full docking station with 8 ports. HP couldn’t offer such a steep reduction on their official site, so they’re quietly moving inventory through Amazon where the real laptop deals happen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5001/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Deal Actually Makes Sense For Regular People</h2>
<p>Most people don’t need a powerhouse machine that costs over a grand. You need something that boots up fast, handles your daily tasks without freezing, and doesn’t die halfway through your workday. This HP 14 checks all those boxes with surprising competence. Under the hood, y<strong>ou’ve got an Intel Processor N150 that can turbo up to 3.6 GHz</strong> when you need that extra push. That’s a <strong>quad-core chip with four threads and 6 MB of cache</strong> which translates to smooth performance when you’re juggling browser tabs, editing documents or video calling with your team. It’s not built for gaming or heavy video editing, but for work and light content creation, it handles everything without the annoying lag.</p>



<p>What’s more, you’re getting 4GB of DDR4 RAM which is honestly the bare minimum for comfortable multitasking in Windows 11, but it’s enough for most everyday scenarios like working in Office apps, streaming content, and managing emails. The storage solution is interesting because <strong>HP splits it between 128GB of internal flash storage and includes a 128GB Micro SD card</strong> in the package. This gives you 256GB total to work with, and you can keep your operating system and programs on the internal drive while using the SD card for documents.</p>
<p>The battery life is another strong point here: <strong>HP claims it lasts through a full day of work or study,</strong> and based on the specs and the efficiency of the N150 processor, that’s believable. No more hunting for outlets in coffee shops or lecture halls.</p>



<p>The connectivity is surprisingly good given it’s a laptop of this price: You get the benefits of Wi-Fi 6, which is the latest standard for quick and stable wireless networking. The port selection is genuinely impressive. There’s a USB Type-C port capable of 10Gbps transfer speeds, two USB Type-A ports for your legacy devices, HDMI 1.4b for connecting to external displays, and an SD card reader.</p>
<p>But here’s where it gets better: <strong>HP bundles an 8-in-1 docking station</strong> that expands your connectivity even further. You also get an additional USB Type-C port, an RJ-45 ethernet port for wired connections, two more USB 3.0 ports, both SD and Micro SD card slots, a headphone jack, and a 4K HDMI port. That <strong>docking station alone would cost you $30 to $50 separately</strong>, and it transforms this laptop into a legitimate workstation when you’re at your desk.</p>
<p>The laptop comes <strong>pre-loaded with Windows 11 Home S mode</strong>. Windows S mode is a stripped-down version of Windows that will not install anything from outside the Microsoft store. The good news is you can switch out of S mode for free if you need to install traditional desktop programs.</p>
<p>The best part of the <strong>whole deal is the addition of Office 365, an entire year of it</strong>. This costs a staggering amount of $69.99 annually: It provides users with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook as well as 1TB of cloud storage via OneDrive. For a student or a professional using office tools, this itself provides an amazing amount of worth to an immense portion of the purchase price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer game have surfaced online. The Bluepoint-led project, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-live-service-games-cancelled-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was shelved</a> alongside a Blur Studio game, was never confirmed, but known to be worked on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, it’s been revealed that <strong>screenshots from a in-progress build</strong> of the title have emerged online. Even more so, it confirms that the God of War project would have returned to an early time: during the original trilogy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-would-ve-returned-to-greece-screenshots-reveal">God of War Multiplayer Game Would’ve Returned to Greece, Screenshots Reveal</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mp1st has been a very reliable source of information for quite some time. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/perfect-dark-reboot-concept-art-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Dark</a> to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rare-cancelled-everwild-screenshots-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Everwild</a>, they’ve been quite accurate with their reports. Now, the outlet has <strong>found screenshots of the cancelled God of War multiplayer title</strong>.</p>



<p>Its source has provided them with a ton of screenshots, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-first-look-at-cancelled-god-of-war-multiplayer-game-unveiled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">available here</a>, and provide some interesting insight. It’s important to note that, while it may be true, take it with a grain of salt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most notable detail in the screenshot is that <strong>it would have taken place in Greece</strong>. The God of War series hasn’t been back to the setting since God of War: Ascension in 2013. Even more so, mp1st’s source told them that Hades would’ve been involved in some way. This means that the game would’ve taken place prior to his grotesque demise in God of War 3.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unfortunately, this is the only information we have at the moment. As the project wasn’t officially confirmed, details, like gameplay and such, will likely be as hard to find as Pandora’s Box. Still, it’s interesting to see what the vision Bluepoint was going for with the live-service project. The future of God of War is a bit uncertain, but, with reports of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-amazon-filming-march-2026-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon TV show</a> starting up next year and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2.5D game</a>, it won’t be long before Kratos (or his brother) picks up those blades once again.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>President of Xbox game content and studios, Matt Booty, has claimed the company's competition no longer lies with other game studios and console developers, but "everything else".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html">The New York Times</a>, primarily discussing the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">shock announcement that Xbox's longtime brand mascot, Master Chief, and exclusive first-party game, Halo, would be coming to PS5</a> in 2026, Booty said the decision came as a result of "seeking to meet people where they are", moving away from console exclusivity in a bid to reach more players.</p>

<p>"Our biggest competition isn't another console," Booty said. "We are competing more and more with everything from TikTok to movies.</p>
<p>"We are all seeking to meet people where they are."</p>
<p>It's a vastly different position to both Nintendo and Sony's PlayStation brand, both of which continue to avariciously guard their first-party exclusives, with Sony only recently experimenting with porting its console games to PC, albeit often months after their console debut.</p><p>Commenting on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">over 9000 employees laid off from the company</a> during the summer, which Microsoft told Eurogamer was "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace" at the time, Booty said: "Layoffs are difficult. They are a part of managing our business".</p>
<p>While the total number of laid off employees in gaming positions remains unknown, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">The Initiative's Perfect Dark reboot, and a new ZeniMaz MMORPG</a> were cancelled, roughly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/candy-crush-developer-king-reportedly-replacing-laid-off-staff-with-ai-tools-they-helped-to-build">200 staff from Candy Crush developer King were laid off</a> and have reportedly been replaced by the AI tools they helped to build. The team at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">Turn 10 Studios behind Forza Motorsport is also reportedly "no more"</a>, and the knock-on effect has also resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">funding being cut for Romero Games' next project</a>, though contrary to reports the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">studio has not closed</a>.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">Microsoft confirmed the Halo series is coming to PlayStation 5</a>. In a new demo debuted at the Halo World Championship, Microsoft revealed Halo: Campaign Evolved – described as "a faithful yet modernised remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a>'s campaign" – is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S next year. It marks the first time ever a Halo game will be released on a PlayStation system.</p>

            <p>Akira Yamaoka, long-time composer and sound design director for Silent Hill and a number of other games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lollipop-chainsaw">Lollipop Chainsaw</a>, is embarking on his first ever U.S. tour in February 2026.</p>
<p>Yamaoka will "bring his iconic soundtracks to life in a cinematic live performance experience" in a number of dates across the country. Internationally acclaimed singer, composer, and lyricist Raj Ramayya, who is perhaps best known for his work on Cowboy Bebop and Resident Evil, will be opening for Yamaoka each night of the tour. The pair have collaborated on a new single, Encrypted Code Reality, which is out on the suitably spooky date, 31st October.</p>

<p>Yamaoka joined Konami in 1993 and composed the music for dozens of its games, having worked on every Silent Hill game from the 1999 original up to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-shattered-memories">Silent Hill: Shattered Memories</a> in 2009. He left Konami in the same year to work for Suda51's Grasshopper Manufacture, but has since returned to compose additional music for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-composer-akira-yamaoka-to-tour-uk">The U.S. tour comes a full decade after Yamaoka toured the UK as part of a Silent Hill Live,</a> performing music from the games with a live band. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-and-live-silent-hills-strange-afterlife">You can read my thoughts on the surreal experience when I attended two of the five shows way back in 2015</a>.</p>

            <p>The creator of viral Roblox game Steal A Brainrot is suing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> doppelgänger for allegedly copying its "artwork, objects, design, and game elements".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/937410050/Brainrot-Goes-To-Court">lawsuit</a> filed in California last week and reported by <a href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court">Aftermath</a>, Steal a Brainrot developer Spyder Games is accusing Fortnite's Stealing Brainrots of infringing its copyright after securing the rights to its creation in August.</p>
<p>In its legal paperwork, Spyder claims that since its launch in May 2025, Steal a Brainrot has been played almost six billion times, had a concurrent peak of 20 million players, and is "consistently one of the top three games on Roblox by player count", whereas Stealing Brainrots, created by Thomas Van Der Voort, wasn't uploaded to Fortnite Creative until July 2025.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Brainrot Fighting</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Spyder is calling on the court "to stop defendant's unlawful conduct" and "recover the losses [it has] suffered and will continue to suffer, including any profits defendant has gained from this unlawful infringement".</p>
<p>Spyder is seeking a jury trial, actual damages, punitive damages, attorney fees, and a permanent injunction restraining the Van Der Voort from violating its rights under copyright law.</p>
<p>"The similarities are not merely the result of the games existing in the same genre or dictated by function," the lawsuit adds. "Defendant made conscious decisions to copy the creative choices and unique designs that were implemented in the game. The similarities between the game and the infringing game are not coincidental. They are the result of willful infringement by defendant in an effort to steal the market for plaintiff's game."</p>
<p>Steal The Brainrot, another Steal A Brainrot clone also available on Epic's platform, is officially licensed and therefore does not form part of this lawsuit.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">Epic will soon allow Fortnite developers to sell in-game items from their Fortnite islands</a>, allowing creators to make more money. For one year from December 2025, developers will earn 100 percent of the V-Bucks value from sales - usually this is at 50 percent.</p>
<p>The news comes as Fortnite's Creative Mode of fan-made content is proving exceptionally popular, with the Fortnite version of Roblox meme game Steal A Brainrot clocking up <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1mtklb7/oh_wow/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">more concurrent players</a> than Epic's official maps.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-minecraft-movie-launches-%E2%80%9Cfor-your-consideration%E2%80%9D-awards-campaign.1335250/</guid>

<p>A Minecraft Movie is officially launching an awards campaign for consideration for upcoming ceremonies like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. Yes, you read that right, and yes, it is official from Warner Bros. itself.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, A Minecraft Movie brought the blocky world of Minecraft to live-action and the results were rather decent. However, the real success came from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-mine-craft-movie-biggest-ever-video-game-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its large box office</a>, which came as a result of successful marketing and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-minecraft-movie-has-added-a-disclaimer-warning-viewers-not-to-throw-popcorn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet memes</a>. Now, there is now a chance we could hear “Steve’s Lava Chicken” sung on the Oscars stage or Jack Black thank ‘Chicken Jockey’ at his Golden Globes acceptance speech.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-campaigning-for-all-major-categories-including-best-picture-and-actor">A Minecraft Movie Campaigning for All Major Categories, Including Best Picture and Actor</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Warner Bros. Pictures</figcaption></figure>



<p>Warner Bros. has launched campaigns for many of its films to be considered for end-of-year awards like the Academy Awards and Golden Globes. While some films, like the smash-hits Weapons, One Battle After Another, and Sinners, are among the names, one is a bit out-there: <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Minecraft Movie</a>. It’s not out there for movies, even okay ones, to do award campaigns, as it could snag some nominations if it’s lucky. However, Warner Bros. is putting everything up for the film, including it’s main cast and director.</p>



<p>The full list of contested categories can be <a href="https://www.wbawards.com/screenings/film/?film=aminecraftmovie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">found here</a>. Notable ones include Best Picture, Jared Hess for Best Director, and Jack Black for Best Actor. Will it get any of those? Seeing how the race is, definitely not. However, personally, it does have a shot at Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Production Design, and Best Visual Effects. Depending on how some future movies do, you could even put “I Feel Alive” up there for Best Original Song. </p>



<p>While a weird campaign, it’s not surprising for Warner Bros. to do so. As mentioned before, A Minecraft Movie had a meteoric rise at the box office. In fact, it’s currently the <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">third-highest-grossing film of 2025</a> behind Lilo &amp; Stitch and Ne Zha 2. A sequel is already greenlit and in production as of earlier this month. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see if it leads anywhere and, if it does, it will be quite entertaining for sure.</p>



<p>Do you think A Minecraft Movie could get nominated for an Academy Award? Golden Globes? If so, what category? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo: Campaign Evolved and the Future of Xbox]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/halo-campaign-evolved-and-future-of-xbox</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-and-the-future-of-xbox.1335235/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For decades, <em>Halo </em>was Xbox's crown jewel. The two were intertwined to the point that you couldn't mention Xbox without also mentioning <em>Halo</em>&nbsp;and vice versa.&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>effectively gave Xbox a fighting chance in the console market after all. By the time&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>came out, it was almost impossible to imagine that Xbox would ever part with the game franchise that defined the console multiplayer FPS experience.</p>

<p>Alas, all things must change. With the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5" rel="nofollow">upcoming release of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em>&nbsp;on the PlayStation 5 in 2026</a>, Xbox will have officially ceded the exclusivity status of the&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>franchise. Although technically speaking&nbsp;<em>Halo </em>has been on PC for quite a while by now, not to mention a couple of mobile game forays.</p>

<p>In any case, this unprecedented change of events didn't come out of nowhere. Recent happenings at Microsoft, notably the firing of thousands of workers and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase" rel="nofollow">recent Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report" rel="nofollow">suggest that Xbox is simply not making enough money</a>&nbsp;for the bigwigs. Since Xbox can't magically make bestselling games appear overnight, the only remaining move left would be to publish games on every available platform.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>Master Chief, Do You Mind Telling Me What You're Doing On That Console?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=7dUh9pCa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-warthog.jpg?itok=a1obI2o5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Warthog looks great and all, but what's going on with those clouds?</figcaption></figure><p>From the outside looking in, this almost feels like an act of desperation. If Xbox leadership felt confident about the direction of the brand, there would be no reason to ever bring&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>to PlayStation. Xbox could port over every single other exclusive to PlayStation under the guise of being player friendly, but the Master Chief is to Xbox as Mario is to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, this is no eulogy for the practice of console exclusivity. At the same time, most people would've probably envisioned the end of console exclusives to be a gradual process where PlayStation and Xbox exchange games on a mutually beneficial basis. Most people would've probably never expected that Xbox would give up all of its exclusives over the span of a single console generation.</p>

<p>While it's too early to say that&nbsp;<em>Halo's&nbsp;</em>appearance on PlayStation is a death knell for Xbox's hardware endeavors, it's also hard to view this as anything other than Xbox looking for a soft exit from the console market. You don't give up your literal console-defining franchise if you don't intend to wave the white flag after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even if everything was going according to plan at Xbox, the main question that every&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan should have when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>is "Why does this exist?"&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved&nbsp;</em>was already remastered in 2011 and subsequently packaged into the <em>Master Chief Collection</em> in 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the idea was to release&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>onto PlayStation to establish an initial fanbase in preparation for a future major&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>title, surely there are other ways to approach this. If you were on PlayStation and diving into&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>with no context on why it was so popular, you end up with a third of the original trilogy's story and none of the franchise's signature multiplayer. Would that be enough to create loyal fans of a franchise that would've otherwise had literal decades of media to build upon? Xbox seems to think so.</p>

<h2><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved |&nbsp;</em>In Truth, This is a Time to Rejoice</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=baLWEFfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-ce-grunt.jpg?itok=I7ew7tvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The fiercest enemies in all of&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>, ready&nbsp;to brutalize a new generation of players</figcaption></figure><p>Frankly, this brings up the question of why <em>Halo 3 </em>wasn't&nbsp;remade instead. A hypothetical&nbsp;<em>Halo 3&nbsp;</em>remake can be sold as a standalone product, possibly even bundled with an updated&nbsp;<em>Master Chief Collection</em>. That way new players on PlayStation will have a better idea of what's going on in the story and existing fans will have an excuse to relive the original trilogy.</p>

<p>If presented alongside<em> Halo 3's </em>story<em>,&nbsp;Halo: Campaign Evolved's&nbsp;</em>new prequel missions featuring Sgt. Johnson&nbsp;would arguably have a greater emotional impact as well.&nbsp;The missions would admittedly have to be shoehorned into&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>, yet it would make sense given Sgt. Johnson's role in the game's<em>&nbsp;</em>narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The elephant in the room is that the status of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game is kind of up in the air. If a successor to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite" rel="nofollow">Halo Infinite</a>&nbsp;</em>was in a presentable state, one would assume that it would've been announced by now.&nbsp;One could conceivably announce the <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> remake, then follow it up with a short teaser of the next main&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> game to the mutual benefit of both games. Of course, if there's nothing to show then there's nothing to show.</p>

<p>Either way, the release of&nbsp;<em>Halo: Campaign Evolved&nbsp;</em>will mark the end of an era for Xbox, but at least it gives a wider audience the chance to experience one of the most influential FPSs in video game history. That alone should be cause for celebration for any&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>fan, and if <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved </em>can give the franchise a second wind, hen all the better.</p>

<p>Sure, there was far too much monetisation in the form of multiple different currencies, and the battles lacked a much-needed strategic edge, but for a mobile game you can largely play for free, it scratched an itch that kept me from ripping overpriced real-world packs and connected me with a lot of friends doing the same.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fhxywot&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>I’ve kept up playing since then, obtaining all One- to Four-Diamond cards of each of the 11 sets while also managing to pull each Immersive card. I’ve also reached the Master Ball rank in each ranked season. Yet despite being someone clearly still invested, my opinion on TCG Pocket has flip-flopped around like a Magikarp that can't decide if it wants to reach the water or perish on dry land. Every positive comes with a negative for this Coalossal gacha game.</p>
<figure data-uuid="38d82b098e613"><a title="Dragonite &amp; Babies" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/38d82b098e613/dragonite-and-babies.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Lowell Bell / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the last year, every key feature or update developer DeNA implemented to make the collecting and battling experience better has come paired with an attempt to fleece the player base for more real-world dollars.</p>
<p>A good example of this (that later got ‘fixed’) is how you trade. TCG Pocket launched without the ability to do so — despite the name of the game — and when it did debut, it came with another new currency and restrictive rules around what cards you could trade, enticing you to spend more real-world money on packs, as gacha games are wont to do.</p>
<p>Notably, you couldn’t trade cards from the current set, and you couldn’t trade Two-Star cards or above. If your favourite Pokémon is Dragonite and you <em>really</em> want that rainbow-border Dragonite EX, better break out that credit card because the Pack Points system isn’t going to get you there unless you spend a few hundred dollars, as you couldn’t trade a friend with duplicates for it.</p>
<p>After fan backlash, DeNA course-corrected from this restrictive system. They first Axewed the trade-based currency and merged it with Shinedust. And sometime soon — perhaps even as you’re reading this — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">they promise</a> you’ll get to trade Two-Star cards while also implementing the ability to gift Diamond rarity cards to friends.</p>
<p>These changes will undoubtedly make TCG Pocket much more player-friendly, yet from my anecdotal experience, this is too little too late. Many people I know dropped it because it was far too stressful to keep up with the rapid release schedule of new cards.</p>
<p>And despite improvements to trading, I’m not sure collecting is going to get much better. The most recent set — the limited-time Deluxe Pack EX — has players both happy and angry like a Morpeko. There’s no mechanically new cards in this pack; however, every pack has an EX card within. This makes it an absolutely amazing catch-up pack for players who missed key cards in past sets.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4748a5f840705"><a title="Deluxe Pack EX All Pack Mascots" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4748a5f840705/deluxe-pack-ex-all-pack-mascots.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: The Pokemon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, this set is impossible to finish without spending money before it leaves the game, until some time in the nebulous future when DeNA re-releases it. They went ahead and included 353 total cards, which is quadruple a normal pack of about 75 cards. It includes reverse holo cards along with regular reprints of common cards, making most packs full of fluff for those — like me — that have kept up with their collections.</p>
<p>Worse, the cards from this set do not retroactively clear past sets despite being the same in every other way, meaning that if you want to grab those last few EX you’re missing to complete them, this pack is essentially useless.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people I know dropped it because it was far too stressful to keep up with the rapid release schedule of new cards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While my opinion on the collection aspect of TCG Pocket has soured, I’ve come to appreciate increasing strategic depth to ranked online battles. I know many don’t agree with me here, but as someone who has regularly played online TCGs since <strong>Hearthstone</strong>’s debut, I find a lot of the matches require interesting plays and choices that keep me coming back to reach Master Ball every season. DeNA has done a great job targeting issues with the battle system, such as introducing Baby Pokémon that alleviate the disadvantage of going first if you’re running a deck with them.</p>
<p>However, not everything is perfect as we’re mired in a Suicune EX and Greninja meta at the moment. DeNA does not rebalance their cards, instead choosing to power creep their older sets, which means the last pack mascot — Suicine — is dominating the meta, appearing in about 60% of my matches. Greninja is the only non-Trainer Genetic Apex card that still sees regular play. I was done playing against the blue dog and frog about a week into the September season. Even if the matches against it are often exciting, no new cards from the Deluxe Pack EX unfortunately ensured we got another month of their <em>'rain'</em> of terror.</p>

<p>Of all the people I know still playing TCG Pocket, I’m the only one who consistently climbs the ranked ladder every season. Most people just log in to rip their daily packs, check Wonderpicks, and move on.</p>
<p>Every positive change DeNA makes to TCG Pocket either comes with or is in response to a negative, still. The Mega Evolution-themed set has three packs to open instead of one or two, making it harder to collect ‘em all. But immediate trading of that set means you can grab the meta-relevant cards or cards you want to build decks for quicker, making the climb to the Master Ball rank that much more exciting as more people will have cards to stay competitive with the Wailords among us.</p>
<p>If the upcoming trading features bring a player-friendly breath of fresh air to the game, I could see myself enjoying TCG Pocket for another year or more.</p>
<p>After a full year of updates, I wouldn’t change my review score; however, it'd be a 7/10 for different reasons. Battles are far more strategic now, but the collection aspect can oftentimes feel overwhelming, especially if you’re free-to-play.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6e5f314903a25"><a title="Pokémon TGC Pocket" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e5f314903a25/pokemon-tgc-pocket.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With additions to the trading system on the horizon, TCG Pocket <em>might</em> reach a place where it feels less like it’s a floundering Magikarp and something more like the raging Gyarados it was when it first launched. But as always with mobile gacha games, I don't have a lot of hope that potential will ever materialise.</p>

A phone call in the dark outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor, England.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three disparate scenes, all more than 5,000 miles from Sony's headquarters in Tokyo, were backdrops for a decision that helped define the PlayStation 2, Sony's landmark console that celebrates its 25th anniversary in North America today. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the best-selling console of all time for well-documented reasons: its massive library, its headstart on the Xbox, its mid-life price cut, and its affordability as a DVD player. But the deal that brought a trio of Grand Theft Auto games – GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas – to the PS2 before any other platform was also vital. They collectively make up three of its top six sellers. Some people bought the PS2 just to play GTA and if you didn't have one, you were nagging a friend who did. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chris Deering, the then-president of Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, estimates the deal boosted console sales in Europe by a fifth – a huge margin. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've heard snippets about this deal and about that key meeting at the Sunset Marquis before. But IGN has now spoken to four people at the centre of it all who can tell the story in more detail than ever. They reveal previously unknown twists and turns in negotiations: how Sony nearly missed out on exclusivity in the US, how Take Two got cash and a discount on production costs from Sony, and how Microsoft could've derailed the whole thing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-claude-1761233968809.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Theft Auto 3's silent protagonist, Claude, became one of the PS2's iconic characters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original 2D, top-down GTA games sold decently but scored middling reviews, and Deering's interest in GTA 3 was only sparked by a chance conversation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We used to have these company pub nights," he says. "It gave me a chance to deal with people I would never talk to and ask them some dumb questions." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He asked one such dumb question to the "very sharp" Sarah Thompson, who oversaw a Sony team evaluating third-party games. "I said: 'You seen anything?' She said: 'Yeah, GTA is looking really cool.' It put it at the back of my mind."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It was actually a contractor called Andy Macoy who had first flagged a GTA 3 test build as impressive. As well as being filed in Deering's brain, it sat on the team's shortlist of games that Sony might want to secure as an exclusive at E3 2000, according to the then-vice president of publisher and developer relations at SCEE, Zeno Colaço, who was Thompson's boss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering went to LA that June knowing he needed exclusives in order to win a second console generation in a row. Microsoft’s Xbox was on the horizon and Bill Gates had showed off a prototype in March.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get a billion dollars a year from Windows licenses. They can do anything they want – they just have to want," he says. "How do we get out ahead of this? That was in the back of my mind. I didn't want them to come in and take away the chance of getting two console [generations] in a row. It was almost like a personal, I don't want to say vendetta, but it could have rained on my parade. So that was a hidden motivation."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sony needed it more than we did.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and David Reeves, then head of marketing at SCEE and later Deering's replacement as president, met various publishers at a villa in the Sunset Marquis hotel. Take Two, the owner of Rockstar Games, was on the list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every person at that meeting tells a slightly different version of the story. Non-disclosure agreements obscure some of the details and the intervening 25 years have clouded memories. It's not clear what was negotiated in the room and what was handled in follow-up phone calls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we know at least six people attended. From Take Two it was Kelly Sumner, who led the company outside of the USA and would become CEO in 2001, and Gary Lewis, who was COO and later president of international. From Sony it was Deering, Reeves, Colaço, John Brunning from the legal team, and possibly also Jim Ryan, who later led Sony's gaming division. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço claims Sumner initiated the meeting "to complain that another one of Take Two's games was getting a knock back from our content group" – the same group that had earmarked GTA 3 as a winner. He thinks that game may have been State of Emergency, which Sony thought was "gratuitously violent".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Anyway, we listened to their complaints," he says. "I explained our position and thoughts of what adjustments might be an acceptable compromise." Then, "to smooth the meeting over and throw them a bone, we asked them whether we could do an exclusivity deal on GTA and another game, with the background knowledge that GTA was doing something original".</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-cat-1761234025399.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The exclusivity deals mean Stephen Bliss' character illustrations for the "3D Universe" era of GTA games feel distinctly linked to the PlayStation brand. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner rejects this version of events. "I'm not saying we were happy about the approval process" for games, he says, but any discussion of that was not linked in "any way at all" to the GTA deal. Exclusivity would never have been used as any kind of "sweetener" for Take Two, he says, because "Sony needed [it] more than we did". (It's also worth pointing out that Deering intended to bring up exclusivity at the meeting anyway, and that Lewis, from Take Two, also says he doesn't recall what Colaço describes).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In any case, the starting point of the offer, Colaço says, was "co-marketing" for GTA 3. Basically, Sony would match $1m of Take Two's marketing money. It offered the same deal for another Rockstar game, but he doesn't recall which one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were at least two other elements to the deal, although they appear to have been negotiated after that initial E3 meeting, likely back in the UK between Deering and Sumner. First, cash up front. Second, what Sumner describes as a "reduction on production costs". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In those days, production costs were really, really expensive," he explains. "Basically for the right to buy a disc and have it packaged and delivered to your warehouse, I think in around 2000 is about $11 per disc… And when you're selling millions and millions of discs, which hopefully we were, any reduction on that is very nice, thank you very much." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">He won't say how much of a discount it was, but Deering says it was "in the neighbourhood of a couple of pounds a unit, maybe $3". </p><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 3 sold 8.5 million copies on PS2 – which, at $3 a unit, would represent more than $25m in potential savings for Take Two and Rockstar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two also negotiated incentives in exchange for, among other things, Sony getting the rights to sell exclusive software bundles that would include GTA, Colaço says. And as for the cash, Sumner recalls Sony agreeing to pay a "significant amount of money" up front – back then, Take Two was not the mega multi-billion dollar company that it is today, and "any millions that were coming in were gratefully received at that stage".</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We were keen to get into bed with Sony.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither side characterises negotiations as tough. "It wasn't like the United Nations, it was more, 'Would you like another glass of wine?'" says Deering. "It wasn't intense."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's very few formal meetings with Chris [Deering]," adds Sumner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It'd be a mistake to think that this deal was <em>purely </em>about money. From speaking to all sides, it's clear that these men got on well, respected each other, and shared a common outlook on gaming's future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering wanted more "mature" games on PS2 to make the console more relevant to adults – Rockstar fit the mold. Take Two, for its part, knew the PS2's power could match Rockstar's creative ambitions. It also knew that Rockstar's games were edgy and, at times, controversial, so it needed a company that understood its vision and wouldn't meddle. Sony, which had experience managing stars like Mariah Carey, were ideal, says Take Two's Lewis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So we were keen to get into bed, so to speak, with and work alongside Sony. And interestingly enough, they felt the same," he says. "You sit down sometimes, if you're lucky to do so, with certain people in a room and you realize, okay, we're comfortable with this deal… we knew we could work with them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everyone knew what they wanted from it," says Sumner. Sony was "massively supportive… and we just absolutely believed in what they were going to deliver."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/gta3-de-1761234429773.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">GTA 3 remains culturally important to this day, and was remastered for modern consoles in 2021.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner couldn't sign the deal off alone, though: he needed his CEO and, crucially, Rockstar to agree. It felt like a "massive, massive bet" to cut off Xbox and to focus on the PS2 as a platform. "It had to be a team decision… but Sam [Houser] and the guys were like, 'Well, if we want to deliver what we really want to deliver, we can't keep on PS1. And it has to be PS2.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The deal for GTA 3 to have two years of console exclusivity with PlayStation was finalized with an evening phone call. "I was standing outside a Chinese restaurant in Windsor and doing the final negotiation," Sumner says. "The deal was done at eight or nine o'clock at night, out in the dark, in Windsor."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does it look like a fair deal looking back? In a 2013 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps2-the-insiders-story-article?page=3" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Eurogamer</a>, David Reeves described it as "remarkably cheap". Sumner chuckles at the notion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think that's in hindsight, either that or he's the best poker player in the world. He certainly squeaked a bit when we did the deal," Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were very, very happy at the time. And I think Sony were very happy as well. Yes, it was cheap from what we now know… I wish I could go back in time and renegotiate it and get a few more quid," he says, chuckling again. "[But] also, it was more beneficial for Take Two and Rockstar than we thought it was going to be. So everyone won."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering, for his part, says he does not think it was cheap, and that it was broadly in line with other exclusive deals negotiated at the time – including securing Tomb Raider as a PS1 exclusive. The concept of the deal, he says, was to "make up what they would've made by having the other versions".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that wasn't the end of the saga. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There were conversations about doing something with Xbox. But that just didn't seem right.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This deal only secured exclusivity in Europe: in the US, Sony was "not as massively supportive" of it, Sumner recalls. In fact, GTA 3 could've easily launched in October 2001 as a PS2 exclusive in Europe only. That would have, theoretically, allowed it to release on Xbox in the US far earlier than its eventual November 2003 arrival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The US "were ambivalent at first," Deering says. "I don't think they were focusing on the franchise, and hadn't had that same tip from their third party team on the rumoured power of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Then word got out around the industry that this is going to be a good game," he says. "And finally, I think at the very last minute, the US came in and joined on. 'Can we hitchhike on this deal?'" He claims they did so "reluctantly."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Colaço says it may have even been after GTA 3's initial release. Sony Computer Entertainment America "only really got on board when they saw GTA’s sales impact and the relationship we had established with Take Two flourishing," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Xbox's release approached, Sony and Take Two's partnership was tested again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has previously revealed that, in 2001, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-recalls-time-it-rejected-rockstars-pitch-to-put-gta3-on-the-original-xbox" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rejected Rockstar's pitch to put GTA 3 on the console</a>. It's not clear how an alternate version of events would've jived with Sony's exclusivity deal, but Sumner believes that, ultimately, a deal with Microsoft was "never going to happen" even if it was "ridiculously large".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There were conversations about doing something with them. But that just didn't, in my mind, my memory, didn't seem right," he says. "They weren't heavy and they weren't aggressive about it, Microsoft, but… we were happy with the bed we're lying in. And there was no reason to change and also, you know, PlayStation were doing better than Microsoft at that stage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also claims Microsoft just "didn't understand what made us tick".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony made you feel warm and in my memory, that's not what we got with Microsoft. They weren't aloof, but they just really didn't get it. I don't think they really understood the market. And they weren't certainly putting their arms around us. You do business with people you like, or you trust. And that's what we did. We just trusted [Sony], absolutely trusted them."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust, and those flourishing relationships, glued Take Two and Sony together, says Lewis. "You could ring any of the senior management there and they would answer your call and they would listen to what your concern was, whether it be getting approval for the game, whether it be production and marketing, whatever it is… I was speaking to someone from Sony probably daily."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony also helped on the development side, recalls Obbe Vermeij, who was then a technical director at Rockstar North. GTA 3 famously began development on the Dreamcast, and while he was initially sad to leave it behind, Sony made the switch easy by sending 20 PS2 dev kits, which were rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sony didn't lend Rockstar engineers but it did have what Vermeij describes as a "weird room full of electronics" at its London HQ, where third-party developers could test their games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would be able to find the bottlenecks and tell you, at a very detailed level, these instructions [to fix it]," he explains. "Sony were just super supportive whenever we asked for something, they would give it to us." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering and Sumner's relationship was particularly strong. They only have good things to say about each other, and, Sumner says, still occasionally meet for beers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have very fond memories of Chris Deering singing outside my hotel in Reykjavik at four o'clock in the morning. He was serenading the whole hotel… And he's not a bad singer, to be fair." But those trips – those "jollies" – weren't nearly as important as the support Sony provided. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They really went out there to support the company...  and I hate to say, in my opinion, unlike Nintendo, unlike Xbox, and unlike Sega," he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It felt like someone putting their arm around you and saying, actually, guys, you're part of the team. I mean, it sounds like I'm in the Sony fan club. And I'm not saying that just because it's about PlayStation 2, I actually truly believe it."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/vice-city-cast-1761234168103.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The success of the GTA 3 deal led to Vice City's 12-month PlayStation 2 exclusivity.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That trust lasted far beyond GTA 3. It's not clear when timed exclusivity discussions for GTA Vice City and San Andreas began. Deering remembers the initial agreement as a "three-game deal." Sumner says each of the games was negotiated separately. Colaço says it was when SCEA joined the GTA 3 exclusivity deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was, at the very least, a renegotiation of terms following GTA 3's release, Colaço says. "Once the game came out and was a success, much bigger than anyone expected, then to maintain the arrangement the financial numbers went up considerably." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Two, he says, made the argument that losing out on sales on other platforms was becoming more and more costly as GTA's popularity surged. He says that was "partially true", but that Take Two also enjoyed being a close partner with Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So the conversations became much more about becoming strategic partners than transactional ones." That includes, he says, discussions about exclusivity for future GTA games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we don't know the terms of the Vice City or San Andreas deals, it's safe to say they were far bigger than GTA 3's. And, as we know, the exclusivity periods shrunk with each new game. Sony secured a full year for Vice City, but just seven months for San Andreas – both down from GTA 3’s two years. As time went on, the people attending meetings "changed a little as discussions were more global and the financial numbers dwarfed the original deal," Colaço says.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sam Houser and others were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The impact of GTA 3 on wider gaming culture and on the PS2's sales was not immediate, nor guaranteed. Before release, Rockstar was worried that GTA 3 wouldn't cut through, Vermeij says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the last E3 show before [release], maybe six or eight months before the game came out, it had a really poor showing. People weren't really that interested. I remember the guys in New York, Sam Houser and others, they were all like, 'Oh my God, it's not doing well.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But of course, we did know that Sony were into it, and they promised a lot of marketing and they totally delivered on that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until six months after release that its success was obvious, he says. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Typically a game would sell well for three or four months and then it would just die out. With GTA 3, it wasn't like that. It sold okay, but then it just didn't die out. It just kept going because people told their friends and it was just picked up organically. It just kept going."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sumner and Lewis both say Take Two played into that by keeping the product "tight": if demand was one million units, they'd ship 600,000. "People were saying it was going to be banned. It was never ever going to be banned, but people believed that, and so what we did is we kept the product really, really tight, so when you saw it in Electronics Boutique, you had to buy it, because if you didn't buy it they may not be here tomorrow,” Sumner says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto was soon a phenomenon with cultural cache. Sumner, who had moved to New York, was called onto primetime TV shows to defend GTA's violence. He also recalls putting a music budget together of $600,000, only for Tommy Matola, the head of Sony Music Entertainment, to say he'd do it for free. "He said, 'I will get you the tracks, I just want to release the CD.' That was the power of Grand Theft Auto."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lewis recalls the joy of success following GTA 3's release. "You get a sigh of relief, I think is fair to say initially, and then this euphoria, because it keeps happening. We really had arrived when these products continued day in, day out, to sell… every 100,000 new PS2s we could pretty much say, 'Well, we got to sell another 10,000 GTA 3s.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's impossible to say exactly how much GTA exclusivity contributed to the PS2's success, but everyone agrees it helped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course they would have been successful [without it],"  Sumner says. "Would they have been as successful without Grand Theft Auto? Probably not, because the amount of coverage and the desirability of that product just sucked people in at a ridiculous rate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Sony delivered a great platform but it's a piece of plastic unless you have something like Grand Theft Auto on it and that was fundamental to people's understanding or awakening to the opportunities, cultural opportunities that the PlayStation could deliver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deering adds that, in Europe, "all things considered, recognising and trying to be self critical and not inflating everything, we probably did 20% more than we would've without it, at least through PS2 and 3."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not bad for what started as evening drinks at a Los Angeles hotel. "They came to the Sunset to complain," says Colaço. "They went out with $2m they weren't expecting. And we did the best exclusivity deal of all time!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Samuel Horti is a journalist with bylines at the BBC, IGN, Insider Business, and Edge. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-sony-secured-gta-as-a-ps2-exclusive]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> publisher Krafton has declared itself an "AI-first company", announcing a move to "place AI at the centre of problem solving" via a "complete" company reorganisation.</p>
<p>The megacorp outlined its "transition to an AI-first company" in a Korean-language <a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">statement</a> posted to the official website that detailed the goals of its new strategy to "prioritise AI as a central and primary means of problem-solving", "fostering change in individuals and organisations, increasing company-wide productivity, and accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth".</p>
<p>"Starting today, Krafton will automate work centered on Agentic AI and fully implement an AI-centered management system where members focus on creative activities and complex problem solving," said Krafton CEO Kim Chang-han, as translated by machine. "We will leap forward as a company that promotes the growth of members and expands the organisation's areas of challenge through AI."</p>
<p>As part of this commitment, Krafton's earmarked around $69.7 million (100 billion Korean won / £52.3 million) to invest in a GPU cluster, and support the multi-stage tasks required for "sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning". This, Krafton believes, will serve as a foundation for accelerating its AI tech, which it hopes to complete and have up and running in the second half of 2026.</p>
<p>Another $20.8 million (30 million Korean won / £15.5m) will also be invested in its workforce to train its staff to use AI tools.</p>
<p>It'll be through this new infrastructure that Krafton believes it will strengthen AI R&amp;D and in-game AI services.</p>
<p>Krafton's position is not an outlier in the industry. Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company would be "aggressive in applying AI"</a>, with developers admitting they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">"dabbled" with AI</a> for the ill-fated shooter Foamstars, Professor Layton studio <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/20231213-24326/">Level-5</a> has used AI tool Stable Diffusion, and even <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/game-development/capcom-is-experimenting-with-generative-ai-to-help-generate-the-hundreds-of-thousands-of-ideas-needed-for-game-development/">Capcom</a> has admitted experimenting with generative AI too. <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999104/20250808042/">Sega</a> also has an in-house AI team.</p>
<p>In fact, a recent survey conducted by the Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), the organiser of Tokyo Game Show, showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in their development</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>“Sharp Dressed Man,” by ZZ Top. Hard on a good day, Medium when my friends were over, Expert once and then never ever again. That was my <em>Guitar Hero</em> sweet spot. And for years, it seemed like everybody had one. The plastic guitar controllers became a staple of living rooms everywhere, and the songs — from big bands, small bands, and bands that didn’t even actually exist — became huge hits. Long before TikTok was the most important thing in music, getting your track on a <em>Guitar Hero</em> setlist could change your life forever.</p><p>For <a href="https://link.chtbl.com/versionhistory">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a><em>, </em>we go through the whole history of <em>Guitar Hero. </em>The story begins in arcades in Japan, travels to an unlikely pair of companies in the US, and nearly falls apart entirely before becoming an enormous hit. For a few years, <em>Guitar Hero </em>was as big as any game you could find, before it began to slowly fade into the background. The game may not be around anymore, but you can still find its legacy in some pretty big-name videogames.</p><p>Hosts David Pierce, Ash Parrish, and Chris Grant all lived through various parts of the <em>Guitar Hero </em>story. They gather at the <em>Version History</em> roundtable to talk about the franchise’s many precursors and influences, the E3 conference that became the franchise’s breakout hit, the eventual rise of Rock Band, and how <em>Guitar Hero </em>eventually lost most of its luster. We also bust out the axe for the first time in a long time, to see who’s still got it.</p><p>This is the fourth episode of <em>Version History. </em>(The first three were about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/792339/version-history-podcast-hoverboards">hoverboards</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/798692/how-blackberry-messenger-set-texting-free">BBM</a>, and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/802307/sony-watchman-tv-version-history">Sony Watchman</a>).

We’re already hard at work on the next bunch of episodes, and want to hear everything you think we should be doing or not doing or doing differently. We’re rewriting the eight Version History Questions as we speak, and we’d love to hear what you’d include in the list.
