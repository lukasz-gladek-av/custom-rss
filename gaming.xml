            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-version-1-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Infold Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 update, as well as the kind of content you can expect when said update lands.</p>

<p>The cozy open-world adventure's first major update will bring the Shooting Star Season with it on December 30th, and the season will run until January 23rd, introducing plenty more stuff to do and collect.</p>

<p>Infold says that the Shooting Star Season will usher in "shimmering meteors" that shoot over the skies of Miraland, bringing with them "festive decorations" that should give your surroundings an even more relaxing and chilled-out feel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=KapKM2ZH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.1-shooting-star-season.jpg?itok=JB8KMyZ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can look forward to new activities and more when&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1 drops.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the new decorations, you can also look forward to new storylines being added to the game, as well as new platforming challenges to test your prowess. Don't worry, though; they'll almost certainly be just as low-stakes as the main game.</p>

<p>Infold is also promising new "time-limited events" to enjoy in Version 1.1, and it wouldn't be an <i>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</i>update without new outfits to get excited about as well. The ones shown off in the trailer look suitably breathtaking.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the outfits and other content being introduced in Version 1.1 will also be time-limited or whether you'll be able to unlock them after the season ends on January 23rd. Since this is the game's first update, we'll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.1, which shows off a couple of the new outfits you'll get the chance to unlock in the update, right here.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, it's a cozy open-world adventure game that emphasizes platforming, exploration, and relaxation over combat.</p>

<p>The game has a storyline to pursue, but you're just as welcome to spend time with Miraland's locals, take part in some minigames, or just vibe at your own pace.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has obviously managed to strike a chord with its player base; Infold's game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-downloads-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million downloads within its first few days</a>, and while many of those players will simply have been curious, that's still a whole bunch of downloads.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nier-automata-sales-cross-9m-as-eighth-anniversary-looms.1069893/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>sales have crossed another big milestone as the game nears its eighth anniversary, publisher Square Enix has revealed.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NieR_JPN/status/1872522683411558507" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on the official Japanese X account</a> for the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise, it's revealed that the game has managed to surpass 9 million copies sold. That's counting both physical shipments and digital sales, of course.</p>

<p>The announcement post (for which we're using machine translation) is a fairly brief and impersonal one, simply thanking fans for their continued support and hoping to rely on them for more support in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=L4xfP_7e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-automata-sales-9m-engels.jpg?itok=8UjADv7X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has crossed 9 million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>The sales milestone means that&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has sold another million copies in less than a year; back in February, it was revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-achieves-8-million-copies-sold" rel="nofollow">crossed the 8 million sales threshold</a>.</p>

<p>In general, it seems like sales are pretty steady for&nbsp;<em>Automata</em>; it had hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-has-sold-over-75-million-copies" rel="nofollow">7.5 million sales in April 2023</a>, so it's trundling along at a pace that Square Enix will no doubt be pleased with, especially given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">need for reliable sellers</a> at this point.</p>

<p>So, what's driving&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>'s success? Well, it's a pretty well-liked game, to start with. Over on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/3540/nier-automata" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, 93% of critics recommend the game, and although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/nier-automata-review-robots-in-love" rel="nofollow">our very own Sam's review</a> is somewhat less effusive, he still praises its "unique, shocking, and interesting" story, as well as its final ten hours or so.</p>

<p>The game is also enjoying something of a resurgence elsewhere in gaming right now; it's had crossovers with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Stellar Blade</em></a>, fighting game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/granblue-fantasy-versus-rising-reveals-2b-from-nier-automata-dlc-on-top-of-vane-and" rel="nofollow"><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">battle royale game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naraka-bladepoint-nier-crossover" rel="nofollow">Naraka: Bladepoint</a>&nbsp;</em>in the last year or two, among others.</p>




<p>If you've somehow missed out on&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>up until now, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA04551_00-GOTYORHADIGITAL0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/NieR-Automata-BECOME-AS-GODS-Edition/BPPZVT8BZ15N" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nier-automata-the-end-of-yorha-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. It's also playable on current-gen consoles thanks to the magic of backwards compatibility.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>In 2024, we gamed like it was 1997. Games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2023/12/7/23992947/metaphor-refantazio-looks-sick"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>, and the solo-developed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> remixed genres of console generations past (or, in <em>Balatro</em>’s case, remixed the very old game of poker itself) to critical and commercial success, while Capcom was one of the most successful companies of the year supported by a healthy mix of titles across different genres. With the industry’s biggest publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">increasingly chasing massive, broadly appealing games meant to be played forever</a>, it was heartening to see old formats come back with some new tricks. And these successes could provide the blueprint needed to pull the video game industry out of its current tailspin.</p><p><em>Persona</em> developer Atlus has once again innovated on the turn-based RPG with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24268103/metaphor-refantazio-review-atlus-xbox-persona"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>. What makes <em>Metaphor</em>’s combat interesting in a way that’s hard to replicate with traditional turn-based RPGs is that Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety. Characters have access to powerful summons, each with their own abilities, along with strengths and weaknesses that enemies also share. Hitting an enemy’s weakness or having your own exploited results in monumental shifts in the momentum of battle. Every attack becomes consequential, as you don’t know what will work against your foes or what they have to work against you.</p><div><p>Atlus has built a unique ability system powered by anticipation and anxiety.</p></div><p>Despite dominating with games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the late ’80s and through the ’90s, turn-based RPGs have largely been left behind. (With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24297436/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">the notable exception of the <em>Dragon Quest </em>series</a>, which consistently sells beaucoup copies in Japan.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/23/23180709/final-fantasy-16-eikons-naoki-yoshida-interview">Modern tastes</a> have evolved to prefer the active, frenetic, and combo-dependent combat of the action RPG over the passive, implied action of turn-based games. But through the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23553499/persona-p3-p4-review-switch-ps4-xbox"><em>Persona</em> series</a>, and now with <em>Metaphor</em>, Atlus has proven it is uniquely equipped to make turn-based RPGs feel just as kinetic and engaging as their action-based cousins.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">The poker roguelike <em>Balatro</em></a> is perhaps the game that best represents the success that can be had by melding old genres with new features. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180536/shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-elden-ring-dlc">Roguelikes can be a difficult sell</a>, especially to players unfamiliar with the genre. To get them to stick, players not only have to be okay with the idea of failure as progression but also have to be invested enough in the game’s wider world to want to keep playing through it multiple times. For every <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"><em>Hades</em></a>, there are hundreds of games on digital storefronts that blur together into smears of generic fantasy dungeon crawlers.&nbsp;</p><div><p>[Balatro is] catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” </p></div><p>One of the reasons<em> Balatro</em> became an instant success was because it didn’t have that hurdle. Poker is known all over the world and hasn’t really changed much in the centuries since its invention.<em> Balatro</em> took advantage of that familiarity and combined it with great humor and an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085031/balatro-jokers-break-the-game">ingenious progression system</a> that made it catnip for the players who can’t resist “number go up.” More than that, <em>Balatro</em> feels more permissive than its roguelike cousins. The best runs in <em>Hades</em> are typically the result of lucking into specific boons or items, whereas <em>Balatro</em> is lousy with jokers, card modifiers, perks, and more that make scores get stupid fast. <em>Balatro</em> took home a slew of Game Awards, and it probably would have won Game of the Year if not for that one meddling robot.</p><p>Speaking of… perhaps the biggest example of 2024’s Return trend is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year"><em>Astro Bot</em></a>. Developed by Team Asobi, <em>Astro Bot</em> is a full-sized, standalone expansion of the PS5 pack-in game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a> that takes the little robot’s adventures beyond the confines of the PS5 console and into the wider universe. At its core, though, <em>Astro Bot is </em>a mascot platformer reminiscent of the games from PlayStation’s earliest days like <em>Crash Bandicoot </em>and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em>. Indeed, <em>Astro Bot</em> pays homage to those very characters, featuring them as robots to rescue along with other characters from PlayStation’s 30-year history.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Astro Bot </em>is stuffed with so many items and secrets to collect. That kind of mechanic can get tedious in games suited to “modern” tastes like <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, as finding things feels no better than ticking off a box in the slow march to 100 percent completion. But each of Astro’s powers — like the dog jetpack or the shrinking mouse — inject whimsy into the act of collecting.&nbsp;And when I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p><p>Mascot platformers fell out of favor, especially with PlayStation studios, despite initial success. Naughty Dog and Sucker Punch have transitioned away from the lightheartedness of Crash Bandicoot and Sly Cooper to make “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035730/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-review-ps5">serious</a>” games for “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai">mature</a>” audiences, and PlayStation’s recent catalog reflects that overall trend. <em>Astro Bot</em> is an outlier in form and tone and parlayed that uniqueness into a shower of accolades. It would be such a missed opportunity if Sony didn’t respond to that success with similar projects.</p><div><p>When I do find a secret, I’m rewarded with a little celebration of cheering bots that somehow never gets old.</p></div><p>Over the last two years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/23/24163110/embracer-laid-off-more-employees-than-riot-games-entire-workforce">prolific layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">studio closures</a> have left tens of thousands of developers unemployed, in large part because companies <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/18/23311082/embracer-group-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-hobbit-limited-run-games-tripwire">spent too much money</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">on getting bigger</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235163/concord-cancellation-live-service-games">developing huge</a>, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/02/10/skull-and-bones-is-a-70-game-because-its-quadruple-a-says-ubisoft/">expensive games</a> that may have made sense years ago but no longer do. Companies dumped hundreds of millions of dollars and considerable development resources into the next live-service shooter in hopes of replicating <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em>’s runaway success and profits. But as those games continue to top the monthly video game spending charts, refreshed by a steady cadence of new content, the idea that a newcomer like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds"><em>XDefiant</em> could compete at that same level</a> becomes increasingly remote. This leaves studios with an expensive product nobody wants to play, along with a pipeline of upcoming games too sparse to make up the difference.</p><p>But the way out of this precipitous (and avoidable) decline doesn’t necessarily mean giving up on the big multiplayer or open-world projects. Capcom, for example, has proven that “por qué no los dos” can be a winning strategy. The company has boasted record profits <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/capcom-hits-new-record-for-sales-and-profits-in-2023-2024-financials"><em>the last seven years</em></a> with a diverse catalog composed of heavy hitters like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes, and <em>Street Fighter, </em>along with smaller, weirder games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23979909/dragons-dogma-2-release-date-trailer-capcom"><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24202033/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-capcom"><em>Kunitsu-gami: Path of The Goddess</em></a>. Contrast that with Square Enix <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/square-enix-president-bemoans-weak-final-fantasy-sales-and-says-his-restructure-is-existential-our-winning-formula-is-no-longer-effective/">reporting less-than-expected profits</a> after it <a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-servers-ending-free-ps5-square-enix-concord-1851714395">failed</a><em> </em>to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/16/24040124/square-enix-foamstars-ai-art-midjourney">make<em> Foamstars</em> happen</a> on top of releasing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5">different</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24030282/final-fantasy-14-new-class-pictomancer-ffxiv-fan-fest-tokyo">AAA <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles</a> in a 12-month period. Capcom has the right idea <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e241213.html">and is doubling down on it</a>, stating that it plans on “re-activating dormant IPs that haven’t had a new title launch recently” after revealing new entries in its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320133/okami-2-announce-game-awards"><em>Okami</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody"><em>Onimusha</em></a> series.</p><p>But more than just appealing to gamer nostalgia, these success stories — which also extend to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">survival horror</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24035933/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft">Metroidvanias</a> — offer a healthier alternative to the trends the big publishers and studios are pursuing. (Nintendo, of course, is always exempt from these generalizations.) While there will always be an appetite for big online shooters or bespoke open-world games with hours of Hollywood-acted voice and motion performance, these breakout releases of 2024 prove (or should at least remind decision-makers) that there is so much worth to also be found in smaller, quirkier, and most importantly, cheaper projects. If the big publishers want to staunch the bleeding of the last two miserable years, they could take the lessons Capcom, <em>Balatro</em>, <em>Metaphor,</em> and <em>Astro Bot </em>provide.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A huge amount of&nbsp;data relating to the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>franchise has been leaked online, including developer builds for various games, unreleased content, and more, spanning the 25-plus years&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>has been around for.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, the leak was first spotted by dataminer and leaker <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visceral</a>, who also revealed that around 90GB of data had been leaked. The leak, according to Visceral, "contains some builds, tools, docs etc from various&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>titles".</p>

<p>Visceral also says that the leak happened because&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>steward 343 Industries (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games" rel="nofollow">now known as</a> Halo Studios) enlisted the help of community modders to work on restoring cut&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>content from past games in the franchise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=_rPGdmG_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=THNnMhNt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge amount of&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>data has leaked online.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak was further confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X user DogbrainLudus</a>, a modder who was part of the aforementioned project, <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/digsite-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">known as "Digsite"</a>. He says that neither he nor any other Digsite members who recently departed the project are responsible for the leak.</p>

<p>DogbrainLudus also says he doesn't care how modders use what's in the leak, although "Microsoft might not agree". I think that's probably putting it mildly.</p>

<p>The reason for the leak hasn't been disclosed, although an exchange between Visceral and <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872429533611393103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another user</a> on X <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872457396813213968" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the team wasn't being paid for its work. A <a href="https://x.com/zel_is_here_now/status/1872578699037753350" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third user then claims</a> the Digsite team told Halo Studios it wanted to be paid for the work it was doing and Halo Studios refused.</p>

<p>Of course, Halo Studios itself hasn't confirmed any of that information, so you should take it with a pinch of salt. Naturally, we're also not going to be listing any of the data that's leaked as part of this&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak; it's easy enough to find online if you look.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/27/game-of-the-year-2024-best-virtual-reality-vr-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It seems as though lots of people have jumped on the VR train this Christmas, with a Meta Quest 3 or a PSVR 2 lurking under the festive tree, ready to help you escape from the remaining leftovers and a visit from Auntie Maureen. It’s the perfect time too, as the VR scene has seen some amazing games appear in the last twelve months, with the latest hardware allowing developers to really push experiences further than ever before. At the head of the pack has been a steady flow of games from beloved series, and our game of the year manages to capture the feel of the original games in an awe-inspiring way.</p>

<p>Being Batman in VR has felt amazing before, but where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review/">Batman Arkham VR</a> let us inhabit the hero in his guise as a detective, Arkham Shadow fully translates the experience of being a master of martial arts as well. If you’ve ever played any of Rocksteady’s Arkham games, Arkham Shadow is that, but in virtual reality. You are Batman, and from the earliest moments where you catch sight of the pointy-eared shadow of his iconic headpiece, Arkham Shadow lets you embody him in a way that’s simply never been possible before.</p>


<p>The key part here is the combat, which uses the same measured and clear approach as the other Arkham games to give you the awareness to attack and counter several enemies at the same time. It works seamlessly and feels incredibly powerful, letting you flow from punch to punch, grabbing enemies and knocking-in their heads. If you’ve ever wanted to be Batman, this is it.</p>
<p>It’s helped by the fantastic visuals, which feel absolutely in keeping with the rest of the Arkham-verse. They let you feel as though you’re truly in Gotham while you explore its dank and gloomy buildings, and even with a generous eleven-hour campaign, you won’t want it to end.</p>

<h2>Metro Awakening VR – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/06/metro-awakening-vr-review/">Metro Awakening</a> grabs a hold of you right from the first minute, the prologue immersing you immediately within the dark tunnels and rooms of the post-apocalyptic Moscow Metro system, wandering through a station camp that’s packed full of small details, has NPCs chattering away, and some superb lighting and graphics.</p>
<p>Vertigo Games has done a great job of adapting the main Metro series to VR, the simple acts of needing to hurriedly pull on a gas mask, change its filters, or to flip on a head lamp adding to the feeling that you really are within this world. And then there’s all the tension and fear that you feel when trying to sneak past enemies, creeping around in the dark and craning your neck to spot where they are, and the eternal fear that you’re going to run out of ammo, given the limited resources of this world.</p>
<p>Easily one of the best VR games of this year, Metro Awakening is another example of just how far VR gaming has come.</p>
<p><em>– Tuffcub</em></p>
<h2>Vendetta Forever –&nbsp;Runner-up</h2>
<p>You know when the action movie hero is grabbing weapons as they run out of ammo to continue their ongoing killing spree? That’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/vendetta-forever-review/">Vendetta Forever</a>. In fact, you grab a gun out of the air, teleporting to its position to traverse the level and, most importantly, get out of the way of the hail of gunfire that’s on its way. It’s fast, a little frantic, and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>It’s more than that though, Vendetta Forever plays around a lot with the premise, whether recreating the lobby scene from the Matrix, Roadhousing a bunch of people in a bar, or the amazingly cool Daredevil-style levels, where you can only see sounds. It’s a creative, fast, fun, and frankly just incredibly cool at all times.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/27/24326278/nintendo-fake-takedowns-youtube-domtendo-dmca<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In late September, Dominik “Domtendo” Neumayer received a troubling email. He had just featured <em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> in a series of videos on his YouTube channel. Now, those videos were gone.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some of your videos have been removed,” YouTube explained matter-of-factly. The email said that Domtendo had now received a pair of copyright strikes. He was now just one copyright strike away from losing his 17-year-old channel and the over 1.5 million subscribers he’d built up.&nbsp;</p><p>At least, he would have been, if Domtendo hadn’t spotted something fishy about the takedown notice —&nbsp;something YouTube had missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo had been a little bit confused right from the start;<strong> </strong>the strikes didn’t make sense. Like countless other creators, Domtendo specializes in “Let’s Play” videos, a well-established genre where streamers play through the entirety of a game on camera.</p><div><p>“The next copyright strike will close your channel”</p></div><p>Nintendo has a complicated relationship with the fans who use its copyrighted works, infamously shutting down all sorts of unauthorized projects by sending cease-and-desists. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">It has gone after YouTubers</a>, too. But both the Japanese gaming giant and the broader gaming industry typically leave Let’s Plays alone, because they serve as free marketing for their games.</p><p>And yet, YouTube had received a legit-looking request apparently justifying these takedowns under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), signed “Tatsumi Masaaki, Nintendo Legal Department, Nintendo of America.”</p><p>It was in a second email from YouTube that Domtendo spotted something off. The takedown requests came from a <em>personal</em> account at an encrypted email service: “tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com”.</p><div><figcaption><em>YouTube took action on Domtendo’s videos, even though the requests cited a personal email address.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Domtendo</cite></p></div><p>Fake takedowns are real. <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/youtube-copyright/summary?hl=en">YouTube says</a> over six percent of takedown requests through its public webform are likely fake, and the company accepts requests via plain email too, meaning anyone can file them. Fighting fake takedowns can cost creators time, money, and stress. But creators can’t easily be sure that a takedown is fake — and they can lose their entire channel if they get it wrong and clash with a company that has a legitimate copyright claim.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">When the well-respected Retro Game Corps</a> received his second Nintendo copyright strike, he publicly declared he would self-censor all his future work to hopefully escape the company’s wrath. But first, he checked that Nintendo’s threat was real. He checked to see who YouTube listed as the complaining party, and that it came from a Nintendo email address. Then he checked with his YouTube Partner Manager to be extra safe.</p><div><p>Rumors of fake Nintendo takedowns have swirled in the past. Earlier this year, <em>Garry’s Mod </em>developer Garry Newman removed<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24140246/garrys-mod-nintendo-copyright-takedowns-dmca"> 20 years’ worth of Nintendo-related fan content from his sandbox video game</a> over takedown threats. Fans speculated that it may actually have been someone posing as a Nintendo lawyer. But Newman eventually revealed <a href="https://garry.net/posts/aaron-peters">Nintendo was legitimately behind those takedowns</a> despite using seemingly suspicious names and emails.</p></div><p>Domtendo thought he might have an actual case of a Nintendo faker. So he decided to push back. At first, it seemed to work. He emailed YouTube, and it soon reinstated his videos. But Tatsumi was back the next day —&nbsp;this time, emailing Domtendo directly.&nbsp;</p><p>“Dear Domtendo, I represent Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) in intellectual property matters,” the first email began. After a bunch of legalese, Tatsumi eventually explains why he’s reaching out: “I submitted a notice through YouTube’s legal copyright system, but the infringing content still appears.”</p><p>He wouldn’t let it go.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo wasn’t about to risk his livelihood just in case Tatsumi was real. He got spooked, and began voluntarily pulling his videos off YouTube. But his new pen pal just kept asking for more removals. Tatsumi reached out day after day, sometimes multiple times a day, according to emails shared with <em>The Verge</em>. The threats got weirder, too:</p><p><strong>October 3rd:</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>I ask for your expeditious removal of all infringing material that use Nintendo Switch game emulators by 6th October 2024. Please note that the amount of videos infringing Nintendo’s copyrights is too high to be able to list them all in this e-mail and we hope that you will conscientiously remove all infringing videos before the next week.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 8th:&nbsp;</strong></p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo hereby prohibits you from any future use of its intellectual and copyrighted property. Existing content may remain as long as there is no request to remove it. Nintendo of America Inc. would like to avoid further legal action and therefore hopes that their intellectual property will no longer be used by you. This cease-and-desist declaration is valid immediately and has been approved by President of Nintendo of America Doug Spencer Bowser.</p></blockquote></div><p><strong>October 12th:</strong>&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p>Nintendo of America Inc. (“Nintendo”) will no longer tolerate this behavior and is now on the verge of filing a lawsuit. Note that we work closely with our subsidiary Nintendo of Europe, located in Germany and therefore already have your address from the time you have been Nintendo Partner and/or will receive your new address from the residents’ registration office.”</p></blockquote></div><p>Domtendo began reaching out to friends and fellow content creators, and discovered he wasn’t alone. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Waikuteru">Waikuteru</a>, a streamer who develops Zelda mods, had been targeted by Tatsumi as well. Only that time, the takedown notices were filed in Japanese, and YouTube claimed they’d come from a seemingly real email address: <a href="mailto:anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp">anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp</a>. Whoever submitted those notices claimed to be a “Group Sub-Manager” in Nintendo’s “Intellectual Property Department.”&nbsp;</p><p>Could Tatsumi be legit? Was Domtendo staring down a real threat?&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Verge</em> could find no public record of a Tatsumi Masaaki working for Nintendo of America or Nintendo’s legal team, period. Nintendo did not respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s repeated requests to fact-check whether such a lawyer even exists.&nbsp;</p><p>But there <em>was </em>a person by a similar name <a href="https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Masaaki+Tatsumi);&amp;assignee=Nintendo&amp;oq=inventor:(Masaaki+Tatsumi);+assignee:(Nintendo)">working on Nintendo technology patents</a> in its home country of Japan, public records show, and Domtendo was dismayed to find a Nintendo email address for that person on the public web.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>This is the name of a real person (</em>真章 辰己) <em>who worked for Nintendo out of Kyoto, Japan</em>, <em>but the company wouldn’t tell The Verge one word about it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: USPTO</cite></p></div><p>To a trained eye, there were signs that Domtendo’s “Tatsumi” was probably a fake. What business would a Japanese game technology inventor have individually chasing down a German YouTuber and threatening them with the laws of the United States? If they were a real lawyer, wouldn’t they know that threatening Domtendo with DMCA 512 is laughable, because that’s the portion of the law that protects platforms like YouTube rather than individual creators?&nbsp;</p><p>But Domtendo didn’t want to take the risk, not without proof. His livelihood was at stake. So as Tatsumi’s email threats rolled in, he reached out to Nintendo himself.&nbsp;</p><p>To his great surprise, Nintendo replied.&nbsp;</p><p>“Please note that <a href="mailto:tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com">tatsumi-masaaki@protonmail.com</a> is not a legitimate Nintendo email address and the details contained within the communication do not align with Nintendo of America Inc.’s enforcement practices. We are investigating further,” the company’s legal department wrote on October 10th, according to a screenshot shared with <em>The Verge</em>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Here’s how Nintendo replied to Domtendo.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Even then, Domtendo didn’t feel safe. He’d seen how Waikuteru had received a legal threat that seemingly came from a legitimate Nintendo email. Perhaps Tatsumi just wasn’t using his proper email account? Domtendo tried emailing “tasumi_masaaki@nintendo.co.jp” to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>His anxiety ratcheted even higher when Tatsumi’s next email arrived, asking him not to send email to that address. “Please understand that matters are not currently handled from there,” he wrote. Even though it seemed impossible that Tatsumi could be real, he somehow knew things that he shouldn’t.</p><p>Then, on October 18th, Tatsumi suddenly changed his tune: “Dear Domtendo, I hereby retract all of my preceding claims.”</p><p>Tatsumi wasn’t done with Domtendo quite yet. Two more emails arrived the same day, explaining that while Nintendo had “suspended” him from filing copyright infringement claims, his Nintendo colleagues would now file them on his behalf. Hours later, Domtendo received what was in some ways the most legit-looking email yet, seemingly sent from anti-piracy3@nintendo.co.jp rather than a personal email address.&nbsp;</p><p>But that email turned out to be Tatsumi’s undoing, when Domtendo checked the headers and discovered they’d spoofed Nintendo’s email address using a publicly available tool on the web. I took the tool for a spin, and sure enough — <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/29436?hl=en">unless you check</a>, anyone can make an email look like it was sent from Nintendo that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Domtendo still doesn’t understand how “Tatsumi” knew he’d emailed the real Tatsumi at Nintendo. He changed his passwords and reformatted his computer, just to be safe. Today, his best guess is that the troll was lurking in his personal Discord channel.&nbsp;</p><p>He’s angry at YouTube for letting this happen. “It’s their fault,” he tells me. “Every idiot can strike every YouTuber and there is nearly no problem to do so. It’s insane,” he writes. “It has to change NOW.”</p><div><p>“Every idiot can strike every YouTuber”</p></div><p>It’s true there isn’t a terribly high bar to submit a YouTube copyright claim, something that YouTube itself admits. Currently, bad actors just need to fill in a form on a website, a place where YouTube sees a “10 times higher attempted abuse rate” than tools with more limited access. Or they can just email YouTube’s copyright department directly. And while <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/512#:~:text=Elements%20of%20notification">the law</a> technically requires a copyright holder to provide their name and address and state “under penalty of perjury” that they’re authorized to complain on Nintendo’s behalf, there’s nothing compelling YouTube to check they aren’t lying before slapping creators with penalties.&nbsp;</p><div><p><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Why is Nintendo targeting this YouTuber?</a></h2></p><p>Russ Crandall, aka Retro Game Corps, was actually targeted by Nintendo. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/24272743/nintendo-retro-game-corps-russ-crandall-profile-youtube-emulation-dmca-takedown-copyright-strike">Here’s the story</a> of  how the Japanese game company (and YouTube) are threatening his livelihood.</p><p>If you have first-hand information about Nintendo, you can reach me securely on Signal at <strong>seanhollister.01</strong>. </p></div><p>The thing to remember is the DMCA’s “Safe Harbor” isn’t here to protect creators, EFF legal director Corynne McSherry explained to me in 2022. When rightsholders realized they wouldn’t be able to sue every uploader, and internet platforms realized they wouldn’t be able to survive under an onslaught of uploader lawsuits, the law became a compromise to protect platforms from liability as long as they remove infringing content fast. </p><p>“It creates a situation where service providers have very strong incentives to respond,” said McSherry. “They don’t want to mess around and try to figure out if they might be liable or not.”</p><p>Waikuteru and Rimea, a pair of other creators harassed by Tatsumi, agree that the YouTube system is unfair. Neither know for sure whether trolls were responsible for all the takedown notices they’re received, and that’s part of the problem. “The idea that months of worries were caused by a single troll as opposed to a big untouchable company is a hard pill to swallow either way,” says Rimea.&nbsp;</p><p>But they also claim YouTube doesn’t allow smaller channels to challenge copyright strikes in the first place, arguing that it automatically and arbitrarily rejects the legal notices that would let them reinstate their videos. “YouTube decides whether someone loses his channel based on channel size,” says Waikuteru.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTube isn’t particularly interested in talking about any of this, though.&nbsp;</p><p>While YouTube spokesperson Jack Malon did confirm that “Tatsumi” made false claims, the company wouldn’t explain why the company even briefly accepted false claims from a protonmail.com email address as legitimate, and repeatedly dodged questions about whether Tatsumi made false claims on other creators’ videos, too. </p><p>YouTube wouldn’t even tell me whether Domtendo was still in danger of false copyright claims from this specific individual, or offer assurances that it would take any new action to prevent this sort of behavior in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Malon does claim that YouTube has “dedicated teams working to detect and prevent abuse,” however, and “work to ensure that any associated strikes are reversed” when bad actors make false claims.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the troll, Tatsumi declined <em>The Verge</em>’s interview request. “Dear Sean, I am an authorized agent for Nintendo of America Inc,” they replied, staying in character to the very end.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-remakes-and-remasters-coming-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>2025 is set to continue the celebration of gaming with new remakes and remasters. It’s right we honor the games that paved the way for what we play now, and there are a variety of interesting titles scheduled for 2025.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-game-plus-in-silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-tomb-raider-games-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a> I-III Remastered are top of the mountain for 2024’s best remakes and remasters. They are products of the PS1 era and look better than ever in the present. We’re used to seeing remasters tinker with an oldie to make it a goldie, whereas remakes are built from the ground up to represent a classic in a new and reimagined way.</p>



<p>We like either direction, to be honest, as playing a prettier edition of games we love is the best! Fortunately, the games industry recognizes this too, so we’re gearing up for even more remakes and remakes in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-remakes-amp-remasters-in-2025">Biggest Remakes &amp; Remasters in 2025</h2>



<p>Like birds, expect more remasters and remakes to suddenly appear. Announcements can happen anytime and anywhere, from Summer Game Fest to Nintendo Directs. These are a handful of titles we know are coming in 2025—with official release dates and guesstimations.</p>



<h3 id="h-freedom-wars-remastered-jan-9">Freedom Wars Remastered — Jan. 9</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The bigger they are… Credit to Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had the original Freedom Wars on my PlayStation Vita as it was one of the rare, exclusive first-party titles. The Vita didn’t get much love, sadly, but Freedom Wars was a great addition to its catalog. It’s a Monster Hunter clone at its core, but the gameplay gets pretty intense, and there’s a nice sense of progression as you unlock better gear and harder missions. The battles become bigger, the bosses become badder, and Bandai Namco Entertainment is heading up this welcome remaster to, hopefully, give Freedom Wars the exposure it deserves.</p>



<h3 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-jan-16">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD — Jan. 16</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It’s like a jungle out there. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-pre-orders-are-available-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is a simple remaster and port of the 2010 Wii original. The Nintendo Switch has been privy to a hefty amount of remasters and ports from previous generations, and the newest Donley Kong release is just this. The biggest difference here is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD includes content only found in the Nintendo 3DS port of the OG game. Other than this, it’s the usual buffet of banana collecting, obstacle climbing, and collectible-finding platforming.</p>



<h3 id="h-tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-feb-14">Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered — Feb. 14</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Careful. Credit to Aspyr</figcaption></figure>



<p>I don’t know how many more Tomb Raider Remastered collections are planned—as there are still a few TR games left—but if this is the last one, it’s been a fun ride. The Tomb Raider games were seminal releases and helped propagate the idea women could be the stars of the action. Lara Croft achieved this and more. In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered-collection-arrives-in-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</a>, she kicks butt across Cambodia and Egypt in The Last Revelation, multiple continents in Chronicles, and France and the Czech Republic in Angel of Darkness. They’re not the most celebrated Tomb Raider entries, but it’ll be fun to revisit them once more.</p>



<h3 id="h-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-mar-20">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition — Mar. 20</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Check the pedometer regularly. Credit to Monolith Soft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition took a while to commission, but it’s happening, and is set for a release as early as Mar. 20, 2025. The Xenoblade spin-off features all of the 2015 original’s content, along with graphical enhancements, additional story components, and much more. It shares a lot in common with other Xenoblade games as it’s a sprawling, open-world RPG where you fight aliens with spectacular attacks and complete missions to upgrade characters and earn better gear—the usual fare you’d expect. </p>



<h3 id="h-yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A darling duo is back. Credit to Playtonic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The adorably named Yooka-Replaylee takes 2017’s Yooka-Laylee and applies a fresh coat of paint. I was so excited for its original release, and despite some obvious shortcomings regarding its controls and chaotic camera, it’s the perfect example of why we need 3D platformers forever—a point Astro Bot has doubled down on. Yooka is a chameleon, Laylee is a cute bat, and together, they combine to explore multiple words brimming with personality, magically book pages, and pesky enemies. If you want a more chilled game where you can sit back, relax, and collect stuff, I’d recommend checking out Yooka-Replaylee.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</h3>



<figure><figcaption>More jungles. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> might be a convoluted name, but it’s apt for the adventure the third mainline MGS entry takes us on. The origins of Snake are born here, and it sets in motion one of gaming’s most revered series. Konami sensibly chose to remake Snake Eater first as it comes first in Metal Gear’s narrative chronology. It’s set to be a faithful recreation of Snake Eater, featuring the same story, dramatic events, and even original voice acting roles. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater may be a remake, but it’s sure to be one of 2025’s best games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-black-myth-wukong-pssr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Black Myth: Wukong PlayStation 5 Pro PSSR upscaler implementation is among the best we have seen to date for an Unreal Engine 5-powered game, according to an in-depth analysis shared online.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at the latest patch released for Game Science's popular game released earlier this year, highlighting how it enhances the game on PlayStation 5 Pro. For Quality Mode, the patch introduces PSSR support, which upscales a roughly 1296p resolution input to 4K resolution and offers a noticeably sharper image compared to the base model. Some visual elements, such as noisy hair on the first boss, are much cleaner with PSSR than with AMD FSR, and lighting is generally more stable with PSSR than in other UE5-powered games like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-playstation-5-pro-looks-better-performance-mode/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, although this could be related to the lighting stability that was already exhibited on the base console. As such, Black Myth: Wukong's PSSR implementation ends up being solid, without any glaring issues outside the typical artifacts also seen in other games.</p>
<p>Balance Mode in Black Myth: Wukong on PlayStation 5 Pro is similar to Quality Mode, as it uses PSSR to upscale an internal resolution of 1296 to 4K, but features some visual differences, such as lower resolution textures and some Lumen tweaks. As opposed to the 30 FPS framerate of Quality Mode, however, the game generally runs at 40 FPS at 120 Hz output in this mode, resulting in a responsive experience with steady frame pacing. Performance mode, on the other hand, hasn't changed much over the base model, still using frame generation to hit 60 FPS at 1080p resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Black Myth: Wukong Updated! PlayStation 5 Pro Support Added - But Is Base PS5 Improved Too?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAkyg8r3A_A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The solid PlayStation 5 PSSR implementation in Black Myth: Wukong is definitely promising, as the upscaler has produced some very hit-and-miss results so far. Hopefully, the AI-powered upscaler will indeed be improved as it is being suggested by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-bad-pssr-older-version/">developers</a>, and reach the same heights as NVIDIA DLSS, which continues to be the best upscaler around.</p>

<p>More than 18,500 games will have been released onto the PC gaming platform Steam in the year 2024, <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/">according to SteamDB</a>. Dividing that by the number of people covering games at Ars, or the gaming press at large, or even everybody who games and writes about it online, yields a brutal ratio.</p>
<p>Games often float down the river of time to us, filtered by friends, algorithms, or pure happenstance. They don't qualify for our best games of the year list, but they might be worth mentioning on their own. Many times, they're better games then they were at release, either by patching or just perspective. And they are almost always lower priced.</p>
<p>Inspired by the cruel logic of calendars and year-end lists, I asked my coworkers to tell me about their favorite games <em>of</em> 2024 that were not <em>from</em> 2024. What resulted were some quirky gems, some reconsiderations, and some titles that just happened to catch us at the right time.</p>

<strong>ConcernedApe; Basically every platform</strong></p>
<p>After avoiding it forever and even bouncing off of it once or twice, I finally managed to fall face-first into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/%5Bhttps://www.stardewvalley.net/%5D(https://www.stardewvalley.net/)"><em>Stardew Valley</em></a> (2016) in 2024. And I've fallen hard—I only picked it up in October, but Steam says I've spent about 110 hours playing farmer.</p>
<p>In addition to being a fun distraction and a great way to kill both short and long stretches of time, what struck me is how remarkably <em>soothing</em> the game has been. I'm a nervous flyer, and it's only gotten worse since the pandemic, but I've started playing <em>Stardew</em> on flights, and having my little farm to focus on has proven to be a powerful weapon against airborne anxiety—even when turbulence starts up. Ars sent me on three trips in the last quarter of the year, and <em>Stardew</em> got me through all the flights.</p>
<p>Hell, I'm even enjoying the multiplayer—and I don't generally do multiplayer. My cousin Shaun and I have been meeting up most weekends to till the fields together, and the primary activity tends to be seeing who can apply the most over-the-top creatively scatological names to the farm animals. I've even managed to lure <em>Ur-Quan Masters</em> designer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgN4Mta86OE%5D(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgN4Mta86OE)">Paul Reiche III</a> to Pelican Town for a few weekends of hoedowns and harvests. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, Paul was already a huge fan of the game. And also of over-the-top creatively scatological farm animal names. Between him and Shaun, I'm&nbsp;amassing quite a list!)</p>

<p><strong>Obsidian;</strong> <strong>Windows, Switch, Xbox, PlayStation</strong></p>
<p>My favorite discovery this year has probably been&nbsp;<a href="https://grounded.obsidian.net/"><em>Grounded</em></a>, a Microsoft-published, Obsidian Entertainment-developed survival crafting game that was initially released back in 2022 (2020 if you count early access) but received <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/03/25/grounded-with-fully-yoked-1-4-update-announce/">its final planned content update</a>&nbsp;back in April.</p>
<p>You play as one of four plucky tweens, zapped down to a fraction-of-an-inch high as part of a nefarious science experiment. The game is heavily inspired by 1989's classic&nbsp;<em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em>, both in its '80s setting and its graphical design. Explore the backyard, fight bugs, find new crafting materials, build out a base of operations, and power yourself up with special items and steadily better equipment so you can figure out what happened to you and get back to your regular size.</p>
<p><em>Grounded</em>&nbsp;came up because I was looking for&nbsp;another game for the four-player group I've also played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/08/how-deep-rock-galactics-dwarf-miners-have-helped-me-survive-the-pandemic/">Deep Rock Galactic</a></em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/my-latest-co-op-multiplayer-obsession-is-raft-the-game-where-you-build-a-raft/">Raft</a></em>&nbsp;with. Like&nbsp;<em>Raft</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>&nbsp;has a main story with achievable objectives and an endpoint, plus a varied enough mix of activities that everyone will be able to find something they like doing. Some netcode hiccups notwithstanding, if you like survival crafting-style games but don't like&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-esque, objective-less, make-your-own-fun gameplay,&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>&nbsp;might scratch an itch for you.</p>

<p>I spent a whole lot of time browsing, playing, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-there-are-861-roguelike-deckbuilders-on-steam-all-of-a-sudden/">thinking about roguelike deckbuilders in 2024</a>. Steam's recommendation algorithm noticed, and tossed 2021's <em><a href="https://www.fightsintightspaces.com/">Fights in Tight Spaces</a></em> at me. I was on a languid week's vacation, with a Steam Deck packed, with just enough distance from the genre by then to maybe dip a toe back in. More than 15 hours later, Steam's "Is this relevant to you?" question is easy to answer.</p>
<p>Back in college, I spent many weekends rounding out my Asian action film knowledge, absorbing every instance of John Woo, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, <em>Flying Guillotine,</em> <em>Drunken Master, </em>and whatever I could scavenge from friends and rental stores. I thrilled to frenetic fights staged in cramped, cluttered, or quirky spaces. When the hero ducks so that one baddie punches the other one, then backflips over a banister to two-leg kick the guy coming up from beneath? That's the stuff.</p>

<p><em>Fights</em> gives you card-based, turn-by-turn versions of those fights. You can see everything your opponents are going to do, in what order, and how much it would hurt if they hit you. Your job is to pick cards that move, hit, block, counter, slip, push, pull, and otherwise mess with these single-minded dummies, such that you dodge the pain and they either miss or take each other out. Woe be unto the guy with a pistol who thinks he's got one up on you, because he's standing right by a window, and you've got enough momentum to kick a guy right into him.</p>
<p>This very low-spec game has a single-color visual style, beautifully smooth animations, and lots of difficulty tweaking to prevent frustration. The developer plans to release a game "in the same universe," <em><a href="https://www.knightsintightspaces.com/">Knights in Tight Spaces</a></em>, in 2025, and that's an auto-buy for me now.</p>

<p><strong>Bethesda</strong>; <strong>Windows, Xbox</strong></p>
<p><em><a href="https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/en/morrowind">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a></em> always had a sort of mythic quality for me. It came out when I was 18 years old—the perfect age for it, really. And more than any other game I had ever played, it inspired hope and imagination for where the medium might go.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, <em>Morrowind</em> (2002) ended up seeming like the end of the line instead of the spark that would start something new. With some occasional exceptions, modern games have emphasized predictable formulae and proven structures over the kind of experimentation, depth, and weirdness that Morrowind embraced. Even Bethesda's own games gradually became stodgier.</p>
<p>So <em>Morrowind</em> lived in my memory for years, a sort of holy relic of what gaming could have been before AAA game design became quite so oppressively formalist.</p>
<p>After playing hundreds of hours of <em>Starfield</em> this year, I returned to <em>Morrowind</em> for the first time in 20 years.</p>
<p>To be clear: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2023/">I quite liked <em>Starfield</em></a>, counter to the popular narrative about it—though I definitely understood why it wasn't for everyone. But people criticized <em>Starfield</em> for lacking the magic of a game like <em>Morrowind</em>, and I was skeptical of that criticism. As such, my return to the island of Vvardenfell was a test: did <em>Morrowind</em> really have a magic that <em>Starfield</em> lacks, even when taken out of the context of its time and my youthful imagination and open-mindnedness?</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>I was surprised to find that the result was a strong affirmative. I still like <em>Starfield</em>, but its cardinal sin is that it is unimaginative because it is derivative—of <em><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/no-mans-skys-next-update-ties-together-years-of-improvements/">No Man's Sky</a></em>, of <em>Privateer</em> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/04/review-elite-dangerous-is-the-best-damn-spaceship-game-ive-ever-played/"><em>Elite</em></a>, of <em>Mass Effect</em>, of various 70s and 80s sci-fi films and TV series, and most of all, of Bethesda Game Studios' earlier work.</p>
<p>In contrast, <em>Morrowind</em> is a fever dream of bold experimentation that seems to come more from the creativity of ambitious designers who were too young to know any better, than from the proven designs of past hits.</p>
<p>I played well over a hundred hours of <em>Morrowind</em> this year, and while I did find it tedious at times, it's engrossing for anyone who's willing to put up with its archaic pacing and quirks.</p>
<p>To be clear, many of the design experiments in the game simply don't work, with systems that are easily exploited. Its designers' naivety shines through clearly, and its rough edges serve as clear reminders of why today's strict formalism has taken root, especially in AAA games where too-big budgets and payrolls leave no room at all for risk.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's been wild to go back and play this game from 2002 and realize that in the 22 years since there have been very few other RPGs that were nearly as brazenly creative. I love it for that, just as much as I did when I was 18.</p>

<p>If you ask someone to list the most addictive puzzle games of all time, <em>Tetris</em> and <em>Minesweeper</em> will probably be at or near the top of the list. So it shouldn't be too surprising that <em>Tetrisweeper</em> makes an even more addictive experience by combining the two grid-based games together in a frenetic, brain-melting mess.</p>
<p><em>Tetrisweeper</em> starts just like <em>Tetris</em>, asking you to arrange four-block pieces dropping down a well to make lines without gaps. But in <em>Tetrisweeper</em>, those completed lines won't clear until you play a game of <em>Minesweeper</em> on top of those dropped pieces, using adjacency information and logical rules to mark which ones are safe and which ones house game-ending mines (if you want to learn more about <em>Minesweeper</em>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/%5Bhttps://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland%5D(https://bossfightbooks.com/products/minesweeper-by-kyle-orland)">there's a book I can recommend</a>).</p>

<p>At first, playing <em>Tetris</em> with your keyboard fingers while&nbsp;managing <em>Minesweeper</em> with your mouse hand can feel a little unwieldy—a bit like trying to drive a car and cook an omelet at the same time. After a few games, though, you'll learn how to split your attention effectively to drop pieces and solve complex mine patterns nearly simultaneously. That's when you start to master the game's intricate combo multiplier system and bonus scoring, striving for point-maximizing Tetrisweeps and T-spins (my high score is just north of 3 million, but pales in comparison to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/%5Bhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW61lo19O4Q%5D(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW61lo19O4Q)">that of the best players</a>).</p>
<p>While <em>Tetrisweeper</em> grew out of a 2020 Game Jam, I didn't discover the game until this year, when it helped me clear my head during many a work break (and passed the time during a few dull Zoom calls as well). I'm hoping <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-favorite-games-of-2024-that-were-not-released-in-2024/%5Bhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2918460/Tetrisweeper/%5D(https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918460/Tetrisweeper/)">the game's planned Steam release</a>—still officially listed as "Coming Soon"—will help attract even more addicts than <a href="https://kertisjones.itch.io/tetrisweeper">its current itch.io</a> availability.</p>

<p>What if I told you that <em>Star Citizen</em> creator Chris Roberts previously tried to make <em>Star Citizen</em> more than two decades ago but left the project and saw it taken over by real, non-crazy professionals who had the discipline to actually finish something?</p>
<p>That's basically the story behind 2003's forgotten PC game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer_(video_game)"><em>Freelancer</em></a>. What started as a ludicrously ambitious space life sim concept ended up as a sincere attempt to make games like <em>Elite</em> and <em>Wing Commander: Privateer</em> far more accessible.</p>
<p>That meant a controversial, mouse-based control scheme instead of flight sticks, as well as cutting-edge graphics, celebrity voice actors, carefully designed economy and progression systems, and flashy cutscenes.</p>
<p>I followed the drama of <em>Freelancer</em>'s development in forums, magazines, and gaming news websites when I was younger. I bought the hype as aggressively as <em>Star Citizen</em> fans did years later. The game that came out wasn't what I was dreaming of, and that disappointment prevented me from finishing it.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2024: on a whim, I played <em>Freelancer</em> from beginning to end for the first time.</p>

<p>And honestly? It's great. In a space trading sim genre that's filled with giant piles of jank (the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_(video_game_series)">X</a></em> series) or inaccessible titles that fly a little too far into the simulation zone for some (<em>Elite Dangerous</em>), <em>Freelancer</em> might be the most fun you can have with the genre even today.</p>
<p>It's understandable that it didn't have much lasting cultural impact since the developers who took it over lacked the wild ambition of the man who started it, but I enjoyed a perfectly pleasant 20–30 hours smuggling space goods and shooting pirates—and I didn't have to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">spend $48,000 of real money</a> on a ship to get that.</p>

<p><strong>CD Projekt Red</strong>; <strong>Windows, Xbox, PlayStation</strong> (<strong>macOS in 2025</strong>)</p>
<p>Can one simply play, as a game, one of the biggest and most argued-over gaming narratives of all time? Four years after its calamitous launch sparked debates about AAA gaming sprawl, developer crunch, game review practicalities, and, eventually, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/it-cost-120m-for-cyberpunk-2077-patches-and-dlc-to-fix-the-games-image/">post-release redemption arcs</a>, what do you get when you launch <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>?</p>
<p>I got a first-person shooter, one with some interesting ideas, human-shaped characters you'd expect from the makers of <em>The Witcher 3</em>, and some confused and unrefined systems and ideas. I enjoyed my time with it, appreciate the work put into it, and can recommend it to anyone who is okay with something that's not quite an in-depth FPS RPG (or "immersive sim") but likes a bit of narrative thrust to their shooting and hacking.</p>
<p>You can't fit everything about <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> into one year-end blurb (or a 1.0 release, apparently), so I'll stick to the highs and lows. I greatly enjoyed the voice performances, especially from Keanu Reeves and Idris Elba (the latter in the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> DLC), and those behind Jackie, Viktor Vektor, and the female version of protagonist V. I was surprised at how good the shooting felt, given the developer's first time out; the discovery of how a "Smart" shotgun worked will stick with me a while. The driving: less so. There were moments of quiet, ambient world appreciation, now that the game's engine is running okay. And the side quests have that <em>Witcher</em>-ish quality to them, where they're never as straightforward as described and also tell little stories about life in this place.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>What seems missing to me, most crucially, are the bigger pieces, the real choices and unexpected consequences, and the sense of really living in this world. You can choose one of three backgrounds, but it only comes up as an occasional dialogue option. You can build your character in myriad ways, and there are lots of dialogue options. But the main quest keeps you on a fairly strict path, with the options to talk, hack, or stealth your way past inevitable shootouts not as great as you might think. Once you've brought your character up to power-fantasy levels, the larger city becomes a playground, but not one I much enjoyed playing in. (Plus, the idea of idle wandering and amassing wealth, given the main plot contrivance, is kind of ridiculous, but this is a game, after all).</p>
<p><em>Phantom Liberty</em>, in my experience, patches up every one of these weaknesses inside its smaller play space, providing more real choices and a tighter story, with more set pieces arriving at a faster pace. If you can buy this game bundled with its DLC, by all means, do so. I didn't encounter any game-breaking bugs in my mid-2024 playthrough, nor even many crashes. Your mileage may vary, especially on consoles, as <a href="https://www.watchoutforfireballs.com/461">other late-coming players have seen</a>.</p>
<p>Waiting on this game a good bit certainly helps me grade it on a curve; nobody today is losing $60 on something that looks like it's playing over a VNC connection. When CD Projekt Red carries on in this universe, I think they'll have learned a lot from what they delivered here, much like we've all learned about pre-release expectations. It's okay to take your time getting to a gargantuan game; there are lots of games from prior years to look into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/27/snow-bros-wonderland-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Every holiday growing up, we’d head off to our caravan. I spent each day embroiled in outdoor activities like riding my bike, climbing trees and skateboarding exceptionally badly, and I loved every single second of being there. When all that fresh air wore thin, the other thing I loved was the arcade. This wasn’t a huge arcade, it was a room in the central caravan site centre, with three or four arcade machines and an air hockey table that never worked. Still, this was my haven, and my first experience of classic games like Rainbow Islands and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs. There are formative moments in your life, and this place played a huge role in my love for games.</p>
<p><iframe title="Snow Bros. Wonderland - Launch Trailer - PS4 | PS5 | Nintendo Switch | Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MfOEWzJbNQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Snow Bros. was a major part of that. An absolute favourite amongst those machines, it was a riff on the original Super Mario Bros. game, giving you a single-screen platform arena that saw you coating enemies in snow before booting them across the screen, taking out any enemies stupid enough to get in the way, plastering them all over the place. It was the right side of chaotic, and visually appealing, and my supply of 20 pence pieces would clink satisfyingly into the beckoning coin slot until my pockets were empty.</p>


<p>This is all to say, I was astounded and eternally happy to discover that the Snow Bros. would be returning. Snow Bros. Wonderland is a sequel to the original two games, following on from their storyline, with the children of the original Snow Bros. taking up the mantle to save the kingdom from the evil King Atchich. It shifts from the 2D perspective to an isometric 3D one, but the overarching gameplay remains the same: cover the badguys in snow, and then yeet them around the screen. As a starting point, it’s a great one.</p>


<p>The team at Tatsujin, under the watchful eye of original developers Toaplan, have captured plenty of the charm of the original, though I preferred the slightly chubbier build of the original Snow Bros. to that of their slender sons. The enemies have made the jump to 3D as well, and though it’s not as immediately arresting as the original, it’s a fine attempt. The game is broken up into different worlds, with the landscape and enemies changing as you advance, each one headed by a massive enemy boss, each of which are simple, but visually appealing.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises is the challenge that you can face in Snow Bros. Wonderland – its cheery visual style belies some tough moments, particularly against the bosses. That said, it’s just the right side of challenging, and there’s plenty of reward for seeing off the final enemy or firing the last snowball into a particularly annoying enemy.</p>
<p>You’re aiming for the highest score as possible as these are then converted into a currency you can use to upgrade your Snow Bros. abilities and their visual look. I loved being able to deck them out in cute hats and boots, and they really become yours, while the slow and somewhat puny feeling attacks they have at the start soon advance into powerful and uproarious abilities later on.</p>

<p>You’ll need them too. My favourite moments were where you have to survive against a steady stream of enemies for a set amount of time, and the game pours it on here, dropping wave after wave into your area. This, in turn, lets you ride a giant snowball through a ton of enemies, resulting in a deeply satisfying combo. You can multiply that enjoyment by playing in four-player co-op too, as there’s plenty of amusement to be had yeeting snowballs at each other on the way to clearing an area.</p>
<p>The only yellow mark in the snow is that the Nintendo Switch version of the game has a poor frame rate when docked. It’s not aggressively bad, with inconsistent dips, but you’ll notice it the moment you start playing. It’s still playable, but it makes the game feel hastily put together when that isn’t the case. Things improve greatly when you play in handheld mode, and everything becomes brighter and more vibrant here, rather than the washed-out look it has when blown up on a TV, and I happily played here for many hours through the campaign.</p>

			<p>It might not be much longer until we actually see something new about Everwild. The upcoming project in development at Rare has been shrouded in mystery ever since its <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> over five years ago at the X019 special event hosted by Microsoft.</p>
<p>While the game received <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-new-trailer-xbox-games-showcase-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another trailer</a> during the 2020 Xbox Games Showcase, Rare studio head Craig Duncan <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-gameplay-ideas-are-still-being-brainstormed-says-rare-studio-head/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">admitted</a> at the same time that gameplay ideas were still being brainstormed. In 2021, reliable rumors <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> that the Everwild project had restarted from scratch, with an 'optimistic' 2024 release window target we now know wasn't met. Later that year, insider Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that even the people working on it still weren't quite sure what it would become.</p>
<p>The silence continued to stretch until late last year when Rare <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-fans-hopes-are-rekindled-by-new-job-ad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a video producer ad for Everwild. You don't hire a video producer unless the game has made it far enough in development that you can think about producing video content to share with the public. Sure enough, even insiders are starting to align, with Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing</a> in October that the gameplay loop has finally been nailed down and development is finally progressing well.</p>
<p>Now, Rare has decided to greet its Instagram fans with an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DD_nmQTs-3a/?utm_source=ig_embed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Everwild themed Christmas card</a> this year. Needless to say, this fueled hopes that we might see this title again at some point next year, perhaps during the regular Xbox Summer Showcase. This doesn't necessarily mean it would launch next year, of course, but if even the developer is starting to tease it, a new trailer might be on the way.</p>
<p>It would certainly be nice if Rare clarified what it's going to be about. From the brief trailers we previously got, it looks as if the players will explore a vast wilderness while helping animals rather than hunting them, as in most games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-5-most-influential-rpgs-of-all-time/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Role-playing games, or RPGs, are one of the most popular genres of games out there. RPGs cater to everyone from kids to adults to the elderly—you just have to find the one that fits your playstyle best! That’s why we’re here to present the top five most influential RPGs of all time so you can see the game that’s right for you. These are listed in no particular order.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-rpgs-everyone-should-play-once-in-their-lifetime">Five RPGs Everyone Should Play Once in Their Lifetime</h2>



<h3 id="h-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Witcher 3</a>, developed by CD Projekt RED and released in 2015, is an action RPG where you play as the character Geralt of Rivia. Geralt is a Witcher, a monster slayer for hire, looking for his adopted daughter Ciri after she disappeared years before trying to escape the Wild Hunt, a group of spectral warriors led by their king, Eredin. Many other characters appear in this game, including, but not limited to, Yenefer of Vengerberg, Triss Merigold, Dandelion, Zoltan Chivay, and Vesemir. The player’s choices within the game can lead to several different endings!</p>



<h3 id="h-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-like-skyrim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skyrim</a>, a 2011 action RPG developed by Bethesda Game Studios, is one of the most popular RPGs ever. Playing as the Dragonborn, a customizable character that can be one of nine different humanoid races, the player must save the world from Alduin the World-Eater, a dragon dead-set on destroying the world due to prophecy. Players can join many factions, side with a group for Skyrim’s civil war, choose to be good or evil, and choose from many different fighting or magic combat styles. Skyrim is popular because each player’s journey can end up differently, even if the main story concludes similarly each time.</p>



<h3 id="h-bloodborne">Bloodborne</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-best-games-like-bloodborne/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloodborne</a> is a 2015 action RPG developed by FromSoftware in which the player plays as a Hunter who fights through the city of Yharnam, attempting to find the source of the blood-borne plague affecting residents. Bloodborne is a Soulslike game, meaning combat is harsh, unforgiving, and relies on precise hits and timely dodging to avoid getting killed. The player character is quite customizable, allowing players to immerse themselves in the world of Bloodborne.</p>



<h3 id="h-diablo-ii">Diablo II</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Diablo II, a 2000 action RPG developed by Blizzard North, is centered around dark fantasy and horror themes and is comprised of four acts. Each act follows a predetermined path, but levels are randomly generated, allowing for a unique experience each time the game is played. The base game has five unique classes: The Amazon, The Necromancer, The Barbarian, The Sorceress, and The Paladin. The expansion Diablo II: Lord of Destruction adds two more classes: The Druid and The Assassin. The game’s purpose is to defeat Diablo in Hell and prevent his return, and each act in the game leads up to that final fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 RPG developed by Square (also known as SquareSoft) that follows the exploits of the character Cloud Strife, a mercenary trying to stop a megacorporation from using the planet as an energy source. Cloud fights alongside many characters who are also trying to save the planet. Many factions, including AVALANCHE, SOLDIER, and the Cetra, are in the game, all trying to fight against Shinra Electric Power Company and the Turks, a secret branch of Shinra’s security forces. The game features three modes of play: the world map, the field, and the battle screen. While in “the field,” players can traverse areas found within the world map and explore, talk with characters, and advance the story through events. Of course, if the old-school graphics prove too much for you, there’s always the remake!</p>



<p>While these games are influential in many ways, they don’t even touch the number of RPGs available on the market. This list is meant to give you five very different types of RPGs, stories, and gameplay mechanics from some of the most influential companies and games. Head over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to let us know if you’ve ever played any of these and which was your favorite!</p>



<hr>



<p>Of course, the RPG genre is vast and filled with more than just the most iconic titles ever. Don’t forget about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-disney-games-to-gift-this-holiday-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many Disney games worth playing this holiday season</a>, which includes a few RPGs set in the iconic universe!</p>

			<p>For those who are excited about the release of Assetto Corsa EVO, it's been confirmed by KUNOS Simulazioni that the title will be getting an open-world map that will come in the Summer of 2025, with the game set to enter <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-set-to-release-on-steam-january-16-2025/">Early Access on Steam on January 16, 2025</a>. Those who have access to Steam and a suitable PC rig will be able to purchase the game and experience it. It's not said whether the game is planned for a release on console in the future after the Early Access period. All of this news was announced in the new keynote video released by 505 Games and KUNOS Simulazioni, which you can watch below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Everything you need to know about Assetto Corsa EVO" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4ZlW9vYZbFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is set to get a lot of new features and content for those who love the virtual racing experience. This includes an authentic and faithful recreation of Eifel, a region in Germany that surrounds the infamous motorsports complex, Nürburgring. This open-world map is set to be released in the Summer of 2025, with the specific release date to be announced at a later date. It's been said that it'll be released in stages so that the team has the opportunity to provide continuous updates and new content to the game as it expands and nears its full release date.</p>
<p>The open-world map will also allow players to have an immersive level of interaction with other players, as well as the opportunity to interact with businesses and the option to rent cars or upgrade their vehicles via the aftermarket.</p>
<p>"Assetto Corsa EVO is primarily a love letter to the automotive world and the petrolheads' lifestyle. Our concept of 'open world' is designed to let players enjoy every single car to its fullest, whether on the rack or public roads, experiencing the pure driving pleasure and simply enjoying the ride," said Marco Massarutto.</p>
<p>When Assetto Corsa EVO releases in Early Access on Steam, it will include 20 cars to choose from, as well as five circuits across four Continents. The game is set for a full release in Fall 2025, where the game will have 100 cars by that point and 15 officially licensed circuits at a minimum, with more to come as free updates.</p>
<p>Assetto Corsa EVO is now available to be <a href="https://u15209703.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.ccgs6cDmqBRpWmPH-2B0gu81-2BxBWpoO13W1-2FJkr1waHxoUFfDV7yVfDglC2AUHrPfTy32OfPiTktnNCzdGuyzXHLgftEhrCjGAhCCDRfZYLTo-3DYUqS_wgpRUt1ukdaFRZYh9QrZG4eYzWlxCkemZe-2BsgPLtG-2FmybzPL2GfDQWiCWmTUvAuLStlYFGYu0XMbHZPcfwEvPr2K7NvGT5mlTwowLnX9JReq1NCR4DybycmQIAsy2M4nNuO4Rg-2B2rGHPCD-2BJI77VlSgCtzhW0f8QKoXVdP1d9IFabm9M2wfYUvGXScMvvEyU8ujoMJcQEbXhRJLx0AZtMVr8wl1Iiihjtm4i3sdFKYXxWdUuKlJIdEhwwSFUHsqh9bRcqy3IAL8RCvGezk69wUzVNsvpWMYQenOSUMUFshjwKuaW9GbCRJIHmenE4gkJFzddty3MisGm-2FECbQyuUouwXsgp2SAEdUEMojmFz02RKQr3x6xodqVnACAJ7DIEVMVWIyn1LgpsOJEkqj3fVZl2Q4Z1H0WM3cXqFAlTg97hDefk0pun5nV9MJ2XkN2MH-2BCuYah-2F7PJw9D5TSecWuTrDp6P08ue4RYF68mO8GVUCvI9c8bgatnuAQenlM4tMR0bPfXdJlLJj-2Fu5TapoG89w-3D-3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted on Steam right now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hitpoint-press-humblewood-setting-is-now-pay-what-you-want<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hitpoint Press has offered TTRPG fans an enticing sale this holiday season. The publisher behind many beloved books and products, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-animated-things-and-spells-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Deck of Many,</em></a><em> </em>has announced that two of their campaign settings, <em>Humblewood</em> and <em>Heckna</em>, are now available as pay-what-you-want.</p>



<p>Humblewood and Heckna's announcement as pay-what-you-want happened somewhat unceremoniously on Hitpoint Press' official web store. As the phrase implies, you can now buy a PDF of either the Humblewood campaign setting or the Heckna campaign setting books for whatever amount you decide. Pay a dollar. Pay ten dollars. Pay whatever, the choice is yours.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=F_40lBE3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=UH6oqGTJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both of these settings utilize the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e SRD and bring their own unique fantasy to the table.</p>

<p><em>Humblewood</em> is a world entirely occupied by intelligent animals, similar to Brian Jacques' influential Redwall novel series. It contains 10 playable player species, new subclasses, and a prewritten adventure for characters levels 1-5. It's a setting so popular it is even available as a third-party supplement on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heckna</em> is a dark carnival setting. A world where various attractions and performers are actually gruesome monsters in disguise. The PDF is both a campaign setting and a prewritten adventure for characters level 1-10. It contains new magic items, a bestiary, a set of safety tools for mindful play, and a "Shuffled Stories" engine designed to remix elements of the campaign on each playthrough.</p>

Hitpoint Press has produced lines of miniatures, GM Screens, and playing cards for Heckna. As for <em>Humblewood</em>, the setting has spawned several prewritten adventures and supplements like <em>Humblewood Tales</em>, as well as an official comic written by Gail Simone.</p>

<p>Hitpoint Press has a respectable reputation in the TTRPG industry thanks in part to their <em>Deck of Many</em> product line alongside TTRPG books nad supplements helmed by prominent creators in the space. These works include <em>Fool's Gold</em> and <em>Hexbound</em> by YouTube personalities DIngo Doodles and Pointy Hat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/breaking-vault-of-viditya-voleti-brings-nonlinear-heists-for-good-cause<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Independent TTRPG designer Graham Gentz has released a new project. The game, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em>, is an experience about groups of criminals, doomed heists, and character development through adversity. Furthermore, the game's sales will go towards assisting trans youth.</p>



<p>As described on its <a href="https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti" rel="nofollow">Itch page</a>, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.</p>

<p>The group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, "You are not a good person, but will you die that way?"</p>

The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game <em>The Anatomy of Fear</em>.</p>

<p>The author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including <em>Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger</em>, <em>Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Under The Autumn Strangely</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, 100% of all sales of <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> will go to the <a href="https://southernequality.org/tyep/" rel="nofollow">Trans Youth Emergency Project</a>. This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.</p>

<p>The game is available now in PDF format for as little as $6.</p>

On December 25, however, they returned to X (formerly know as Twitter) to do exactly that. “This holiday season, I couldn’t resist sharing this gift with you all,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span>. “Some might call it an early reveal… but I call it the best-kept secret of the year.” The message was accompanied by a photo showing a hand holding an alleged Switch 2 sideways in what looked like a hardware testing workroom. </p><p>The ravenous Switch 2 leak community immediately honed in on weird artifacting and mismatching in the image to accuse it of being an AI-generated fake. NextHandheld later followed up with a second post sharing an alleged image of the Switch 2 dock, cheekily writing, “It’s all just AI generated.” There were once again weird anomalies in the background and the outline of the console. Looking more closely at the images shared, believers speculated that the breaks were too clean to be AI-generated and instead indicated that, likely to protect their identity and the location where the photos were taken, NextHandheld had simply used AI to replace everything in the images <em>but</em> the hardware itself.</p><p>One user on the Switch 2 subreddit, DoctorHoneywell, compared various contours and dimensions from a previous alleged Joy-Con leak and found the photos from NextHandheld were a very close match, possibly indicating that both were in fact from a production unit approximating the final build design and shape. “It could be a really high quality resin 3D print with a well done finish, and then custom stickers on it. It could be really good photoshop job over an AI image,” DoctorHoneywell concluded. “But that would mean that I was still right with what I have said every single time I’ve been asked about this before they came out: It’s either real, or a high quality fake.”</p><p>The debate waged throughout Christmas Day, and NextHandheld’s own poll shared on X had 60 percent of roughly 4,000 respondents believing the leaks were legit and the rest thinking they were elaborate fakes. The mysterious leaker is also promising to reveal new details in the days ahead. Other once-prominent Nintendo leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..">like Pyoro, who previously confessed</a></span> to having a source with access to Nintendo’s website backend, have also tried to get in on the action, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but without sharing anything definitive</a></span>. For some, the entire thing is reminiscent of the notorious 2018 “Grinch leak” about <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s roster. That one turned out to be a carefully crafted scam. Is NextHandheld pulling a similar trick?</p><p>The stakes around these leaks remain quite low. Unless everything that has so far trickled out has been completely made-up and off-base, all available rumors and reporting point to Nintendo’s next console likely being pretty similar to the existing Switch, just with upgraded specs. Every time it feels like speculation around the Switch 2 might be dying down again, a new data point arises for fans to argue about, and it seems likely that will keep happening until Nintendo finally reveals official information. The company’s promised to do so by April 2025, and the time for its big traditional February Direct is quickly approaching.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The narrative-focused RPG chronicling the struggle of misfit adventurers on a quest to save the world held my attention like little else. Its slow-burn story told through text boxes on pre-rendered backgrounds, all backed by a soaring melodic score, was unlike any piece of media I encountered before. Before the decade was up, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> arrived and delivered more of the same for me. In the early 2000s, however, <em>Final Fantasy </em>changed, and I thought I’d never experience <em>that</em> kind of game for the first time again. That is, until I fired up <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> and was instantly transported back to the late ‘90s. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735"><em>Final Fantasy VII: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>And if you’re like me and have been craving those original PlayStation <em>Final Fantasy</em> vibes, then you absolutely need to give <em>Fantasian</em> a spin.</p><figure id="" data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re only now hearing about <em>Fantasian</em>, there’s probably a good reason for that.

This is especially the case if you mute the new voice acting and just let the text boxes do the dialogue and exposition for you (which, with all due respect to the voice talent that went into bringing the characters to life, I think is the better way to play <em>Fantasian</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>FF</em> titles of the late ‘90s, however, the backgrounds in <em>Fantasian </em>weren’t created with computer graphics, but instead were produced with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual physical dioramas</a></span> that were photographed from multiple angles. Though it gives a distinct, and <em>gorgeous</em>, look to <em>Fantasian</em>, the experience in motion is very similar to old-school <em>FF </em>titles. <em>FF7 </em>in particular always had a hand-crafted look to its backgrounds that contributed to its charm. The world feels intentional, with an eye toward making it feel like a memorable place, inspirationally crafted to transport you to a fantasy realm. Toss in some turn-based combat, random encounters, and a hybrid fantasy/science-fiction narrative about an amnesiac protagonist and, well, if you were a <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan in the late ‘90s, this should all sound very familiar. And speaking of sound, oh boy, will <em>Fantasian</em> <em>sound</em> familiar. Just listen to this battle theme:</p><p>And compare it to the melodies in this classic <em>FF</em> jam:</p><p>The soundtrack is filled with moments like this, stirring up our memories of the epic adventures of yesteryear through melodies and motifs that sound familiar to ‘90s-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> tunes or just through Uematsu’s signature melodic and compositional styles. It’s some of his finest work. </p><p>As someone who always felt that a certain charm was lost when <em>Final Fantasy</em> started changing its overall structure in the early 2000s with <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, <em>Fantasian</em> has successfully filled several late evenings for me with a kind of wild neo-nostalgia that I’ve always wanted to experience, but have never expected from modern games. In its presentation and narrative, <em>Fantasian</em> literally feels like a hidden PSX <em>FF</em> title. </p><figure id="" data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a few rough edges here and there, and you can sense the mobile origins of the game from time to time via the UI and the fact that the combat wants you to line up targets in a row in a way that would probably feel more natural on a touch screen. And while the story is perfectly entertaining, it’s not hitting the way <em>FF7</em>’s or <em>FF8</em>’s does. (Then again, it also has to compete with the two decades of nostalgia I’ve built up for Cloud and Squall’s tales.)</p><p>But really, those rough spots matter very little as the game nails the overall pacing and tone of storytelling and dialogue that brought late-‘90s <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles to life. I’ve yet to hit the game’s infamous “Part Two,” which I’ve heard comes with a wild difficulty spike (and I’m playing on “Hard” difficulty), but I’ve been spending evenings grinding out my characters in preparation for that…which, honestly, is what I used to do in <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> anyway.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fantasian</em> is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of 2024, even though it’s a psuedo-remaster of a 2021 title. It is the kind of game I’ve been aching to play for nearly 25 years. If you’ve been glancing at screenshots since the game’s original release a few years ago, admiring the dioramas and wondering if it could cast the same spell as those late ‘90s PSX <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, then wonder no more and give <em>Neo Dimension</em> a try.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After season one ended with Gi-hun (Lee Jung-jae), also known as Player 456,  choosing to search for the people behind the game instead of boarding a flight to Los Angeles to reconnect with his daughter, we catch up with him two years later as he’s contracted a group of people to search for The Salesman (Gong Yoo), the man who recruits people into the game. The formerly naive Gi-hun is now a radicalized vigilante with a makeshift shooting range and illegal guns in his hotel room. But, that’s not the only change this season. </p><p>Over seven episodes, <em>Squid Game</em> introduces its first transgender character, shows us someone being recruited to be a guard, and turns more children’s games into chaos creators. It’s not all good, as some of the second season’s changes left us yearning for more. But one thing is for sure: these changes make it abundantly clear that we are entering the final episodes of <em>Squid Game</em> as a series. Let’s cherish them while we can.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-recommend-id="image://fa2a16f2361db10f4303770ed7689ba7" data-format="png" data-width="1535" data-height="1038" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Two men about to play Russian Roulette" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The central tension of the show has always been rooted in the deadly consequences of playing the show’s twisted versions of children’s games. In the past, <em>Squid Game </em>has turned Red Light, Green Light into a massacre machine, throwing marbles into a breeding ground for lethal deception, and literally put lives in people’s hands with Tug of War. The new season gives still more traditionally harmless games a murderous twist.</p><p>Before the season gets to the island for the start of the competition, the Salesman merges double-handed Rock, Paper, Scissors with Russian Roulette. After capturing Woo-seok (June Suk-ho) and Mr. Kim (Oh Dal-su), two of the men tasked by Gi-hun to find him, he forces them to each throw out a choice in Rock, Paper, Scissors with each of their hands before taking one choice back and determining the winner based on the final selections. The loser got a gunshot to the temple, with the chance that the hammer could come down on an empty chamber. As we saw, the split-second nature of having to observe what your opponent played and choosing which of your hands to take back led to Mr. Kim acting on instinct alone, instincts that convinced him to spare his younger flunky. </p><p>Later, the season introduced a six-legged pentathlon in which six contestants each tie one of their legs to another’s while moving through a course that has them playing five games—Ddakji, Flying Stone, Gongi, Spinning Top, and Jegi. Outside of Ddakji, the other four were all new additions. But none of those produced heart-wrenching results like the final new game introduced in the second season: Mingle.</p><p>In Mingle, contestants stand on a spinning platform surrounded by a number of open rooms. When the platform stops spinning, the announcer speaks out the number of people that must be grouped together and in one of the rooms by the time the timer stops. Anyone left out of a room when the timer is out gets shot dead, along with contestants in a room with the incorrect number of (alive) players. Alliances are formed and broken within minutes, depending on what is asked of them to survive, and the mad dash to doors turns into contestants physically trying to keep others out of their rooms, effectively killing them. This was the first game of the season that made it abundantly clear to the contestants that teamwork is a survivalist illusion, and saving yourself ultimately will come down to killing others.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-recommend-id="image://241b4a62e61865bf19eb65f91ef3c47b" data-format="jpg" data-width="2808" data-height="1872" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Contestants choosing sides" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Following the death of game creator Oh Il-nam (O Yeong-su) at the end of Season 1, it looks like the head of the games In-ho (Lee Byung-hun) took what he learned from last season and expanded it. In the first season, contestants were only given one opportunity to vote on whether the games should continue or stop without any compensation. While the majority voted for the games to stop, they all returned back to the murder lottery after spending a day in their depressing realities. In true <em>Squid Game</em> fashion, one of the few parts of the competition that had any sort of moral fiber was twisted into another opportunity for those working the game to engineer more competition. </p><p>In the second season, players get to vote on the game’s continuation after every competition. To make the decision even harder, players receive an equal share of the prize money if the majority votes to leave. It grows deadlier the deeper into the competition the contestants go, especially when players wear a patch of their choice. The people who vote to stay typically feel as if more money is the only way to save their lives from the debt that could lead to their deaths. The people who vote to leave believe they’d rather be alive and broke than risk their lives for the hopes of a little more money. Even though their decisions are conflicting, they’re both rooted in survival, which inherently puts anyone voting against their decision in opposition to them living. What results from that is one of the bloodiest group fights in <em>Squid Game</em> history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-recommend-id="image://89cb1e803a43325c65b29183926ca8a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="6462" data-height="4308" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squid Game contestant looking serious" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is either blatant foreshadowing of the next winner in <em>Squid Game</em>, or Netflix is about to venture into a dark place of no return. In this season, Player 222, Kim Jun-hee (Jo Yu-ri), is revealed to be pregnant with the child of fellow contestant Player 333, Myung-gi (Yim Si-wan) after he ghosts her. She’s in the competition because she lost her money due to following Myung-gi’s terrible investment advice. Regardless of why she’s there, she’s officially the first pregnant woman in <em>Squid Game</em> history, which means her death could be unprecedented in the worst way.</p><p>Outside of the young guards who get killed in both seasons, <em>Squid Game</em> has pretty much excluded children from risking their lives. Given that Jun-hee’s pregnancy wasn’t overtly visible, it’s possible the organizers of the game were unaware of her bringing a fetus into a warzone. However, a child’s life being decided by their parent’s desperation is the type of social experiment <em>Squid Game</em> has come to be known for. Luckily she survives Season 2, but that doesn’t mean she or her child are in the clear just yet. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-recommend-id="image://a1663cf64a7f5012f189562f35d72bda" data-format="png" data-width="1507" data-height="1014" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking at the opposition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gi-hun has had a one-track mindset since winning the 45.6 billion  in the first season of <em>Squid Game</em>: stop the people running the game. His first plan fails after the organizers remove the tracking chip implanted in the molar of one of his teeth meant to guide former police officer Jun-ho (Wi Ha-jun) and his team to the remote island that has eluded him for two years. Well, if you can’t bring them to justice, take them to hell. That, or some version of that mentality, was clearly at play when he staged the first attack on the guards by the contestants.</p><p>He doesn’t only remember the games he played in his first go-around, but also the human dynamics that often had depraved results. Once the contestants’ voting reached its first draw, requiring votes to be cast again the following day, Gi-hun knew those who voted to stay would see bedtime as a golden opportunity to take out dissenters from the other side of the voting aisle. He acknowledged that his plan would require fellow contestants to lose their lives, giving him and his collaborators the chance to play dead themselves before attacking guards coming out check their vital signs.</p><p>Even though his plan led to mass casualties, and was ultimately thwarted by In-ho secretly playing as Player 001, Gi-hun now knows the game’s once-impenetrable fortress has exploitable vulnerabilities. Hopefully his attack destabilized their defenses enough for his cavalry to come in and save the day. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-recommend-id="image://3d087d27b02b47c1488bf60af14dc49b" data-format="png" data-width="1384" data-height="947" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gi-hun looking determined" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should’ve seen this coming when show creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told <em>Entertainment Weekly </em>that he envisioned the second and third seasons as one season until he realized there were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/squid-game-creator-split-seasons-2-and-3-too-many-episodes-8763970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">too many episodes</a></span>. Let me speak for the rest of us binge warriors who have routinely dedicated 30 hours of streaming to watch an entire 30-episode series in one weekend: there can never be too many episodes. As a result, the second season of <em>Squid Game </em>is good, but not as satisfying as the first season, which Dong-hyuk also admits was as far as he originally planned for the story to go. </p><p>The primary issue with the truncated season is that the stakes aren’t high enough for viewing interest to be guaranteed much longer. As of now, the third season will show what ramifications will be levied against players for threatening to kill the organizers, how voting on the game’s continuation will change after the bloodbath, whether Gi-hun’s backup arrives in time, and who ultimately will win the competition. Outside of the mutiny, we’ve experienced these stakes in the first season, but they all felt a bit higher because it was our first time. Plus, <em>Squid Game</em> is less of a mystery-style thriller and more of an action thriller that derives its suspense from us clicking to the next episode and finding out how else this show will depict the survival of the fittest. </p><p>While <em>Squid Game</em>’s third season will arrive sometime in 2025, cutting the final season into two parts wasn’t a smart move. Still, if it helped Dong-hyuk get <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/global/squid-game-creator-lost-nine-teeth-season-2-money-1236206385/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more money</a></span> (and lose less teeth), then job well done. See you back on the island.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A massive leak of Halo content that contains development tools, unreleased content, and dev builds has leaked online.</p>



<p>The content is said to date back all the way to 1998 at Bungie, when the developers had just released Myth II: Soulblighter and were working on Oni and Halo: Combat Evolved.</p>



<p>First reported by <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VISCERAL</a>, the leak contains around 90GB of data and is said to have leaked because 343 Industries hired a group of modders to try and restore cut content and data from the old games. This was known as the Digsite project, with some users familiar with the project, including one modder who had worked on the project, <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirming that the leak was genuine</a>.</p>



<p><em>As with all leaks of this nature, downloading them is at your own risk, and the files can be found on various social media platforms.</em></p>



<p>As for the Halo franchise today, 343 Industries renamed itself to Halo Studios in 2024 and continues developing the next Halo games. <span>As part of the announcement of its studio</span>‘s name change, the development also announced its games would be moving&nbsp;to Unreal Engine 5.</p>



<p>“If you really break Halo down, there have been two very distinct chapters. Chapter 1 – Bungie. Chapter 2 – 343 Industries,” studio head Pierre Hintze said. “Now, I think we have an audience which is hungry for more. So we’re not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of&nbsp;how&nbsp;we make Halo games. So, we start a new chapter today.”</p>

		<p>KUNOS Simulazioni has released a new video for Assetto Corsa Evo, which explains what players should expect when the game launches into Steam Early Access on January 16th. The video is hosted by Marco Massarutto, the studio’s Co-Founder and Executive Manager, who touches on subjects like the dynamic weather, the tracks, the cars, and the game modes.</p>

<p>When Assetto Corsa Evo releases into early access there will be 20 cars to choose from. From previous trailers some of the cars that have been shown include the Alfa Romeo Giulia GTA, Alpine A110, Alpine A290_β, Hyundai N Vision 74, Hyundai i20 N, Hyundai i30 N, Lamborghini Huracán STO, Mercedes-Benz 190E 2.5-16 Evolution II – specifically the 452nd of 500 road legal cars produced, Porsche 911 (930), and Porsche 911 GT3 Cup (992). The brands that have been confirmed for Assetto Corsa Evol are Abarth, Alfa Romeo, Alpine, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Ferrari, Ford, Honda, Hyundai, Lamborghini, Lancia, Lotus, Maserati, Mazda, Mercedes Benz, Mini, Morgan, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen.</p>
<p>Five tracks will be part of the first phase of Assetto Corsa Evo’s early access, on which you can drive the above cars on. Those tracks are Laguna Seca,&nbsp; Brands Hatch, Imola, Mount Panorama, and Suzuka Circuit. The open world side of the game, which is based in the Eifel region in Germany and includes the Nürburgring, is not due until the summer of 2025. This release will be done in stages instead of the whole map coming out in one go, allowing the team to expand and release content while addressing any issues that come up. The open world will include places where cars can be rented, and retailers that will sell upgrades.</p>
<p>The single player modes will include practice sessions, and the new Driving Academy mode. Driving Academy will let you learn each track using various cars, as well as having challenges to complete. There is also a time attack mode. As challenges are beat, licenses are unlocked while allows access to more cars. Assetto Corsa Evo has a new DirectX 12 graphics engine developed by Kunos specifically for racing games. This engine powers the dynamic weather system, which has everything from clear weather to storms. The lighting will also simulate real life with reflections and shadows being accurately generated to provide a real life look to race proceedings. The track conditions will be affected by wet weather and rubber build up, which in turn will impact how the cars perform. Players will notice better driving simulation too due to improved suspension, more realistic tyre behaviours, and how different parts of cars interact with each other in changing conditions.</p>

<p>Assetto Corsa EVO’s full release is scheduled for Autumn 2025, include 100 cars, 15 officially licensed race tracks, and the open world. More tracks will be added post full launch, and all of these will be free updates.</p>
