		<p>Who needs other people, eh? Sure they’re good for companionship, love and affection – and I suppose for a more effective Helldivers squad – but really, why not replace all that with a good old single player game? One that you can play on your own, whenever you like, and which won’t rely on anything other than your investment in it. OK, maybe I’m being flippant, but single player remains the bedrock of gaming, and after a number of years in the live service wilderness, they’re firmly at the forefront once more. 2024 has been a brilliant year for solo experiences, but one ran, bounced and boinged just that little bit harder than everyone else.</p>

<p>To call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> a love letter to gaming is to diminish its own creativity. Still, it is a missive filled with warmth and joy, not just for the PlayStation family and its beloved characters, but to the bountiful platforming abandon that’s normally a portly plumber’s remit. Just like Nintendo’s finest, Astro Bot is a repeated shot of delight that you will continue to down until you can’t possibly take any more, before finding room for just a little more.</p>
<p>Astro and his pals’ PS5-shaped spaceship is wrecked by some no-good aliens, leaving them strewn and stranded throughout the universe. Fortunately, our plucky hero sets out to rescue them within moments, leading to hour upon hour of platforming perfection.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> was a proof of concept to show off the PS5’s different abilities, Astro Bot takes that creativity and turns the dial way up, delivering you to tropical locales, sandy deserts and freezing tundras, where you fend off all manner of cute but deadly foes while encountering a new gameplay mechanic around every turn. It’s perky, cute and practically perfect in every way, and while you can share in its joy with other players, this is a classic singleplayer affair, making it a deserving winner of this year’s award.</p>

<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Atlus is renowned for the likes of Persona. When fourteen of the creative minds behind Persona left P-Studio to set up Studio Zero, it was obvious that whatever they made would be liquid gold. The first game they released is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>While Studio Zero is tasked with developing original IP and content unrelated to Persona, it’s fair to call their work Persona-like. Not only are there systems and mechanics that carry over, from the progression of time to the friendship simulator, and even the basics of combat, but there are some tremendous Easter Eggs that even the least eagle-eyed fans will spot.</p>
<p>Gameplay boils down to two things: a dungeon-crawling turn-based action RPG and a time management sim. The interplay between the two is very well built, offering huge flexibility in how you play the game. If you’re looking for a game you can easily sink 150 hours into, without getting bored of gameplay, you won’t go far wrong with Metaphor!</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Solitaire is basically&nbsp;<em>the</em> single player card game, and Balatro takes a healthy dose of influence from Solitaire in with its blend of Poker hands and an overarching roguelike structure. There’s no story here (outside of a slightly snarky Joker card commenting on your failure), just a pure, unadulterated tumble down a rabbit hole of Poker hands, modifiers and ever-growing scores to overcome.</p>

But this year, in 2024, we had to expand the list to 15. And we cut stuff from this list! What a bad, horrible year, huh? Anyway, here’s some of the worst, most awful, or just plain annoying gaming-related news from the past 12 months. Hopefully 2025 is better.</p></div></div><div><p>When the more powerful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span> was announced in September, it sparked a lot of controversy. Its $700 price point, and the reality of how much (or little) it would actually improve games, were the two big points of contenti0n. Still, if it did make most games look and run better, Sony would be able to mostly come away victorious. </p><p>Alas, that’s not been the case. While a lot of games do look better, there have also been games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Alan Wake II, </em>and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a></span>, that looked <em>worse </em>after receiving fancy PS5 Pro patches. Some of this has been fixed already, but it does seem like devs are still figuring out how to use the Pro’s upscaling tech, and that’s leading to some of these issues. Hopefully, in a few months, we won’t see games looking worse on PS5 Pro. That doesn’t change that all of this has soured any potential excitement around the prospect of the Pro, and probably damaged the console’s already shaky public image forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Generally, when something feels too good to be true, it’s because it isn’t going to last for much longer. That was very much the feeling around Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which made the launch of the Xbox Series X/S feel like such a great deal.  There was this extraordinary library, including day-one releases of Microsoft-published titles, to delve into for just ten bucks a month.</p><p>Over the years since, the prices have climbed, albeit at the same time as massive international financial issues were occurring following the covid pandemic. In 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048" target="_blank">Game Pass for console went up to $11</a></span>, while the Ultimate version that also got you access to PC games  went up two dollars to $16.99. Which still felt like a pretty decent deal, and despite talk of the increase coinciding with Microsoft’s outrageous purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, was actually a slightly below-inflation rise.</p><p>But then came 2024. I<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">n July, it was revealed that Game Pass Ultimate</a></span> was going up from $17 to $20, a whopping 18 percent increase, and now massively above inflation. But worse—far worse—Microsoft simultaneously killed off the more affordable $11 console-only tier. It was replaced with a new tier called Game Pass Standard, which would no longer include day-one game releases, and was priced at $15! Yup, an almost 50-percent price increase for a <em>far</em> worse version.</p><p>What this meant, really, is that the price of Game Pass—for anyone who was using it as a means to access the full library and play the day-one Microsoft games—went from $11 to $20 a month. And this time, with the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal having somehow gone through, it <em>really did</em> feel like it was a factor.</p><p>In 2024, Game Pass went from one of life’s great deals to one to somewhat resent, now a whopping $240 a year, with no discounted annual pricing. Which royally sucks. - John Walker</p></div></div><div><p>At the end of 2023, Rockstar Games ended a decade of waiting and released the first trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>. It quickly racked up millions of views and was pulled apart by every <em>GTA </em>YouTuber and outlet for as many details as possible. Now, it’s a year later and uh...well, Rockstar is radio silent on <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>Since December 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995">Rockstar has not released a single screenshot or teaser about its big 2025 <em>GTA </em>sequel. Nothing</a></span>! Fans held out hope that a new trailer would arrive at The Game Awards, but that was always unlikely as Rockstar rarely attends shows like that to show off its upcoming games. </p><p>So, we enter 2025 with no new trailer. Now the question for 2025 is: When does <em>GTA 6</em>'s trailer arrive, and will Rockstar’s big sequel make it out this year or get delayed like nearly every other one of its past games?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-recommend-id="image://d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1294" data-height="728" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Homer running away from a giant finger.

It’s now become the absolute norm that if you’re willing to fork out tens of dollars more for a game, you can be among the people to play it three days before everyone else. For…kudos? Playground fame? YouTube hits? It’s such a revoltingly cynical exploitation of FOMO. </p><p>Pre-orders have gone from offering a cheaper price in return for the risk of buying something that might not be worth getting, to a way to pay <em>far more</em> for something that might not be worth getting, for the reward of getting to find that out a few days early.

Over 14,600 people who make video games lost their jobs in the past 12 months. Things have become so bad that Geoff Keighley, the king of saying how good a year it’s been for video games even if it hasn’t been, had to acknowledge them on stage at The Game Awards.</p><p>The truth is, every year is a good year for video games themselves, but as corporate greed and poor business decisions become more and more prevalent every year, the people who make the  games we celebrate have suffered. As more institutional knowledge is lost to senseless job cuts, the games are going to suffer, too. It doesn’t have to be this way, but so long as corporate greed takes precedence over talent, this is the result. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-recommend-id="image://b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promo image of Borderlands.

			<p>The European gaming market didn't have a great year for sales. GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring revealed this tidbit during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-in-review-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GI Microcast show</a>, confirming that sales of new games went down by 29% compared to last year, as registered by GSD data.</p>
<p>2023 was always going to be a tough comparison. Last year saw the release of games like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Diablo IV, Mortal Kombat 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy XVI, just to name a few. 2024 just didn't have the same sheer triple-A power when it came to its schedule. Dring admitted as much in the podcast while also singling out two games that underperformed: Star Wars Outlaws and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>Sales of new games in 2024 versus new games in 2023, and let's remember 2023 was a big year for new games, were down 29%, almost a third, year-on-year. Next year's the return of big blockbuster new games, even from February when you've got that sort of triple threat of Assassin's Creed Shadows and Avowed (I know Av</em><em>owed isn't that big) and Monster Hunter Wilds all in the same window. And there's all the games that were announced during The Game Awards, there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Elden Ring coming out</a>, and there's a Grand Theft Auto, which obviously is the big thing. </em></p>
<p><em>There's a new Nintendo console, and there's gonna be loads and loads and loads of games next year, but I'm alarmed by this data because, despite the fact that there weren't a lot of major titles, the big Star Wars game of the year only got to number 45 in a year where there wasn't a lot of games coming out. </em><em>In terms of the traditional big blockbuster Christmas games, you had Call of Duty, which did well, and you had Dragon Age, which did not. That is disappointing, though, that position. T</em><em>hat was it. Dragon Age&nbsp;had the market to itself and it couldn't find an audience, and that really is scary as we move into the following year.</em></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ranked #14 and #19, respectively, when it comes to the new games European chart. But switching to the full chart that also includes games released in previous years, they drop to #45 and #68. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> is similar in that it ranked in the ninth place among new games but only #34 overall. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, which was the twelfth best-selling new game of 2024 but only ranked #43 in the global chart.</p>
<p>Only five new games performed at least decently this year in Europe: Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO (#13), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> (#12), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> (#6), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (#3). Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 25 dominated European sales in 2024.</p>

And that’s really depressing to think about considering how bad 2023 was for game developers and the media covering the industry. Still, even a shitty year can have nice moments and wonderful surprises.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-alan-wake-musical-unions-peaches-blade-1851116121">So as we have done before</a></span>, let’s highlight some of the best video game-related surprises in 2024. The stuff that keeps us going. That makes a terrible, horrible year a bit more manageable. I’m not saying a great game coming out of nowhere or a cool announcement happening can fix anything, but it can at least distract us from all the bad news out there. And that’s something, I think.</p></div></div><div><p>It’s hard to remember a time before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>, but it did exist.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The wait for <em>Elden Ring</em> was long and led to a lot of people desperately awaiting any news or teases at every video game show and event. For about three years, after its 2019 announcement, people waited and waited until 2022 finally came along and let them play <em>Elden Ring.</em> I think most assumed a similar wait would follow for a sequel, but instead, a<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-multiplayer-release-date-trailer-1851720335"> spin-off co-op sequel was announced in December</a></span> and will be out in 2025. Nice!</p></div><div><p>While you always hope a new video game will be good, sometimes it’s hard not to get nervous or cynical. That was the case with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>ahead of its December release. </p><p>While I wanted the game to be great, I was nervous. How would a first-person <em>Indiana Jones </em>game work? I wasn’t sure. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174">Then I (and others) played <em>Great Circle</em></a></span><em> </em>and discovered a really special game that plays more like <em>Dishonored </em>or <em>Hitman </em>than<em> Call of Duty</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>.

After the series made a hard pivot away from its ensemble cast to focus mostly on Sonic and his inner circle, Shadow had become a bit player in most games. Seeing Sega do right by him and make such a grand spectacle of it was easily one of the biggest surprises for <em>Sonic </em>fans this year. And hey, it looks like he’ll be part of the live-action movies in the future as well, so Sega can’t just abandon him again. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-recommend-id="image://6d3c559643b3ad87a747f7b9c9d0acfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows John Marston from RDR.

And the people celebrated.</p><p>As time went on, the store shifted to selling more modern games alongside classics, and dropped the name in favor of its acronym, GOG.

<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-datamine-leak-loot-box-scrapped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871169815278195163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has provided information about Marvel Rivals’ cancelled loot boxes, such as the rarities, animations, icons and more. The loot boxes would’ve been divided across four tiers: Gray, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and Red. Grey would’ve been the least rare, providing potentially a recolour of the skin, and Red would be the rarest of the lot, where all the premium cosmetics can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To acquire these loot boxes, players would have to “convert Lattice and Units into Crystallization (main currency) and Marscoin (blue currency), which can then be used to pull for skins.” Besides a new skin, these boxes might’ve also included rewards like emotes, player cards, sprays and more. Moreover, the files revealed that the loot box system is time-bound and potentially connected to a special limited-time event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, RivalsLeaks has clarified that they could be wrong about Marvel Rivals loot boxes, as they are only going by the information they can dig up from the files. In the same thread, the original poster also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871178424016105934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they had been told that the loot boxes “might be crapped, but who knows, maybe one day they might get added?”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals celebrated reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 million players with a free reward</a>. Also, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-skins-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free skins</a> in the game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-multiplayer-game.1068570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/24/game-of-the-year-2024-best-multiplayer-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If 2024 has shown us anything, it’s that the multiplayer live service boom is well and truly over. Despite being objectively fun to play and super polished, games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">Suicide Squad</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> failed to make a splash – the latter being dead on arrival in one of the biggest gaming flops ever. It casts a grim shadow over the wider multiplayer genre, proving that there’s really only room for a handful of majorly successful online games at one time.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there weren’t any great multiplayer games in 2024, though. While legions of gamers are still glued to Fortnite, Warzone, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends, there have been some hot new contenders, one of them arriving at the start of the year…</p>

<p>Playing big, bombastic shooters with friends is always more fun, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> is the kind of game to remind you that these can also be silly and just funny as well. It takes the satire and violence of Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and adds in a bit of player-led workplace comedy. Sure, it’s fun to call in a huge orbital barrage or minefield on a bug’s nest, but it’s <em>funny</em> to do that five seconds after your team has just rushed in and “forget” to call it out in time.</p>
<p>Arrowhead has always made fun and silly co-op games where the fire is always friendly, and explosions are always excessive, but the jump from the top-down action of the original to a third person view with more realistic graphics just managed to capture the attention of gamers at large. Add to that an engaging meta layer to the game, actively engaging with the community through highs and lows of balance and gameplay changes, and the recent reveal of a new enemy faction, and this is easily the best multiplayer game of the year.</p>

<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Through the last generation, it’s felt as though couldn’t so much as blink without a new Warhammer 40,000 game being announced, resulting in a never-ending slew of PC and mobile titles. With 40K having witnessed a huge spike in popularity over the past few years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> arrived at the perfect time, with Boltgun and Chainsword in-hand.</p>
<p>What made the sequel such a strong offering was its pairing of a solid campaign with a whole suite of multiplayer options, allowing friends to play through the story together, duke it out in PvP, or run a gauntlet of missions designed for co-op play. There’s a lot of shared DNA with Saber Interactive’s brilliant World War Z video game, enhanced with dynamic melee combat and a heavily expanded arsenal of weaponry plucked from the 41st millennium.</p>
<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Last year’s Call of Duty wasn’t the flawless end to Infinity Ward’s Modern Warfare trilogy fans had hoped for: it was by no means poor but felt more like a DLC expansion as opposed to a full-blown sequel. Going into 2025, it seemed as though the next Call of Duty would be even further entrenched in a lack of innovation and growing player fatigue. We were wrong to doubt Treyarch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> is the full package: the best CoD campaign in many years, rewardingly layered Zombies co-op, and punchy, tactical online play. On paper it’s a subtle change yet the inclusion of “omnidirectional” player movement adds a silky smoothness that elevates each part of Treyarch’s trifecta. It’s hard to imagine this feature being dropped in future instalments.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst.1068522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Nintendo will have been watching the recent stream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> design leaks and is likely now keen to unveil its under-wraps new console as soon as possible, an analyst has said.
</p>
<p>
We've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's now widely expected that Switch 2 will simply look like a slightly larger Switch 1, now with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
So, when will Nintendo finally unveil Switch 2? In early November, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the company had now run out of time to reveal its Switch successor in 2024</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has set itself a deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor, but, considering the leaks, and the falling sales of Switch 1, Toto suggested to Eurogamer today that the company was unlikely to wait that long. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense," Toto said. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. 
</p>
<p>
"It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is widely expected to arrive later in 2025, and while Nintendo is yet to offer any suggestion of timing, we don't have too long now to wait and find out.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware. Nintendo has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible</a>.

Want something more chilled? Dire, Dire Docks is an absolute banger. You also have two versions of Piranha Plant's Lullaby to choose from.</p>
<p>Of course, the game's best theme is "Slider" - what you'll know best as Princess Peach's Slide. And yes, you can extend this track up to an hour in length.

            <p>
As more characters join the Sonic the Hedgehog movie series, fans have been curious when their favourite big cat - Big the Cat - will pop up.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">IGN</a> alongside the launch of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>, the movie series' writing duo Pat Casey and Josh Miller revealed a Big the Cat cameo had actually been written for the previous film - only to be left on the cutting room floor.
</p>
<p>
(There's no spoilers here for the new movie, we should add.)
</p>
<p>
In <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-the-hedgehog-2">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>, Big the Cat would have popped up in skeletal form as Sonic passed through a cave. Within it, viewers would have gotten a quick glimpse at Big's decomposed body. Dark. 
</p>
<p>
Still, confusingly, this might not have been the Big the Cat fans know and love, the duo continued - which perhaps is why the sequence never made it on screen.
</p>
<p>
"In one draft of Sonic 2, when they're going through the snowy mountains to the cave, we had a bit, because Sonic 2 was sort of an Indiana Jones," Casey said. 
</p>
<p>
"Indiana Jones, it's a trope that at some point a skeleton pops out at you and scares you. So we were going to do that, but with a skeleton of a, I would say, a Big the Cat, not necessarily-"
</p>
<p>
"Not necessarily the Big the Cat," Miller interjected.
</p>
<p>
"But we ended up cutting it," Casey concluded. "It didn't make any sense."
</p>
<p>
So, no Big the Cat. But on the upside, for fans of the character, no dead Big the Cat either. 
</p>
<p>
Fans have previously celebrated whenever Big has popped up over the years - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-frontiers-three-minute-explainer-video-is-probably-how-sega-should-have-started">Sonic Frontiers</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/big-the-cat-is-in-team-sonic-racing">Sonic Racing</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-sonic-prime-animated-series-gets-december-release-date">Sonic Prime</a> and even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/knuckles-shadow-and-big-the-cat-shown-in-sonics-lego-dimensions-level">Lego Dimensions</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Sega and Paramount more closely align game and film worlds for an authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool," Ed wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Eurogamer's Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth Wukong, Game Science’s latest action RPG, is the latest title to receive a knock-off on the Nintendo e-shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Black Myth Wukong knock-off on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wukong-sun-black-legend-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo eShop</a> is titled “Wukong Sun: Black Legend,” which couldn’t be more obvious. The title will be released on December 26, 2024, for the Nintendo Switch and can be purchased for $7.99. Even the cover art is heavily inspired by the cover art used by Game Science for their game. For those wondering, Black Myth Wukong wasn’t released for the Switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It gets worse when you read the description for the Black Myth Wukong knock-off, as it states the following:&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic Journey to the West in Wukong Sun: Black Legend! Step into the role of the immortal Wukong, the legendary Monkey King, as he battles through a chaotic world teeming with powerful monsters and untold dangers. Explore a story inspired by Chinese mythology, filled with action-packed battles, stunning environments, and legendary foes.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, the gameplay for this Black Myth Wukong clone is miles apart from the original title. From the screenshots on the store page, it seems like Wukong Sun: Black Legend is a 2D, side-scrolling game where you fight various enemies and bosses in four different biomes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clones and knocks-offs are not new in the gaming world; whenever any title goes viral, we see copies of that game floating around different stores. Last year, we saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a clone of The Last of Us</a> appear on the Nintendo eShop, too, and just this month, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rip-off of Gary Zone Warfare</a> was seen on the PlayStation Store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Science CEO recently revealed his views</a> on Black Myth Wukong not winning GOTY. Also, the title helped push <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/china-gaming-industry-black-myth-wukong-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">China’s gaming industry to new heights</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-shooter-of-2024-best-fps-tps-games-this-year/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-shooter-of-2024%E2%80%94best-fps-tps-games-this-year.1068486/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-shooter-of-2024-best-fps-tps-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This year has been wild for shooters, with bullets ricocheting all over the place and in different ways. So let’s give you a guide to Insider Gaming’s 2024 best shooter of the year, across FPS and TPS games.</p>



<p>Choosing the best shooter of 2024 boils down to several key aspects: Gunplay, Story, Sound Design, and how much we rage when we play it—maybe not the last one. It’s easy to whip up a few levels or maps, stick some enemies in it, and declare it a shooter, but at the core of the genre is so much more than this.</p>



<p>A shooter needs to hit all the senses: It should look good, and feel good, and the intense sound of whirring bullets should instill uneasiness due to realism and authenticity. Every game I’m about to discuss for Insider Gaming’s best shooter of 2024 award hits this in droves, but only one can be king of the hill.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooter-of-2024-winner-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Best Shooter of 2024 Winner — Call of Duty Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Plenty of stopping power this time around. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> does what few CoD titles have done in recent years—innovates. Once you’ve dived (literally) into omnidirectional movement, it’s <em>impossible</em> to go back. Your Operator glides around with a buttery smoothness I’ve craved for so long and you quickly wonder where it’s been all this time. </p>



<p>The campaign is juicy and jaunty and features one of the most intense and exciting story missions in years. Zombies is back and better than ever, with a bundle of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wonder-weapons-in-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Weapons</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-super-hero-easter-egg-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Easter Eggs</a>, and everything you could want from the undead merry-go-round of round-based Zombies. Finally, the multiplayer brings back the classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-level-is-prestige-1-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prestige System</a> we love so much, makes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mastery Camo</a> grind the simplest and most accessible it’s ever been, and outside of the usual bugs, it looks to be a great year ahead.</p>



<p>The sheer mention of a new Call of Duty title is enough to give many players the ick. However, Black Ops 6 shouldn’t as it’s a fantastic entry, and I would argue it rejuvenates the long-running first-person shooter series for the first time in a long time. CoD has been in the doldrums for several years now with the lackluster (and recycled) Modern Warfare 3 feeling low-effort, Modern Warfare 2 feeling like a solid entry, and nothing more, and a dependable but forgettable Vanguard. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 is the best iteration since Black Ops Cold War—also made by Treyarch and Raven Software—and I stand by this. It’s not a perfect Call of Duty, and very few are, but it’s the complete package we’re looking for in a shooter, and Black Ops 6 deserves the best shooter of 2024 recognition.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-shooters-of-2024-nominations">Best Shooters of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>We feel Black Ops 6 rightfully took the top spot. However, it might pique your interest to know who else we had up our sleeves for the best shooter of 2024 category. Everything is subjective at the end of the day, so let’s see if your favorite shooter was among our honorable mentions.</p>



<h3 id="h-xdefiant">XDefiant</h3>



<figure><figcaption>It was onto something. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ubisoft’s XDefiant started the year as one of the most hyped titles of 2024—dubbed the “Call of Duty killer.” It does a lot of what FPS fans are asking for: Gets rid of SBMM, actively listens to and acts on player feedback, tracks XP properly, and tries to avoid bugs. Fast forward to the end of the year, and suddenly years of development are up in smoke as Ubisoft announces <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant is shutting down</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s take nothing away from XDefiant though. I loved my time with it, and it possesses some of the snappiest and most engaging shooting mechanics from a newcomer in years. However, it still doesn’t feel like a massive step away from CoD, and its hero abilities and microtransactions were too much for many in the community—possibly contributing to the FPS title’s quick downfall.</p>



<h3 id="h-stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl</h3>



<figure><figcaption>As eerie as ever. Credit to GSC Game World</figcaption></figure>



<p>Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl is one of two single-player-focused nominations in this category. We head into the Zone to uncover the mystery behind anomalies, and artifacts, and do our best to survive. Ukraine’s radiation-plagued world is a magnificent, mysterious, and mortifying world, unfortunately, marred by questions about its quality. </p>



<p>If you read almost any <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2 Heart of Chornobyl review</a>, one theme is prevalent throughout—technical issues and bugs. Stalker 2 seems to be in a better state post-launch compared to its hampered debut; nevertheless, we need to stamp out giving games free passes with the allure of fixing them later. That being said, Stalker 2 is the perfect example of how shooters can be original, why single-player titles are needed, and not everything needs to be online multiplayer with live-service elements.</p>



<h3 id="h-helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Buggy, in a different way. Credit to Arrowhead Game Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>The biggest surprise hit of 2024 easily goes to Arrowhead Game Studios and Helldivers 2. A live-service shooter not immediately sentenced to purgatory like some of its other contemporaries around the same time—<em>you </em>were thinking Suicide Squad, I said it. You’re tasked with saving and protecting Super Earth using an array of weapons and fun Strategems that can either scurry a turret to your location or drop a devastating bomb and kill everyone.</p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was a huge success <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-12-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling 12 million units in 12 weeks</a>, but its reputation was soured somewhat by the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/negative-helldivers-2-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Account controversy</a>. This isn’t why we didn’t give the win to Helldivers 2 though; it gets a ton of credit for its world-building and marketing, and rightly so. But the gameplay itself can get repetitive—even with friends—and the thrill of annihilating Automatons feels like it has an expiry date. Still, plenty to build on here for Helldivers 3, and it’s great to see a new multiplayer game smash it.</p>



<h3 id="h-warhammer-40-000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Classic gameplay. Credit to Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>My goodness, I miss single-player-driven shooters. Like Stalker 2, the main emphasis for Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is its story, dramatic events, riveting visuals, and epic battles. As an almighty Space Marine with unreal strength and combat abilities, you tussle with Tyranids&nbsp;throughout a several-hour-long campaign. This is one sticking point for Space Marine 2—its campaign length—but it has plenty of replayability, and I understand the comparison to Black Ops 6’s story length.</p>



<p>Space Marine 2 compares favorably to the over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter style of fan favorites like Gears of War. It’s somewhat of a niche by today’s standards, and I’m keen to see more of this. Overall, a minor lack of originality and a less-than-stellar multiplayer component edge Warhammer’s newest shooter out of the top spot.</p>

Given that Stardew was somehow my most-played game on Steam and Nintendo Switch, I have to agree that "Masterpiece" is a fair assessment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>More Cozy Games Under $10:</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Cozy Grove, which I feel is more like Animal Crossing than Stardew, is on sale for under $5. If you're the type of person who enjoys organizing, I'd recommend Unpacking, while Spiritfarer brings the management game genre to the afterlife. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>DOOM Eternal for $10</strong></h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213719"><div id="213719" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>DOOM Eternal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The DOOM series was pretty foundational to the FPS genre, and one of the best DOOM games of the modern era has dropped to under $10. In IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">9/10 DOOM Eternal review</a>, Ryan McCaffrey highlights the game's satisfying difficulty: "This excellent refinement of the already outstanding 2016 reboot makes you an unspoken deal: if you can keep up with it, it will keep up with you."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More FPS Games Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For more single-player shooting, you can get six Halo games for $10 with The Master Chief Collection. Multiplayer shooters like Siege and Battlefield 2042 are also under $10 for the time being. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">50% Off Hollow Knight </h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213729"><div id="213729" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hollow Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight is one of the most rewarding gaming experiences I've had, and also the closest I've come to throwing my Switch at the wall in frustration (that's a positive, by the way). Per IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/06/22/hollow-knight-review">9/10 review</a>: "The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it." Now you can find out why there's always a chorus of comments begging for a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-gameplay-trailer-news">Silksong</a> release date for just $8. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Platformers Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Hollow Knight, Celeste doesn't shy away from challenging the player, and additional "B-sides" for every level up the ante for even platforming veterans. I recommend Little Nightmares to any horror fan, while the 2020 Ori sequel offers particularly creative puzzles. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Civilization VI for $2.99</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213739"><div id="213739" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sid Meier’s Civilization VI</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Civ VII</a> set to release in just a couple of months, most of the Sid Meier franchise is on sale. While I prefer Civ V's map mechanics, Civ VI, in my experience, is better optimized for setting up multiplayer lobbies. Convince your friends to drop a couple of bucks, and you can all lock into an empire-building marathon that will most likely end in some form of betrayal. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>More Strategy and Simulation Games Under $10: </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Most Total War games and DLCs are discounted, though one of the best deals is the Warhammer base game for $6. And if you've ever wanted to travel across the entirety of Europe for $5, now you can (with Euro Truck Simulator 2). </p><h2 data-cy="title2">75% Off Overcooked 2</h2></div><div catalogid="0d0168fb-49ee-4fb7-81a7-b2b2faa2eb5f" id="213745"><div id="213745" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Overcooked 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something cheap you can convince your friends to pick up and play with you, look no further than Overcooked 2. The cooperative cooking game allows up to four players to hop into a campaign that, with arcade-style levels and goofy physics, will probably lead to some screaming. But, as IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/07/overcooked-2-review">Overcooked 2 review</a> describes, this "frantic and inventive co-op game... manages to turn frustration into charm."</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Co-op Games Under $10: </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">For larger groups, I also recommend For the King and Castle Crashers. It Takes Two is one of the best games for two-player co-op, and only one person has to buy the game courtesy of Hazelight Studio's "<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2995920/It_Takes_Two_Friends_Pass/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friend's Pass</a>." And, of course, Portal 2, down to just $2, will always be a co-op classic. </p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 23, 2024 10:37 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the short term, this means there will be fewer blogs on the site as we rest and recuperate for the next couple weeks. But! We’ll still be running stories here and there.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, we’d like to thank all of you for the incredible support you’ve shown this past year. Aftermath – and the many fun, interesting, and occasionally indulgent pieces we’ve been able to write – wouldn’t exist without you. Independence is empowering but also terrifying; there’s no institutional safety net to catch us when we fall (and then unceremoniously lay us off about it). By subscribing, you’ve provided us with assurance that you, our readers, have our backs and value what we do. We plan to continue making it worth your while. We’ve got big plans for next year, and we hope you’re as excited as we are to see what’s to come.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, though, if you need some holiday reading – or if you’re just joining us, as many of you did during our anniversary sale last month – here are some of our greatest hits:</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/how-a-leftist-meme-account-accidentally-fooled-everyone-into-believing-a-famous-quote-came-from-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How A Leftist Meme Account Accidentally Fooled Everyone Into Believing A Famous Quote Came From Final Fantasy</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/making-a-skating-game-set-in-palestine-has-become-an-act-of-resistance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Making A Skating Game Set In Palestine Has Become An Act Of Resistance</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/its-exhausting-trying-to-read-video-game-website-headlines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It's Exhausting To Read Video Game Website Headlines</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/the-worlds-best-stereo-system-what-happened-ken-fritz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What Happened To “The World’s Best Stereo System?”</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/dry-january-sober-curious" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You Could Just Keep Doing Dry January</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Journalism: An FAQ</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Why So Many Games Journalists End Up Going Into Game Development&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-vii-fandom-parasocial-heartbreak" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Very Dumb Reason Why I Can’t Play Final Fantasy VII</a></p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nobody Needs To Know How Many People Are Playing A Singleplayer Video Game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-best-sellers-of-2024-revealed-apex-legends-elden-ring-baldurs-gate-3-on-top/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This year saw a lot of majorly successful games on Steam, with the best sellers being revealed based on total gross revenue earned in 2024. Although these are the top-selling games, the revenue for the titles hasn't been revealed, and they are separated into categories. If you want to see what games are in each category, you can check out the official list on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/bestof2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam page</a>. The categories are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platinum: 1st-12th</li>
<li>Gold 13th-24th</li>
<li>Silver 25th-50th</li>
<li>Bronze 51st-100th</li>
</ul>
<p>As there are a lot of games, we won't be discussing every single one that has made it onto the top charts. There are also sub-categories into which the games are organized. On the Steam page, you'll see there are categories for Top Sellers, New Releases, Most Played, Steam Deck, Controller, and VR. This allows you to see what statistics they are measured by, which includes top concurrent players as well as top-grossing revenue for the year.</p>
<p>In the platinum category for top-grossing revenue, live-service games like Apex Legends and Counter-Strike 2 continue to be on top, alongside games like PUBG Battlegrounds and Destiny 2. When it comes to premium titles, it's no surprise that award-winning titles like Black Myth: Wukong, Baldur's Gate 3, and Elden Ring are on the list. This year saw Black Myth: Wukong win <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">multiple awards</a> at various ceremonies, with Shadow of the Erdtree raking in a couple, too. Despite being released last year, Baldur's Gate 3 continues to be majorly successful, and Larian Studios is dedicated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">providing consistent updates</a> and new content for players to dive into.</p>
<p>Looking specifically at the New Releases category, titles like Path of Exile II, Heldivers 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and, of course, Black Myth: Wukong are all in the platinum category. When it comes to how they decide which games go into the platinum category, they look at the first two weeks of the game's revenue after its released, and that is the deciding factor as to which game is best-selling and is deserving of being in the platinum category.</p>
<p>When it comes to peak concurrent players, most of the games are live-service titles that have been out for a while. Specifically, the top-played games with over 450,000 peak players are in the category, which consists of games like Apex Legends, Counter-Strike 2, and the newly released title Marvel Rivals. However, there are some premium games on there, such as Helldivers 2, Black Myth: Wukong, and Elden Ring.</p>
<p>While 2024 has felt like a bit of a quieter year for gaming, there have been some majorly successful releases, with some of them going on to win multiple awards.</p>
<p>What has been your top game of 2024?</p>
