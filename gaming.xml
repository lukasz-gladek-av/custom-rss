The hardware is encased in a puzzle box inspired by the game, and fans are invited to attempt to solve it.</p><p>Solve the puzzle to enter the sweepstakes and the console and controller can be yours along with other prizes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-washington-state-is-doing-to-juice-local-game-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers are probably familiar with "country pavilions" at events like Gamescom and Game Developers Conference. They're areas organized by region-affiliated trade groups or governments that shine a light on game development in their regions—both to help games from those areas find an audience, and to convince investors and studios to open up shop in their area.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Gamescom 2024's country pavilion was a nearly overwhelming sight this year, with China, Australia, the United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Indonesia, Estonia, The Philippines, and other countries represented with booths large and small, each filled with developers demoing their games, pitching to investors, or soliciting the press.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One country was not represented: The United States. Or...was it? One solitary booth from the land of the red, white, and blue stood tall, though ironically, it was painted a more emerald green.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's because the pavilion belonged to the Washington State Department of Commerce, and it was staffed by creative economy development director Shannon Roche Halberstadt. A veteran of the Recording Industry Association of America, Halberstadt explained to Game Developer that she took the role with the Washington State government to help support game development in the state, already home to Valve, Microsoft, Nintendo of America, and a slew of triple-A game studios.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With companies like those already ruling the roost, why exactly would the state government trek all the way out to Germany to showcase the state? Halberstadt told Game Developer it's part of a project not just to attract new companies to the region but to support local studios...and keep them from decamping for new pastures.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Keeping developers in Washington despite the high cost of living">Keeping developers in Washington despite the high cost of living</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our conversation with Halberstadt comes at a time when&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">atrociously high development costs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in the United States are sending publishers and investors scurrying to parts of the world where lower costs of living drive cheaper salaries and, thus, cheaper budgets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, when you think "high salaries" in the United States, Washington State definitely lands on the list. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/cost-of-living-by-state/">A 2024 analysis by Forbes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> put it as the state with the eighth-highest cost of living in the nation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Salaries in the Seattle and Redmond areas are dragged upward by the presence of Microsoft and Amazon, but developers there also have to contend with brutal housing costs that only go down when you head south to Olympia or Tacoma or across the water to Bremerton or Poulsbo.

"It's a really great place," she said. "You're around all these other companies. You're gonna have peers, you're gonna have people who are already in the industry. You'll be able to access support services. You'll be able to access networking and meetups...that community actually is a really important thing."</span></p><p>Image via Adobe Stock.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Department of Commerce can't tackle high housing costs on its own (Halberstadt deferred to the legislature on that topic), but she said there are other levers it's pulling to boost development in the region.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Funding from the state itself for startups and indies isn't likely to come any time soon, but she said part of her journey to Gamescom was to research how other countries support developers. She also wants the State to look into incentives like those for the aerospace or agriculture industries.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her primary concern however has to do with getting smaller studios in front of investors and publishers. It's another reason she came to Gamescom—she gestured to a table behind her, where game studio One More Game was showing off </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790700/SWAPMEAT/">SWAPMEAT</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The game had picked up the "Creative Overload" award at the Devcom Indie Showcase just the night before, something that couldn't have happened unless the Department of Commerce had brought them to the event.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because of that award, they said, they were getting meetings with interested parties they wouldn't get at home.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though Halberstadt is new to the games business, she seemed up to speed on how traditional business development loans don't work well for game studios. "Game studios have a really difficult time accessing traditional financial products because the arc to product creation is so long," she said. "The financials don't work out for a bank down the street that's doing an SBA loan. It makes it really difficult." Her hope is that Washington's government can work with financial entities to incentivize loans that support game studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the state's game development economy is already self-sustaining, why does Halberstadt need to get involved at all? "You invest in water where the grass is green to keep it green," she said. "If you're not investing and you're not creating a space to develop new talent...the industry can go other places."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She gestured to the trade floor, where dozens of countries were eagerly pitching themselves as places for studios to land.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Video games can help artists earn a living">Video games can help artists earn a living</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned before, Halberstadt came out of the music industry, previously working at the RIAA.

            <p>
With Stalker 2's November release looming, anyone looking to acquaint (or reacquaint) themselves with the series' acclaimed post-apocalyptic horror action ahead of its arrival will soon be able to do so on the go, with the original Stalker trilogy now set for a Switch release on 31st October - a little earlier than developer GSC Game World had initially announced.
</p>
<p>
Stalker comes to Switch with a choice of purchasing options. First, there's the Legends of the Zone bundle that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-makes-its-way-to-xbox">launched for Xbox Series X/S and PS5</a> earlier this year, packaging together 2007's Shadow of Chernobyl, 2008's Clear Sky, and 2009's Call of Pripyat. That'll set you back £32.99/39.99 EUR/39.99 USD, but players looking for a slightly less concentrated dose of Stalker can alternatively buy each game individually, for £15.99/19.99 EUR/19.99 USD apiece.
</p>
<p>
All three games whisk players to an alternate version of the real-word Chornobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine, which - thanks to a second nuclear disaster in 2006 - has become rife with mutants and anomalies, tempting adventures known as Stalkers to enter its boundaries. The series' acclaimed mix of bleak FPS survival horror and RPG elements should all be present and correct on Switch, with GSC Game World also promising some platform-specific features.

<p>
The Stalker trilogy on Switch (developed in collaboration with Mataboo) promises to be "fully optimised" with "refined visuals", and will include an "adapted shooting system" with gyro aiming, touch interface an controls, plus full handheld and TV mode support.
</p>
<p>
As for the eagerly awaited Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, that <em>isn't</em> coming to Switch, but it's due to launch for Xbox Series X/S and PC on 20th November this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-dev-diary-explains-hunting-and-feeding-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Chinese Room has released a <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/dev-diary-hunting-and-feeding" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new dev diary</a> that discusses more details about<a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-now-been-delayed-launching-by-first-half-of-2025/"> the upcoming title</a> Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2. This dev diary is the 19th dev diary that the team has released, and this one, in particular, dives into hunting and feeding in both combat scenarios and social scenarios. Both are possible as you roam the streets of Seattle. For this game, they've made sure to make feeding a fundamental part of the player's actions and strategies. "You'll be doing a lot of it- Phyre's a little-and-often kinda drinker; that helps keep the beast in check," says Senior Game Designer Max Bottomley. He goes on to explain how feeding is used throughout the game, and that feeding is predominantly used as a main source of healing, as well as being able to utilize discipline abilities.</p>
<p>While feeding in the game is very important, it's also a huge undertaking to ensure that you do it without being spotted. Getting spotted is a Masquerade violation, with more aggressive characters unwilling to let you feed without being attacked. As a result, it's important to isolate targets. "Feeding in the swing of combat is risky, but not impossible- if you're mindful of which direction you start a feed from, for example, your victim can help soak up a lot of gunfire for you!" says Bottomley.</p>
<p>The dev diary also explains the difficulties of trying to make feeding look good from a first-person perspective in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, "It doesn't really show you much at best and looks silly at worst, but a simple cut in and out of third-person can also be disorienting and feel a bit disconnected." Because of this, The Chinese Room decided to utilize both third—or first-person perspectives for feeding, allowing for cinematic action and continuity of motion.</p>
<p>The dev diary also discusses hunting in detail and Phyre's ability to use Heightened Senses, which enhances her sense of smell, allowing her to see, smell, and hear enemies. This also comes with a visual notification, and players are able to stalk their enemies via the scent of blood in the air.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Part of hunting and feeding in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is the Blood Resonance Events. While roaming the streets of Seattle, players will be able to track and hunt down NPCs that can become fully resonated using a specific type of blood to feed on. Once they are found, players can charm, fear, or anger to bend them to their will.&nbsp; These events are 'social feeding.' "Social feeding is a key part of the players' time in our Seattle and revolves around influencing the NPCs in certain ways- maybe you'll stumble upon someone angry that the ATM has stolen their card, and you can take that anger and feed on it," says Gavin Hood, the Project Lead Game Designer.</p>
<p>There are three more dev diaries listed to be upcoming, each discussing more details of the game, including the Blood Resonance events and fashion. The topic of the third diary will be announced at a later date.</p>

Now through 12:59AM ET on October 10th, you can save an extra 20 percent on top of Woot’s already-discounted codes when you use promo code <strong>SAVE20</strong> at checkout.

Plus, unlike the 13-month limit associated with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241171/xbox-game-pass-standard-launch-pricing">Xbox Game Pass Standard</a>, you can stack up to 36 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>On top of the hundreds of other games constantly rotating in and out of the Game Pass library, Ultimate provides access to a growing list of full games and trials via EA Play. You’ll also get access to online multiplayer, exclusive deals, and in-game perks as part of the subscription. You don’t even necessarily need an Xbox console. Xbox Cloud Gaming lets you play on tablets, smartphones, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">streaming devices like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick 4K Max</a> — which is also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/dp/B0BP9SNVH9?tag=theverge02-20">on sale at Amazon</a> for $34.99 ($25 off) right now as part of Prime Big Deal Days.</p><div><p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including new first-party releases on day one, which you can play on multiple devices. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p></div><p>Whether the price increase is justified is a moot debate while these discounted codes are still available, but note that Microsoft seems to be upping the ante with its offering. For example, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be the first game in its series to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass">hit Game Pass on day one</a>. </p><p>It joins a score of other first-party and even some third-party games that Microsoft will give similar treatment to after a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">string</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889421/microsoft-acquires-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty-warcraft-king-gaming-buy-news-reports/archives/3">studio acquisitions</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/plucky-squire-pc-switch-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently sat down to play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> because I'd heard it was like <em>Zelda</em>, and I like <em>Zelda</em>. I didn't know it also had <em>special powers</em>.</p><p>Having not really seen much about the game outside of seemingly everyone I know and respect on social media saying how incredible it is, I was mere seconds into it before I found myself smiling at the clean, childish art style that, well, is the stuff of storybooks.</p><p>A few minutes later, when it became clear I was literally playing <em>through </em>a storybook, that smile grew even wider. The pages were turning as I moved across map tiles, there was a kind old British man narrating proceedings, and before long I was whispering "oh that's lovely" out loud.</p><p>Then, oh, another trick! We can interact with the story as it's written on the page! The bad guy of the tale has fucked with the pages and some of the text laid across the map isn't describing events, it's been switched up to block them, so you need to complete puzzles in the world (book?) that involve moving the text--and you're in the book, so the text can just be picked up--around to fix the sentences, which changes what they're describing, which <em>then </em>changes the world itself. Seeing this for the first time I am not just smiling or whispering, I'm looking at my cat and saying "oh this rules", to which she replies "mew" (yes, it does).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Plucky Squire | Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJSMqtG0Kcs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>By the time <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is pulling its biggest party trick--leaping<a href="https://youtu.be/0DBGXN48tV4?t=177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> out of the pages of the book and into the real world</a>, which presents a whole new axis of movement and a fresh set of puzzle possibilities--I was sitting bolt upright in my chair saying, quite loudly now, "ahhhh wow this is <em>great</em>".</p><p>As you can hopefully tell by now, <em>The Plucky Squire</em> is a game that made me <em>feel something</em>. I can talk about it as a game if you want, review-style, about how it's a cute little <em>Zelda</em>-like, about how it's got some interesting puzzles and a neat twist and some lovely voice acting. I could spend a surprising amount of time gushing about the little hand cursor you control in the main menu, which is pointing while you point, but once you click/press a button it stops pointing and gives a thumbs up.</p><p>But I'd rather just talk around this game, about how it's just pure joy. Playing it makes me smile, and laugh, and through its setting is able to deliver both the best of video games and the best of children's books at the same time. It's not that I feel like a child while playing it, there's a certain distance and reverence in its tone that requires you to have grown up already to appreciate it, but there's absolutely an echo, a child-like feeling of happiness--pure, warm, reassuring--to be found on each page.</p><p>Every time I play <em>The Plucky Squire</em> (which I haven't finished yet) brings a nice little surprise: maybe some fights, maybe a scroll with some unlockable art I can enjoy later, maybe some funny dialogue. It doesn't matter what it is, really; it's <em>all </em>good.It's also pretty short,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-perfect-length" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but as we've established recently</a>, that's fine. A game knowing its limits is a good video game, and one that's able to make a grown man smile like an excited young child is a <em>very </em>good video game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                <p dir="ltr">In late July, Humble Games--the publishing arm of the Humble Bundle digital storefront--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">laid off the entirety of its staff</a> in a surprising move that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/humble-games-layoffs-leave-developer-unable-to-update-its-game-or-release-it-on-switch/1100-6525328/">left some indie titles in a precarious position</a>. But now, ex-Humble staff have formed their own indie publishing company, called Good Games Group, and it appears that Humble Games parent company Ziff Davis is one of its first clients.</p><p dir="ltr">Led by former Humble Games leaders Mark Nash and Alan Patmore, Good Games Group will be working with various companies to bring indie titles to market, and according to a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-humble-games-staff-found-new-indie-publisher" rel="nofollow ">Eurogamer</a>, one of those companies is none other than Humble Games' parent company, Ziff Davis. Although Ziff Davis was ultimately responsible for the layoff that left them jobless just a few months ago, Nash and Patmore seem excited to get back to work.</p><p dir="ltr">"Good Games Group's mission is to bring exceptional indie games to the global gaming community," Patmore said of the partnership. "Partnering with Ziff Davis allows us to continue working with the amazing indie developers we collaborated with at Humble Games, while also allowing us to chart a new course for the future."</p><p>It's not yet clear exactly which titles Good Games Group will be responsible for, but <a href="https://www.goodgamesgroup.com/" rel="nofollow ">the new publisher's website</a> includes header and footer images featuring a number games previously published by Humble Games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-of-pain/">Ring of Pain</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/signalis/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/supraland/">Supraland</a>, to name a few. It's possible that the newly assembled team could be working on some of the same games it would have been responsible for if the mass-layoff had never happened. Initially, Ziff Davis <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-game-publisher-humble-games-reportedly-lays-off-all-staff/1100-6525236/">told GameSpot that the layoffs would have "no impact"</a> on its operations, with the company planning to have an outside consulting firm called The Powell Group handle any loose ends related to unfinished projects. Humble Games has yet to make a statement regarding the new partnership with Good Games Group, or whether The Powell Group is still in the picture.</p><p>Layoffs have hit the gaming industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-industry-layoffs-are-worse-than-ever-how-did-we-get-here/1100-6521799/" data-ref-id="1100-6521799">especially hard in 2024</a>, affecting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">AAA studios</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indie-publisher-thunderful-to-lay-off-20-of-its-workforce/1100-6520404/" data-ref-id="1100-6520404">indie devs</a> alike.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Diablo IV, which just received its first expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vessel of Hatred</a>d, was definitely a success for Blizzard. Even those who don't love the game must admit that, at its core, Diablo IV sticks closely to the tenets that made the franchise a tentpole in the genre.</p>
<p>However, as revealed by Jason Schreier (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/play-nice-book-excerpt-blizzard-diablo-iv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Wired</a>) in his latest book 'Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment', the first iteration of Diablo IV was something very different from what we got. Following Reaper of Souls, the higher-ups decided there wouldn't be a proper second expansion for Diablo III, so Reaper of Souls director Josh Mosqueira started working with a small team on a whole new concept. The project, codenamed Hades, employed an over the shoulder camera with action combat inspired by Rocksteady's Batman: Arkham trilogy.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this concept even had roguelike elements such as permadeath. Whenever the player character died, the user would get some kind of perks to facilitate their next attempt. While intriguing, the idea quickly ran into some obvious issues. Batman: Arkham's signature action combat was designed for a single player game, while Diablo IV, like all the games since the very beginning, would need to support cooperative multiplayer. According to Schreier's retelling, it didn't take long for Mosqueira to realize that himself. He left Blizzard in July 2016, founding Bonfire Studios, which to this day appears to have made no games of its own.</p>
<p>Following Mosqueira's departure, Blizzard decided to scrap the project and go back to what made the franchise great in the first place. That obviously translated into a longer wait for fans, but given the Diablo IV we actually got, perhaps it is best that Hades did not materialize after all - such a radically different game might have killed the beloved franchise altogether.</p>

So it wouldn’t be shocking if Nolan has warmed up to the idea of making him the protagonist of his next film.</p><p>But what that project will be about remains a complete mystery.

The only thing that seems possibly set in stone is that whatever the movie is will begin filming in 2025. </p><p>Hollywood A-listers dropped whatever they were doing to appear in <em>Oppenheimer</em>, and it ended up making hundreds of millions domestically. So it wouldn’t be shocking if the next Nolan movie attracts even more high-profile talent, with cameos that sometimes border on being outright distracting and fourth-wall breaking (at least that’s how I felt about Damon in <em>Interstellar</em>). </p><p>So what subjects might Nolan tackle next? He’s already done comic book adaptations with the Batman trilogy, sci-fi action with <em>Interstellar</em>, <em>Tenet</em>, and <em>Inception</em>, and period pieces between both<em> Oppenheimer </em>and <em>Dunkirk</em>. <em>Insomnia</em> and <em>Memento</em> ticked the mystery thriller box. Does the <em>Prestige</em> count as fantasy? It certainly included magic. Maybe Nolan’s next movie really will just be a lowkey, slice of life tale. If anyone could will that into being a box office blockbuster hit, it’s him. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Naturally, fan favourite heroes like Peach, Yoshi and Donkey Kong return, while villains like Boo, Goomba and Spike, the latter of which hasn’t been playable since Mario Party 10 back in 2015, join the ranks. Two brand new unlockable characters, Pauline and Ninji, are also along for the ride.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/mariopartyjamboree-preview-blogroll-1725653103545.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ninji Joins the Party</figcaption></figure></output><h3><strong>Seven Game Boards</strong></h3><p>Craving a classic 4-player frenzy? Jamboree’s Mario Party Mode applies the series’ beloved board game formula onto vibrant new terrain. Roll your dice block and prepare to traverse a whopping seven game boards – the most seen on Nintendo Switch to date – each with their own unique mechanics. </p><p>The five new boards are Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, where the paths are altered every time you wake the giant Wiggler; Goomba Lagoon, where paths can be washed away by high tide; Roll ‘em Raceway, which lets characters whizz around the circuit in a race car; Rainbow Galleria, a vast shopping mall where you can nab a star for 50% off in a flash sale, and King Bowser’s Keep, where imposter Bowser can cause carnage by claiming spaces as his own. Two returning boards are Western Land from Mario Party 2, and Mario’s Rainbow Castle from Mario Party, making Jamboree a true celebration of the series, then and now.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/supermariopartyjamboree-boarding-carousel-img-01-1728318016204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party</figcaption></figure></output><p>In addition, there’s an exciting new mechanic to spice up the game ⁠– players can earn a Jamboree Buddy which will help them for three turns on the board. These allies enable you to take certain actions twice, including gaining double the coins or stealing stars twice from your foes. But the same way positive actions are doubled with a buddy, so too are unlucky ones! If you land on a Bowser space, it’ll trigger twice, adding a whole new level of chaos to your game. Beyond their doubling effects, Jamboree Buddies also offer aid via individual power ups, for example, Donkey Kong can launch you across the board, while Yoshi can copy an item held by your opponent.</p><p>Players can jump into Mario Party Mode with up to 3 friends locally or online, or match online with random opponents from across the world. And if they feel like <em>really</em> testing their skills, they can choose the new Pro Rules feature, which introduces a more competitive ruleset which makes things more strategic and more reliant on skills.</p><h3><strong>More Minigames Than Ever Before</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/nswitch-supermariopartyjamboree-24-1728318457404.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>More Minigames!</figcaption></figure></output><p>Minigames are the star of the Mario Party series, and this collection carries the same addictive, chaotic DNA to have you shouting at the TV. Doubling down on its mission to be the biggest Mario Party game ever, Jamboree has over 110 minigames ranging from classic races and obstacle courses to whimsically bizarre experiences, such as working with a co-op partner to perfectly slice a steak in two or leaping around in a giant picnic basket to avoid being crushed by falling sandwiches. Along with the variety of games, there is also a variety of control schemes – Jamboree has the best of both worlds with some minigames using motion controls and other using button controls. Not a motion control fan? You can disable those minigames from appearing in the settings menu, or using a Pro Controller to auto-disable them. <br>Similar to the aforementioned game boards, players get both new minigames and nostalgic hits, like Granite Getaway, Blame it on the Crane, and Snow Brawl which all make a return.</p><p>Players can also try their hand at these competitive trials in new ways, such as the Daily Challenges, by heading over to Minigame Bay. </p><h3><strong>Brand New Modes</strong></h3><p>Amazingly, Super Mario Party Jamboree isn’t content with delivering the most jam-packed version of the classic board game mode to date. It expands the series even further by adding three new motion control modes, and two brand new online modes, one of which lets up to 20 players join the chaotic fun! </p><p>Paratroopa Flight School is the first of the new motion control modes, where players can use their Joy-Con to soar through the air, taking part in competitive or cooperative activities with a buddy. There’s also Toad’s Item Factory, where participants work together to get a ball to the goal by controlling individual parts of a machine via their Joy-Con. Finally, there’s Rhythm Kitchen, a classic 4-player rhythm action game which lets you bust a move with the Joy-Con to cook along with the beat. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/supermariopartyjamboree-moving-carousel-img-03-1728318490598.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Paratroopa Flight School</figcaption></figure></output><p>The first new online mode is Koopathlon, a 20-player race via a series of minigames (your position in the race is tied to how well you perform at said minigames) which mixes the most popular elements of the franchise with a global “battle royale” approach, as players try to overcome Survivathon encounters that threaten to knock them out of the running. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/07/nswitch-supermariopartyjamboree-04-1728318591668.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Bowser's Kaboom Squad</figcaption></figure></output><p>Bowser’s Kaboom Squad, the second online mode, is an action-packed co-op experience where 8 players team up to take down a rampaging Imposter Bowser. You’ll need to defeat him within 5 rounds to win, so load bombs into a cannon to chip away at his health. After each round, you can earn helpful items via a minigame to help you gain the upper hand in battle. Remember: teamwork makes the dream work, particularly when facing off against the Imposter King of the Koopas!</p><p>Host the ultimate games night from the comfort of your sofa when Super Mario Party Jamboree launches on 17th October exclusively for Nintendo Switch, and is available from Nintendo eShop, My Nintendo Store and at retailers. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> has arrived, adding a new region, campaign, and class. In the new region of Nahantu there are Tenets of Akarat to find activate, similar to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-fractured-peaks-altar-of-lilith-locations-in-diablo-4/1100-6512480/">Altars of Lilith</a> found in the regions from the base game. While they function slightly differently, the basic premise of finding them hidden in the environment remains the same. Finding them rewards you with region renown, which can unlock important bonuses, like extra skill points and potions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How the Tenets of Akarat work</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381974" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381974"></a><figcaption>Based on the glowing statues in the background, you need to activate the left and middle statues for this Tenet of Akarat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381974-tenetofakaratexample.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unlike the Altars of Lilith, activating the Tenets of Akarat requires a few minor steps. Each Tenet of Akarat will have some small statues around them, either one or three. If there is only one, after activating it, you will have to take down a few enemies that spawn in. If there are three, there are a few potential solutions.</p><p dir="ltr">Sometimes you simply need to activate all three statues to activate the Tenet of Akarat. In other instances, like the above image, you will need to activate only some of the statues to match another set of statues in the background. The third possibility is that you will need to attack the Tenet of Akarat itself, which will activate all three statues for you. <strong>Once the Tenet of Akarat has its corruption removed, you still need to interact with it for it to count.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">Every Tenet of Akarat location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381975" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4381975"></a><figcaption>There are a total 0f 30 Tenets of Akarat in Nahantu.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4381975-tenetsofakarat.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a total of 30 Tenets of Akarat throughout Nahantu. Unlike the Altars of Lilith, none of them are hidden behind Strongholds or other quests, so once you reach Nahantu you can find and activate all 30 of them.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-6-all-seasonal-journey-rewards-and-objectives-for-vessel-of-hatred-launch/1100-6527027/">Seasonal Journey Rewards And Objectives</a> guide.</p>

"I once enjoyed the game as a player, back when I was in the middle of the game's target audience," Delaney wrote. "Today, I'm well outside of that, but the game has taken on new meaning to me now that I have kids of my own. Because the core gameplay remains fun and easy to learn, passing down my favorite characters to my kids has been a heartwarming joy, and watching their favorites emerge has been exciting."</p>
