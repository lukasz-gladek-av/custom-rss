			<p>Developer Raccoon Logic's <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/best-tips-for-starting-revenge-of-the-savage-planet/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> has surpassed 1 million players, the studio has announced. Nearly two weeks since the game launched, the studio celebrated the milestone, though creative director Alex Hutchinson still lamented the fact that, due to Revenge of the Savage Planet being available on subscription services, 1 million players doesn't mean 1 million sales.</p>
<p>"<em>We are super grateful to all the 1M players who have taken up revenge against Alta</em>," a statement from Raccoon Logic on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2787320/view/537728173036537047">Steam page</a> began.</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you for the support. On the team side, we are continuing to make fixes very regularly to ensure that everyone has the best experience possible. We're also working on a roadmap for new features/updates/etc that we want to share with you very soon! In the meantime, keep kicking brainards, raccoons, and decking out your habitat STV Cribs Style. The team loves seeing all your creations, gifs, memes, etc. Keep em' coming!</em>"</p>

<p>On X, creative director Alex Hutchinson still celebrated the milestone, but seemingly with an upset tone that the game's inclusion on Xbox Game Pass means it doesn't exactly reflect the financial success that 1 million players would have meant in the days before subscription services like Game Pass.</p>
<p>"<em>In the modern world it sadly doesn't mean sales with the subscription services but still an awesome milestone</em>," Hutchinson<a href="https://x.com/BangBangClick/status/1924124703427371070"> wrote on X</a> while sharing a photo celebrating 1 million players.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">review of Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, we praised the game's style and its humor, but still found it a tedious journey that cut any momentum it was starting to build at various points in the game.</p>
<p>"<em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire.1194471/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/creature-keeper-review-dog-walker-for-hire<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Creature Keeper</em> is a monster collector from Chicago-based studio Fervir Games, and one that went through the trenches to get here. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2019, and an expected release of 2021, was just the beginning of a road built piece-by-piece in real-time whilst they were traveling on it, and indeed, even now. It’s always nice to see the fruits of labor, regardless of the outcome.</p>

<p>You play as Blank, a young up-and-coming “Creature Keeper” from Thera, based in the hills of Sodland. After a grueling training period, Blank immediately has their feet put to the fire, as a growing corruption is enveloping Thera, as well as ruining the livelihoods and prospects of several nearby towns. Together with the creatures uncorrupted by this mysterious influence, Blank has to learn quickly.</p>

<p>There’s a lot that<em> Creature Keeper</em> keeps under the bonnet, namely, what exactly is being showcased. Is it a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-red-and-blue" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em></a>-esque creature collector? Is it an action-RPG in the <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo" rel="nofollow">Diablo</a> </em>vein? Is it a brawler evoking <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/dynasty-warriors-fighting-game-turned-musou" rel="nofollow"><em>Dynasty Warriors</em></a>, of all things? The answer is all 3, and more, including a gardening mini-game. Inside and out, you can tell this is someone’s baby, “nurture over nature” as it gleefully sprawls out on screen like a Jackson Pollock painting.</p>



<p>This works both for <em>Creature Keeper</em>’s benefit and against it. When the game is showing you how it works in its initial throes, it’s all very contained. You’re given a creature to control, and in their own time, the AI can attack whatever’s attacking Blank. If you want to expedite the process, however, you can select the monster as the game slows down, and choose whether it’s a normal attack, a special attack that you can switch out for each separate creature, or whether they ignore that monster entirely.</p>

<p>In this contained environment, it works well. It helps that Blank is also an element in each fight, with weapons readily available and found throughout chests in Thera. Cracks start to show almost immediately however, as after the tutorial, each fight is an insane explosion of mushy pixels that cannot and will not determine separate factors in each fight you decide to take on.</p>

<p>You see, it’s not just Blank and their monsters on display, but the monsters that have been corrupted, and the monsters you can befriend that haven’t been corrupted. Then there’s the icons attached to the corrupted monsters, your owned creatures' health bars, and the damage numbers in tiny groups of pixels, and the projectiles certain monsters will fire profusely to the point of sub-5 FPS slowdown… and the hats. It’s mesmerizing, albeit completely unintelligible chaos, and that’s before you’re allowed more than one creature to follow you on your adventure.</p>



<p>There’s no real way to mitigate this. All but a small handful of creatures will have collisions on their sprites, but that’s when they showcase size on top of their massive attacks, so what you have is a melting pot of nothing. You can strategize and line up attacks for your creatures to make, but it’s tough to determine in the heat of the moment where it starts and ends, even with appropriate set-ups.</p>

<p>It’s the set-ups themselves that seem to have the primary focus in <em>Creature Keeper</em>. Creatures level up, and they unlock perks, but there are some absolutely baffling design decisions made here. Why would I want my creature to get a 10% damage buff, but an increase of 15% in damage taken? Why do HP bonuses only offer paltry +10s when my creatures can reach health that pushes 1000? Why is movement speed a bonus to consider when the creatures are strictly tethered to the player character?</p>

<p>There are also other bonuses you can attach in the form of a garden where you can plant seeds, which you can place clay figures of your current party nearby certain seeds, so you attain bonuses in battles. It’s not as explicitly black-and-white as that, but you’d be hard pressed to find the strategy involved. Even when the game introduces its Rock/Paper/Scissors mechanics for monster weaknesses and strengths, the trick lies in staggering.</p>



<p>Hit a monster enough times, and they’ll become stunned briefly, and you can wail on them, which is Blank’s job. It appears that Fervir Games anticipated this, which is why Blank’s damage doesn’t scale to the same height as the monsters you can catch, so before long, your role in the battle becomes near-negligible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You’re still a stagger merchant, make no mistake, but as a player, you become tertiary to a creature system that only relies on numbers; numbers in power, numbers in size, neither of which demand the intricacies that <em>Creature Keeper</em> promises.</p>

<p>That isn’t a detriment, as it’s nice that the game gives enough leeway for the player to simply just play it without worrying about its largely context-less flow in battles. Indeed, it was more fun trying to see the world of Thera as Fervir have crafted it, which does lead to some interesting moments. The campaign isn’t exactly <em>Moby Dick</em>, but <em>Creature Keeper</em> pulls punches when necessary with some heartfelt decisions, ones that lean into the lore with vigor.</p>

<p>Mind you, this is when the game isn’t forcing through some unbelievably painful attempts at comedy. This may be a complaint that varies with how one perceives comedy, but each time <em>Creature Keeper</em> is attempting to make the player chortle, it is always with long-winded scenes, mixed in with unnecessary and downright annoying pixelated emojis plastering the screen. It barely adds anything to proceedings, just pure eye-rolling whenever it tries to hit you with a goofy Jerry Lewis prat-fall in 16-bit format.</p>

<h2><em>Creature Keeper</em> Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p>Did I have fun with <em>Creature Keeper</em>? It’s really hard to say. It’s a true “shut your brain off” button masher that doesn’t do enough with its tactical potential, and its story is sandbagged by some truly unfunny comedy beats. Beyond its mostly ineffectual perk system, what changes could be made would also poison the well of its extremely specific flavor, and as it stands, it HAS identity. As it stands, the journey <em>Creature Keeper</em> has made to be here could be worth the price of admission alone.</p>

However, Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the <em>Cyberpunk </em>tabletop roleplaying game, which first debuted in 1988, has revealed a pretty important piece of information: Alongside returning to the capitalist hellscape of Night City, the sequel will take us to another city as well.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197564,196805" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Speaking to Polish gaming channel tvgry at the Digital Dragons Conference in Poland, Pondsmith talked a little about the upcoming game, revealing that “Orion” will take place at least partially, though not entirely, in Night City. He described some talks he had with the CD Projekt Red team, and said that while he’s not as involved in the sequel as he was with <em>2077</em>, he can say that the game will feature a second city that is “more like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p>“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit —I’m not telling you any more than that, but there’s another city we visit,” Pondsmith said. “Night City is still there, but I remember looking at it and going, ‘yeah, I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work.’ And it doesn’t feel like <em>Blade Runner</em>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.’”</p><p>Assuming Pondsmith is being careful with his words here, this doesn’t explicitly mean <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s next game is set in Chicago specifically, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does still exist in the universe</a></span>. He describes the new location as being “like” the city, so it’s probably not the Illinois metropolis itself, and as of yet, it’s unclear in what ways the new setting will resemble Chicago. In its infrastructure? Its culture? Unbearably cold winters? We’ll find out eventually.</p><p>What I’m curious about is how much of a divide there will be between this new city and the Night City we know and love. I know exploring an old map in an open-world game might not sound that exciting, but Night City is still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">one of the most well-realized cities I’ve ever explored in a game</a></span>, and I imagine CDPR isn’t too keen to just throw all that work away if there are still stories to tell. I’m also wondering if the studio will include some kind of choice import to have the story of <em>2077</em>’s merc protagonist V referenced in the sequel according to your decisions. I don’t need a cameo from the guy, but I wouldn’t mind a drink at the Afterlife bar paying tribute to his big space heist at the end of the game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And once again, it’ll be a show focused on world premieres and exclusive new trailers with no talking heads or any other fluff. Just games.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>TinyBuild Connect Date, Time, and How to Watch</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The full event will be livestreamed on Tuesday, May 27 starting at 1:00 p.m. Eastern / 12:00 p.m. Central / 10:00 a.m. Pacific. For our friends across the pond, that’s 7:00 p.m. CET. It’ll start promptly at those times and will jump right into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/"><u>IGN.com</u></a> (our homepage)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Facebook</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ign/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitter</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s Twitch</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ign?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s TikTok</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw?themeRefresh=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>IGN’s YouTube</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not able to catch the show live, you’ll be able to watch the whole thing on our YouTube page after it finishes. Just like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMre7n_HPao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>last year’s show</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>What to Expect from tinyBuild Connect 2025</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This will be a dense show, with lots of reveals and announcements packed into less than 30 minutes. There will be a mix of premieres of previously unannounced games, new info about announced games, and updates for released titles, highlighted by upcoming titles Hello Neighbor 3, Ferocious, and Kingmakers. You can expect a new look at gameplay for both HN3 and Ferocious, while Kingmakers is getting a Steam Early Access release date announcement. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello Neighbor 3 was announced last year and is the latest entry in the adventure sandbox thriller series. You’ll return to the town of Raven Brooks, this time as a stranger with no ties to the town. Raven Brooks functions as a real-time sandbox simulation, where every player’s decision is the right one. It’s populated by residents who act based on their personalities, relationships, desires, and goals. The game is currently in the playtesting phase, so now seems like the right time for an update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ferocious made a strong impression during last year’s Games Baked in Germany showcase with its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ferocious-official-mecha-trailer-games-baked-in-germany-showcase"><u>cinematic trailer</u></a>. Developed by Omyog, a small German team with veterans from the film and AAA game industries, the game is a survival-focused, narrative-driven FPS set on a remote island filled with dinosaurs and hostile mercenaries. Among the team is the former Level Design Director of Far Cry 3, Narrative Director of Far Cry 4, and Campaign Creative Director of Star Wars Battlefront II, so it’s safe to say it’s an experienced team.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/20/tb-connect-2025-final-artwork-1747758278474.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Kingmakers was revealed last year too, and it took the IGN audience by storm. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingmakers-combines-back-to-the-future-with-army-of-darkness-and-its-blowing-up-right-now-ign-next"><u>featured it on IGN Next</u></a> because its trailer was a surprise hit, getting more than 11 million views across our social channels. Like Ferocious, it resonated thanks to its unique premise. Kingmakers is a mix of third-person shooter and RTS set in medieval Europe. You might be thinking, “How could a shooter be set in medieval times?” Well, you’re a time traveler who’s been sent to the past with modern weapons to alter the course of history. TinyBuild has confirmed that they’ll be announcing the game’s release date in Steam’s Early Access, so you can look forward to that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those are some of the games you can expect to get updates, but there will be plenty more announcements and updates we can’t see coming. Tune in on May 27 to see all of it.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Game preservation has grown tremendously over the last couple of years, and gaming culture brand Lost in Cult is also adding to these initiatives with a brand-new line of physical games. Aiming to do things differently, Lost in Cult is kickstarting its preservation effort with three games that will "redefine" what a physical release can be.</p><p>What's immediately noticeable here is that each of the games--Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow, and Thank Goodness You're Here--are being presented with original artwork, and they'll come packaged with a variant game cover, an essay booklet, poster, and more. More importantly, each game is up-to-date with its latest version and they're all playable offline. As for the price, these are listed for roughly $80 each on the UK-based site.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497826"></a><figcaption>Lost In Cult physical editions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497826-lost-in-cult-1.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497827,1300-4497828,1300-4497829" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497827-lic-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497828-lic-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4497829-lic-3.jpg"></figure><p>Lost in Cult added that preservation specialists Does It Play have assisted in testing the games, and each disc or cartridge features the game in its entirety at the point of release. That means no updates, no downloads, and no codes in the box.</p><p>These will be very limited releases and they'll start shipping in Q4 2025. Immortality is limited to 1,500 copies on PS5, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow is limited to 3,000 copies on PS5, and Thank Goodness You're Here will be limited to 1,500 copies on PS5 and 3,000 copies on Switch.

This new format <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/certain-nintendo-switch-2-physical-games-are-game-key-cards-for-downloads/1100-6530576/">treats the Switch cartridge as an authentication key</a>, as Switch 2 owners will need to connect online to download the full game to their system.

<p>"It's not woke," Cockle said, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thats-just-stupid-geralt-actor-slams-suggestion-the-witcher-4-starring-ciri-is-woke" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by IGN</a>. "There's nothing woke about it. [Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome."</p><p>We're not exactly sure how Cockle might define "woke." It's a term often thrown around without any specific meaning, after all.</p><p>After a trilogy of games star starred Geralt, Cockle said, "We've seen the end of Geralt's journey," adding that he celebrates Ciri and the fact that she's the protagonist of The Witcher 4.</p><p>"If you read the books, then you understand why CD Projekt went down this avenue," Cockle said about choosing Ciri as the protagonist. "There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it."</p><p>"If you think it's woke, read the damn books--they're good, first of all. And secondly, you won't think it's so woke anymore," he said.</p><p>The Witcher 4 kicks off a new trilogy of Witcher games that will span The Witcher 4-6. All of these games will be released within a <a href="https://x.com/BigManFanelli/status/1577335568224198657" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">six-year window after The Witcher 4 launches.</a></p><p>Geralt will appear in The Witcher 4, but only in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-dev-explains-why-ciris-the-star-this-time-confirms-geralt-will-appear/1100-6528460/" data-ref-id="1100-6528460">smaller, supporting role.</a> Game director Sebastian Kalemba told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-was-always-going-to-be-about-ciri-even-when-we-were-doing-the-wild-hunt-actually-but-dont-worry-about-geralt-definitely-hes-going-to-appear/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> that it was a "natural choice" for The Witcher 4 to tell its story from Ciri's perspective, building off the narrative in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p><p>"There's plenty of room for her and for us, also, to build on top of [her]. There's so much room for exploration, and because she's such a nuanced character, the beginning of her journey gives us freedom and so many opportunities to be able to dig in and use [that] for good," he said.</p><p>In other news, Kalemba recently discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-director-wants-players-to-feel-the-rewards-for-their-choices/1100-6531667/" data-ref-id="1100-6531667">he wants players the rewards for their choices in The Witcher 4.</a></p><p>In addition to The Witcher 4, CD Projekt is developing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2077 sequel</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher 1 remake</a>.

            <p>
Worried the impending arrival of $80 games might price you out of your favourite hobby? Well if Borderlands 4 follows suit, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has suggested the community should just suck it up and deal with it. "If you're a real fan," he recently told a potential purchaser, "you'll find a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Pitchford made the proclamation on social media after a <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">Borderlands fan opined</a>, "Randy, [Borderlands 4] better not be $80. Don't take that risk, a lot of gamers aren't gonna pay $80 and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag. You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher."
</p>
<p>
But Pitchford begged to differ. "Not my call," he <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">insisted</a>, before dismissing pricing concerns. "If you're a real fan, you'll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlour in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
The response from Borderlands fans on social media was, unsurprisingly, swift, strong, and overwhelmingly negative. "Thanks, now I won't buy the Game even if it costs $70", one person <a href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1924852589121687964">wrote</a>, while another <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1924850023625318758">added</a>, "That has to be one of the worst CEO replies from recent memory." Another <a href="https://x.com/RaistlinJustice/status/1924787599610122325">called</a> Pitchford's comment "elitist [and] out of touch"; "Rich person says just find the money," another <a href="https://x.com/Obey1Cannoli/status/1924818949494944151">wrote</a>, with plenty more using <a href="https://x.com/FergusMcburgs/status/1924823182374285777">considerably stronger language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Of course, none of this means Borderlands 4 <em>will</em> cost $80 dollars when it eventually arrives, but the industry certainly seems to be heading in that direction. Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">got the ball rolling earlier this year</a>, when it announced a $79.99 USD price tag for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and Microsoft was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">quick to follow</a>, confirming some Xbox game prices would rise to $79.99 at the end of 2025 - presumably in time for this year's Call of Duty.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Borderlands 4 publisher Take-Two has relayed a more cautious approach to price increases, with CEO Strauss Zelnick recently reiterating the company's stance on variable, game-by-game pricing. While some analysts have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">speculated next year's GTA 6 might reach as much as $100</a>, one of the only confirmed prices on Take-Two's upcoming roster is Mafia: The Old Country, which costs $50. Borderlands 4 pricing details are yet to be shared.
</p>
<p>
But while customers might balk at the rising cost of games, former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">recently suggested the move was inevitable</a>. "I think it was going to happen sooner or later," he explained in the wake of Mario Kart World's price reveal, "maybe not from Nintendo, but it was going to happen eventually. We live in contrasting times, where inflation is real and significant, but people expect games that are ever more ambitious and therefore expensive to develop to cost the same. It's an impossible equation."
</p>
<p>
As for Borderlands 4, that's set to launch for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 12th September after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Take-Two announced it was bringing its release forward</a>.

            <p>
Right, anyone in need of something that's just generally quite pleasant? I've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy-reroll">Katamari Damacy</a> creator Keita Takahashi's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/to-a-t">to a T</a> ever since, well, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">it was revealed</a>, honestly. It's suitably strange, as per usual with the cult game maker's works, this time putting you in the position of a teenager who is constantly t-posing. There's also sandwich-making giraffes and other strange inhabitants, and you can now take a look at it yourself in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3727290/to_a_T_Demo/">demo that's dropped on Steam today</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo doesn't sound particularly long, as you just get to play through its first episode. Still, sounds like enough time to get to do things like brushing your teeth, something I genuinely couldn't tell you whether that's been in a game before or not. There is also a "very cute dog"! All very nondescript stuff, but I trust Takahashi to deliver on the weirdness. Plus, your save data in the demo carries through to the full game, always a neat feature.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, a couple of songs from the game have been released too. There's <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=wy7WY8G6Do3_GdCrsmPyWg">Perfect Shape by PREP</a>, an upbeat track that wants to make sure you know you're the perfect shape (aww, thanks!). And there's the slightly chiller <a href="https://social.tunecore.com/linkShare?linkid=sqwwoGAmx850yjYtNIG8aQ">Giraffe Song</a>, performed by Rebecca Sugar, i.e. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a> contributor and Steven Universe creator. Honestly, both have already hooked me, some incredibly strong earworms here that I don't think have been heard in a game since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bugsnax">Bugsnax</a>'s theme song. Cripes, now I'm going to be singing that to myself for the rest of the day.
</p>
<p>
Not long to wait for the full thing now either, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/katamari-creators-new-game-about-a-teenager-stuck-in-a-t-pose-gets-a-release-date">as it's due out next week on May 28th</a>.

            <p>I recently stumbled on <a href="https://dominoclub.itch.io/erostasis">Erostasis</a>, a brilliant and filthy cybernetic microgame in which you are a wiry meatpuppet created to, aha, satisfy the urges of an exceedingly backed-up bionic starship. Over the course of a very busy 20 minutes or so, you visit various self-aware ship systems and play out their kinks. The writing is clattery, theory-drenched and sensual, set to moaning electronica. The visuals are a gunky collage of seeming porno and industrial stock footage. It’s glorious. Probably don’t play it where members of the public can see.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I were to choose <em>a polar opposite of that game</em> it might be new metroidvania Mio: Memories In Orbit, which also takes place on a living ship and is as elegant and videogamey and serenely sexless as Erostasis is subversive and debauched. I really like the looks of Mio, too, for wholly different reasons, and I’m tickled pink that publishers Focus Entertainment have managed to email me about it while I’m still recovering from my Erostasis experience. </p><!--more-->

Over the course of presumably many centuries, the vessel's innards have exploded into a wilderness of cosmic vegetation.</p>
<p>The visuals take inspiration from “comics, paintings and anime”, and are set to “lo-fi beats and choral melodies”. They remind me a teeny bit of Biblical beat ‘em up El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron. There’s a similar, faerie frailty to the setting, with warmly painted architecture and machinery bleaching or darkening to pencil strokes in the backdrop. Mio herself moves and fights with the aid of golden tendrils emerging from her skull. These are very much not the kinds of tendrils you encounter in Erostasis, a game in which it is generally difficult to tell one body part from another.</p>
<p>Its uncommonly artful art direction aside, Mio seems pretty routine for a metroidvania. There are abilities and modifiers to acquire, new areas or shortcuts to access with those abilities, friendly robots to repair for lore and upgrades, a bestiary of 30 enemy units, and 15 bossfights. The trailer suggests that you’ll do a lot of chaining together moves to overcome sequences of obstacles and build a combo. Again, all quite familiar, but persuasively executed.</p>
<p>Mio: Memories In Orbit launches this year, according to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1672810/MIO_Memories_in_Orbit/">the Steam page</a>. It and Erostasis join last year's seedy sarcophagus <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultros">Ultros</a> in the pantheon of games set on living starships. I am fervently hoping that we’re in the middle of some kind of floral fleshcruiser renaissance. I'm trying to work out which format or genre I'd like next. Maybe a bioship life sim? Where you have to worry about cellular mitosis and deep space photosynthesis, rather than managing a crew?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Today, developer Arrowhead Studios brought the fight to Super Earth, as the Illuminate are touching down on the Helldivers' home turf. Everyone is joining in the fight, from the player-led Helldivers to some fresh reinforcements in the SEAF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Short for Super Earth Armed Force, the SEAF soldiers are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-finally-brings-the-illuminate-invasion-to-the-streets-of-super-earth">populating battles taking place on Super Earth</a>, helping the Helldivers hold out against the oncoming Illuminate forces. These troops can be ordered around using several commands, and will assist the Helldivers in defending the home of Managed Democracy. In turn, Helldivers 2 players already love their new NPC helpers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As seen in the new trailer for the Heart of Democracy update, SEAF soldiers are subject to roughly the same dire circumstances and thin survival odds as the Helldivers. Today's trailer has more than a few shots of SEAF soldiers getting absolutely routed by the invasion forces.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the new SEAF pals are garnering both the sympathy and adoration of Helldivers, provoking the need to defend their newfound backup.

"Protect them at all cost helldiver."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others draw comparisons to the Clone Troopers from Star Wars, especially the NPC allies you'd see in the classic campaigns of games like Star War: Battlefront.

Honestly, having an NPC pal around to push those bunker buttons <em>would </em>be useful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, the Helldivers will absolutely need the help on Super Earth, as the new update seems quite chaotic.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/blades-of-fire-review.1194321/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blades-of-fire-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I always look forward to it when a studio steps out of its comfort zone to create something unexpected. Blades of Fire, a 3D action-RPG from developer MercurySteam, best known for the stellar <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread</a> and its action-packed take on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/29/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-review">Castlevania</a> during the PlayStation 3/Xbox 360 era, does just that. Combining its past successes to give you control of a blacksmith who crafts his own weapons of destruction seemed like a promising concept. Unfortunately, the superb crafting portions of this lengthy fantasy adventure are overshadowed by an uneven story and combat that lacks real depth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as Aran, a commoner who gains access to a legendary forging hammer that sets him on a quest to stop the queen who is leading the kingdom into ruin. The three pillars of Blades of Fire are its satisfying but simple combat, enjoyable weapon crafting system, and emotionally unimpactful story. While very uneven, those were at least enough to keep me relatively entertained for the 55 hours it took me to reach the first round of credits. However, there’s only an unsatisfactory conclusion to find there, and it was the postgame scavenger hunt necessary to find the “true” ending that really drained what little enthusiasm I had left by the end.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blades of Fire Review Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with the good, the crafting system stands as the tallest of the three pillars holding up Blades of Fire. Through the hammer Aran receives at the beginning of his journey, he can build the powerful weapons necessary to vanquish all that stand in his path. Initially you can only craft a singular weapon, a heavy polearm called the Hyssop that deals devastating strikes but uses a lot of stamina with each swing. However, after Aran vanquishes enough of a given enemy type, you will unlock a blueprint for the weapon they brandished against him. Dismantling 60 skeletons unlocks the claymore they would clumsily swing, while taking down just five spearmen from the queen’s transformed army grants access to a long spear that deals either piercing damage from afar or slashing damage in circular strikes. Finding and taking down each new enemy to expand your arsenal made for an enjoyable loop, and  encouraged me to take down the stronger optional enemies whenever they appeared.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interacting with a forger anvil, which function as both rest points and a fast travel system, can then transport you to a mystical forge that lets you create those weapons. When you do, you can adjust several aspects of them: For example, the Twin Mallets are limited to customizing the size and shape of the head and handle, where larger weapons like the Glaive also have options for adding a pommel. These choices modify that weapon in small but noticeable ways, tweaking weight, balance, and damage to your liking, as well as altering Aran’s maximum stamina and how much stamina it costs to dodge while using it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While confusing at first, forging became my favorite part.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The final part of forging a weapon is the actual forging itself. Crafting weapons in most games ends after selecting your materials, but Blades of Fire has you actually striking the heated metal to match the weapon's shape. This system, while underexplained and confusing at first thanks to the lack of detailed tutorial, quickly became my favorite part of the journey. A weapon’s steel appears as bars similar to those on an audio visualizer, and some will shrink while others grow as you strike. The better you do, the longer a weapon will last before you need to sunset it to be recycled for parts or traded in to an ally for specific and often rarer materials. It took me half a dozen weapons before I figured out the proper technique for managing the strength, tilt, and width of each of my strikes, but once I did, I found myself confidently crafting weapons with the maximum rating every time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those who end up not enjoying the crafting, there is an option to skip the process after the first time, but the maximum number of times you can repair it will be limited to the best results you’ve created manually. This smartly expedited my return trips to the forge, as I’d often hold off replacing weapons until they were all beyond repair, turning what would be a lengthy process into a short trip that got me back in the action sooner. Blades of Fire even gives you the option to name your weapon before setting out, which I initially reserved primarily for punny names like Captain Falchion or Let me Axe You something – but eventually as I saw them reach their final forms with the best materials and enhancements, giving them names suitable of their legacy like Gae Bolg or Masamune. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though there are 35 different weapons to wield and each vary between their speed, range, and other properties, combat unfortunately boils down to just eight attacks. These are performed by pressing the button on your controller that matches the part of an enemy you want to strike: So triangle/Y will strike at an enemy’s head, Circle/B will strike on the right, and so on. There are also charged attacks that deal higher damage and mutilate enemies if fatal, resulting in more gruesome deaths. It is disappointing, though, that mutilating an enemy's head with either a blunt weapon or piercing weapon has the same animation, and seeing them fall off the same way got old after the first dozen times. There are also no combinations of attacks that offer any real benefit, so alternating left and right strikes is virtually the same as mindlessly spamming a single direction. If it wasn’t for the use of parries and perfect dodges that offer a small window of opportunity to retaliate safely, combat would have felt even more bland than it already does. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Choosing the directions of your attacks carefully becomes more necessary later on as enemies start to have different levels of resistance on each body part, and some like elementals can even move these weak points mid-combat. To its credit, Blades of Fire does have a large variety of enemies to fight – unfortunately, nearly every one of them is humanoid. That means that even though they all have their own unique quirks and attack patterns, I was rarely impressed by anything new that was thrown at me. Outside of bosses, which can be hulking behemoths that shake things up more substantially, one of the few interesting regular enemy types were the trolls: they have constant health regeneration and two health bars, requiring you to drain one bar and then mutilate a limb with a charged attack before you can attempt to finish them off. But a mechanic like that is the exception rather than the rule, and the predictability of every enemy’s clearly telegraphed attacks meant fights often just came down to my parry timing. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It has one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in a while.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you do fall in combat, the powers of the legendary hammer mean Aran doesn’t stay dead for long. However, his temporary deaths come with the penalty of dropping your equipped weapon at that location, similar to how you drop souls, blood echoes, and other currencies in games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2011/09/30/dark-souls-review">Dark Souls</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/bloodborne-review">Bloodborne</a>. Thankfully, Blades of Fire is much more forgiving, as any weapon dropped in a location turns to stone and remains in the world permanently until Aran retrieves it. This was a welcome change to the formula as the potential of permanently losing a weapon you’ve invested heavily into after consecutive deaths would have been extremely frustrating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last and certainly least, the most disappointing pillar of Blades of Fire is its story, characters, and world exploration. Aran’s quest to stop the queen does keep a decent pace, but it never surprised or wowed me and many moments that seemed like they <em>should </em>be impactful are hindered by an uneven delivery. At one point after killing a major boss, he simply fell to his knee and sat there until I struck him once more – it felt like it was set up for more, but there was no dialogue and no flair. Just this previously important character falling to the ground in anticlimatic fashion. Blades of Fire also has one of the most disappointing endings I've seen in a while, rolling credits with little resolution and then immediately sending you off on a scavenger hunt that is too long for its own good if you want to find out what’s actually going on. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Jada's Favorite Action/Adventure RPGs</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters are generally one-note stereotypes, and often have dialogue that further enforces their simplistic nature. Aran regularly remarks that he’s not smart enough to solve the puzzles without the aid of Adso, a young scribe who accompanies him on the journey, though Adso doesn’t offer much advice outside of stating the obvious. Adso is the brains to Aran’s brawn, deciphering codices you find, reading ancient languages to reveal paths or secrets, and magically sealing coffins during fights occasionally. Adso also makes regular remarks about Aran’s size when climbing ladders, which ends up feeling like an out of place attempt at humor as Aran rarely responds or finds opportunities to tease back. They are written as if they’ve known each other for a long time despite meeting for the first time in the opening hours, which makes moments like these unearned and shoehorned in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the cast are Glinda the Master Forger, a cranky witch of the woods type that lives in a house on top of a flying beetle, and Arwen, an impatient and hardheaded young girl that is only involved in the final dozen hours and yet conveniently turns out to be super important. As time went on, the uncanny parallels between these characters and those in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/04/12/god-of-war-review">God of War</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a> became more and more distracting. Aran is just a less wise and somehow less charismatic Kratos, Adso deciphers ancient languages and takes note of enemies and other elements of the world similar to Atreus, Glinda fills in the role of Freya, and Arwen is essentially a less prominent Angrboða. You even fight a giant snake at one point, and explore places that strongly resemble areas like the temple resting above the Lake of Nine. Different games using similar character archetypes or tropes isn’t anything new or wrong on its own, but it does start to feel derivative to a fault here - especially when Blades of Fire doesn’t come off so hot in such a direct comparison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the only way it’s put in a bad light, as a lackluster map system often makes exploring for secrets very cumbersome and confusing. There are a ton of little hidden paths to find that lead to cool optional collectibles like shrines for upgrading your weapon customization options, chests with items that increase your healing flasks, gems to up your maximum health or stamina, and different dyes to customize Aran’s outfits. But many locations have multiple levels of elevation, and apart from staring at the one-dimensional map while hoping that you are reading it correctly, you don’t really have a way of knowing which level you are on until you either reach the correct destination or the wrong one. You can leave markers on the map that create a streak of color in the world as guidepoints, which at least help by adding distance and elevation cues to the compass at the top of the screen, but that’s only a half measure. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Blades of Fire’s blacksmithing burns bright, but it doesn’t forge a sharp enough edge to put its customizable weapons to good use. The combat is serviceable but overly simplistic, and the mediocre story often failed to evoke any kind of emotion in me at all, positive or negative, as it just goes through the motions from start to finish. The unintuitive map also frequently left me&nbsp;running in circles, making what could have been a fun hunt for secrets feel more like a chore. And when those pain points are compounded by unflattering comparisons to the games it so clearly took inspiration from, Blades of Fire just can’t cut it.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sale ends May 31. If a game you want is out of stock, you'll want to circle back and check again, as GameStop has restocked some of the titles already.</p><p>You’ll need to <strong>spend $79 to get free shipping from GameStop</strong>, so consider bundling multiple games together to get the most out of the sale. If you need help filling up your cart, you’ll find a random selection of Blu-ray films in the $15 catalog. You can avoid the shipping costs by picking up your games at your local GameStop store (if stock is available).</p><h2><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=GameStop%27s+Biggest+Sale+Of+The+Year+Includes+AAA+Games+For+%2415&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-05-20+09%3A53%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-05-20+09%3A53%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6531678&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Flinks%2Fshop-select-software-for-only-15%2Fnew%3Fview%3Dnew%26pmax%3D16&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgamestops-biggest-sale-of-the-year-includes-aaa-games-for-15%2F1100-6531678%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$15 Games</a></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497732" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497732"></a><figcaption>Persona 5 Tactica and Dragon Age: The Veilguard</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4497732-mixcollage-20-may-2025-09-23-am-195.jpg"></figure><p>Most of the games in the $15 catalog are a few years old, but this is a great opportunity to pick up something you may have missed at launch.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Though the map gives a good general idea of what the actual GTA 6 map might look like, there's still plenty of speculation involved. Clicking on one of the various city icons makes clear when a location's inclusion on the map is based on a leak or on a real-life Florida location that is not yet confirmed to be present in GTA 6. Most of the map locations can be found in Vice City or the Leonida Keys regions, with the central and more northern parts of Leonida relatively empty so far.</p><p dir="ltr">It's an ambitious project and one that looks to be gaining some traction in the community. Users on Reddit have volunteered to help translate the map, which is currently available in English and German, into other languages like Spanish and Portuguese. No doubt the map will continue to be fleshed out ahead of the game's official map reveal, but in the meantime, here are all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gta-6-all-main-locations-from-vice-city-and-beyond/2900-6538/" data-ref-id="2900-6538">main GTA 6 locations we know so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Rockstar recently revealed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-ref-id="1100-6531329">second trailer for GTA 6</a> and confirmed footage in the trailer was captured on a base PlayStation 5 and included both cutscenes and gameplay. The trailer came shortly after Rockstar announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">GTA 6 had been delayed</a> and will release May 26, 2026 instead of in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">While the delay was disappointing for fans, the CEO of Take-Two, Rockstar's parent company, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-suggests-no-more-delays-says-recent-push-is-less-than-6-months/1100-6531629/" data-ref-id="1100-6531629">another GTA 6 delay is unlikely</a>, and that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-reacts-to-grand-theft-auto-6-delay/1100-6531597/" data-ref-id="1100-6531597">delay was necessary</a> to support the development team "in their search for perfection."</p>

            <p>Lost in Cult is launching a new label to release premium physical games, beginning with three British games: Immortality, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow and Thank Goodness You're Here.</p>
<p>Known as Editions, the new line of physical games will be limited in quantity and include interview booklets, art cards and more for collectability and display, with a new game added each month on PS5 and Switch.</p>
<p>Editions will cost £59.99 and ship worldwide. Three games are available now at launch, with more planned every month from July into 2026.</p>

<p>A major reason for the label is game preservation, with Lost in Cult partnering with DoesItPlay? to ensure each game's playability for the future: every game is complete on disc or cart, is playable without the internet, and includes all primary content at the time of publication.</p>
<p>Plus, in addition to the limited edition versions, all releases will be available as a standard edition through online and brick-and-mortar stores. Museums and archive groups will also receive copies.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is aiming for shipping within six months of the release of each Edition, though is hoping for within three months. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a> are also in the works.</p>

<p>"We're being bold," said Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown. "I can unashamedly say we set out to create a new standard for physical games. And this is a multi-faceted mission. Our Editions are designed to preserve not just the game, but the story and artistry behind its creation. At the same time, our retail releases ensure no one is locked out of owning great games physically, giving everyone a chance to play their favourites for the decades to come, internet connection willing or not."</p>
<p>Said Sam Barlow, Immortality creator: "The most common request we've had since releasing Immortality has been for a physical edition, but we always knew that if we did do it, we'd need to do it right - and so, working with Lost In Cult on this amazing new series was a no brainer!"</p>
<p>Lost in Cult is known for its premium game packages, including its Design Works books and Lock-On gaming journals.</p>
<p>Each game in the Editions lineup will come with a slipcase and poster of custom artwork, an authenticity card with printed signature from the game's director, art cards, and a 40-page booklet from Edge Magazine alumni Chris Schilling.</p>

<p>The company is carefully curating its selection of games, focusing on those that have pushed the medium as an art form. The first three have all been recognised by BAFTA.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here won Best British Game at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">this year's awards</a>. It will be available through Editions on PS5 (1500 copies) and Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>Immortality won Best Narrative in 2023 and was nominated for multiple other awards. It will be available on PS5 (1500 copies).</p>
<p>Lastly, The Excavation of Hob's Barrow was long-listed by BAFTA in 2023 for Samantha Béart's performance. It will be available on Switch (3000 copies).</p>
<p>You can check out more details on Editions on the <a href="https://www.lostincult.co.uk/">Lost in Cult website</a>.</p>
<p>Thank Goodness You're Here received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thank-goodness-youre-here-review">five star review from Eurogamer</a>: "Developer Coal Supper's relentlessly inventive absurdist comedy might, by necessity, keep a tight rein on players, but this is an impeccably constructed masterclass in gag-telling."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortality-review-an-ingenious-hollywood-mystery-made-less-profound-by-the-invitation-to-solve-it">Immortality</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-excavation-of-hobs-barrow-review-an-adventure-game-with-depth">The Excavation of Hob's Barrow</a> were also very well-received.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
