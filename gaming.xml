            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/streamers-return-twitch-from-youtube/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamers-return-to-twitch-as-youtube-exclusivity-contracts-expire.969582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/streamers-return-twitch-from-youtube/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Many big-name streamers have returned to Twitch after breaks as long as three years as their exclusivity contracts expire on YouTube. In recent hours, the likes of TimTheTatman, Dr Lupo, and Swagg have all announced their return to Twitch as avenues into multistreaming-based opportunities open up.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-home">Back Home</h2>



<p>Per the chatter on social platforms, Google is reluctant to offer exclusivity contracts and is leaning more heavily into short-form content, the type that has made TikTok such a popular app. This has meant that many top-tier creators aren’t having their exclusivity contracts extended, which in turn means they’re free to stream on other platforms.</p>



<p>To that end, Tim, Lupo, and Swagg have all kicked off streams on Twitch after lengthy breaks away from the super-sized streaming site.</p>



<p>It has been a rocky year or two for Twitch, least of all because of the rise of competing platforms like YouTube and Kick. The platform has dealt with mass layoffs, controversies, and dissent within the streaming community as it navigates an ever-changing market and audience.</p>



<p>While many streamers have made a return to Twitch, and assumedly some are yet to follow, they’re not <strong>exclusive </strong>to the site. It’s believed that Amazon is just as reluctant to hand out exclusivity contracts and is perfectly satisfied with multistreaming content creators broadcasting shared streams on their platform.</p>



<p>Considering exclusivity contracts can number in the tens of millions of dollars, it’s a wise decision all around.</p>



<p>Who are you waiting to return to Twitch?</p>

            <p>New gameplay footage from Slitterhead has dropped from PAX West, and once again, Slitterhead is <em>really</em> emphasising the fact you can play as a dog.</p>
<p>We first got a good look at Bokeh Studio's Slitterhead last summer when a developer diary revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog, something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-release-date-and-trailer-have-popped-up-online">reprised in leaked footage in June</a>, too.</p>

<p>Now, Gematsu has shared three videos of footage taken at PAX West (one is embedded above; the other two can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZg1p87fJHM">here</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrL4dzpSp_0">here</a>), which give us a better look at how The Spirit moves around the world, slipping from person to person (or dog to person, as the case may be), as well as its dark, detailed urban environments.</p>
<p>There are also some super interesting chase sequences (albeit with a little twist) and delightfully grim enemy designs (is it me, or does one look like Beetlejuice?). It should be familiar to anyone who spent time with the Siren games back in the day.</p>
<p>We also get a better peek at the combat, too, and how The Spirit can move from person to person, even in the middle of a fight.</p>
<p>If the sight of blood makes you a little woozy, though, you may want to give these a miss.</p>
<p>Slitterhead will release on 8th November 2024 for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scump-best-jackal-loadout-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/scump%E2%80%99s-best-jackal-pdw-loadout-for-cod-kings-is-here.969561/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/scump-best-jackal-loadout-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Seth ‘Scump’ Abner is one of the most recognisable Call of Duty pro players of all time. He has amassed millions of followers over a ten-year career that has spanned a dozen Call of Duty games. Recently, he has been enjoying the Black Ops 6 beta and has taken the time to outline his best Jackal PDW loadout, reserved exclusively for the best COD players in the business.</p>



<p>I’m kidding, of course – but <strong>using </strong>Scump’s Jackal build might help you to become one.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-jackal-pdw-loadout-from-a-cod-champion">Best Jackal PDW Loadout From a COD Champion</h2>



<p>Scump has been tearing up Black Ops 6 since the beta went live, streaming for hours on end and snapping some incredible clips. His in-game skill is going the distance in proving why he’s considered the king of Call of Duty esports, and even though he has now retired from competing, he’s still capable of breaking ankles.</p>



<p>Here’s Scump’s Jackal loadout in Black Ops 6:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle – </strong>Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel – </strong>Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine </strong>– Extended Mag II</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip – </strong>CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock – </strong>Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>But what about the best perks to use with the Jackal?</p>



<p>Scump has opted to use the Perk Greed wildcard, synching up with Ghost, Dexterity, Double Time, and Gung-Ho. His ‘speciality’ is Enforcer. He has long been able to rack up huge kill counts in Call of Duty, and that’s where this Jackal build shines. </p>



<p>With the extended magazine, Scump can keep tossing lead downrange, and the other attachments are mostly designed to provide as low recoil as possible. For maximum run and gun action, pair up this Jackal loadout with an Assault Pack field upgrade to stay topped up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-game-youve-never-heard-of-and-its-2024-sequel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>What’s the greatest NES game of all time? Super Mario Bros 3? Perhaps it’s Mega-Man 2, or The Legend of Zelda? There’s almost certainly no definitive answer to the single best game on the console, but what If I told you one of its greatest games was one that not only shattered the perception of what you could achieve on the NES, but was also a game you’ve (probably) never heard of? </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/gimmick-carts-1724853943733.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Original Gimmick! (known as Mr. Gimmick in Sweden) packaging.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Gimmick!, developed by Japanese studio Sunsoft, was a Nintendo Entertainment System masterpiece. But despite critical acclaim – including praise from industry legends Shigeru Miyamoto and Masahiro Sakurai – it was almost immediately forgotten, in no small part thanks to the fact it was only ever released in Japan and one small Scandinavian pocket of the West. Despite its obscurity, though, one Swedish fan not only loved Gimmick!, he obsessed over it. This was more than a mere hobby, too, as he set up his own studio with the lifelong goal of creating the sequel Gimmick! deserved and finally exposing it to the world.</p><p>But the journey wasn’t easy. From being laughed out of a pitch meeting to mass layoffs threatening the studio’s existence, the path to Gimmick! 2 has been as tricky as its notoriously difficult predecessor. </p><p>This is the Inside Story of Gimmick!, the greatest forgotten NES game and its unexpected 2024 sequel. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-1-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite its relative obscurity, Gimmick! <em>is</em> appreciated. It’s regularly mentioned in top lists by hardcore NES enthusiasts and original copies trade on eBay for ungodly amounts of money. Iconic Nintendo game director Shigeru Miyamoto said it was “fun”, extremely high praise from someone who rarely (if at all) praises other people’s games. Kirby and Super Smash Bros visionary Masahiro Sakurai has been even more enthusiastic, saying Gimmick! was “a technical marvel”.</p><p>But what is it about Gimmick! that’s so revered? Why do hardcore fans and industry legends worship a game about a green, star-throwing blob called Yumetaro?</p><p>“It just did a lot of things to stand out,” says Illusory Wall, a Dark Souls YouTuber and huge fan of Gimmick! “It was offering an experience that was unique.” That uniqueness was exemplified by Gimmick!’s star mechanic, a charged projectile that also could serve as a platform to jump off – a rare feature by even today’s standards, but in 1992 it was revolutionary.</p><p>“I can’t think of another platformer on the NES that has anything close to the mechanics of this game,” says Pat the NES Punk, retro Nintendo enthusiast, YouTuber and Gimmick! obsessive. “What’s amazing about the star attack is that it’s based seemingly on realistic physics. It deflects off objects and enemies, it bounces and dissipates.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I firmly believe that Gimmick! would always be on anyone’s top 5 NES game had it been released beyond Japan and Scandinavia.</p></div><p>Gimmick! was more than its star mechanic, though. Not only was it a tight, colourful, and fun platformer equal to many of its peers, but Gimmick! also set new standards for variety and detail. In an era where Super Mario games constantly reused sprites and tile sets, Gimmick! was full of environmental diversity. Each level was unique and also loaded with bespoke one-off moments; moments that often weren’t required, but just added an unprecedented level of depth to each space.  </p><p>“There’s these two sprites at the beginning of level six that don’t exist anywhere else in the game and it’s basically a guy playing with his dog,” explains Illusory Wall. “The dog gets excited for you holding onto the star, it treats it like you’re holding onto a ball – It’ll wag its tail and come after you. The guy is tepid, he doesn’t want to be in your business. The fact that they’re not even trying to attack you adds an extra layer. They feel like these living creatures in the game, they’re not just obstacles.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/guy-and-dog-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"enemy" walking his dog.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“In the second stage, you can knock over the spiny turtle enemy. If you then jump on the legs of the character it’ll kick you in the opposite direction, it’s realistically pushing you off the enemy,” explains Pat the NES Punk. ”There’s no gameplay reason for that to exist in the game. It’s just a cute little touch that other games [of the era] wouldn’t have.”</p><p>Gimmick! is jam-packed with these moments. Its second level even features a Metal Gear Solid-like moment where the end-level boss can be found asleep if you reach him too quickly. Each level is full of detail reserved for only the most ambitious games of today. “I firmly believe that Gimmick! would always be on [anyone’s] top 5 NES game had it been released [beyond Japan and Scandinavia]” claims Pat the NES Punk.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/boss-is-asleep-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sleeping boss on Stage 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Gimmick! fans know it’s special, but despite being a critical hit, the game never reached an audience large enough to gain commercial success. Gimmick! (or Mr. Gimmick! in Sweden) was never released outside of Japan and Sweden. And even in the two countries where it did make it to shelves, its availability was limited. So much so that many of the Swedish developers working on the sequel hadn’t heard of it before they joined the project.</p><p>“I first heard of Gimmick! through a Swedish retro gaming YouTube channel,” says Olof Karlsson, Lead Programmer on Gimmick! 2. ”I grew up playing Nintendo games, and I never played Gimmick! It's like Kirby's Adventure in the quality level, except that no one really knows about it. How?”</p><p>So why was Gimmick!, despite its apparent quality, never widely released in the West? Perhaps it arrived too late into the NES’s lifecycle, or was an unfortunate victim of cost-saving measures. According to Sunsoft’s former vice president of development in America, David Siller, the company's managers felt the game's characters were too "strange or quirky". For a game aimed at children, this – paired with the elevated difficulty level – perhaps didn’t present well for its target audience. That’s right, Gimmick! Is hard. <em>REALLY </em>hard.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Despite its cute looks Gimmick! is more of a Castlevania than a Kirby.</p></div><p>“It's a game that looks cute and colourful – probably most analogous to Kirby on the NES. But Kirby was more reasonable to get through,” explains Illusory Wall. “Despite its cute looks [Gimmick! is] more of a Castlevania than a Kirby.”</p><p>“The difficulty of Mr. Gimmick was one of its advertising features,” recalls Pat the NES Punk. In fact, an ominous warning was even on the back of the original box: <em>“Every game you played before has only prepared you for this ultimate challenge. You’ll call on many skills, techniques and tricks you’ve learned to help Mr. Gimmick survive the evil onslaught. Only the strong will survive and only the very best will experience the secret ending.” </em></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/back-of-the-box-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Despite the positive critical reception Gimmick has received over time, its inevitable lack of commercial success never presented an opportunity for a sequel. Gimmick!, like many forgotten gems of its era, faded into obscurity, with Sunsoft leaving Yumetaro to gather decades worth of dust. 30 years later, though, one hardcore Swedish fan had different ideas…</p><p>“I didn't own Gimmick!, I [only] played it at a friend's house, but I truly remember the characters in the game. They were so much alive compared to [other] games,” says Niklas Istenes, the CEO and founder of Bitwave Games and creator of Gimmick! 2. “[Later on] when I started to collect games I finally bought the cart and I remembered I loved it. I watched speedruns, I watched people highlighting the secrets, I was so intrigued by how many details there are in this game. It was my go-to title when people came over and saw my retro collection. I always brought out my Gimmick! [cartridge] first.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/nik-retro-1724853943733.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Niklas Istenes, CEO and founder of Bitwave Games.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It’s clear that Istenes is a super fan of Gimmick!, and that was reinforced when IGN visited the Gimmick!-filled Bitwave office in February of 2023. But the dots still needed connecting. How had this small, Swedish developer –- who at the time had only released one game called Pictoparty on the Wii U – been allowed to create the sequel to a forgotten, Japanese, Nintendo cult classic?</p><p>“I had no idea if Sunsoft was still around, maybe they're bankrupt or something?” shares Istenes. “Maybe they don't care anymore about their old IPs? So I wrote… not even a pitch, it was more of like, ’Hey, do you still have this IP? We're interested in doing a sequel. What's the royalty cost, yada, yada, yada.’”</p><p>“My proposition was around $10,000. They're like, ‘No, that's small fry for us. You're a nobody. You made a party game on Wii U. No way you're getting one of our most cherished IPs.’ I don't know what I expected. It was a shot in the dark.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The vision of my company was to do the sequel Gimmick!, so that's what I pitched.</p></div><p>Istenes’ attempt was bold and certainly naive. He explained that Bitwave Games (previously known as Retroid Interactive) was built on a foundation of his love for Gimmick!. He would often wax lyrical about the forgotten platformer to his colleagues, and now it appeared his dream of making a sequel was now dead. But a few years later, right in the eye of the Covid pandemic storm - an event that threatened the studio's very survival -  there was a glimmer of hope…</p><p>“It was a very low period, and there was a lot of talk of whether we should just close down" recalls Istenes. “I didn't know what I was supposed to do. So I reached out to a friend called Martin Lindell. Martin came back and he was like, ‘I started at Embracer. Could you pitch your company to us?’ The vision of my company was to do the sequel Gimmick!, so that's what I pitched.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/doohickey-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Embracer Group is a large Swedish game licensing company that, at one time, was making an unfathomable number of acquisitions, Bitwave being one of them. Embracer not only liked what Bitwave had to offer, but was on board with trying to get the rights to a Gimmick! sequel.  It immediately got to work putting Istenes in front of Sunsoft to pitch the concept after an undisclosed, but no doubt significantly improved offer.</p><p>“I couldn't see how they reacted because it was a very small window in Microsoft Teams, and they were all wearing face masks,” recalls Istenes, describing his awkward videocall pitch to Sunsoft. “The translator also had an issue with her camera, so she had to turn it off. Then her default image was a cat, so it was like a cat was translating it. It was just weird. They could feel my passion for the game, though, and I think that's what truly nailed it in the end.”</p><p>Finally, a lifelong dream could be realised. Bitwave Games could now create a sequel to the long-forgotten masterpiece. There was just one problem… they now had to make a game that not only honoured the original, but one that surpassed it…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-2-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“We wanted it to stand on its own. We want it to be a fun platforming game that appeals to everyone,” explains Lead Programmer Olof Karlsson. “ We want it to be accessible, but also a true sequel. We don't want [fans of the original] to feel like we've massacred their boy. It should be like, ‘Wow, they really took this to a new direction but it's still Gimmick!.’”	</p><p>The passion for Gimmick! 2 at the Bitwave office during our visit was undeniable, but it was all built on the foundation of their love of the original. Istenes is proud of the space, particularly his treasured retro collection. And of course, the items that took pride of place were his valuable original editions of Gimmick!.</p><p>“I bought the PAL version first. It was $250,” recalls Istenes. “The guy who sold it had no idea what he had on his hands. He was cleaning his mother's basement, found a bunch of NES games he played when he was young, and decided to sell them on Tradera [Scandinavia’s eBay equivalent]. He was [very confused about] why this was so special.”</p><p>He wasn’t the only person struggling to understand the second-hand value of this long-forgotten cartridge. Gimmick! recently featured on the Swedish TV show, Bytt är bytt, A.K.A Trash or Treasure. It’s a show that tasks contestants to estimate the value of antique objects. Not only had the contestant, despite being a self-proclaimed NES fan, never heard of Gimmick!, but the host also openly declared it “The game that nobody wanted”. But Istenes wanted it. And he didn’t just want the Swedish edition, he wanted the definitive release.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/bytt-quote-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>“The Japanese version is the version you need because it has an extra sound chip,” reveals Istenes, pointing out that only the Famicom edition featured the revolutionary YM2149 sound processor, a piece of hardware that doubled the game’s audio channels. And when Istenes finally acquired his very own Japanese version, inside the collector's item’s case was more than just an enhanced Gimmick! cartridge. The seller had included a secret note…</p><p><em>"Hi, Niklas, my name is Takumi Hamada. Thank you bid. I'm very happy. I want to be friends with people around the world on eBay. Please contact bullshit. I always want to Japanese products. I help you anytime. Arigato."</em></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/japanese-notes-1724856838600.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><em>Hidden note from the Japanese eBay seller.</em></figcaption></figure></output><p>“He wanted to be friends with me on eBay,” says Istenes, smiling from ear to ear. “If you're out there, thank you very much for this amazing product, which does not contain any bullshit at all!”</p><p>Gimmick! was more than a game to Istenes. It was nostalgia in its purest form, reminding him of the time he spent enjoying the game with his childhood friend. Decades later, Gimmick! was still helping him forge friendships. “When I joined, it was just Niklas and Gustav and both of them were consultants,” explains Karlsson. “I was the only one working in-house. The reason I joined this company was because I wanted to work with Niklas.”</p><p>The Gimmick! 2 team was quickly being assembled, but by the time production of the long overdue sequel was in full swing Istenes obtained perhaps his greatest coup: “I reached out to a composer I used to work with, but he was too busy for the project,” says Istenes, “He told me to shoot for the stars though. Which composer would I want to work on a game like this? I thought it would be cool to work with someone like David Wise.”</p><p>It was clear that Istenes had no problem shooting for the stars. After already successfully getting the rights to his dream game, he boldly reached out to the iconic David Wise; the video game composer famous for soundtracks such as Donkey Kong Country and Battletoads. He was Istenes’ dream composer. And, perhaps to his surprise, Wise immediately said ‘yes’. </p><p>”I love [classic] Nintendo games and working on the platform,” says Wise. “It was an easy ‘Yep, I want to be involved.’"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The pair immediately got to work on finding Gimmick! 2’s unique musical tone, looking for the sweet spot between the original and the sequel's two countries of origin. “I've made sure I've used this wonderful instrument called the Nyckelharpa,” explains Wise, referring to a Swedish instrument whose name translates to ‘key harp’. “It’s like a violin, but it's got these little wooden switches on them. It's got its own ethereal sound and I was very keen to get that into the soundtrack.” </p><p>“I remember playing Donkey Kong Country and listening to the aquatic theme that he made and doing fan drawings when I was in school,” says Istenes. “It was just so amazing to be working with him.” </p><p>Not only had Istenes got the rights to make his dream sequel, but he had also struck a deal with his dream composer. Gimmick! 2’s production was progressing well. So well, in fact, that it was only a matter of time until disaster struck…</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/part-3-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In June 2023, Embracer Group announced a restructuring program, making significant cuts to the entire workforce across all of its acquired studios. Unfortunately, staff at Bitwave Games were among the many casualties, losing half of their colleagues in one fell swoop. Gimmick! 2 was immediately put in jeopardy. </p><p>“When the news hit it was scary,” explains Istenes. “I didn't know exactly how it would affect the studio. It wasn't like I had a list of people that I knew would have to leave. But since it's a monetary situation, it needed to happen fast.”</p><p>“It was one of the darkest days in the history of our company,” says Senior Game Developer, Hampus Lidin. “I don't think we’d had such a huge setback before.” It was a setback that caused Lead Programmer Olof Karlsson to feel a little lost: “I was very confused about how to handle this. How do I feel? What am I supposed to feel?" </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It was one of the darkest days in the history of our company.</p></div><p>“People who had to leave were a part of the company for five years, and there are some staff members that'd been a part of the project from the beginning,” shares Istenes. “You kind of just have to shut off your human part of the situation.” </p><p>Understandably, this was a tough pill to swallow for the affected staff. But Istenes was also deeply troubled by the situation, as he’d always thought of Embracer as the studio's saviour. In a single moment, everything was turned upside down. “I'm not blaming Embracer for what happened,” says Istenes. “It's external forces and how the industry is. My relationship with Embracer is still very good. They're just pivoting as well to just try to make the best out of a situation. Some hard calls needed to be made.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/embracer-1724853943735.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Embracer's June 2023 restructuring statement.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Six months had passed since we first visited the studio in February of 2023, and since then the Embracer cuts hadn’t been the only bad news for the production of Gimmick! 2. During that time, Lead Programmer Olaf Karlsson had stepped away from the project due to burnout, only to later return out of necessity after the layoffs.</p><p>“The fact that I only lasted six months before burning out was heartbreaking,” explains Karlsson. “I came back as a result of the layoffs. Niklas approached me and said, ‘I know that you burnt out on this previous project and that you didn't want to hear about it anymore, but could you consider coming back?’ And I was like, ’Yes, of course.’"</p><p>Gimmick! 2 had stalled, and there was a genuine fear that this labour of love might never make it to the finish line. But there was still an underlying determination from its leader to see it through, and that passion emanated through the entire studio. “I don't really want to work on something unless I feel like everyone around me really wants to do it,” says Karlsson. “To have the CEO want to do it this much [gives you] a level of engagement that you otherwise wouldn't really get.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It doesn't just feel like something wearing the old game’s skin. It feels like a true sequel to Gimmick!</p></div><p>Surprisingly, despite the hurdles, Gimmick! 2 got back on track fast, with Istenes – in a desperate attempt to save his dream – introducing a pivot into production.</p><p>“I want it to be the best game ever,” says Istenes. ”I want every idea that I have to be in the game, which makes it very, very hard to design a game like that. When the news broke, I knew we could still [finish] the game, but we needed to pivot back to the roots and focus more on gameplay. It was pretty clear from the beginning what we needed to cut in the game to still make it great and as long and enjoyable as we wanted it to be.”</p><p>The pivot back to a gameplay focus allowed the Bitwave team to refocus on their original vision, cut out the unnecessary bells and whistles, and double down on the core experience that made the original so beloved. “It feels more true. It feels more like a sequel.” explains Karlsson. “It doesn't just feel like something wearing the old game’s skin. It feels like a true sequel to Gimmick!. We can actually finish this still. This is doable.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Gimmick! 2 is fast approaching. In fact, there’s a good chance it’s available for you to play right now. Despite the hardships, the whole project has been built with consistent passion. Whether it was a love of the original’s design, technology, hardware, or just plain nostalgia, Bitwave Games has been built on the foundation of Yumetaro, and that love bleeds through every frame of the sequel.</p><p>“The opportunity to work on Gimmick! 2 was a once-in-a-lifetime experience,” explains Karlsson.”I think what will make it special is a combination of what we're aiming for; a very tight, mechanically interesting and fun platforming game with amazing visuals and a beautiful soundtrack composed by f**king David Wise of all people. How did we get David Wise? It's incredible.”</p><p>“I hope it captures the same spirit of the original,” says Pat the NES Punk. “ I hope it seems like a world of wonder with interesting enemies and characters you encounter along the way.” </p><p>“I hope people will learn more about the original one,” says Istenes. “I think this will be a much better game in more than one sense. But I hope people will play this, enjoy the game, and then go back and play the original game. And, hopefully, we’ll make a sequel to this one as well!”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We didn't pick this to be the game that would make us the richest studio in Gothenburg.</p></div><p>For better or worse, Gimmick! 2 fulfils a lifelong ambition. Time will tell if the sequel will create its own lasting impact like its predecessor, or perhaps even exceed the original’s legacy. We don’t know if Bitwave Games will thrive or fall under the weight of an ever-evolving industry, and we don’t know if Gimmick! will ever truly receive all the praise it so clearly deserves. What we <em>do</em> know is that Yumetaro started a dream. A dream that built a studio, helped craft a vision decades in the making, and forged an assortment of beautiful friendships. </p><p>Not bad for a barely released, forgotten ‘90s game about an anthropomorphic, star-throwing green blob.</p><p>“This game has always been a project of the studio's heart,” says Istenes. “We didn't pick this to be the game that would make us the richest studio in Gothenburg. It’s to set a trend of how we make high-quality games, that's what we're aiming for here. As long as some people enjoy playing the game, and get a fun player experience from it, then I'm happy.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/28/gimmick-relfecting-1724853943734.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><em>Thank you to Pat the NES Punk, Illusory Wall, Pekachow, David Wise, Niklas Istenes, and everyone at Bitwave Games for their time. Special thank you to Jesse Gomez for production and Andréas Göransson for sharing the story.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Let’s be honest, Jackbox games have always been pretty naughty, if you’re playing with the right people, but Jackbox Games aren’t flirting with us anymore. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/jackbox-naughty-pack">Jackbox Naughty Pack</a> is full frontal naughtiness, right down to the 69 pence or cents in the price tags.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Jackbox Naughty Pack | Official Trailer (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FTAYOPKYDuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is a smaller collection than usual, with just three games included instead of five, but as everyone knows, it’s not about how how big the package is, but what you do with it. Jackbox Games has adapted two series staples with Dirty Drawful and Fakin’ It All Night Long, and come up with a brand new game, Let Me Finish, for the climax.</p>


<p>Dirty Drawful is, well, it’s Drawful but with dirtier suggestions than usual. Players are each given a prompt that they then need to try and draw on their phones, with each drawing then being shown to all players who try to come up with what the original prompt is. All those answers are then voted on by the group, who vote on which one they think was actually correct. Points happen, and everyone has a little giggle along the way from the blend of bad art and bad jokes.</p>
<p>But things are a bit naughtier now with opening prompts like “And God pisseth out the universe” and “Colon, I’m home!” which are… quite tricky concepts to get across with stick figures and wobbly lines. Sex, drugs and plenty more are going to appear in the full prompt list, and you’ll be very glad to hear that yes, there is an undo button this time.</p>


<p>Fakin’ It All Night Long is in the same vein, a filthier and slightly weirder version of the social deduction of Fakin’ It. Everyone gets a secret task, but one person gets a fake task and has to try to blend in with their response, with the category determining if you have to type out a response, raise a hand, a finger count – a ‘Finger Blast’ as it were – or respond with emoji in Emojinal Damage. Given how vague and multipurpose emoji can be, this one can lead to quite a lot of debate… Regardless of the category, you’re trying to read everyone else’s response, how quick they were to answer, how realistic they’re being, and between you deduce who it is that is the imposter for that round.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that you’re going to want to play this with a very particular group of friends, given how adult the questioning and prompts can be through Naughty Pack, but there’s an interesting pacing needed through the modes. The modes should start off relatively restrained before getting filthier through the game mode, the team told us at Gamescom, and they shouldn’t be too deeply personal. There’s no straight up question over a person’s ‘body count’, but there might be something about if you’ve had sex in a bathroom, for example, or more about personal preferences in the bedroom. Additionally, there is a streaming mode, content filters that will ensure that it’s safer for public consumption.</p>

<p>All in all, the prompts that we saw in our hands on time at Gamescom were on the more tame end of the scale, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UK52_wJqL_0">seeing the team playing the games at PAX West</a> this weekend has shown off just how far the prompts can go – “From 1-5, with 5 being every time, how often do you come from head alone?” is pretty darned personal, if you ask me, while “Raise your hand if you would totes f*** a vampire” is in that playful nonsense category.</p>
<p>Onto the final game mode, Let Me Finish. This new game is a presentation style mode that gets filthy in a more abstract fashion. You’re given a picture, like a set of tools, and then get asked “Which of these tools likes a finger up the butt the best?” Or a stacked plate of nachos and the query “Where do these nachos snort cocaine into?” Complete nonsense, of course, like some of the best bizarre conversational tangents at the end of a long night out taken a few steps further. Two players are then thrown into a debate and can put their case forward using their phone to act as a laser pointer and temporary drawing tool, but other players are able to jump in and try to steal the question away as well.</p>

<p>Importantly for players around the world, Jackbox Naughty Pack is localised through French, Italian, German, Latin American Spanish and Castilian Spanish. That’s excellent news, but has been an interesting challenge for Jackbox Games and their established translation partners. There’s just so much slang that needs to be translated, with such a range of vulgarity that can go from playful to outright offensive. Striking the right balance there has led to a fair bit of back and forth, the team told us.</p>
<p>This is all a big experiment for Jackbox Games after a decade of releases in the main series, to see how much of an audience there is for this kind of thing. Bizarrely enough, as risqué as the topics might be, it feels like Jackbox is playing it safe with a smaller 3-game bundle, only one of which comes with a new title and theme. That’s potentially a bit disappointing, but if it’s successful, Jackbox could get a bit more adventurous with more naughty times in future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-may-have-only-sold-25-000-copies-analysts-say.969546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-sales-25000-analysts-estimate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a recent breakdown from industry analysts, it was estimated that Concord – Sony’s floundering multiplayer shooter that was just released – may have only sold around 25,000 copies. It has been the talk of the town for several days, with Concord being released to a woeful reception and barely scraping up an all-time high player count of 697 users on PC.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, just 82 people were playing Concord on PC, and an analyst from Circana mentioned that when the game was released, ‘fewer than 0.2% of active PS5 players’ were on the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-failing-to-take-off">Failing To Take Off</h2>



<p>In the figures <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">handed to IGN</a>, it was suggested that on Steam, around 10,000 copies of Concord had been sold, while on PlayStation, around 15,000 were estimated to have shipped.</p>



<p>Offering a key insight into the shoddy performance, Circana’s Mat Piscatella explained that Concord has ‘low awareness and purchase intent among video game players.’ Basically, nobody knows it exists and they don’t want to buy it if they do. With Concord being a new IP, it didn’t have an existing fan base to pick from, and starting from scratch needed an <strong>intense </strong>marketing campaign.</p>



<p>That just wasn’t there for Concord.</p>



<p>Even the first real trailers for the game only emerged at the end of May, giving players just a couple of months to understand the title before deciding if they wanted to invest in it. Unlike many other shooters making it to the market now, Concord has a premium price point, but free-to-play games are doing much better at present.</p>



<p>In a statement, Rhys Elliott of Midia Research explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A tight-knit group of players might be willing to take a chance on a new game for free, but paying $40 is a big ask in today’s macroeconomic climate. Launching Concord as a premium game limited its audience numbers and user acquisition. The more people who play a game, the more appealing it is. Network effects are crucial for building a healthy, engaged ecosystem. </p>



<p>Concord should have launched free-to-play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What are your thoughts on the topic? Do you think Concord might have succeeded if it was released as a free-to-play shooter supported by a live-service operating model?</p>

<p>Larian has revealed that the long-awaited seventh patch for Baldur’s Gate 3 will start rolling out next week. It’ll be deployed first on PC, with the team stressing that ‘it’ll take a little longer’ to apply the update on console. Patch 7 has been talked about for a few months, but now that it’s finally here, it’s about to bring countless changes and additions to the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-supporting-mods">Supporting Mods</h2>



<p>Larian confirmed several weeks ago that ‘Patch 7’ will contain official mod support, which is a boon for PC players worldwide. This includes support and various tools for modders to take advantage of.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the more dastardly players out there will be pleased to learn that Patch 7 introduces fresh cinematics and tweaks for the game’s ‘evil’ endings. </p>



<p>As you might expect, Patch 7 will also deliver a host of quality-of-life changes and some optimisations on the companion front. It’s believed that this could be one of the final few major updates for Baldur’s Gate 3, especially as Larian is now done with the series. It was confirmed a while ago that the studio won’t release any expansions or DLC for the award-winning game.</p>



<p>While Larian’s Swen Vincke confirmed Patch 7 will be released ‘next week’, he neglected to provide a more specific date, but we should have that information very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24232337/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-nintendo-switch-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sure, it’s not straight-up horror as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/10/24195658/close-enough-welcome-back-slenderman">the early teasers suggested</a>, but even still, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24195883/emio-nintendo-smiling-man-switch-famicom-detective-club-date"><em>Emio — The Smiling Man</em></a> is among the darkest games Nintendo has ever made. It’s a murder mystery that doesn’t skimp on the murder and throws in an unsettling urban legend for good measure. More than that, though, it’s just a really great mystery on a platform that has steadily become an ideal home for them.</p><p><em>Emio</em> is actually the continuation of a decades-old franchise from Nintendo called <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>. Created by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"><em>Metroid</em> designer Yoshio Sakamoto</a>, the games originally never launched outside of Japan, until <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435952/famicom-detective-club-review-nintendo-switch">a pair of surprise remakes hit the Switch in 2021</a>. <em>Emio</em> is the first entirely new entry in the franchise since the late ’80s — but even still, not a lot has changed.</p><p>As with its predecessors, <em>Emio</em> plays out like a visual novel, where your actions are determined by a series of verbs on a menu. This is how you “look” at a crime scene or “ask” a witness questions or “review” your notes. Sometimes, the actions are contextual — you can’t talk to someone if there’s no one there — but there are almost always a few things you can do at any given moment. If not, you can always “think.”</p><p>It’s not the most elegant way to engage with the world, but it is functional. It also necessitates a lot of reading and repetition. You often have to press witnesses by asking the same questions over and over, and the only way to learn what happened is to listen to people. That combination is something of an acquired taste, and also one that only really works with the right narrative — which is where <em>Emio</em> shines.</p><p>The game tells the story of a series of murders involving a killer who both wears a paper bag with a creepy smiley face and also puts one on his victims. At the outset of the game, a recent killing appears to connect to a series of murders 18 years prior and also possibly ties into an urban legend about a person named Emio who kills with nearly identical methods. You play as a young assistant of a private investigator, working alongside the police to put the various pieces together.</p><p>Because there are so many moving parts and — at first — only loose theories holding them together, I had a lot of fun doing all of the asking, looking, and reviewing. It’s very satisfying when things click into place. There are plentiful threads to pull on, which shift the story into even darker and more disturbing directions as the scope becomes clear. Even without the horror element, there’s plenty to be creeped out about in <em>Emio</em>.</p><p>The game also joins a sizable lineup of similar mysteries on the Switch, which feel right at home due to its portable nature, like the video game equivalent of a good book. Outside of <em>Famicom Detective Club</em>, there’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597736/the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-review-switch-ps4-steam"><em>Ace Attorney</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"><em>Murder by Numbers</em></a>, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/20/23689348/coffee-talk-episode-2-review-ps5-xbox-switch-steam"><em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, to name a few. <em>Emio</em>’s gameplay might feel a touch dated in comparison, but its core mystery carries it through.</p><p><small>Emio — The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club <em>is available now on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Discord wants to share your recent playtime with your friends.</p>
<p>Discord's activity tracker now displays not only the games you've been playing over the last 30 days, but also long you've been playing them, too.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you've returned to a game after a hiatus, your tracker will indicate to your pals that you've made a comeback.</p>

<p>Just click on your friend's profile in your Friends List, and the pop-up will reveal how long they've been playing - or possibly idling in, going on the example from my own list below - the last game they opened.</p>

<p>For those less keen to share - or perhaps have their boss on their Discord friends list - you can turn the activity log off by going to Activity Settings &gt; Activity Privacy &gt; Activity Status, and turn off "share your detected activities with others" and "share your activity status by default when joining large servers".</p>
<p>Discord has also partnered with Amazon Music Unlimited to launch a new Amazon Music Listening Party activity, with a free three-month trial (availability will vary, though, I'm afraid). You can also proudly link your RPG Roll20 accounts, too.</p>
<p>At the end of last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-latest-discord-feature-update-brings-direct-friend-calling-and-more">Microsoft confirmed it was expanding Discord support on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One</a> with a number of new features, including a consolidated Xbox and Discord friends list.</p>
<p>Furthermore, once the update is available, it'll be possible to initiate a Discord call, jump straight into a voice channel, or watch a friend streaming directly from the Xbox Friends list.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In recent hours, news regarding mass layoffs at OpTic Gaming has started to surface on social media. While the organisation has yet to confirm how many employees have been impacted by the action, some have claimed that it impacts merchandising, graphic design, and e-commerce teams.</p>



<p>On Twitter, event management staff working at ‘ESA’, the Esports Stadium Arlington, have also reported being laid off from their jobs at OpTic Gaming.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-round">Another Round</h2>



<p>When 2023 kicked off, OpTic Gaming let go of several staff members, following a trend that had surfaced at the time that was seeing thousands of esports and gaming industry employees laid off from their jobs. Back then, it wasn’t confirmed by the company how many people were dismissed, and it looks like the same operating model is being deployed this time.</p>



<p>On social media, several former OpTic Gaming employees have posted heartfelt messages following their dismissal from the company:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Guess today makes it official. It's my last with OpTic. I hope I inspired at least one person during this historic run. </p><p>It's been 2 years full of blood, sweat, tears, and laughter. </p><p>Taking the week to get things sorted and then we're back better than ever. </p><p>Love y'all, it was… <a href="https://t.co/JKYGASuBGN">pic.twitter.com/JKYGASuBGN</a></p></div>— Gerbz (@CallmeGerbz) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallmeGerbz/status/1830014999986663780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Some fans have been quick to criticise OpTic Gaming, with claims of mismanagement flying around on social platforms. It has been claimed that one of the heaviest hit teams is the staff at the Esports Stadium Arlington, the largest esports facility in North America. In 2022, OpTic Gaming secured the management of the stadium, and in 2023, it served as the site for a COD League Major.</p>



<p>On Twitter, Jacob Hale suggested that the layoffs have hit ‘mainly talent, upper management, and some production staff’.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to representatives of OpTic Gaming for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/we-build-lego-great-deku-tree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>At last. The LEGO Great Deku Tree, available exclusively at the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMKGY?object_uuid=93316706-e5a7-40b0-8ea1-3a6b7dc896b2&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Store</u></a>, is the first of its kind – a Nintendo-themed set that doesn't concern a certain turtle-stomping, mustachioed plumber. Instead, we're transported to a medieval land ruled by prophecy, fate, and magic. For thousands of years, our heroes, Link and Zelda, have saved Hyrule from the forces of evil. </p><div catalogid="a354f9e4-c347-41a8-9501-e2ef3cec9a91" id="201337"><div id="201337" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>LEGO Great Deku Tree Set</h3></p><div><p>With this 2-in-1 set, you can build the Great Deku Tree in the style of Ocarina of Time or Breath of the Wild with the same pieces.</p></div></div><p>The Great Deku Tree was a key ally in four of their most acclaimed adventures: <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> (1998), <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker">The Wind Waker</a> (2003), <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a> (2017), and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> (2023). And accordingly, this set includes Easter eggs from across the franchise. It would appeal to any 3D Zelda fan, regardless of which series entry they grew up exploring.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 1</h3></div></output></p><p>The LEGO Great Deku Tree gives you two build options. In the first option, you build the Tree as it appeared in Ocarina of Time, where, in its dying moments, it summoned Link and sent him on his quest to defeat Ganon. The first boss battle, against the Queen Gohma, takes place inside the Tree.</p><p>In the second option, you build the Tree as it appeared in Breath of the Wild, standing watch over the Master Sword. This iteration of the Great Deku Tree is covered in pink leaves rather than green, and its root structure is more extensive and tangled, although its base is less solid and stout, like a swamp tree that's evolved to survive in water. Perhaps over thousands of years, the ecosystem of the forest changed, even as the characters that inhabited it recurred.</p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 2</h3></div></output></p><p>The two builds are split into 22 bags. You cannot build both trees at the same time; there is extensive overlap, especially in the beginning and middle portions of each build, that prevent this from happening. You get a single, thick instruction book for both builds. There are no stickers in this build; all illustrations are printed directly onto the bricks themselves.</p><p>The two Great Deku Trees are not, canonically speaking, the same character; each new iteration of the Deku Tree grows from a seed and sprout of the prior one. They are all descended from one another, and thus, it is fitting that the first halves of both builds are identical. You start by laying down the forest floor and the base of the tree. </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>We Build LEGO The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree - Part 3</h3></div></output></p><p>You also build two miniature builds separate from the main tree, and no matter which tree iteration you decide to go with, you will not have to 'recycle' them; these two miniatures will accompany the final build regardless. The first miniature is Link's forest house from Ocarina of Time, which contains a box to store his supplies, including a hookshot, a bomb, red and blue potions, and a compass. It also comes with Navi the Fairy, which you can swap to be green, blue, or yellow, depending on whether Link is talking, searching, or fighting enemies. </p><p>The second miniature is of the pedestal in Breath of the Wild, where Link finds the Master Sword in Korok Forest. You also build Hestu (complete with his maracas) and Korok creatures that dot the forest floor.</p><p>The Great Deku Tree set comes with a total of four minifigures. You get a Breath of the Wild Link and a Breath of the Wild Zelda in their signature teal tunics, and you get two iterations of Ocarina Link – Young Link, whose tunic comes with a skirt piece around its waist, and Adult Link, who you can display with the titular Ocarina. </p><p>The minifigures come with numerous weapon accessories. In addition to the supplies in the various trunks and boxes, you have three options for swords – a short sword, the Kokiri sword, and the Master Sword – and three options for shields – the Traveler's Shield, the Deku Shield, and the Hylian Shield with its signature crest.</p><p>After the first nine bags, you're directed to branch off and choose either the Breath of the Wild build or the Ocarina build. If you decide to go with the former, you proceed right on to Bag 10, and you continue building up through Bag 19, in linear order. The final Breath of the Wild tree contains two remote Bomb Rune and a Sheikah Slate in hidden compartments along the tree's base. There's a tribute to the Riddles of Hyrule sidequest in the tree's head. At the bottom of the tree is the Navel, which includes the General Shoppe, Spore Store, and Inn. The tree itself is rigged so that when you push down on a lever at the back, its eyebrows and mouth move. Lastly, you build four smaller trees that decorate the surrounding area.</p><p>If you decide on the Ocarina build, you take a more circuitous route to the end result. After Bag 19, you open Bags 10, 14, and 23 at the same time. Then Bag 13. Then Bag 16. Then Bags 17, 20, and 21. And then lastly, Bag 22. </p><p>The Ocarina tree comes with its own set of game-specific Easter eggs. The tree's hidden compartments contain a fairy bow and a staff notes musical representation of "Saria's Song." The bottom of the tree is a dungeon, with a treasure chest that holds a Fairy Slingshot and a massive Skulltula that drops from the ceiling via a catch-and-release mechanism. </p><p>Outside, instead of additional trees, there's a Gossip Stone and two carnivorous Deku Babas to eat Link if he gets too close. Lastly, the tree's mouth opens into a doorway so that Link can crawl inside and explore.</p><p>If there is a drawback to this set, it's that once you build one version of the set, you will feel hard-pressed to build the other. For the sake of this review, I managed it, but it required me to exercise foresight; I got a bunch of Zip-Loc bags and address labels to keep track of what went where. </p><p>So right now, I have the leftover pieces from Bags 10, 14, and 23 in a single bag. If I take apart the current tree, I'll have to match up my tree with the instruction booklet's tree to figure out what went there, and then rebag and regroup them. But even that doesn't completely solve the problem, unless I separate everything into three piles, piece by piece. It'll be a slow go, and that's if I don't lose a couple of pieces in the transition. So I probably won't. Doing it once was enough.</p><p>If I had to choose which was the "better" build, it's the Breath of the Wild tree. It's more colorful and detailed, and its facial expressions are more animated. But that said, both trees are an impressive sight. And if you grew up with Ocarina of Time, then that's the tree you're building. Your nostalgia will make the final decision for you.</p><p>LEGO Great Deku Tree 2-in-1, Set #77092, retails for $299.99, and it is composed of 2500 pieces. It is available exclusively at the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMKGY?object_uuid=93316706-e5a7-40b0-8ea1-3a6b7dc896b2&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>LEGO Store</u></a>.

        <p>That's Monday. Space Monday.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Another week, another Steam Fest looms. From September 2st until the 9rd you'll be able to find intergalactic discounts and demos in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration/">Steam Space Exploration Fest</a>.

<p>The sale isn't live yet, but the trailer above provides a glimpse of some of the games featured. I highly recommend the awkward-to-type ΔV: Rings Of Saturn, a physics-based 2D space mining sim about venturing ever further into an asteroid field. Sin adored it in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/v-rings-of-saturn-review">ΔV: Review Of Saturn</a>, and Sin is never wrong.
</p>
<p>I am often wrong, so you may disagree with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exo-one-review-a-gorgeous-sci-fi-marble-run-that-lacks-pace-or-friction">my negative assessment of interplanetary marble run Exo One</a>, also featured above. I thought it was an impressive screensaver.
</p>
<p>There are many more games in the trailer that I haven't played. For example, I did a double take and had to rewind a bit when The Invincible showed up at the end. That looks fancy, doesn't it? How will I know the cadence of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">how often Julian is wrong</a> if I don't give it a go myself?
</p>
<p>This <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/space_exploration/">page on Steam</a> will be the home of the sale once it goes live on Monday. I'm telling you this now because otherwise we'll forget and not write about it again until the sale is half over, and because maybe this way you'll save your pennies tomorrow rather than blowing them all on riding the Peppa Pig car at the local garden centre. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're the kind of person who prepares for spooky season the same day the pumpkin spice latte hits cafes, you probably want to have <em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em> on your radar--and it's nothing like the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow">super cute <em>Bloomburrow </em>set</a>.</p>
<p><em>Duskmourn </em>is the upcoming spooky set for Wizards of the Coast's biggest trading card game, and it's inspired by modern horror from the '80s and beyond. While that's obvious in its art and card frames, arguably my favorite thematic element is one of its new mechanics: Manifest Dread.</p>
<p>There are a few other mechanics and details that Wizards revealed today at a PAX West panel, and I'll go over some of those details here as well. But first, let's manifest some dread.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hauntwoods-shrieker-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=dZidHRfp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hauntwoods-shrieker-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=rWBIbgHy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bonus: Certain cards have a Monstrous Reflection alternate, where the art is from the monster's point of view.</figcaption></figure><h2>Manifest Dread Is a Tricker's Dream</h2>
<p>Longtime <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> players might remember the Manifest mechanic, which also appeared recently in <em>Modern Horizons 3</em>. Manifest Dread is a variant that will be introduced in <em>Duskmourn</em>.</p>
<p>Manifest Dread lets you take the top two cards of your deck and choose one to put face down as a 2/2 colorless, typeless creature. The other gets put face up in your graveyard. That face-down card can be revealed by paying its mana cost, if it's a creature.</p>
<p>It's simple on its face, but the beauty is in the mystery it creates. If I pull a 6/6 creature and a land, I'd probably put the 6/6 creature face down to reveal it later. That seems like the easy answer for maximum viability.</p>
<p>But what if I put that 6/6 creature in the graveyard face up? Obviously, that face down card has to be something insane, right? And to my opponent, that's a scary move--one that might manifest some dread, even.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/razorkin-needlehead-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=hOaln1xt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/razorkin-needlehead-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=ZdnSAHK9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Another card with a Monstrous Reflection variant.</figcaption></figure><p>I love this mechanic because of how much it plays into the horror tropes that <em>Duskmourn </em>is all about. It builds anticipation and tension for your opponents, who have no idea if you're bluffing or getting ready for a game-winning move.</p>
<p>Previously, Wizards shared the Impending mechanic that's part of <em>Duskmourn</em>, which similarly ties into the theme. You can play a card at a lower cost, but it won't really be active until a certain number of turns have passed.</p>
<p>It's another way to build anticipation, but it's the fear of something the opponent knows. A spell cast with Impending is cast face up. But when it comes in face down? I mean, every horror fan knows how terrifying the fear of the unknown is.</p>

<p>In the first look article that Wizards posted, they revealed that the House of Horror is indeed just one house--a house that spans the entire plane. To bring that house to life, a new Enchantment type is coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>: Rooms.</p>
<p>Room cards are split cards (the ones that are horizontal and feature two cards in one), and when you cast it, you choose which side to pay for. Then when it enters on the field, the other side is "locked." You can open the door by paying the other side's mana cost (as a sorcery).</p>
<p>Room cards provide ongoing effects and practically act as two enchantments in one. The art on them is also pretty scary, with the "split" promising to feature some scary hidden easter eggs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enduring-innocence-enduring-curiosity-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=betuDV9m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enduring-innocence-enduring-curiosity-magic-the-gathering-duskmourn.jpg?itok=O-2OseQf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other Enchantments play a big role in&nbsp;<em>Duskmourn</em>. Additionally, certain cards, like Enduring Innocence and Enduring Curiosity, have alternate art from a Japanese artist.</figcaption></figure><p>Enchantments were a big idea in Duskmourn, according to Head Designer Mark Rosewater. It just felt thematically on point to focus on them, creating a sort of "enchanted," spooky theme. There are even more Enchantment Creatures, too.</p>
<p>To add to the atmosphere, Eerie is a new effect coming to some cards, which trigger whenever an Enchantment enters the field. This includes Enchantment Creatures, typical Enchantments, and even Rooms--which can trigger twice.</p>

<p>Enchantment Creatures play another big role, synergizing with the return of the Delirium mechanic. Delirium triggers when you have four or more card types in your graveyard, which will likely happen pretty quickly with the <em>Duskmourn </em>cards.</p>
<p>And finally, a new mechanic that's coming to this set is Survival, which triggers when a card is tapped during your second main phase. Again, much like most of what's in Duskmourn, it's a thematically relevant mechanic that especially matches the characters who are trying to survive in the haunted plane.</p>

<h2><em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em>'s Commanders Revealed</h2>
<p>We also have new details on the four pre-constructed Commander decks in&nbsp;<em>Duskmourn</em>. The Commander leads are:</p>
<ul><li>Amanatou, Veil Piercer (White-Blue-Black)</li>
<li>Valgavoth, Harrower of Souls (Black-Red)</li>
<li>Winter, Cynical Opportunist (Black-Green)</li>
<li>Zimone, Mystery Unraveler (Green-Blue)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, Zimone is probably the one I'll have my eye on the most, with her ability synergizing very strongly with the Manifest Dread mechanic. However, my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review">Asterion-loving heart</a> has a real soft spot for Winter's whole vibe.</p>
<p>The last thing I did want to share with you, as a final hurrah, is the Double Exposure cards Wizards shared with us. Kaito, who you might remember from&nbsp;<em>Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty</em>, returns as a Planeswalker, but his Double Exposure treatment looks beautiful.</p>

<p>That's all we have to share about&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering Duskmourn</em>&nbsp;from today's panel, but stay tuned here for more about the upcoming horror-inspired set!</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">Against The Storm</a> already contains a zoo's-worth of animal-people to order around as you attempt to build a town that can survive the perma-rain of the Blightstorm. That doesn't stop new expansion Keepers Of The Stone from adding one more. Come September 26th, you'll be able to welcome the frog people as you venture into a new biome.

<p>The new expansion takes place in the Coastal Groves, where settlements are built - you guessed it - along the water. You'll be able to construct the new Strider Ports and set off on water-based expeditions on the backs of water striders.
</p>
<p>The expansion also adds new buildings such as the Pantry, Cannery, and the Frog House. The latter are what frogs live in rather than the normal shelters, and they can be upgraded several times to keep frogs happy, with "unique benefits" chosen at each level <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/4614588176974421592">according to the feature list</a>.
</p>
<p>September 26th will also be the release date of Against The Storm's update 1.4, which adds a new fishing system alongside new requirements, new goods and other changes for free. If you want the frogs and the new biome and so on, however, you'll need to cough up for the DLC. There's no listed price on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3075500/Against_the_Storm__Keepers_of_the_Stone/">Steam page</a> yet.
</p>
<p>I've not found the time to go back to Against the Storm since it hit 1.0, but it was already a banger in Early Access, and apparently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">a mega-banger upon its full release</a>. I'd trust Eremite Games to do something good with an expansion.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Todd Howard recently said that he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-expect-fallout-1-and-2-remakes-from-bethesda-any-time-soon-todd-wouldnt-want-to-paste-over-their-charm">wanted people to experience Fallout 1 and 2 as they were</a>, rather than remake them. Well, this'll make things easier: both games are currently free to keep as part of the Fallout Classic Collection over on the Epic Games Store.
</p>
<p>Fallout Tactics is free, too, but I don't know whether Todd's cruel enough to want people to experience that one as it was.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can head to the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/bundles/fallout-classic-collection">Fallout Classic Collection store page</a> anytime between now and September 5th at 4pm to add the set to your account. Which means that you'll need an Epic account, of course.
</p>
<p>I'm a Fallout 3-and-after heathen, so I can only turn to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/these-are-your-25-favourite-rpgs-of-all-time">your own picks for the best RPGs</a> to tell me that Fallout places at 13 and Fallout 2 at 21. Those are respectable positions for two games that are, frankly, ancient. (Fallout Tactics didn't place.)
</p>
<p>Or perhaps I should look to Edwin, who revisited <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-fallout-is-the-perfect-antidote-to-fallout-fever">the original Fallout and found it the perfect antidote</a> to the fever around the Fallout TV series. He also found it "the hardest to get into", all these years later.
</p>
<p>My parents have been staying with me for the past week and we didn't Fallout even once. On the other hand, I discovered recently that my dog has fleas, so if someone wants to nuke my entire flat, that's fine with me.
</p>
<p>There's a second game currently free over on Epic, and it's Wild Card Football, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/wild-card-football">which you can grab here</a>. It's a knockabout 7-aside arcade American football game, where 150 'Wild Cards' remix the rules with invisibility, stat boosts, flying saucers, and the like. Shades of Brutal Sports Football, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brutal_Sports_Football">maybe</a>? Or perhaps that's just me longing for hyperviolence.</p>

To talk more about these changes, <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> spoke to Marvelous USA and XSEED Games executive vice president Kenji Hosoi at PAX West 2024, where both brands are showcasing a <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/08/marvelous-usa-and-xseed-games-announce-pax-west-2024-lineup">diverse lineup</a>. <span id="more-911433"></span></p><p>Get the full interview below.</p><p><strong>First thing’s first—what was the reasoning behind separating XSEED Games and Marvelous USA into distinct publishing labels?</strong></p><p><strong>Kenji Hosoi, Executive Vice President, Marvelous USA / XSEED Games:</strong> “I think it’s always been slightly confusing for our fans since we were both XSEED Games, as well as Marvelous USA. Even in online comments, sometimes people would refer to us by both names in one sentence, so the brand separation was to mainly clarify which titles fall in the Marvelous category and which ones are XSEED’s. The Marvelous side will consist of titles that are internally developed by our Marvelous dev team—like the <em><a title="Series > Story of Seasons [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/story-of-seasons">Story of Seasons</a></em> and <em><a title="Series > Rune Factory [18 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/rune-factory">Rune Factory</a></em> series, as well as <em><a title="Games > Daemon X Machina [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/daemon-x-machina">Daemon X Machina</a></em> and others. The titles that we license from external developers and publishers, such as the indie titles <em><a title="Games > Potionomics [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics">Potionomics</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/sakuna-of-rice-and-ruin">Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</a></em>, and <em>Freedom Planet</em>, would fall into the XSEED category.”</p><p><strong>I understand differentiating Marvelous content from third-party content, but then you have <a title="Companies > Marvelous Europe [141 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/marvelous/marvelous-europe">Marvelous Europe</a> who is still publishing that third-party content in Europe, and Marvelous the parent company still publishing in Japan. So why is there only that separate in North America, as opposed to just publishing everything as Marvelous USA going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Unlike Marvelous Europe and Marvelous Japan, our company originated as XSEED Games, and many of our fans have been with us throughout our decades long journey of bringing games from Japan to a western audience from before we teamed up with Marvelous. Many people still think of us as XSEED, so we figured the easiest way to represent both sides of our business was to separate the brand name based on the two types of titles (external or internal dev) we handle.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>So what opportunities do these changes present for XSEED Games in terms of expanding your games lineup? Will we see more third-<a title="Genres > Party [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/party">party game</a> announcements from XSEED Games than usual as a result?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “The brand separation is specifically to clarify which titles will fall under which brand name, so aside from that, our operation itself will not change. As each game we consider for a publishing deal is different, we’ll continue to pick up third-party titles that fit our target audience, expected game quality, and how it performs in our internal title evaluation process. If we get lucky and receive a wave of titles that fits with the XSEED brand, then we’ll have more to publish, but the same logic applies if we are not as lucky in any given year.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games already has quite the number of upcoming third-party projects. Will these changes affect the way the company approaches partnerships going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “No, not at all. As mentioned previously, there really are no operational changes and we’ll continue doing everything we’ve been doing for the last decade.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games has published third-party projects from developers big and small. What’s the brand’s process when it comes to actually discovering these games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “There are multiple avenues by which we discover titles. Sometimes we get direct emails or introductions from industry friends, which is the usual process for many third-party titles developed by bigger companies. Sometimes we’ll receive pitches through our website, though we haven’t had one that’s come through that we’ve actually ended up publishing. Other times, we’d find potential titles at game shows like PAX, Gamescom, Tokyo Game Show, and BitSummit. <em><a title="Games > Cuisineer [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cuisineer">Cuisineer</a></em>, one of our indie darlings, was actually discovered by our president Ken Berry when he visited PAX East, and then later introduced to our Marvelous Europe office for publishing. Ken meeting the developers <a title="Companies > Edelweiss [30 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/edelweiss">Edelweiss</a> at BitSummit was also the start of our partnership on <em>Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin</em>.”</p><p><strong>Does fan demand or feedback play any part in determining which projects XSEED Games decides to sign?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “100 times yes! Like many things in our lives, feedback is some of the most valuable info we get. The more fan love there is for a title, the easier it becomes to make a decision. If there’s a big demand that’s easily measurable like Steam Wishlists, social media follows, Kickstarter pledges, the first step of quantifying market demand is that much easier to do. And if proving market demand is easy, then it becomes easier to prove to decision makers why a game is ‘good.’ The process of convincing someone that a game is good enough to merit the risks inherent in publishing is actually quite hard, and fan feedback brings a very important piece to the table that’s easy to digest for everyone involved.”</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/XSEED-Games-Interview_08-31-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you talk about how your PAX West 2024 lineup is different from previous events with this new distinction between Marvelous USA and XSEED Games?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “On a fan / attendee level, the booth experience will be the same except that we have a massive lineup this time around! From the publishing side it’s helping us to bring more titles than we’ve historically taken, including creating booth experiences for upcoming Marvelous USA titles <em><a title="Games > Farmagia [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/farmagia">Farmagia</a></em> and <em><a title="Games > Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a></em>, as well as a playable demo for <em><a title="Games > Death the Guitar [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/death-the-guitar">Death the Guitar</a></em>. These combined with our big lineup of playable XSEED Games-published titles including <em><a title="Games > Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/corpse-party-ii-darkness-distortion">Corpse Party II: Darkness Distortion</a></em>, <em>Cuisineer</em>, <em><a title="Games > Moonlight Peaks [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/moonlight-peaks">Moonlight Peaks</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Potionomics: Masterwork Edition [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/potionomics-masterwork-edition">Potionomics: Masterwork Edition</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > Slitterhead [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/slitterhead">Slitterhead</a></em>, <em><a title="Games > The Big Catch [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-big-catch">The Big Catch</a></em>, and <em><a title="Games > Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana">Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</a></em> has made it a bit of a challenge to fit all in one booth, but it’s one we were eager to take on to make sure fans have the best possible experience when they stop by.”</p><p><strong>XSEED Games once dipped its toes into the <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [450 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> genre with <em>London Detective Mysteria</em>, but we haven’t seen any visual novel releases since. Would XSEED Games ever consider localizing more visual novels in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “As someone who was really pushing to pick up the <a title="Platforms > PS3 [15,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps3">PlayStation 3</a> version of <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em> back in the day, personally, I wish we could do more visual novels. Unfortunately, that genre of games is very text heavy obviously, and they take a long time to localize. We work on a lot of text heavy games like the <em>Story of Seasons</em> and <em>Rune Factory</em> series, and we just don’t have enough resources at the moment to pick up visual novel titles on a regular basis. If we exponentially grow our localization team in the near future, then it’s definitely possible, but I don’t see how we can handle frequent visual novel releases at this time.”</p><p><strong>With the popularity of <a title="Companies > Vanillaware [192 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/vanillaware">Vanillaware</a> titles, would XSEED Games ever consider remastering <em>Muramasa: The Demon Blade</em> or <em>Grand Knights History</em> for current-generation platforms?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “This is a question we get asked quite frequently at game shows. All I can really say is I wish we could! We’re all fans of Vanillaware, as everyone should be, and both titles mentioned would be a great addition. If we’re ever given the opportunity, it’d be a fun party for us!”</p><p><strong>Are there any plans to localize future projects in more languages such as Brazilian Portuguese and LATAM Spanish?</strong></p><p><strong>Hosoi:</strong> “Brazilian Portuguese is definitely a language we get asked about once in a while. Given the massive amount of text in some of our games, I’m not sure if it’s cost effective enough for us to keep BP as a default language for all of our games just yet, but we’ve had a few titles we’ve included BP as a localized language, so we’ll definitely be looking more into the LATAM languages as our next expansion in our localization process.”</p><p><strong>It looks like we’re out of time. Thanks so much for talking to us, and enjoy the rest of PAX West!</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
