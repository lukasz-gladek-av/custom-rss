			<p>Continuing a process that began with Monster Hunter World, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> attempts to further streamline the series formula to reduce the time players spend in menus and at the base camp to keep them on the field as much as possible, providing them with all the tools they need to effortlessly traverse the new open-world maps.</p>
<p>Among these new tools the game provides is the Seikret, a friendly Bird Wyvern that assists Hunters by giving them access to Supply items and an additional weapon while making traversal way faster than on foot. Unlike Monster Hunter Rise's Palamutes, which served a similar traversal purpose, however, Seikret don't really feel good to control due to some default control settings that the game never really explains unless the player goes through them manually.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165234_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The settings you will want to change as soon as you begin your adventure in Monster Hunter Wilds are the Call Seikret Controls (Radial Menu), and the Seikret Manual Controls found on the second page of the Controls menu in the main Options menu. The first one is, by default, set to Auto-move, which puts the Seikret into Auto-move after calling it from either a shortcut or the Radial Menu, which makes the Bird Wyvern head towards any highlighted target, whether it is a resource you have highlighted yourself on the map or any target monster. This option is far from being the best, as it wrestles control away from the player upon calling the Seikret, and having to press buttons to slow it down and make it stop feels clunky and uncomfortable.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250225165952_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Seikret Manual Controls option is even more important to change to have better control of the Seikret. The default option, Type 1, makes the Seikret move without player input, similar to Auto-move, as pressing nothing maintains the current speed, while additional button presses are required to slow it down and make it stop. Type 2 is a much, much better option in pretty much every scenario, as the Seikret will only move with directional inputs without needing additional button presses to change the beast's speed, just like controlling the Hunter. And if you still want the Seikret to bring you to your target automatically, you can still activate Auto-move at any time, so changing the Seikret controls this way will provide you with the best traversal options the game has to offer for all sorts of situations. If you're so used to how you call the Palamute in Monster Hunter Rise, you can also change the Call Seikret Controls option so as to be able to call the Seikret by holding the circle/B button with your weapon sheated.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metro-dev-4a-ukraine-rebrands-to-reburn-and-reveals-brand-new-pc-fps.1121391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series developer 4A Ukraine has announced that it's changing its name, and that its next project will be a narrative-led first-person shooter based on an entirely original IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, 4A Ukraine' new name is Reburn, and it's currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, a game the studio describes as an "action-packed first-person shoter with a heavy focus on narrative, world design, and characters".</p>

<p>Unlike the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series' oppressive subterranean tunnels,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>will take place in "a fictional Latin American megalopolis" and will revolve around a "down-on-their-luck PMC outfit".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=1KNYrj3i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/4a-games-reburn-la-quimera-aiming.jpg?itok=ALSsfXh4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the next project from Reburn (formerly known as 4A Ukraine).</figcaption></figure><p>Rather impressively, Reburn says it's working with filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn for the "world and narrative" of&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>. Refn is best known for movies like&nbsp;<em>Drive&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Neon Demon</em>, as well as 2008's prison drama&nbsp;<em>Bronson</em>.</p>

<p>The studio promises that the game's world will combine "Latin American folklore with highly advanced weaponry and technology", which, I suppose, is where the title comes from.</p>

<p>You'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>in single-player, but if you want to, you can also team up with up to two friends for three-player co-op. Seems a little strange to stop at three, but hey, if it's good enough for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a>, it's good enough for&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>, I guess.</p>

<p>Reburn says you can expect the same kind of "tense gunplay and intimate storytelling" you're familiar with from the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series, as well as "highly detailed environments, characters, and weapons".</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be,&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, although it doesn't have a release date yet. No console version appears to be planned for now. Stay tuned for more.</p>
