            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Meghan Morgan Juinio says AI is a tool that’s “going to evolve whether you’re onboard with it or not.”</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no question that one of the biggest talking points during last week’s Gamescom Asia x Thailand Game Show came out of Dead Space creator Glen Schofield’s opening keynote address, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered">regarding his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in games development</a>. In addition to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">speaking with Schofield</a>, IGN managed to get some time with another industry veteran, Meghan Morgan Juinio, to ask for her thoughts on the controversial practice that has previously been met with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-fans-give-black-ops-6s-zombie-santa-loading-screen-the-finger-amid-ai-slop-backlash">anger from Call of Duty fans</a>, but also major support from games industry executives like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">EA CEO Andrew Wilson</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think if we don’t embrace it, I think we’re selling ourselves short,” said Juinio, who recently vacated her role as director of product development at Santa Monica Studio after 10 years and two hugely successful God of War games. “AI is a tool, and something that will augment us. At least for right now, that’s how I see it. It’s going to evolve whether you’re onboard with it or not, so I want to be at the forefront of helping to guide how that goes and how we use it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God of War Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Juinio went on to compare the use of generative AI to the procedurally-generated content that's been a part of games development for decades now, pointing to SpeedTree – a tool for generating trees in real time – which was used as early as 2002 for the foliage in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. She also recalled a time when animators were pushing back against motion capture and the use of procedural generation to blend animation frames rather than key them by hand. Both procedurally generated assets and animations have long become standard practices in games development, and Juinio seems just as confident that generative AI will also find its place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Personally, I’m super positive,” said Juinio. “Like [Glen Schofield said in his keynote address], this is the next big technological advancement that’s coming. In fact it’s here already, and I think as leaders in the video game industry it is on us to figure out not just <em>can </em>we do it with AI, but <em>should </em>we? And it’s a case-by-case type of decision making process and what's true for game X might not be true next year for game Y.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked if she thought the increasing adoption of generative AI might help mitigate the swelling costs of AAA-games development, Juinio was clear that the use of AI in games development is unlikely to be the be-all end-all solution to the post-pandemic pattern of regular studio closures and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blockbuster-games-bubble-has-burst">the bursting of the blockbuster game bubble</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I wouldn’t necessarily put it into an either/or kind of scenario in that way, because to me the size and scale and beauty of the game isn’t the main thing,” said Juinio. “At its heart, the game [needs] to be fun. [Ideally] at its heart the story is fantastic, it’s human, players connect to it, and it’s fun to play.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes it looks beautiful, and yes the music is immersive. But the music could be really immersive and the gameplay could be not good, or the story [might] not be engaging, and I don't think it would resonate with players as much. And so at least for right now, I don't see AI replacing the fun gameplay that is at the heart of a game like God of War.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Juinio seems adament that generative AI in games development is here to stay, she also remains confident that it will never be able to rival the heart and soul that can only come from a human touch, and that the adoptance of AI will only be a positive if there's an equal amount of investment made into developers to help them get the best results out of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the end of the day you still need game developers to come up with the ideas,” said Juinio. “The story of God of War is very much a human story that is based on human experiences.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At least as of today, I don’t see that going away.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month the makers of Battlefield 6 stated that there was currently no way to implement the use of generative AI into the daily work of its development team, despite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6">regarding the burgeoning technology as “very seducing”</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed the debate over generative AI is bigger than in-game assets. At the start of October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-issues-official-statement-in-response-to-generative-ai-claim-as-openai-ceo-sam-altman-calls-sora-2-copyrighted-character-videos-interactive-fan-fiction">Nintendo issued a statement in response to claims around generative AI</a>, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman calling Sora 2 copyrighted character videos “interactive fan fiction.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tristan Ogilvie is a senior video editor at IGN's Sydney office.

<p>Persona 3 Reload is bringing back the original’s singer with a new update celebrating the Nintendo Switch 2 release.</p>



<p>Released in 2024, Persona 3 Reload served as the series’ first remake, bringing the 2006 original back to life for newer generations. With the changes, the original vocalist, Yumi Kawamura, did not return. Instead, the music was sung by Azumi Takahashi, as well as returning contributor Lotus Juice. Upon its release, it received tons of praise for its reinvention of the game and dedication to the original. An expansion, titled Project Aigis, came out later that year and acted as an epilogue to the game’s narrative. A port of Persona 3 Reload is launching on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/persona-3-reload-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on October 23rd and, as celebration, a nostalgic voice is making her return.</p>

<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>An iconic voice returns to Persona 3 Reload… 🎤🎶</p><p>Listen to eight dungeon and battle BGM tracks by the original Persona 3 vocalist – Yumi Kawamura – when the game launches on Nintendo Switch 2! </p><p>Patch will be available on all platforms. <a href="https://t.co/cZKpuVTWyP">pic.twitter.com/cZKpuVTWyP</a></p></div>— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1980787484729430169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Atlus West revealed that songs from the original Persona 3 and FES will be coming to Reload on October 23rd, when the Nintendo Switch 2 version is released. To celebrate the occasion, vocalist Yumi Kawamura, who performed the songs for the 2006 JRPG, spoke about the addition. In a statement below, she says</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s been a while!” Kawamura states. “I’m truly overjoyed and grateful to be reunited with everyone again. Persona 3 is a treasure to me as well—I can’t help but feel excited. Old friends, will you fight alongside me once more? New friends, how about letting my songs aid you in battle? Let’s celebrate together. Thank you for your continued support!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The songs being added to Persona 3 Reload from Persona 3 and FES are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Burn My Dread -Last Battle-“</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction”</li>



<li>“Deep Mentality”</li>



<li>“When The Moon’s&nbsp;Reaching Out Stars”</li>



<li>“Want to Be Close”</li>



<li>“Memories of You”</li>



<li>“Mass Destruction -P3fes Version-“</li>



<li>“Brand New Days”</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s important to note that the songs will only be available during exploration in Tartarus and in battles. The songs, as mentioned before, will come to Persona 3 Reload on October 23rd via a new patch. Luckily, all consoles, like PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S will get to listen to Yumi’s iconic tracks then, too. While Azumi’s versions of Persona 3’s songs were great, Yumi’s rasp and range can’t be beat. As a fan of the series, it’s good to see her renditions return and add some nostalgia to the amazing turn-based gameplay.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Yumi’s versions come to Persona 3 Reload? Who do you prefer, Yumi or Azumi? Did you play the remake? What did you think of it?

The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/luigis-mansion/" data-ref-id="5000-3596">Luigi's Mansion</a> is joining the classic games lineup on October 30.</p><p>Originally released alongside the GameCube in November 2001, Luigi's Mansion sees Mario's cowardly brother exploring a haunted mansion he won in a contest he never entered. With the help of Professor E. Gadd and his vacuum-like Poltergust 3000, Luigi must work his way through the mansion's many rooms and capture all the ghosts that lurk within.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvN4hHpfVqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GvN4hHpfVqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Luigi's Mansion marks the sixth title to arrive on Switch Online's GameCube collection.

Nintendo also offers an annual family plan for $80 that covers up to eight Nintendo Accounts across multiple systems.</p>

<p>Another smashing patch</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="6da3549b449be"><a title="Donkey Kong Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6da3549b449be/donkey-kong-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>'s first DLC in-game event next week, Nintendo has rolled out a new update for the smash outing.</p>
<p>This updates the game to Version 2.0.2 and includes a fix tied to Pauline's voice when collecting fossils in the two previous updates. It also makes "several other changes" to improve the gameplay experience. If we hear anything else about this update going on behind the scenes, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h2>Donkey Kong Bananza: Ver. 2.0.2 (Released October 21, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fixed the issue causing Pauline's voice not to play at times when acquiring a fossil in Ver. 2.0.0 and Ver. 2.0.1.</p>
<p>Several other changes have been made and issues addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next in-game event will allow you to nab two new figures for DK Island. Of course, to access this content, you will need to have purchased the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> DLC. If you're still not sure about it, you can check out our review. Here's a quick sample, and below this is the video review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Donkey Kong Bananza: DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush feels like a split banana. The new roguelike mode is a lot of fun, gelling surprisingly well with the game's core mechanics and giving me a welcome excuse to swing back into my beloved Bananza, but the other half of the deal, DK Island, left me feeling a little short-changed with its lack of appeal outside of the new game mode."</p>

<p>Luigi’s Mansion is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online just in time for Halloween.</p>



<p>As a benefit of Nintendo Switch Online, many nostalgic games from Nintendo’s past are available to play. From NES classics like Donkey Kong to Game Boy hits like Tetris, there’s a lot to enjoy for fans. With the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2-upgrade-pack-details-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-online-users/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Expansion Pack</a> including GameCube, Nintendo 64, and Game Boy Advance titles was released. As the catalog grows, with recent additions including Forsaken 64 and Chibi-Robo, a spooky hit from the 2000s is coming just in time for Halloween.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://youtu.be/GvN4hHpfVqQ?si=YMZmjm1kbZz5gIyG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new video</a> from Nintendo, the company announced that Luigi’s Mansion is headed to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. Furthermore, you won’t have to wait long to play it, as it releases on October 30th, 2025, the day before Halloween. The iconic 2001 title, released on the Nintendo GameCube, has since gone on to have a 3DS re-release and two other mainline entries.&nbsp;Luigi’s Mansion follows Mario’s brother, Luigi, as he navigates a ghost-infested mansion in search of his brother and friends. With a handy Poltergust 3000 and the kooky Prof. E. Gadd, you’ll take down the many ghosts and specters you’ll encounter.</p>



<p>The most recent title from the Luigi’s Mansion series was a re-release of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-luigis-mansion-2-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a> for the Nintendo Switch in 2024. As for the last mainline entry, that was Luigi’s Mansion 3 in 2019, also for the Nintendo Switch. Its success as a Mario spinoff has made it a household name and one many hope makes a return with a new game. Perhaps the addition to Nintendo Switch Online could be a sign it’s in the works or if interest is there? In any case, Luigi’s Mansion’s addition is a scare we all can enjoy.</p>

<p>Horrifyingly good news for Luigi fans</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Switch 2's 'Nintendo Classics' GameCube library for Switch Online expands next week with the return of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a>.</p>
<p>This spooky GameCube launch title will drop on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, so just in time for Halloween. It made its debut in 2001 and puts Luigi in the spotlight as the main character. After winning a mansion filled with ghosts, he's now got to save the day with the help of Professor E. Gadd and his trusty Poltergust 3000.</p>
<p>Check out the trailer (which highlights how you can now play all three titles on the Switch 2) and here's the official PR:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Luigi wins a stately mansion, but he’s in for a ghastly surprise when he creeps through its front door and learns that his magnificent manor is teeming with ghosts. And worse yet, Mario is nowhere to be found!</p>
<p>Enter <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, where a gallery of ghouls haunt the halls, secrets wait to be unearthed, and Luigi is … not the most courageous character around. Luckily, Professor E. Gadd is on the scene, and he has the perfect tools for the occasion! Play as Luigi, capture ghosts with the Poltergust 3000, track his items and whereabouts with the Game Boy<sup>™</sup> Horror device, and help save Mario from a frightening fate in this action-adventure game originally released for the Nintendo GameCube system in 2001.</p>
<p>With <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> joining Nintendo Classics, all three games in the series can now be played on Nintendo Switch 2, including <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>. Take all three adventures for a spooky spin this Halloween!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This next update follows games such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Mario Smash Football</a>. This is also one of ten titles originally announced alongside the Nintendo Classics GameCube library.

<p>Just keep in mind, to play Switch Online GameCube games, you need access to a Switch 2 and the Expansion Pack Tier. Japan will receive the same update next week. Apart from Luigi's Mansion, earlier this month, Nintendo also added three more games to the SNES library.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new job listing from Ubisoft, the Splinter Cell remake has lost its director again.</p>



<p>Based on the Tom Clancy brand, Splinter Cell brings the stealth espionage action to gaming. With six mainline titles and a dozen novelizations, the series was a hit in the 2000s/2010s. Unfortunately, we last played as Sam Fisher back in 2013 with the cool yet controversial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-adds-steam-achievements-for-splinter-cell-blacklist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blacklist</a>. Having been over a decade since the last entry, a remake of the franchise’s first title was in order and announced in 2021. Sadly, all the news surrounding the project since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hasn’t been the best</a>, with no updates and the original director leaving. Now, it seems whoever came after them has quit the remake, according to a new Ubisoft job listing.</p>



<h2 id="h-ubisoft-hiring-new-director-for-splinter-cell-remake">Ubisoft Hiring New Director for Splinter Cell Remake</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/splinter-cell-remake-lost-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a job listing, which has since been taken down, was available on Ubisoft’s website. The position, Game Director, was for the Ubisoft Toronto office and would be for the Splinter Cell remake. The description for the job states that the person would be part of the Splinter Cell development team, leading workers and coming up with new features. </p>



<p>In 2022, the original director, David Grivel, left the project and Ubisoft after more than a decade at the company. Given we haven’t seen any gameplay or updates like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-will-release-by-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a>, things look a bit unsteady. Just recently, the series did get a small revival with Netflix’s Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, an animated series from John Wick creator Derek Kolstad. The show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-renewed-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was renewed</a> for a second season shortly after premiering, so it seems the hype for a new entry is very much present. Hopefully, things will work out and we’ll finally put on those night-vision goggles again.</p>



<p>What do you make of the news of the director’s departure? Did you watch Splinter Cell: Deathwatch? What did you think? Do you want to see a new Splinter Cell game in the future?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This is a new story, in that there is a new story <em>today </em>about it, but this is also a very <em>old </em>story, in that the same shit has been happening in video games for as long as there have been video games.</p><p>That story is crediting. Or, to be clear, the lack of proper crediting. The issue is back in the headlines today after staffers at Ridgeline Games, who worked on <em>Battlefield 6</em> in some cases for <em>years</em>,<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ridgeline-games-creative-director-disappointed-in-ea-s-uneven-staff-crediting-in-battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> found that they had either been shuffled to the very end of the game's credits (in a 'special thanks' section) or had been left off entirely</a>.</p><p>Like I said, this is not a new problem;<a href="https://kotaku.com/everyone-who-worked-on-a-game-should-be-in-the-credits-1847669211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about it in 2021</a>, with the headline 'Everyone Who Worked On A Game Should Be In The Credits', followed by 'I am once again asking you to respect people's time and work', which pretty much sums up the whole deal. And yet here I am again, writing about it in 2025, saying the exact same thing.</p><p>A game's credits should be a comprehensive list of everyone who worked on the game. Everyone. It doesn't matter if they worked on it for five minutes or five years, if they contributed to the game, or to the businesses <em>making </em>the game, they need to be in there. The fact workers are continually left off credits, whether it be for petty political reasons, even pettier "well they didn't <em>really </em>work on it" reasons or even just administrative oversight, is inexcusable.</p><p>You can't say crediting everyone is "too hard" when you have <em>made a video game</em>, a task that is infinitely harder than writing down everyone who worked on it. You can't say anyone from an external provider being left off was a case of them not really developing the game when <em>they worked on the game</em>, doing something the core team either didn't have the time or experience to do. And leaving people off because they left the team before the game shipped, or in Ridgeline's case above were shut down before <em>Battlefield 6</em> was released, is the most teen drama shit imaginable.</p><p>And that’s just touching on the credits themselves, that form part of the shipped game, not the broader issues of how studios use crediting as a means of coercing people–whether that be to reward or punish workers–<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-game-companies-use-credits-to-reward-or-punish-de-1840905129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as detailed in Forest Lassman's 2020 story about the practice</a>.</p><p>It shouldn't matter if someone applied the final polish or were there at the "ideas on a napkin" stage, put them in the credits. To not do so, for whatever reason, makes you look like an asshole.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/matt-leone-shadow-of-the-colossus-oral-history-aftermath-hours"><h3>A History of Histories</h3></a><p>" I don't think there is always a canonical version of, like, the development story of a game."</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-credits-battlefield]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-i7-down-74-on-amazon-and-its-not-refurbished-2000637810</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-i7-down-74-on-amazon-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-refurbished.1330990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lenovo would never dare slash 74% off one of its premium laptops on its official website: That kind of discount would damage brand perception and upset customers who paid full price last month. But Amazon operates differently, quietly listing this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/">Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 with Intel Core i7-13620H, 40GB RAM, and 1TB SSD for $799, down from $2,999</a>. This <strong>isn’t refurbished or open-box merchandise</strong>, it’s brand new and it hits an all-time low that makes high-performance computing accessible to people who’ve been priced out of serious laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core i7-13620H is a significant leap in processing power with its <strong>10-core architecture split between six performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong>. The performance cores handle heavy tasks like video editing, 3D rendering and complex spreadsheets by running <strong>at speeds up to 4.9GHz</strong> when you need maximum power.</p>
<h2>Memory and Storage Designed for Hard Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>40GB DDR5 RAM configuration is where this laptop separates itself from budget machines</strong> that struggle with basic multitasking. DDR5 represents the latest memory standard with faster data transfer rates and improved power efficiency compared to DDR4. With 40GB available, you can run virtual machines for software testing, keep Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro open simultaneously, work with massive Excel files containing thousands of rows or maintain fifty browser tabs without the system grinding to a halt.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides storage</strong> that’s fast enough to be thought of as instantaneous. Boot times are under seconds, programs launch instantly when you click on them, and large files transfer in a snap. PCIe NVMe technology reads and writes your files several times faster than older SATA SSDs so your laptop feels fast with every command you give it.</p>
<p><strong>15.3-inch WUXGA display with 1920×1200 resolution</strong> gives you extra vertical room compared to 1920×1080 standard displays. The extra 120 pixels of height makes it easier to handle docs, spreadsheets, or source code as you are able to see more content without having to scroll down. The IPS display shows you accurate colors with stable viewing angles that never diminish when tilting your monitor, while 300 nits of brightness ensures that you are always able to see the screen with clarity even under well-lit office space.</p>



<p>Connectivity is comprehensive with <strong>two USB-A ports for older devices, one USB-C jack that supports USB Power Delivery 3.0</strong> for chargin<strong>g purposes as well as DisplayPort 1.2 for external monitor support, HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and extra monitors,</strong> a headphone jack, and an SD card reader for fast transfer of photos from digital cameras.</p>
<p>At $799, this laptop beats mid-range offerings while offering specs that rival machines in the $2,000 to $2,500 range. Lenovo is not going to be trumpeting this discount publicly without jeopardizing brand position, but Amazon’s subtle listing makes it possible for anyone frustrated with paying top-of-the-line prices for high-performance computing to take advantage of it.</p>

Now, publisher Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates on PC and keep those players satisfied.</p><p>Sidetrack was previously known as the M.U.G.

According to <a href="https://www.paydaythegame.com/news/payday2/2025/10/next-chapter/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starbreeze</a>, Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a focus "on the stability of the game and improving the overall player experience." Future updates are planned for "quality-of-life improvements and general game fixes."</p><p>Starbreeze will host a livestream on October 23 that lays out the details of the patch and invites the player community to "help shape future improvements." With Payday 2 now in the hands of Sidetrack going forward, Starbreeze will primarily be working on updates for Payday 3. Payday 2 still has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has tens of thousands of players</a> at any given time, according to SteamDB. However, Payday 3 has trouble <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cracking 1,000 concurrent players</a>.</p><p>Earlier this month, Starbreeze <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/payday-studio-cancels-dd-game-focusing-on-payday-and-new-heisting-games/1100-6535161/" data-ref-id="1100-6535161">canceled its Dungeons &amp; Dragons game</a> and laid off workers in a renewed push towards the Payday franchise and other heist games.

              <p>Running out of battery during a long flight, a full day of meetings or a cross-country train ride turns your expensive laptop into a glorified paperweight. Power outlets at airports and coffee shops are either occupied or nonexistent and watching your battery percentage drop below 10% creates anxiety when you’re in the middle of important work. The Anker 25,000mAh laptop power bank solves this problem by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">carrying enough juice to fully charge a MacBook Pro multiple times, and it’s now available for $91, down from $134</a>.</p>

<p>This power bank is unique in that it’s<strong> designed with laptops and high-power devices specifically in mind</strong> which is not usually possible with portable chargers. The <strong>25,000mAh capacity is equivalent to about 90 watt-hours of onboard energy storage</strong>, which means you can top off a standard 13-inch MacBook Air 1.5 times, a MacBook Pro 14-inch a single time fully or sustain an iPad Pro through several workdays’ worth of usage. <strong>With phones, you can expect six to eight complete charges</strong> on an iPhone 17 or Samsung Galaxy.</p>
<h2>Comparable Power Output as your Laptop Charger</h2>
<p><strong>Every one of its three USB-C ports can output up to 100W of power</strong>&nbsp;which is what most laptop chargers are capable of outputting. It makes a difference because lower-watt power banks may advertise that they can charge laptops but output power so slowly that your Battery still drains as you work. With 100W to output per port, you can fast-charge a MacBook Pro while charging a tablet and phone at top speed at the same time. <strong>Maximum output is 165W when both ports are engaged</strong>, outputting power smartly across devices that are connected.</p>



<p>The<strong> twin built-in cables</strong> eradicate portable charging’s most annoying aspect: remembering to pack the appropriate cables. One USB-C cable stretches up 2.3 feet, allowing you flexibility to keep the power bank in your bag while your laptop is on a tray table or desk top. This retractable cable is good for over 20,000 retractions so you are not working with a mechanism that fails after several months’ usage. The second USB-C cable is 0.98 feet long and serves as a carry strap as well.</p>
<p>Having four devices you can power at once changes your travel and remote-working adventures. The two onboard USB-C ports accommodate your laptop and your tablet, with <strong>another USB-C and another USB-A</strong> accommodating phones, wireless headphones, e-readers, portable gaming handhelds, or any other USB-powered devices you might want to power on your travels. In effect, you are carrying your own mobile charging depot that keeps your entire tech universe juiced up for the whole day.</p>



<p>The 100W ultra-fast recharging can therefore mean that the power bank itself is never a bottleneck. Insert it in a 100W charger and it’s up to 30% capacity in 22 minutes – quick enough to top up on a lunch break or flight layover. <strong>Recharge to 100% is 90 minutes</strong> with a suitable charger compared to lower-grade power banks which require five to six hours to fully recharge.</p>
<p>Anker made this power bank <strong>travel-friendly with airline rules in mind, holding it to 90Wh capacity, only slightly below 100Wh of capacity that most airlines place on carry-on batteries</strong>. It can be taken on planes without special permission which makes it truly practical for vacations as well as business travel.</p>
<p>At $91, this power bank costs less than many basic 10,000mAh models that can’t even charge a laptop properly. You’re getting triple the capacity, actual laptop-grade power output, built-in cables that eliminate the packing hassle, and the ability to charge multiple devices at full speed.</p>

<p>Lootify’s October 2025 monthly codes can be used to redeem various rewards in the game, including Gold, Keys, Potions, Scrolls, and much more. The rewards can then be used to upgrade various items in the game, and also to make use of the rebirth feature, so let’s show you which codes are active.</p>



<p>Lootify is a popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-azure-latch-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> RPG dungeon game that blends together open-world exploration, thrilling combat, looting, as well as some ultra-challenging boss battles. Although the word ‘loot’ is in the name of the game, it certainly isn’t the most important element of Lootify. </p>



<p>One of the best ways by which players can focus more on combat and exploration rather than simply looting is by using some free Lootify codes, which the developers release through their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/official-lootify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can have an easy gateway to free Balloons, Ruby Blocks, and Turrets by using the latest Car Battles Codes for October 2025.</p>



<p>Building a car is not an easy task, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-plants-vs-brainrots-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Car Battles lets even amateurs in the world of automobile engineering build their own vehicles, albeit with a small twist at the end. The cars that players build in the game are then used in combat against other players, where the objective is to destroy all vehicular competition. Players have to use items like turrets, custom wheels, and even blades to cause damage to their opponents, all while maintaining the structural integrity of their own vehicle, and this is where Car Battles codes can help.</p>



<p>That’s why designing your vehicle strategically is of utmost importance. After all, the placement of one drill can be the difference between you winning and losing at Car Battles. To upgrade cars to create the best possible machines, players will have to either spend in-game money or open crates of varying rarities to test out their luck. Think of the game as a free-for-all, but one where you get rewarded for destroying other players’ cars using your own. </p>

<h2 id="h-expired-car-battles-codes-nbsp">Expired Car Battles Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As of the writing of this article, Car Battles does not have any codes that have expired. Although that is to be expected, considering that this is a fairly new game, players will be keen to expand their arsenal using some free rewards. When new codes drop and the currently active ones stop working, they will be moved down to this section.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing we recommend that all players do is bookmark this page for future reference about Car Battles, as we update the article with new codes as soon as they drop. This can save players from having to go through the hassle of finding the new codes from the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/communities/472296619/Wreck-Team#!/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s Discord server</a> or from the developer’s socials.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-car-battles-codes">How to redeem Car Battles Codes</h2>

Now, Microsoft appears to be teasing that the next-gen Xbox will be some type of hybrid console and PC.</p><p>Xbox president Sarah Bond sat down with <em>Mashable </em>this week to discuss the latest Xbox Ally X handheld, and dropped some vague hints about Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console. When asked about rumors that the next-gen Xbox console will be more like a gaming PC, Bond appeared to agree. “I can tell you you’re right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Bond. “You’re starting to see some of the thinking we have in this handheld, but I don’t want to give it all away.”</p><p>I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>, and that the Xbox Ally devices are an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad">early look</a> at what’s to come. Bond’s latest comments are subtle, but they once again line up with her previous promise of delivering an “Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device,” and prioritizing Windows. “That’s why we’re working closely with the Windows team to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming,” said Bond in June, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688407/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-cloud-amd">announcing a multi-year partnership</a> with AMD for a portfolio of Xbox devices.</p><p>I’m convinced that Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox console will be powered by Windows and be part of a number of devices from third parties that Microsoft also considers Xbox consoles. A $1,000 Xbox Ally X handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">tests the appetite</a> for pricey next-gen consoles, and it may well also test the appetite for a combination of Xbox and Windows. Perhaps that’s what Bond means when she says the next-gen Xbox will deliver “the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/803824/microsoft-xbox-sarah-bond-next-gen-xbox-console-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who adores the fall, spooky vibes, and Halloween, when I played<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival,</em> I fell instantly in love with it. This free online Halloween-themed mini-MMO features pumpkin carving, spooky places to explore, and much more. And it’s available to play now on PC and Mac. But don’t wait too long, as the servers shut off shortly after Halloween.</p> <p>Developed by Adam “adamgryu” Robinson-Yu, the creator behind cozy indie game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-bittersweet-journey-of-a-short-hike-1841525700">A Short Hike</a>, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</a></em> has become an annual tradition. Each year, in the middle of October,<a href="https://x.com/adamgryu/status/1978913908543951324?"> adamgryu reopens <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for a few weeks</a> and players flood in, filling the spooky streets and hills of the game with jack-o-lanterns as far as the eye can see. And each year, the indie developer has expanded the online pumpkin-carving MMO with new places to explore. This year, players can watch public domain horror films in the newly opened theater. There’s also a haunted hay ride, a creepy mansion to explore, a corn maze, and many secrets to discover either alone or alongside other players, who appear as cute ghosts.</p>

  <p>I simply adore<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival.</em> So often, when Halloween rolls around, devs and publishers release scary horror games. And while I enjoy those, I often wish we got more games that let you experience the immaculate vibes of a cool night during October. A night with carved pumpkins dotting the landscape and campy Halloween decorations everywhere you look. And <em>Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> nails those vibes perfectly.</p>

 <p>Even better, the jack-o-lanterns you see in the game were carved and placed by real people using the MMO’s fantastic, intuitive, and flexible pumpkin carving tool. Pick a pumpkin, spin it around, and start carving into it. You can also scrape spots of the pumpkin away, giving you more options for shading and decoration. Some people do simple faces or funny jokes, and others create elaborate pieces of art. All of these pumpkins can be liked, and once a day, you can award a medal to your favorite.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000637793" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637793"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637793">©<span><span>adamgryu / Kotaku</span></span></figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve spent the past few days logging into<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> for half an hour or so to see all the new carved pumpkins, give my favorites a like, and then just chill in the cozy-creepy vibes of the festival and the surrounding city and hills. If you love Halloween or have small kids who enjoy spooky stuff, <a href="https://adamgryu.itch.io/pumpkin-carver">I highly recommend downloading<em> Ghost Town Pumpkin Festival</em> ASAP</a>. If you want, you can even pay to download the game and unlock exclusive cosmetic items. Either way, Halloween fans are in for a treat.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has announced a second Nintendo Direct stream will be dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, taking place this week on Thursday, 23rd October at 2PM UK time (3PM CEST, 9AM EDT, 6AM PDT). The stream promises around 60 minutes of content with tons of new info on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> exclusive coming from game director Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders Direct 2 – 23/10/2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdfrV1vruvI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>Kirby Air Riders is a sequel to the pink puff ball’s 2003 GameCube original, Kirby Air Ride. The game features a roster of 16 characters drawn from the Kirby universe, with a mixture of both racing and the returning City Trial mode, which is much more like a vehicular combat game, where you rampage around the Skyah city map, powering up your Air Machines in preparation for game-ending minigames.</p>

<p>It’s curious mix, and in my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands on with the title back at Gamescom 2025</a>, I said, “Having been unfamiliar with the original game, City Trial was something truly unexpected for me when playing Kirby Air Riders. There’s plenty about it that feels like a Smash Bros. style party game – not least the style of the UI – with an initial simplicity and chaotic fun that hides a strategic and skilful depth.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/kirby-air-riders-will-launch-on-november-20th/">Kirby Air Riders is launching for Nintendo Switch 2 on 20th November</a>.</p>

                <p>The latest edition of Steam Next Fest is over, and Steam has shared its list of the 50 most-played demos from the week-long event. This year's list was pretty heavy with horror, adventure, RPG, and simulation games. And surprisingly, only a few roguelike and racing titles.</p><p>One of the most unusual titles was Final Sentence, a battle-royale typing game that has a fatal ending for any player who can't keep up with the pace.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZSfblvkuro" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kZSfblvkuro" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Another title that caught our eye was The Cube, Save Us: an extraction shooter with a very arresting visual style.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKEoM5N-Eyg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mKEoM5N-Eyg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We've had our eye on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-670015">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> for a while, so it wasn't too shocking to see that on the list. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown/" data-ref-id="5000-691471">Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown</a>, was unexpected and it offers an intriguing glimpse at a chance to rewrite some of the stories that took place on that series.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqYgGynR3iU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bqYgGynR3iU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Most of the games that made the list either have active demos that can still be downloaded, or they're already in early access.

              <p>The cool thing about a game like <i>Arc Raiders</i> is that you can engage in a bit of voyeurism if you’re not up for brawling with the game’s bigger threats. Keeping out of sight and making sure other players are far too busy to notice you is actually a really smart tactic if you’re playing solo. Plus, you can get a front-row, responsibility-free seat to some cool firefights that you’re way outgunned for.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p> <p>Reddit user SquinkyEXE took such an opportunity to spy on a group of six randos who teamed up to take down one of the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">more menacing threats</a>: a <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Leaper">Leaper</a>.

Since folks have their own agendas on the map, unlikely scenarios like these emerge, making for some memorable, unscripted moments that I can’t wait to see more of when the game arrives in full form next week.</p>

Players, however, can still earn career XP in bot lobbies, as well as receive a 150% XP match completion bonus. Portal lobbies without bots can still be used to earn Mastery and complete challenges.</p>

<p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a> from Battlefield Studios last week said that its internal data indicated that a "large number of these [bot-enabled Portal servers] were created primarily to earn XP, inflate player stats, and earn special accolades through defeating bots." While the developers understand why players would make these lobbies, it was making it "noticeably harder" for players to find non-XP-farming experiences in Battlefield Portal.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas," Battlefield Studios said.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the bot farms are now dead, Battlefield Studios is still working on solving the underlying progression frustrations that led to players resorting to XP farms in the first place. In an update last week, Battlefield Studios increased the amount of XP earned from match completion and daily challenges, as well as reduced the amount of Mastery XP needed to unlock a weapon's first 20 Mastery ranks. Assignments that required players to reach career ranks 20, 23, and 26 in order to unlock were also adjusted to instead unlock at ranks 10, 15, and 20.</p><p dir="ltr">More progression changes could be coming in the future as well, with Battlefield Studios stating that it's "aware of the frustrations regarding the challenges themselves" and will be reviewing them, but that it will take time to "develop, test, and implement these changes."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-almost-cod-like-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-first-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">Battlefield 6 sold more than 7 million copies in its first week</a>, making it the biggest launch of any game in the long-running franchise, and saw a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">concurrent player peak of 747,000 players on Steam</a> shortly after launch. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1</a> will launch October 28 and add new maps, weapons, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Battlefield 6 news, the game apparently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-apparently-failed-to-credit-all-of-these-essential-game-developers/1100-6535584/" data-ref-id="1100-6535584">fails to credit</a> the work done by some of the developers at Ridgeline Games, who worked on Battlefield 6's campaign before the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-co-creator-doesnt-have-anything-positive-to-say-about-ea-after-it-shuttered-his-studio/1100-6521910/" data-ref-id="1100-6521910">studio was shuttered last year</a>. In a post on LinkedIn, former Ridgeline studio head Marcus Lehto said the studio helped build Battlefield 6's foundation, and that "every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox president and chief executive officer, Sarah Bond, has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-is-100-percent-looking-at-making-things-in-the-future-says-president/">put down any notions from players wondering if Xbox is still making consoles and hardware</a>. A next-gen Xbox is on the way; there's seemingly no question about it. Questions about <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-2027-launch-rumor/">what will be packed into that new box and what it'll look like</a>, however, won't be answered anytime soon. Though, according to Bond in a new interview, we can expect it to be three things: a "<em>very premium, very high-end, curated experience</em>." It's also worth noting that those three probably also mean a fourth thing: very expensive.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yDmwJ7tuoD8&amp;t=377s">interview with Mashable</a>, discussing the ROG Xbox Ally X handheld that ASUS created in collaboration with Xbox and Microsoft, Mashable asks Bond if they could say anything about next-gen Xbox hardware, and if they can comment on rumours floating around that Microsoft is looking to make the next-genertion of Xbox hardware some kind of inbetween a console and a PC.</p>



<p>Essentially, taking the experience you get on an ROG Xbox Ally/Ally X handheld, where you can play your Steam, GOG, BattleNet, EA Play, etc., games, and your Xbox games on one device. That's the rumour, anyway, that Mashable refers to.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally X Hands-On Interview with Xbox CEO, Sarah Bond" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yDmwJ7tuoD8?start=377&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The beginning of Bond's response is a comment on what Mashable had already said about the next-gen hardware, saying, "<em>Well, I can tell you you're right, that the next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end, curated experience.</em>"</p>



<p>Then, while gesturing to the ROG Xbox Ally X sitting between her and Mashable's tech editor, Bond continues, "<em>You're starting to see some of the thinking that we have in this handheld, but I don't want to give it all away</em>."</p>



<p>On the one hand, this is simply an executive hyping up her company's next major product. Of course she'll say it'll a "<em>premium, very high-end</em>" experience. On the other hand, her short comment regarding how we're already starting to see where Microsoft and Xbox are thinking of moving its hardware forward in the ROG Xbox Ally X, is arguably the most interesting part of this. </p>



<p>An Xbox console where you can access and play all the games in your PC gaming library across multiple PC launchers and digital storefronts, that delivers a console experience for your PC games, does sound like exactly the kind of thing that could make Xbox consoles interesting again.</p>



<p>If the rumours are to be believed, we'll see if that'll be reality sometime around 2027. In other Xbox hardware news, after Microsoft raised the prices of the consoles players buy in stores, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-development-kits-price-hike-microsoft/">it also raised the price of Xbox development kits for game developers</a>. If you're looking for more on the ROG Xbox Ally X, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">you can check out my review of the device</a>, as well as my <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-talks-rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-the-way-forward-for-us/">interview with two ASUS executives who confirm that the ROG Xbox Ally line of handhelds is the way forward for ASUS and its ROG handheld devices</a>. </p>

The bull riding simulator was reviewed poorly at the few sites that actually covered it, and the late PS2 release was quickly forgotten. Just another bad game. But one copy of this long-forgotten game is sitting in a Walmart in Delaware, still wrapped in plastic and waiting to find a home.</p><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/1o8qh14/surprised_to_see_a_ps2_game_at_walmart/">Reddit user KingTRoss shared on the PS2 subreddit</a> that they had discovered an unsold copy of <em>PBR: Out of the Chute</em> at Walmart. It was still in shrink wrap, sported an old Walmart price tag of $15 that was starting to peel off, and was hidden among newer PS5 and PS4 games like a little Easter egg from the past waiting to be found.</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/unsold-ps2-game-walmart-reddit-pbr-bull-riding-weird-reddit-2000637727]]></content:encoded>

The pages have existed since at least 2023 but, as <a href="https://steamdeckhq.com/news/games-getting-brand-new-steam-deck-verified-pages/"><i>Steam Deck HQ </i>notes</a>, Valve may be ramping up the degree to which they encourage developers to promote them. Before a game even gets one, though, it needs to secure that coveted “Verified” rating. Valve actually has four criteria to determine whether or not a game should earn the badge. A game should: have no issues with middleware (such as anti-cheat software), launch without trouble or compatibility warnings, be fully playable via a gamepad, and, lastly, should “have good default settings, and text should be legible.”</p> <p>What defines “good default settings” is probably open to some level of interpretation, but any way you slice it, for all their sleek visual appeal, these pages are misleading. The problem is that these landing pages feature the trailers for their respective games embedded into an image of a Steam Deck, which in my opinion gives a really false impression of how some games run. Sure, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/datablob.studio/post/3m3ozg4vs4c2t">as developer datablob notes on BlueSky</a>, in theory this gives a decent impression of how a game might look on the Deck, but just observe <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2909400/FINAL_FANTASY_VII_REBIRTH"><i>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</i>’s Steam Deck Verified landing page</a>.</p>

 <p>The page plays the default trailer from the Steam Page which is clearly running on a much more powerful PC than the Steam Deck. Yes, there’s a tiny disclaimer at the bottom that says the footage was “Captured on PC” and not Steam Deck, but still, the context makes it easy to imagine the game running at such high fidelity and framerate on the Deck.</p>

 <p>To be sure, I double-checked and spun up <i>Rebirth</i> on my Steam Deck and, nope, it still doesn’t look that great. And <i>Rebirth</i> isn’t the only game guilty of this. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2457220/Avowed"><i>Avowed</i>’s Steam Deck landing page</a> also shows the game performing at a level of fidelity that it simply cannot on the Deck.</p> <div id="gallery-1"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637696"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-1-2000637695"> 				© Screenshot: Square Enix / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>The recently released <i>Ninja Gaiden 4</i> also has this problem, and the subtitle text in the game isn’t what I’d consider legible enough on the Deck’s smaller screen. It does run at a respectable framerate, but it definitely doesn’t look as sharp on the Deck as it does in this simulated experience on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/verified/2627260/NINJA_GAIDEN_4">the game’s landing page</a>.</p> <div id="gallery-2"><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637746"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure><figure> 			 				<figcaption id="gallery-2-2000637745"> 				© Team Ninja / PlatinumGames / Kotaku 				</figcaption></figure> 		</div>  <p>I’m sure in the future, when the Deck gets its inevitable upgrade, it may run these specific games in a way that matches how they’re portrayed on their landing pages. But at that point, will there be new GPU-melting games that are beyond its capabilities, that are earning these badges and being featured in misleading ways on advertising pages? The Steam Deck deserves far more honesty.</p>
