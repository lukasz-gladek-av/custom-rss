Things started out well with the surprise success of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, the critically acclaimed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>, and the slick action duo of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>. But things took a downward turn in the summer thanks to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord’s</a> (failure to) launch. The doomed hero shooter and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">subsequent closing of developer Firewalk Studios</a> was certainly a low point for Sony, even if a delightful little robot did his best to brighten the mood in the fantastic <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>. Since then we’ve seen the arrival of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, an even more powerful PlayStation 5 console that comes at an eye-wateringly premium price and has been met with a mixed reception. But with time ticking away, there’s barely time left in 2024 to dwell on PlayStation’s past. It already feels like time to look ahead to 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the upcoming year have in store for PlayStation? With almost all of its first-party studios keeping cards close to chests, you may be mistaken for thinking things are looking quiet. But let's delve in deeper to see exactly what games to expect for the PS5 in 2025, as well as make a few hopeful guesses of our own.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2024</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Games We Know Are Coming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, let’s look at what is scheduled to come from those all-important PlayStation Studios. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is certainly looking like the headline attraction, and it’s coming to the PS5 in 2025. The sequel to 2020’s open-world samurai adventure, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, is set to be a stunner as we’re introduced to both a new hero and Northern Japanese location. Let’s hope for some gameplay trailers early next year or in the summer, ahead of a winter release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. It’s a multiplayer heist shooter, and so it will certainly be fascinating to see what lessons PlayStation has learned from the live-service disaster of Concord. First revealed in 2023, we’re yet to see any gameplay, but hopefully that doesn’t mean it won’t hit its target of a 2025 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And… those are the only PlayStation Studios games we currently know are slated for a 2025 release. And with no actual release dates locked in yet, we can barely plot out what to expect in each part of the year. But that isn’t to say there won’t be more big games coming to the PS5 next year, though, and we can certainly theorise at what else we might see from some of Sony’s first-party stable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We now know that Naughty Dog’s next adventure will take us to the stars in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. We don’t expect to be playing this in 2025, though, but we’ll happily eat up any more info Neil Druckmann and the team wants to share about it – especially if that includes some of that laser blade gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> has a lot of weight resting on its shoulders, not only because it will be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">Bungie’s first full release since it was acquired by Sony</a>, but alongside Fairgames, it will be PlayStation’s first big new live-service shooter to follow in the quickly fading footsteps of Concord. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> developers have as strong a shooter pedigree as anyone in the business, so it will certainly be interesting to see the result of its work as it aims to revive its long-dormant 90s series as a multiplayer extraction shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could 2025 be the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> emerges from its oily cocoon? Hideo Kojima was at The Game Awards but didn’t bring a new trailer with him. Unacceptable behaviour, if you ask me. Are we any closer to knowing what it’s all about? Who’s to say, but we certainly want to play it. And the sooner we can, the sooner Kojima can move on to working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive from the Metal Gear master.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for third-party exclusives, there’s a fair few to look forward to – especially if you’re into big swords. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> looks set to be a flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game. A semi-open world samurai bloodfest with soulslike elements, it certainly doesn’t look to be lacking in style. No release date has been given as yet, but let's hope for next year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of blades, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/where-winds-meet">Where Winds Meet</a> is a PS5 console-exclusive RPG set in ancient China. Taking place during the Ten Kingdoms Era, you step into the shoes of a warrior who wields influence over warring dynasties, shaping history with the point of your sword, as well as mystical and magical abilities. Originally set for a 2024 release before being delayed to add even more content to its packed, mammoth open world, it wouldn’t be a shock to see it finally arrive within the next 12 months.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait, there are more swords and even bigger blades in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ballad-of-antara">Ballad of Antara</a>, a free-to-play co-op action RPG packed with multiple protagonists and intertwining stories coming to the PS5 in 2025. We’ll get a better look at it soon, with a beta promised to be on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Think we’re done with swords? Think again. This next game even has one in the title: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword of the Sea</a>. You don’t use this one to fight with, though; instead, you’ll be plonking your feet on it and riding around at speed, Tony Hawk and Metaphor: ReFantazio style. From Abzû and The Pathless studio Giant Squid, the reveal trailer couldn’t help but remind us of Journey, as a mysterious cloaked character hoverswords around vast desert ruins. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another relatively fresh announcement, having only been revealed at September’s State of Play, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> is the next game from Lost in Random developer Moonhood Studios. An adventure handcrafted from clay, it’s set to be one of the most visually striking games of 2025. Plus, it’s even coming out on PS VR2. At least someone is helping out that long-forgotten little guy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last PS5 console exclusive we’re going to highlight is a game we wrote about exactly this time last year in our 2024 PlayStation look-ahead. Hopefully 2025 will be the year we finally get to clumsily bumble our way through the world of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/baby-steps">Baby Steps</a>. A PS5 console-exclusive, the team up from the developers behind Getting Over It and Ape Out looks equal parts agonising as it does hilarious.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That may be it for exclusives, but there are plenty more multiplatform games coming out in 2025 that are set to make it a bumper year for PlayStation players. Alongside the arrival of I<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">ndiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> onto PS5, there’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> to name but a few. Oh, and a little game called <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>. Could be good. Who knows.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hopes and Dreams</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Now for the fun part: the section where we get to cross our fingers and conjure up games that don’t exist yet, but maybe will appear before our eyes in 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Insomniac has had a relatively quiet year – for a studio that puts out new releases with such regularity, that is – but understandable considering it continues to recover from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">data breach suffered at the end of 2023</a>. We know that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Wolverine</a> is in the works but don’t yet know exactly when it will be in our hands. And, if rumours are to be believed, a Venom game is scheduled to arrive before it. While it may be unlikely that we’ll be playing either of these superhero stories within the next 12 months, we might get a clearer picture of what is coming next from the Spidey studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Santa Monica Studio. What’s next for the God of War developer is a mystery, although we do know Cory Barlog – game director of 2018’s God of War – moved on to helm a new project in 2021 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-new-director-cory-barlog-unannounced-projects">after leaving Eric Williams to fill Ragnarok’s director seat</a>. Could we see what Barlog’s game is in 2025?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 100 Best PlayStation Games of All Time</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for other studios, can we expect yet more delves into the world of Horizon from Guerrilla Games, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/live-service-game-horizon-online-reportedly-guerrillas-next-project-horizon-3-might-be-a-ways-off">an online multiplayer game reportedly in development</a> at the Amsterdam developers? And it's been a long time since Bend released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> – almost six whole years, in fact – and the studio has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-unannounced-project-logo-reveal">hinted that it's making another open-world adventure</a>. Little is known apart from that, but it’s safe to say we’d like to learn more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The truth is, we know very little about what is in the pipeline from many of Sony’s first-party studios, so don’t be surprised if the PS5 is in for another relatively quiet year in 2025. We’d be more than happy to be wrong about that, though, and be pleasantly surprised by a flurry of reveals and releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, could <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-becomes-majority-shareholder-in-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-no-full-takeover-for-now">Sony’s interest in acquiring the massive Kadokawa company</a> (which, alongside a huge anime portfolio, also owns FromSoftware) finally result in a Bloodborne remaster or sequel? I know we said these are hopes and dreams… but don’t be silly.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Hardware and Tech</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of hardware, Sony has been very busy over the past couple of years with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vr2">PS VR2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-portal">PlayStation Portal</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> all released to varying levels of success. As a result, we expect things to be quieter on the hardware front when it comes to 2025. However, it may be the year that we see the PS5 Pro justify itself further as an expensive upgrade if games like Ghost of Yotei and GTA 6 start to push the base PlayStation 5 to its limit. It will certainly be interesting to see how developers embrace this new tech over the next year or so, and if we start to see genuinely impressive comparisons between the original PS5 and Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But while we expect actual hardware releases to be quiet, we’ve heard whispers that there may be some news to share of fresh PlayStation tech in 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-set-to-take-on-nintendo-with-new-portable-playstation-report">Could we see Sony take another stab at the handheld market?</a> Just stick some internal storage into the Portal. I have no qualifications when it comes to hardware engineering, but how hard can it be, lads? In all seriousness, though, if recent reports are to be believed, then maybe we could actually see a successor to the PSP and PS Vita in the coming year, or at least an announcement of one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s be honest, it’s all guesswork isn’t it? Got your own theories and hopes for what we’ll see from PlayStation in 2025? Let us know in the comments below, as well as what you’re most excited to play.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Playing a Witch in Path of Exile 2? These Are the Best Summons]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-a-witch-in-path-of-exile-2-these-are-the-best-summons.1070850/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witch-path-of-exile-2-best-summons/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Witch was always a fan-favorite in the first Path of Exile, and that didn’t change with the launch of its sequel. People still gravitate toward the Witch for several reasons, primarily because she has powerful summons. With the right combination of skills and abilities, you can roam a map as the powerful Witch, clearing mobs of enemies without lifting a finger. But first, it’s best to learn the best summons in Path of Exile 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-choose-these-top-summons-for-witch-in-path-of-exile-2">Choose These Top Summons for Witch in Path of Exile 2</h2>



<p>Playing as a Witch proves more entertaining than you’d initially imagine. I mean, Chaos magic is downright fun to use and often quite powerful, but you’ll spend more time playing catch-up after your minions slay the entire zone ahead of you instead of casting a powerful bolt of magic.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>You have a handful of choices while playing as Witch, namely:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Frost Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zombies</strong></li>



<li><strong>Skeletal Warrior</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>These are in order from “best” to “worst” of the ones we recommend you use. Some may favor Skeletal Warriors above Zombies. The latter is a weak, time-limited unit that decays quickly, but you can spawn more quickly, nearly endlessly, to have a constant flow of minions dominating the battlefield. They’re an excellent tool that works similarly to a meat shield between your squishy Witch and the countless hard-hitting enemies across Wraeclast.</p>



<p>Skeletal Sniper is perhaps one of the most effective and useful summons available, as they deal ranged poison damage that bursts into a cloud of noxious fumes designed to deal area-of-effect damage and lock down mobs. For a similar effect, albeit less effective and with fire, Skeletal Arsonists come in second place.</p>



<p>However, keep in mind that Path of Exile 2 is currently in Early Access. Grinding Gear Games is still working on balancing and will likely change the effectiveness of many abilities before and after launch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-stalingrad-review-campaign-begins</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/undaunted-stalingrad-review-the-campaign-begins.1070841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-stalingrad-review-campaign-begins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undanuted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>. This time we're looking at <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>, which introduced a campaign setting to&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> in one of the most challenging military campaigns of the modern era.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=nEq2SZel 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-3.jpg?itok=GvfXQq3N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>'s map tiles not only get destroyed as the campaign unfolds but they can also be fortified.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your deck to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play. New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated. This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to work out how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-5.jpg?itok=XStSzDKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-5.jpg?itok=ClzXn6lS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>includes a rulebook and mapbook, and also a scenario book for both factions.</figcaption></figure><p>The difference with <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em>, from all other <em>Undaunted</em> games, is that <em>Stalingrad</em> is focused on a legacy campaign, rather than single battles. <em>2200 Callisto</em> had linked scenarios, but <em>Stalingrad</em>&nbsp;sees the results of each mission play into the next. In <em>Stalingrad</em>, both players start with the similar but not for the artwork decks, but over time, as you take losses and your troops gain experience, you will replace them with inferior replacements, upgrade them, gain new units, or maybe just lose them completely from your deck.</p>

<p>The map too changes over time, expanding, but also reacting to missions and the destruction you bring. Each mission directly links from the previous, and the campaign branches and adapts depending on the last, and with 35 possible scenarios in the book, along with each of the 2 factions having their own scenario book with background narrative and scenario rules, every time you play through will be different (unless you complete exactly the same mission with exactly the same results and the same losses somehow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-2.jpg?itok=ex0hvN70 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-2.jpg?itok=88SX07m6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Both the German and Soviet forces in&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>start with the same decks stat wise, but develop differetly as the campaign progresses.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Undaunted Stalingrad Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>features the 2 historical forces that were part of the campaign during WWII, the Germans and the Soviets. Both factions start with the same decks, but they have different upgrades and additions as the campaign develops. We're keeping this review spoiler-free, but the differences are very on-theme and in keeping with the forces of the time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=ztqI8vIp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-stalingrad-6.jpg?itok=OdjUGivU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As the&nbsp;<em>Undaunted Stalingrad </em>campaign progresses, the Game State will change depending on the winner of each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Does The Campaign Work In Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>At the end of each scenario, along with removing casualties from your deck, and upgrading troops, the game also tracks the game state with a number. Using a table, you take the current game state number, and depending on who the victor is, change the game state to the new number based on that scenario.</p>

<p>The game state also tells you which background section of the scenario book for your force to read, and then which scenario to play next. The scenario then tells you which cards to unlock, your objectives for that game, and any special rules to play.</p>

<p>The developing map and changing deck really does bring home the pressures of war, and makes you consider your decisions in battle. It's easy to throw troops forward when you know everything resets for the next game, but when you're several games into a campaign, and you know that losing a tank could put you on the back foot for the rest of the campaign, your strategy will change.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> is designed for the long haul and that's where it shines. Both players need to be happy going in that there's going to be a few games to get to the end of the campaign, to get the most out of it, rather than the pick-up and play options in the earlier <em>Undaunted</em> products.</p>

<p><i>Undaunted Stalingrad&nbsp;</i>is a fantastic if somber experience. Anyone who's read my reviews before will know that theme is huge for me, as it's easy to put a thematic skin on some mechanics in order to gain audience buy-in, but <em>Undaunted Stalingrad</em> really captures what was a horrendous, grueling campaign for both sides. It takes the solid <em>Undaunted</em> mechanics, and mixes them extremely well with the branching legacy campaign, along with capturing the unique feel of both forces, which was also very pleasing to see.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Undaunted Stalingrad?</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a quick pick up and play game, as a new player, or a previous <em>Undaunted</em> player, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is at it's best when played as part of the legacy campaign, and you should try out one of the other <em>Undaunted</em> options (<em>2200 Callisto</em>&nbsp;has a linked campaign, but you can play any scenario you wish). If you're not a fan of the WWII theme, then this leans into it very heavily, and when you're deep in the campaign, it's hard to see past it. If you want an incredibly thematic experience, then <em>Stalingrad</em> is that, but if you want a deck-builder wargame hybrid without the WWII theme, then try <em>2200 Callisto</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/29/game-of-the-year-2024-best-playstation-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While 2024 has not arguably been one of the biggest years for exclusives, Sony has still had some big hitters come in. Those include remakes and reimaginings of beloved favourites, the dawn of new IPs that could go on to establish themselves as part of the PlayStation Pantheon, and more memorable experiences that will live on in memory whether you’re new to gaming or have been part of the PlayStation journey since the beginning. With that in mind, there could only have been one clear winner for this award.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> is pure, unfiltered joy. What better game to win Best PlayStation than one that celebrates everything PlayStation from its 30 year history? Astro Bot is more than just a celebration though. It is the culmination of a character that found its beginning in the original PSVR era, and then introduced players to all the features of the PS5, and now being cemented as the current PlayStation mascot.</p>
<p>Astro Bot has so many elements to it that make it great. Levels are based on classic franchises, there are plenty of Bot characters to find hidden away, tons of secrets to uncover, and it is getting regular free updates with even more content to play through. It looks stunning, it sounds stunning, and the gameplay of Astro Bot is really smooth too. Astro Bot captures the very core of the message Play Has No Limits.</p>
<h2>Helldivers 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> was one of those gaming phenomena where it feels like literally everyone is playing the exact same thing… or at least trying to, as servers inevitably crumbled during the early days and weeks. Taking Arrowhead’s familiar formula of friendly fire filled co-op action, but adapting it now to a third person shooter, just being able to blast bugs like its 1999’s Starship Troopers was enough to grab everyone’s attention, but that initial drop would lead to another, and then another, and then another.</p>

<p>The initial hook was the humour of the excessive military might you could call upon for backup, while being inherently very, very squishy and prone to being caught in the explosion that you or your friends just called in. Throw in a meta-game of planetary conquest/liberation played against a DM within Arrowhead, and a wild obsession with a planet that quickly became dubbed ‘Space Vietnam’, and Helldivers 2 was pretty much all that anyone was talking about for a month or two following its release. That’s the stuff that GOTY contenders are made of!</p>
<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth – Runner-up</h2>
<p>It’s a little wild to think that a remake of a game that’s more than two decades old could be hemmed in by technical limitations, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> leaving the PS4 behind and going all in on the current generation, that seems to have been the case. This middle chapter in the remake trilogy goes all in on having broad open areas that are stuffed with things to do, whether that’s fixing chocobo stops, settling in for a round of Fort Condor, or getting stuck in with some challenge battles to perfect your use of the subtle new tweaks in combat.</p>
<p>Of course, the real draw is still going to be the retelling of the JRPG classic’s story, which is handled masterfully well as it fleshes out the middle third of the tale, further exploring the cast of characters and additional backstory in ways that the original couldn’t. It’s a good thing there’s so much side content to help tide fans over until the series’ conclusion.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-xbox-game.1070787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/29/game-of-the-year-2024-best-xbox-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With Microsoft’s numerous acquisitions in the late 2010s, many expected a year like 2024 to come much sooner. As it is, the wash of good games and blend of first and second party exclusives has arrived seemingly just in time for the tech giant to completely upend its gaming strategy and pivot away from exclusives almost entirely.</p>
<p>It’s a shame in some ways, the old tribalism of console wars still having a certain appeal like sports fandom, but in the fullness of time, it’s probably better that you can play whatever you want, wherever you want.</p>

<p>From its first announcement through to release, there was no small amount of concern for what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> would be like. MachineGames are best known for the Wolfenstein series where you mow down hundreds of Nazi goons at once, and less for the Uncharted-y style third person romps that were inspired so heavily by those original Indy films. Of course, the end result is pretty much nothing like either of these games.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own path, the largely first person view shifting the pacing of the game’s exploration and puzzles, the relative lack of guns pushing you more towards stealth and quick whip-assisted fisticuffs. It’s a thoroughly enjoyable adventure, and it also feels like Indiana Jones throughout, thanks to a solid rendition of the character by Troy Baker, and some excellently directed cutscenes that capture the madcap nature of the films.</p>

<p>This is a must for Xbox gamers today… and PlayStation gamers won’t have to wait too long to see for themselves.</p>
<h2>STALKER 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2</a> on its own is a remarkable achievement in survival horror. The immersive worlds, tense inventory management, and realistically raw and brutal combat that made this series so iconic are back in full effect – the awkward glitches and bugs that accompanied those original entries in the franchise also see a return as well. There’s a charm in that blend of seriousness and clunkiness, though, and it’s endearing to be scared for your life wading through irradiated swamps only to see a pig ragdoll across the sky or an NPC to promise he’s got the best goods for sale only to offer you moldy bread and a rusted knife.</p>
<p>It’s a beautiful and unforgettable gaming experience, but the unprecedented dedication and perseverance of the Ukranian team behind the game deserve’s just as much recognition and admiration as the game itself.</p>
<p><em>– Miguel M</em></p>
<h2>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Asobo’s rebooted Microsoft Flight Simulator was an absolute marvel in 2020, and it only got better over time. Built around a computer-generated rendition of the whole world, smartly adapted from satellite and flyover imagery, it lacked some of that human touch to start with, which was gradually fed in over time with region-specific overhauls.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, then, seeks to build more of a game on top of that framework. There’s a whole career to work your way through, which will introduce you to specific mission types like air search and rescue, helicopter cargo transport, mountain rescue, commercial aviation and much, much more. There’s also new aircraft types, with gliders, airships and hot air balloons, and if you want (as it required for a number of photography missions), you can land your plane and go walk around. And again, that’s with MSFS 2024 featuring the entire world…</p>
<p>There’s some bugbears, though, and launch was plagued by server issues, no doubt partly related to the new fully dynamic download process that keeps the initial install as small as possible – the kinds of issues that make you thankful the 2020 game still exists! The future is bright for this one, though, and we’re keen to see what’s next from the team at Asobo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-2024-indie-game-of-the-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Indie games are thriving like never before. From innovative gameplay to stunning visuals, the indie scene is a treasure trove of creativity, with standout titles across every platform. This year, games like Animal Well, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Nine Sols, and UFO 50 captured our hearts and imaginations. Yet, even among such a stellar lineup, one game stood above the rest — not just as the best indie game, but as one of the year’s defining games overall. Say hello to Balatro, your 2024 indie game of the year.</p>



<p>In a poll on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forums</a>, Balatro emerged victorious, earning a commanding 72% of the votes. It outpaced contenders like Palworld, Harold Halibut, Animal Well, and UFO 50. And if you’ve played even a few hands of Balatro, the result should be no surprise.</p>



<h3 id="h-redefining-the-deck">Redefining the Deck</h3>



<p>At its base, Balatro is a poker game, but not as you know it. Developer <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LocalThunk</a> takes the familiar structure of poker and transforms it into something wildly original.</p>



<p>Players start with a traditional 52-card deck, but from there, the rules are upended. Instead of competing against other players, your goal is to hit specific target scores using creative strategies. The addition of Joker modifiers (special abilities that can alter the way cards behave) is a game changer. For example, modifiers might let you form straights by skipping numbers or treat hearts and diamonds as a single suit. These twists create an endless variety of deck-building possibilities, ensuring that no two runs are ever the same.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Balatro - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgrv9giaNO8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-endless-strategy">High Stakes, Endless Strategy</h3>



<p>The beauty of Balatro lies in its balance of simplicity and depth. Players must carefully manage their money and deck-building strategies to progress through the game’s eight antes. The Boss Blinds that present unique challenges to test your planning and adaptability, add an extra layer of complexity. Every decision feels meaningful, and one wrong move can spell the end of a run.</p>



<p>But that’s precisely what makes Balatro so addictive. It’s the perfect “just one more run” game, where every defeat only fuels your desire to improve and try again. Few games manage to capture this balance of challenge and replayability so effectively.</p>



<p>What makes Balatro truly special is how it reimagines a familiar concept and makes it feel entirely fresh. LocalThunk’s ingenuity and commitment to creating a unique experience shines through in every hand you play. It’s a game that keeps you on your toes, rewards thinking, and delivers endless hours of fun.</p>

<p>The Sports genre continues to tick along and produce annual entries. However, new sports IPs are constantly popping up, and legendary series’ are being revived. All of this happened in 2025, so let’s show you our Best Sports Game of 2024 winner and nominees.</p>



<p>Sports games are a genre that will never die. With so many sports and simulated interpretations of them, we’re guaranteed multiple releases each year. Plus, as most sports have annual seasons, it makes sense to see yearly iterations. I’m thinking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-team-of-the-year-promo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a>, NBA 2K, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-25-was-the-best-selling-game-in-us-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden</a>, and a myriad of other popular franchises.</p>



<p>2024 featured a lot of these names, and our Best Sports Game of 2024 award winner came top of the league.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-title-of-2024-winner-ea-fc-25">Best Sports Title of 2024 Winner — EA FC 25</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I can only imagine the greatness of this conversation. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel it says a lot about the state of sports titles when EA FC 25 is the recipient of our Best Sports Game of 2024 award. EA’s latest soccer sim sequel isn’t bad by any means—and I’ve spent a couple of hundred hours with it already—but its lack of innovation is symptomatic of a genre that seems to thrive on the concept.</p>



<p>However, when it works, EA FC 25 is a fabulous addition to the long-running series. The 2024 iteration features the new FC IQ tactical system upgrades—which make a world of difference to your gameplay—and I’ve enjoyed the flexibility to mold my team and adapt to my ever-changing squad of players. </p>



<p>Also, Rush is a brand-new 5v5 game mode effectively replacing Volta’s ghost town. These matches are fast-paced, shorter, take place on smaller pitches, and encourage high-scoring games. Absent-minded teammates can detract from the experience, but it’s a great inclusion and something I hope EA builds on.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 features subtle tweaks across the board, and modes such as Pro Clubs have undergone their biggest changes in years. The main selling point for FC 25 is it plays a great game of soccer—the biggest (and best) sport on the planet. Yes, center-backs can somehow catch up to Mbappé&nbsp;with little effort, referees are card-happy, and certain shooting mechanics can be exploited—like every year—but I <em>always </em>want to play another match.</p>



<p>I feel other sports titles aren’t doing enough to make their presence known. For soccer alone, eFootball continues to be a shell of its former Pro Evolution Soccer self, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ufl-achievements-trophies-list-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UFL</a> is the new kid on the block trying to make a name for itself. I’m hoping a sports game (old or new) brings 2025 to life and challenges the EA FC mantle.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-sports-games-of-2024-nominations">Best Sports Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>EA FC 25 hasn’t won by a landslide, don’t get this twisted. Other sports titles have more than adequately put their name in the hat. From improved follow-ups to returning legends, let’s check out the main contenders to the crown. </p>



<h3 id="h-wwe-2k24">WWE 2K24</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t go one-on-one with The Undertaker. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>WWE 2K24 feels like a series heading in the right direction. 2K22 was a welcome return after the 2K20 fiasco, and 2K23 was a step-up. Here, I feel WWE 2K24 is once again a gradual improvement over its predecessor, without being groundbreaking. The realism, presentation, and refined nature of the in-ring mechanics are as sumptuous as ever. However, a seriously lackluster Showcase Mode (for 40 Years of Wrestlemania, no less) and technical issues bring WWE 2K24 down, and the developer needs to address the same recurring drawbacks for it to earn a GOTY title match.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-sports-college-football-25">EA Sports College Football 25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prestigious. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A 2013 legal dispute halted the beloved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/despite-call-of-duty-release-college-football-25-is-still-the-best-selling-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA Sports College Football</a> franchise quicker than a quarter-back running full-speed into an offensive tackle. It’s taken 11 years, but EA Sports College Football 25 has been a blessing for many who want an alternative to EA’s annual mire which is Madden. This is potentially the start of something beautiful. The College Football aesthetic is nailed down for every team and it features improved gameplay mechanics Madden could do with copying. However, its game modes aren’t the deepest, and it feels like EA was testing the waters with EA Sports College Football 25—a much-improved sequel could throw a flag on the field though.</p>



<h3 id="h-topspin-2k25">TopSpin 2K25</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A swift backhand to the sports genre. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>I had to do a double-take when I realized it’s been 13 years since I owned the last TopSpin game—2011’s TopSpin 4. I’m not sure why Tennis games haven’t been chased very hard over the years—given the popularity of the sport—but I’m glad 2K are now firing on all sports fronts—with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> on the way. I feel I can copy and paste many of the sentiments I did for the nominees. TopSpin offers great gameplay with its winning combination of punchy, racket-slapping shots and authentic tennis matches. But it’s rough around the edges in place: Stadiums and licensed players look great, but animations began to repeat frequently, and it needs a bit more depth in its content. Like EA Sports College Football 25, we’re glad to see it back, and hope it goes one better next time!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Countless Nintendo Switch 2 rumors have circulated over the past couple of years, but none had nailed down the new console's launch date yet. A few hours ago, the Italian website UAGNA <a href="https://www.uagna.it/videogiochi/esclusiva-ecco-la-data-di-uscita-di-nintendo-switch-2-200465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the rumor that Nintendo Switch 2 accessories (first-party as well as third-party ones) will launch on the market on March 28. As such, they believe this to be the release date for the console, too.</p>
<p>To begin with, we must take this with a big grain of salt. That said, it's not completely out of the realm of possibility. In fact, last month, another rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-march-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed</a> to a January reveal and a subsequent late March debut for the console. Just a few days ago, we learned that the date for the announcement could be January 8, 2025.</p>
<p>It would be an accelerated timetable compared to the predecessor. The Switch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-review-gen-hat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on March 3, 2017, but it was first showcased by Nintendo on October 20, 2016. The console was then briefly demonstrated in December at Jimmy Fallon's show, while a proper press event, including the final release date, took place in January. If these rumors are true, Nintendo might be compressing everything into the January unveiling.</p>
<p>The console's specifications have long been shared by leaks and are unlikely to have changed since. Nintendo has once again partnered with NVIDIA, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choosing their Tegra 239 SoC</a>, which is a customized version of the Orin SoC originally announced in 2018. It will be powered by an eight-core CPU with 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores and a GPU based on the Ampere architecture featuring 2048 CUDA Cores. Support for NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Ray Reconstruction is believed to be included.</p>
<p>However, it seems that the Nintendo Switch 2 will only <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">output at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second</a> when docked. If confirmed, this would undoubtedly be disappointing for a new console that debuts in 2025—rival consoles from Sony and Microsoft have supported not only 60 frames per second but now even up to 120 frames per second for years.</p>
<p>So far, analysts are bullish on the new hardware's sales prospects, believing that the new platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sell-17-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could sell 80 million units by 2028</a>. Of course, a lot will depend on the games. The long-awaited Metroid Prime 4 could be a cross-platform launch like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Switch, but the new hardware (despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-confirmed-to-be-backward-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed backward compatibility</a>) will need some brand new titles to really gain traction.</p>

            <p>Ho-ho-hello! And welcome to our annual <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Newscast</a> quiz for the festive season: Eurogamer's big News Quiz of the Year 2024.</p>
<p>From lawsuits to layoffs, alarm clocks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> leaks, it has been another non-stop year. We've published nearly 4000 news stories since January began. But now, we've boiled it all down to this: 24 questions covering 2024.</p>
<p>It's time to find out how much of this year you remember - and how Eurogamer's own news team did recalling the stories we all wrote. (Spoiler: once again, things get competitive.) </p>
<p>If you'd like to join along at home, please do! We begin with 12 questions based on stories this year (one from each month of the year), some general knowledge  (also about video game news), and then a smattering of headlines from just the past few weeks with missing words for our contestants to try and fill in. </p>
<p>Joining me for one last time this year are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy. Please enjoy, and we'll see you for much more news in 2025!</p>

<p>When was the last time you came in first on Call of Duty: Warzone? You might win a match next year with a few worthwhile Warzone tips and tricks from someone who won a single round way back when the game was first released.</p>



<h2 id="h-open-your-parachute-early"><strong>Open Your Parachute Early</strong></h2>



<p>Most people carefully plan their drops with pinpoint accuracy. They know which building they’ll camp in and the route they’ll take into the zone once it appears. But you know better.</p>



<p><strong>Open your chute early</strong>. When you do, you pull your starting pistol. Did you know you can kill opposing players while they’re still floating down to the ground? Use these precious seconds in the air to down an enemy player, or at the very least, take some of their health away.</p>



<h2 id="h-spend-cash-early-spend-it-often"><strong>Spend Cash Early, Spend It Often</strong></h2>



<p>When you die, you wind up in the Gulgag. You’ll receive a single life in a 1v1 against another opponent there. If you die, you’re done. If you win, you resurrect and parachute down once more.</p>



<p>To avoid losing all of the money you earned up to this point, spend it early and often. You can buy a self-resurrect for $4500, which is invaluable to avoid the Gulag and remain in the match.</p>



<p>While playing in a party, any help you can provide to your team makes you invaluable, so spend the money to revive dead teammates!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-how-to-get-a-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-cleaver-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to Get a Cleaver in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-avoid-the-gas"><strong>Avoid the Gas</strong></h2>



<p>Well, duh. This is a non-tip, you’re likely thinking. But wait, the gas in Call of Duty: Warzone is unlike the gas found in PUBG or Fortnite. In this battle royale, the gas is deadly. With the gas rapidly encroaching your position, you cannot hang around, waiting to unleash an ambush.</p>



<p>If you have a gas mask, your character will automatically put it on when inside the gas zone. But this process takes a long time. Use that limited time to find a better position—a gas-free position.</p>



<h2 id="h-grind-the-pre-game"><strong>Grind the Pre-Game</strong></h2>



<p>Many are content to sit around and wait for the actual battle royale to begin. They grab a drink, eat a snack, or check their social media.</p>



<p>During the pre-game, use those precious minutes to train your weapons. You earn XP before the match by getting kills, which unlocks perks, attachments, and skins.</p>

<p>What’s the end game of any role-playing game? It’s fashion, right? Many of us play RPGs and MMORPGs because we feel a deep connection to a character we built from the ground up. As that character progresses in level, becomes stronger, and finds better gear, a part of ourselves flows into said character. And upon reaching the end game, when you’re all-powerful, what then? Well, it’s time to learn how to transmog gear in <strong>Diablo 4</strong>!</p>



<h2 id="h-travel-to-kyovashad"><strong>Travel to Kyovashad</strong></h2>



<p>You can transmog your gear in Diablo 4 by traveling to the central city of Kyovashad. You’ll find a small inn directly to the north of the waypoint. On the top floor, the only room at the top of the landing that players can enter, is a bed and a cabinet. It’s here that you’ll transmog your equipment.</p>



<p>Once you activate the cabinet, you’ll find various options to customize your character better. You can alter your appearance by adding cosmetic items like the wolf pup backpack cosmetic from the beta or transmog your gear based on available cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-earn-transmogs-in-diablo-4"><strong>How to Earn Transmogs in Diablo 4</strong></h2>



<p>If your selection of transmogs feels lackluster, it’s because you’ve been spending all your time raking in the gold instead of salvaging items.</p>



<p>By visiting the local blacksmith in any settlement, you can salvage unwanted gear and, occasionally, receive a new transmog. You can tell when you’ll earn a new cosmetic look based on the hammer-like icon over the item.</p>



<p>Of course, you’ll also be able to buy premium cosmetics through the in-game store. Those, however, can be pretty expensive. As we’ve seen since the Early Access launch, the store features quite the pricing scheme. A single outfit collection can cost up to $25!</p>



<p>Alternatively, you can buy the occasional single piece, like a shield cosmetic, for much less.</p>







<h2 id="h-saving-outfits-for-later-use"><strong>Saving Outfits for Later Use</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps one of the most annoying aspects of a transmog system in RPGs is having to continually update your appearance after acquiring new gear. For some, it’s easier to wait until max level. Others, however—myself included—like to look like an absolute unit throughout the game.</p>



<p>Thankfully, in the transmog section, you’ll find ‘Ensembles.’ You start with a single ensemble slot and pay gold to unlock additional slots.</p>



<p>This feature allows players to quickly transmog an entire gear set to suit their style and appearance desires with one click.</p>

<p>Do you have a favorite cosmetic set in Diablo 4? Let us know in the comments, or share a screenshot of your character in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As surprising as it was to see Nintendo drop an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/">uncharacteristically creepy teaser</a> earlier this year about a masked man known as "Emio," few could have expected it would be related to a brand-new entry in the company's long-dormant Famicom Detective Club series. What's less surprising is just how riveting the game turned out to be, an expertly paced thriller whose setting, music, and atmosphere masterfully crescendo into one of the most suspenseful denouements Nintendo has ever conjured.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for Emio - The Smiling Man follow.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">The lead-up to this climax, however, is anything but straightforward. Like the previous two games in the Famicom Detective Club series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club/" data-ref-id="5000-635127">Emio - The Smiling Man</a> is a slow-burn detective story--a densely plotted mystery that unravels methodically over the course of roughly a dozen hours. Picking up a few years after the events of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/famicom-detective-club-the-missing-heir/" data-ref-id="5000-527219">The Missing Heir</a>, the Utsugi Detective Agency is enlisted to aid police detectives Junko Kuze and Daisuke Kamihara in investigating the death of a teenage boy, who was discovered wearing a paper bag unsettlingly scrawled with a smiley face.</p><p dir="ltr">What's most shocking about this scene, however, is how it eerily parallels a series of unsolved murders that occurred in town 18 years ago, leading you and the police to suspect the same culprit is responsible. The only other lead to go off of is a disturbing urban legend of a serial killer known as Emio, the "Smiling Man"--a paper-bag wearing individual who approaches crying girls at night and strangles them, placing a smiley face paper bag over their heads afterward to leave them with an everlasting smile.</p><p dir="ltr">With this tenuous connection as your starting point, you embark on a winding investigation, navigating a deliberately laid breadcrumb trail of clues, misdirections, and dead ends. But for all the progress you make, the answer always seems just beyond reach. Every new lead you uncover only raises further questions, and it often feels as if you are no closer to discovering the connection between the cases, let alone the culprit's identity and whereabouts.</p><p dir="ltr">That is, until you reach the penultimate chapter. Following a tense car ride with Detective Kamihara, you return to the city center to canvass the locals for any more potential leads you can discover. After a largely fruitless search around town, you eventually meet two unassuming construction workers, who suddenly turn your understanding of the case upside down.</p><div tabindex="0"

format.     </p><p>Sorry, but you can't access this content!</p></div><p dir="ltr">During the ensuing conversation, you present to the workers two police sketches: one of a man named Minoru Tsuzuki, a person of interest from the serial murders who has been missing for 18 years; and one of Makoto Kuze, Detective Kuze's missing brother who also disappeared around the time of the serial murders. The construction workers claim to have just recently worked with a man named Minoru Tsuzuki, but they don't recognize the Minoru depicted in the police sketch. Rather, they both identify the sketch of Makoto as Minoru.</p><p dir="ltr">Even more curiously, the construction workers recall driving Minoru home on the last day of their project. The background music suddenly falls silent as the two recount dropping Minoru off in the middle of nowhere at the foot of the mountains, then watching the strange man as he wordlessly waded through the overgrowth and up the mountainside. It's a confounding twist, made all the more chilling by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPiQu-iBXag" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ominous track</a> that accompanies their testimony, reinforcing the feeling that you're on the precipice of some horrible revelation.</p><p dir="ltr">The tension is only amplified as you delve into the final chapter, which begins with your arrival at Yamanba Pass, the eerie stretch of road in the middle of the mountains where Minoru was last seen. The atmosphere is immediately unnerving. The overgrown brush and dilapidated pavement make it apparent no one has been through the area in quite some time, and the only audible sound is the faint, haunting murmur of the wind blowing through the trees. With sunset quickly approaching and no other path forward, you have little choice but to enter the woods and continue pursuing your new lead.</p><p dir="ltr">The ascent is unbearably foreboding. As dusk gradually creeps in and you steadily make your way up the mountainside, scanning the thick foliage for any clues that may lead you in the right direction, you come upon multiple forks in the trail, most of which either double back to a previous area or lead off to a dead end. It's tense and disorienting, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG-SKfTAFHM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unsettling background music</a> that plays as you negotiate this seemingly endless forest only accentuates the feeling of unease.</p><p dir="ltr">But what really lends this scene an overwhelming sense of dread is the way the game deftly manipulates player expectations. Though you as the audience are aware that several characters have had brushes with the Smiling Man at different points in the story, you as the protagonist have yet to meet him yourself--which must mean your inevitable face-to-face encounter with the elusive killer could happen at any given moment while you're desperately navigating this dark, remote mountain.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a palpably tense experience, and a testament to how masterfully executed the game's closing chapters are. And that's to say nothing of the wrenching epilogue that unlocks after the credits roll, which ties up every loose end and lingering question in gutting fashion. Though it may not have garnered as much mainstream attention as some other releases, these climactic moments solidify Emio - The Smiling Man as one of the year's most poignant titles, a genuinely tender, funny, and heartrending tale that will stay with me for years to come.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

			<p>This year, many awesome games were released, and some fantastic DLCs and expansions for games for titles that debuted in previous years were also launched. Some of them were completely unexpected, while others had people waiting eagerly for the DLC to unlock on their device so that they could get stuck in. Here is Wccftech's best DLC/expansion of 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a></em></p>

<h2>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs (8.5/10)</h2>
<p>Alan Wake 2 has received two DLCs, both of which were released this year. Night Springs came out stronger than The Lake House. Both were phenomenal and the perfect addition to the Remedy universe. In typical Alan Wake fashion, the story was wild and unpredictable but a ton of fun to dive into.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it is starkly different from the game it's attached to. It doesn't have much to do with the main characters of Alan Wake 2 and instead takes you on three individual characters' journeys, including Control protagonist Jesse Faden. Below is an excerpt from the review written by Francesco De Meo.</p>
<p><em>While the gameplay is pretty much in line with the North Star episode, this episode is considerably better than the other two and the one that feels the closest to the base experience. It is possibly even more daring than the base game in terms of visual presentation, masterfully blending together some very different styles, something that alone makes it worth the price of admission.</em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">10/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Starting off strong, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is an absolutely fantastic expansion to Elden Ring and has so much content that it's basically the same value as a whole game for half the price. This was eagerly awaited by many and was even given a perfect score by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>It introduced some great bosses and more lore for the Elden Ring universe. Players got to face off against some of the hardest bosses the Elden Ring universe has seen, with new ways to level up and gain strength to carry them through the DLC. FromSoftware can do no wrong, or so it seems anyway.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</h2>
<p>This year also saw the release of a new expansion for one of the most loved MMORPGs on the market right now. Dawntrail is the latest DLC for Final Fantasy XIV, a DLC that is brilliant in its own right but doesn't quite stand up to the excellence of Shadowbringers or Endwalker, for example. However, the game hasn't really ever experienced a terrible expansion, and all have elements that are enjoyable in their own way.</p>
<p>The same goes for Dawntrail, which introduced new Jobs (playable classes) for players to pick up, too. Players now have the option to play as a <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-unlock-viper-in-ffxiv-dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Viper</a> or a <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-unlock-pictomancer-in-ffxiv-dawntrail/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pictomancer</a>, which are two incredibly fun classes to get into.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Dredge: The Iron Rig</h2>
<p>Dredge is a fantastic game that blends the "cozy game" genre with a hint of horror. The game takes you on a solo fishing adventure, where everything is not quite as it seems. Soon, you're fishing up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2561450/DREDGE__The_Iron_Rig/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lovecraftian horrors</a> from the ocean and making a quick buck by selling them to a vendor who doesn't seem all too surprised.</p>
<p>This year saw the release of The Iron Rig, the second official expansion for the game. It adds another couple of hours to the game and allows you to build the newest destination, with 50 new fish to catch and more achievements to get. Compared to the base game, this expansion is more focused on the fishing element, which is perfect for those who enjoy that element of the game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>World of Warcraft: The War Within (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">9.5/10</a>)</h2>
<p>World of Warcraft is a game that often gets a lot of hate, as they have released some expansions that haven't done the game justice and led to the game nearly dying (thank you, Shadowlands.) However, The War Within is an expansion done right, introducing a fun new villain from the Void. The new zones are gorgeous (albeit a bit laggy in Dornogal), with a lot of fun side quests, dailies and a great campaign that is still being added to.</p>
<p>When it comes to expansions being accessible, The War Within is up there as one of the best. The focus is no longer strictly on those who want to do Mythic+ dungeons and Mythic Raiding, and there's a shift of focus over to those who enjoy questing and doing single-player content or multiplayer content with minimal consequences. Here's my summary from the review:</p>
<p><em>Overall, World of Warcraft: The War Within has been a delight to experience, from fun and rewarding mount grinds to surprisingly adorable pets (looking at you, Oop'lajax), as well as some genuinely heartbreaking quests that you get to experience in the main story campaign.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-co-ceo-open-to-bringing-back-classic-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>When <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-best-single-player-game-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot released</a> in September, many players loved the nod to the history of Sony and PlayStation classics throughout the game. From tributes to more recent franchises like Horizon and Uncharted to older series like Ape Escape, the game fed into nostalgia in a big way. This has led to questions about whether PlayStation could dip into its backlog of classic franchises for new games in the future.</p>



<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202412/26274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famitsu</a>, PlayStation Co-CEO Herman Hulst was asked about past PlayStation series and the possibility of bringing them back. According to Hulst, it’s not something that’s out of the question for the company.</p>



<p>“The numerous IP holdings we hold are important assets for PlayStation, and as part of our efforts to strengthen our portfolio, we are continuously looking at opportunities to leverage past IPs, as well as developing new franchises,” Hulst said via auto translation.</p>



<p>Hulst added that the company’s goal is to release games made by the best developers whether they are a part of PlayStation Studios or not. He tipped the hat to external studios for the “many successes so far”.</p>



<p>The idea of reviving past franchises has picked up steam across the games industry over the years. Currently, fellow Japanese company Sega <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-outlines-segas-plans-for-new-slate-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is in the middle</a> of a massive revival of classic games like Golden Axe, Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, Streets of Rage, and more. </p>



<p>Whether PlayStation decides to bring back classic titles down the line obviously remains to be seen. Still, it has to be nice for longtime fans of the studio to see that the door isn’t closed if the right opportunity comes along.</p>



<p>What classic PlayStation franchises do you hope to see get a revival in the future? Let us know down below and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-pc-game.1070508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/28/game-of-the-year-2024-best-pc-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Time was that PC gaming was synonymous with mouse &amp; keyboard gaming, this being the best way to play twitchy first person shooters, clickathon real time strategies, and the like. But PC gaming has morphed to be so, so much more than that. In fact, PC has become something of the urplatform for those who can afford it, as it has gobbled up former console exclusives, opened the floodgates to indie devs and early access, and controller support has got better and better to the point that Steam Deck and other handheld gaming PCs are now totally viable.</p>
<p>All of which brings us to our Best PC Game award, drawing from across the breadth of what PC gaming can offer. And no, they won’t be pushing your 4090 or ray tracing to the max.</p>

<p>It might be a little unfair to be putting a single release that contains 50 separate games (51 if you count the secret hidden one) up against more traditional releases, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/ufo50-packs-50-retro-styled-games-into-one-amazing-package/">UFO 50</a> truly stands out as a modern day classic. Inspired by the infamous Action 52 cartridge from the NES days (but with no sign of the woeful CheetahMen, thank goodness), UFO 50 sets itself up as the complete catalogue for an unreleased console from the 80s. Contained within are a dizzying array of NES-like games from all kinds of styles and genres, many of which would be fantastic taken on their own.</p>
<p>Completing each title unlocks content for the framing narrative but there is also plenty of high score and speedrun potential for the more skilled gamers. That being said, you will need to make use of old-school techniques and learning level designs and enemy patterns to succeed. There is little of the modern handholding that AAA games rely on here.</p>

<p>I’ve put most of my time into UFO 50 on the Steam Deck so it has felt like a console experience and it really comes into its own here. Whether you remember the halcyon days of dodgy multi-game cartridges or not UFO 50 is so full of charm and originality that it fully deserves to be seen as the standout PC exclusive title of 2024.</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Hollowbody – Runner-up</h2>
<p>I’d been looking forward to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody’s</a> release for a long while after playing an early demo and enjoying its novel take on survival horror via a Blade Runner aesthetic. This excitement was proved entirely well placed when I got my hands on the full game. The fixed camera angles, traditional feeling combat and excellently designed environmental puzzles all combine to make a true modern day classic, all topped off by the futuristic dystopian UK setting.</p>
<p>Since release, Headware Games have added plenty of new features and fixed the few bugs that remained to make an even more complete package. Most recently an over-the-shoulder third person camera perspective has been patched in to appeal to gamers who don’t share my nostalgia for the old school tank controls and fixed views. So good is Hollowbody that I’m planning to go back and replay it to look for extra stuff I missed before I do the same with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. If you have access to a PC that can run it, then you owe it to yourself to check it out.</p>
<p><em>– Steve C</em></p>
<h2>Ara: History Untold – Runner-up</h2>
<p>The last few years have seen a rush of new historical 4X games launch, as all manner of developers seek to put their spin on this subgenre before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/20/civilization-vii-gameplay-revealed-with-february-release-date/">the next big Civilization game hits</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">Ara: History Untold</a> brings with it a fresh perspective and emphasis on the empire building and cultural aspects of the genre, almost deemphasising warfare and combat as you manage supply chains, production lines and more to get ahead.</p>
<p>There’s and arresting visual style to how your cities will sprawl across the map, but the framing of the game through the passing of ages and distinct technological eras will have a much greater impact for those who love to sink turn after turn after turn into this genre.</p>
<h4>Honourable mentions (in alphabetical order)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Frostpunk 2</li>
<li>Mouthwashing</li>
<li>Satisfactory</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Are you an acolyte of the mouse and keyboard, or perhaps a Deck devotee? What have you been playing this past year on PC?</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-nintendo-in-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon it will be 2025, also known as the year Nintendo <em>finally </em>pulls back the curtain on its next console. After 2024 was filled with shaky rumors, alleged leaks, and nonstop speculation about the Nintendo Switch successor, we know for a fact Nintendo will share more about the next generation in less than 100 days. If that’s not exciting enough for you, the Nintendo Switch still has a few cards up its sleeve and 2025 will finally see the launch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</a> eight years after its initial announcement. And, as always, there will surely be some surprises along the way, with some possibly tied to a certain plumber’s 40th anniversary. Here’s what to expect from Nintendo in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo in 2025: What’s Already On the Books</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into Switch 2, let’s recap what we already know is coming to Switch in 2025. Nintendo has been incredibly consistent at publishing a Switch game most months for the last two years, and while I’m not sure they’ll keep up that pace to the same degree in 2025, we already know about a fair number of games coming in the next few months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">January 16 marks the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD,</a> a remaster of the 2010 Wii platformer that includes the extra levels from the 2013 3DS port. That’s right, this is the third time Nintendo is selling us Country Returns and it’s now been more than a decade since the last original Donkey Kong Country game with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze">Tropical Freeze’s</a> launch on Wii U. Hopefully Donkey Kong’s recent inclusion in Nintendo’s movies and theme parks will eventually result in a brand new video game, but for now you’re getting Country Returns again, and you <em>better like it. </em>As someone who’s bought and played both previous versions, it really is a fantastic platformer and one worth trying if you’ve never played it before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re getting another HD remaster on March 20, but this one is much more exciting. After years of fan demand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x">Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition</a> is finally landing on Switch, meaning the entire Xenoblade Chronicles series will be available in one place. Xenoblade Chronicles X is the odd one out in the series: It’s not <em>directly </em>tied to the trilogy and it was doomed to originally release on Wii U back in 2015, so this second chance at life will be many players’ first chance to dive into this enormous open world RPG. The visually enhanced Definitive Edition also adds brand new story content longtime fans will surely dissect and theorize about for years to come.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, those are the only firm release dates we have for Nintendo in 2025, but there are a few huge games coming sometime in the coming months. That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, Game Freak’s return to the Legends subseries after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Arceus</a> successfully shook things up back in 2022. We still know very little about what Legends: Z-A will entail, other than it centers around an “urban redevelopment plan” in the Kalos Region’s Lumiose City from Pokémon X &amp; Y, and that Generation VI’s Mega Evolution is set to return in some way. Pokémon took a much needed year off in 2024 so it’s exciting to see what Legends: Z-A will look like after taking a bit more time in the oven.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One big third-party Nintendo Switch exclusive worth shouting out is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and the New World of Steam,</a> which is scheduled for release sometime in 2025. It’s the big return of Professor Layton and his assistant Luke after more than a decade out of the spotlight. I’m hopeful it will actually make it out on time – Level-5 has been a bit too eager to announce release windows before games are actually ready, but whenever this finally comes out it will be an exciting return for a series that’s always been heavily associated with Nintendo.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The final TBA 2025 game on Nintendo’s calendar right now is the long-awaited Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. First announced at E3 2017, Prime 4 was MIA for years <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-gameplay-revealed">before its re-reveal at June’s Nintendo Direct.</a> Prime 4 is coming from Retro Studios, developers of the original Metroid Prime trilogy, and it features the return of Sylux, a villain first introduced in the Nintendo DS spinoff Metroid Prime Hunters. The most recent trailer is absolutely gorgeous and I can’t wait to see how the full adventure shapes up later this year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>We’ll Know More About Switch 2 in Less Than Three Months</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Enough messing around, let’s get into what you’re all here for: the Nintendo Switch successor. Last May, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-it-will-announce-switch-successor-console-within-this-fiscal-year">Nintendo would make an announcement about the Nintendo Switch successor “within this fiscal year.”</a> Nintendo’s fiscal year ends on March 31, meaning that we’re expecting an official unveiling sometime within the next 90 days or so. Other than Nintendo’s recent confirmation that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-officially-be-backward-compatible-with-original-switch-games">Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the Switch 2,</a> the company has been very quiet about what the console will actually be like.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, March might not be the end of the story. It’s possible we will get a quick teaser trailer before the end of this fiscal year, similar to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/first-look-at-nintendos-new-console-nintendo-switch">the Switch’s reveal trailer in October 2016,</a> followed by a full presentation ahead of the official launch. Or Nintendo might tell us everything we want to know right away, which is the best-case scenario. Either way, I’m confident we’ll get a big presentation at some point this year with all the answers we’re looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last time Nintendo held a big in-person event in Japan to properly unveil the Switch, which was broadcast live around the world. I’m expecting a slightly different strategy this time as I think Nintendo will stick to its prerecorded Nintendo Direct-style presentation to show the successor off. But I think the information presented will be largely the same, where Nintendo will likely share information on the following:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Name</li><li>Release Date</li><li>Price</li><li>Launch day/window game lineup</li><li>Specifications</li><li>Unique features</li></ul><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what these console details will actually be, your guess is as good as mine. But I can almost guarantee the Switch successor will launch before the end of 2025 as I don’t see a world where Nintendo announces it as early as March and waits until 2026 to release it. And I’m personally expecting the Switch successor to be very iterative of Nintendo Switch, maintaining the hybrid design that made it such a global success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new console means new games and Nintendo is definitely cooking up a big lineup for the next console’s first year. Not counting projects it was a co-developer on, Nintendo’s internal development teams only put out one game last year: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-side-order-dlc-review">Splatoon 3’s Side Order DLC.</a> It’s clearly been full steam ahead on Switch 2 games for a while and I’m expecting some heavy hitters at launch and in the first year of Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are well overdue for a new 3D Mario because it’s been nearly eight years since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey.</a> That was the last <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury">brand new 3D Mario apart from Bowser’s Fury,</a> which was a bite-sized expansion added onto 3D World’s Switch release in 2021. I’m confident Nintendo is setting up the next 3D Mario to be the Switch successor’s must-have game at launch, to get all of the hardcore Nintendo fans snap up the new console right away. And it just so happens that 2025 is the 40th anniversary of Super Mario Bros., and given how big Nintendo went for the 35th anniversary in 2020, I think it’s a safe bet that Mario will be front and center at the next console launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about Mario Kart? We’re even more overdue for a brand new Mario Kart entry given that it’s been 11 years now since Mario Kart 8’s original release. Yes, we got <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Tour, and the Booster Course Pass</a> in the time since, but it’s still been way too long since a wholly original home console Mario Kart. I go back and forth between thinking 3D Mario or Mario Kart is the big launch game, but either way I think we get both before the console’s first holiday season. Right now, I’m feeling a 3D Mario at launch as the big single-player showcase game, with Mario Kart coming just a bit later to get families interested in picking the console up over the holidays. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As much as everyone loves Mario though, Nintendo will want to diversify its launch lineup beyond its most iconic character. I could see some sort of Zelda remake or remaster in the cards to get that franchise represented as soon as possible on the next hardware, with the two most likely candidates feeling like an Ocarina of Time HD remake or a Breath of the Wild remaster that runs at a solid 60 fps. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I think it’s a safe bet that Mario will be front and center at the next console launch.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also expecting Nintendo to unveil some sort of brand new IP to hit the console at launch or shortly after. The Wii had Wii Sports, Wii U had Nintendoland, and Switch had 1-2-Switch, so there will likely be some sort of casual, family-friendly experience to show off what the new hardware can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also hopeful we might get a glimpse of Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai’s new mystery game at some point in 2025. Sakurai dropped one of the biggest plot twists of 2024 when he revealed that he prepped his entire YouTube channel in advance and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game">has been secretly working on a new video game since early 2022.</a> It’s been in development for three years now so it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a reveal is planned for sometime this year. It’s most likely the next Smash Bros., but I would love to see Sakurai’s take on a more niche Nintendo series like Star Fox or F-Zero. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of F-Zero, I wouldn’t be surprised if Switch 2 is home to a remaster of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> or an entirely new game in the series. Nintendo has been building up hype for the F-Zero series for the last year now, first with the release and continued updates in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/f-zero-99">F-Zero 99,</a> followed by the addition of nearly every game in the series to the Nintendo Switch Online game catalog. I feel like it’s accelerating toward something big for the series and there’s almost no better way to show off new, powerful hardware than a gorgeous, futuristic racing game running at a perfect framerate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Switch 1 Support Will Continue</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes will definitely be on Switch 2 in 2025 but Nintendo will continue to support its 140 million-plus Switch 1 install base with new games. We already discussed the Switch games we know are coming in 2025 but there will certainly be more reveals as the year goes on. I’m expecting Kirby to show up on Switch 1 in some way – it’s been two years since Return to Dreamland Deluxe – either through a remaster of a fan favorite like Kirby Planet Robobot or an entirely new game. I also think it could be time for Nintendo to wheel out some of its smaller series and I’ve got a feeling in my bad knee that Rhythm Heaven could finally make its Switch debut this year in a similar fashion to Rhythm Heaven Megamix showing up on 3DS after the Switch was already out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Could Next Level Games Show Up?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Luigi’s Mansion 3 developers Next Level Games have put out a new game every three years since 2013. The studio’s last full game was Mario Strikers: Battle League in 2022, meaning 2025 is the year for its next project if this development cycle pattern is to continue. It could be time for Luigi’s Mansion 4 on the Switch successor but given how much Mario I already think is in the cards for 2025, I could also see this game getting unveiled at some point for a release sometime in 2026. While I definitely think some studios will continue developing games for the older Switch hardware, I firmly expect to see Next Level Games’ new project on the next console and wouldn’t be shocked if we get a glimpse of it in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Nintendo’s Entertainment Endeavors Continue</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Nintendo is much more than a video game company at this point and it has some solid entertainment plans lined up for 2025. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-nintendo-world-to-open-at-universal-epic-universe-in-2025-with-donkey-kong-country-and-a-mine-cart-ride">Super Nintendo World is set to open in Florida this May</a> and it includes the Donkey Kong Country expansion that’s currently exclusive to Universal Studios Japan. And Nintendo is opening its second stateside retail store when Nintendo San Francisco opens at Union Square sometime this year.  scheduled to hit theaters in April 2026 so I’m guessing we’ll get the first trailer for the sequel sometime before the year is up too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s everything we expect from Nintendo in 2025. Are you ready for the Switch 2 or are you still excited about the Switch 1 games we know about? Let us know in the comments. And for everything else Nintendo, switch with IGN.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
