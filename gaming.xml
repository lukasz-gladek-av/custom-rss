            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350382/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-doom-ninja-gaiden-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though Nintendo can technically claim it had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">the first big gaming news event of the year</a>, at least <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24338314/microsoft-xbox-event-developer-direct-date-2025">Xbox’s Developer Direct</a> actually showed off some games <em>and</em> let us know when we can play them. The showcase was anchored by deep dives into the biggest games coming down the green pipe like <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight</em>, with a couple of surprises to fill out the nearly one-hour-long runtime. Here are the highlights from the show.</p><p><h3><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h3></p><p>Xbox kicked off the Direct with the surprise reveal of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a>. The game is being codeveloped by Koei Tecmo’s Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>studio PlatinumGames. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>revives the series’ bloody, fast-paced combat and high-stakes (but often frustrating) platforming with a new face, the ninja Yakumo. Yakumo will use his unique fighting styles to defeat the Divine Dragon Order that’s turned Tokyo into a dystopian, crumbling mess. <em>Gaiden</em>’s former protagonist, Ryu Hayabusa, will also make an appearance as a playable character and Yakumo’s rival.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> will launch in the fall of this year, but if you don’t want to wait for your bloody ninja action, you don’t have to. Xbox stealth dropped <a href="https://youtu.be/MFjWCZIVZDw?si=Dw16HKjd1MRHKDhp"><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</em></a>, a remake of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em>, and it’s available right now on Xbox and Game Pass.</p><p><h3><em>South of Midnight</em></h3></p><p>The developers at Compulsion Games went into detail about <em>South of Midnight</em>’s gameplay and story. You play as Hazel who must use her powers as a Weaver, fighting monsters and traversing the haunted landscape, to rescue her mother who gets swept away in a hurricane. With this, everything I’ve seen about <em>South of Midnight</em> makes it seem like it’ll be one of my games of the year. It’s got a Black protagonist, features characters and tropes that harken to Southern gothic folklore, and its stop-motion art style makes it immediately stand out. I cannot wait to get my hands on this game when it releases on April 8th.</p><p><h3><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h3></p><p>Sandfall Interactive was founded in Montpellier, France, in 2020 with a team led by former Ubisoft developers. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is the studio’s first game — a turn-based RPG with a compelling narrative hook. The world has been ravaged by a being known as the Paintress. Every year, she writes down a number, and everyone older than that number disappears. Expeditions are sent out to stop the Paintress, and the game will follow Expedition 33 in their attempt to save humanity. In addition to an interesting <em>Persona 5</em>-style take on turn-based combat, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24271773/dream-rpg-voice-cast-rotation"><em>Expedition 33</em> features some serious voice acting talent</a>, starring Charlie Cox, Jennifer English, Ben Starr, and Andy Serkis. Can’t wait to hear them perform when <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> launches on April 24th.</p><p><h3><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h3></p><p>To close out the Direct, Xbox gave us another look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages,</em> the prequel to id Software’s 2016 <em>Doom</em> reboot and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>. It will, of course, feature all the ripping and tearing a <em>Doom </em>enjoyer could want, along with an interesting focus on narrative — something the series isn’t really known for. But I suspect folks are far more interested in piloting a 30-story Doomguy-shaped mech suit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5">when the game releases on May 15th</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the presentation at Xbox Developer Direct, which included <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-gameplay-releases-on-may-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all-new gameplay and a release date</a> for the upcoming first-person shooter, we also have information on the game’s pre-order bonuses. If you’re the type to score your most anticipated titles early, then you’ll be happy to know doing so for Doom: The Dark Ages means getting your hands on the game early, along with in-game items to boost that cool appeal we all love from cosmetics!</p>



<h2 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages-pre-order-bonuses-for-each-edition">Doom: The Dark Ages Pre-Order Bonuses for Each Edition</h2>

<p>If you pre-order a standard edition copy, you’ll receive the <strong>Void Doom Slayer Skin</strong>, shown above, on launch day. It’s a gorgeous skin, but somewhat odd considering this is a first-person shooter. </p>

		<p>Team Ninja didn’t just rock up with one announcement, but two! In addition to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-has-been-revealed-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-ps5-pc-in-fall-2025/">the reveal of Ninja Gaiden 4</a> at the Xbox Developer Direct showcase, they also announced and shadow-launched Ninja Gaiden 2 Black across consoles, PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>This is an Unreal Engine remaster of Ninja Gaiden 2, the 2008 Xbox 360 exclusive.</p>
<p><iframe title="NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black Official Launch Trailer | Developer_Direct 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MFjWCZIVZDw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on the Xbox Wire blog, Fumihiko Yasuda, Head of Team Ninja explained the reason for this remake, “The biggest reason for developing NINJA GAIDEN 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of NINJA GAIDEN 4. We chose NINJA GAIDEN 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like NINJA GAIDEN Black was for the first game.”</p>
<p>We can unpick this a little, given the penchant for re-releasing and enhancing games. While Ninja Gaiden 2 was and remained an Xbox 360 exclusive, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 brought the game to PlayStation 3 in a heavily modified form with new bosses, but also with content removed from the game and enemy counts modified. It’s this game that was featured in Ninja Gaiden Master Collection in 2021. Fans requested the original Ninja Gaiden 2, and so this is Yasuda’s answer.</p>

<p>“This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game,” he says. “We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of <em>NINJA GAIDEN Sigma 2</em> while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p>
<p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, of course, comes out alongside the announcement of Ninja Gaiden 4. This is the first mainline sequel in over a decade, bringing a new protagonist, and seeing Team Ninja join forces with PlatinumGames to deliver the next generation of this ultra-fast future ninja series.</p>

			<p>Prior to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySygveWfuKE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a> that just aired, Bethesda invited Wccftech and other press outlets to check out the DOOM: The Dark Ages presentation included in the broadcast. We also participated in a roundtable Q&amp;A with Executive Producer Marty Stratton and Game Director Hugo Martin.</p>
<p>From the get-go, id Software sounded very confident about their new game, claiming that players would feel like a superweapon in a medieval war against Hellish forces. The prequel is set in a sci-fi/fantasy world, the most expansive they've created to date by far, filled with explorable locations, unlockable weapons, and conquerable foes.</p>
<p>Being a prequel to 2016's DOOM, the developers believe this will be the ideal entry point in the series for newcomers. This is also because of the increased focus on accessibility thanks to the newly added sliders that will let users ramp up or down the difficulty as they see fit. Modifiers shown include damage to the player, demons, enemy aggression and projectile speed, parry window, daze duration, game speed, and resource values.</p>
<p>Hugo Martin said that if 2020's DOOM Eternal felt like being in control of a fighter jet, DOOM: The Dark Ages will make you an iron tank. The objective has been to make a more grounded combat system. The Slayer is still fast, but he's also heavy and strong with his moves, favoring power over the previous game's acrobatics. There's also a bit of a return to form in that the tweaks to movement speed should make strafing to aim once again viable, like in the classic game.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many new cool tools, chiefly the Shield Saw, which can block, throw, parry, and deflect depending on the context. Some melee weapons were also added to compound that medieval feel, so players will have an iron flail, an electrified gauntlet, and a spiked mace to bash enemies with, and they even come with their own combos and upgrades. Needless to say, there's a ton of devastatingly powerful guns, too, since it is still DOOM after all.</p>
<p>Finishing off enemies promises to be even cooler this time around, thanks to a new Glory Kill system that is said to be fully in the player's control.&nbsp;DOOM: The Dark Ages doesn't stop at ground combat, either, as id is giving players two big toys to play with: a 30-story-tall Atlan mech and a mechadragon. Both are reportedly fleshed out, coming with their own abilities and mini-bosses to fight.</p>
<p>However great all that sounds, the developers acknowledged combat might not be enough to win over single-player fans in 2025. Thankfully, the game also features way more exploration than in previous titles, with large, diverse environments and unique rewards for those who will explore them in-depth. While not an open world, it will feature secret caves, dungeon-like mines and more, in what's been called the largest playspace ever in DOOM and a 'sandbox.'</p>
<p>Last but not least, DOOM: The Dark Ages takes the narrative out of the codex, in the developers' own words, and into the cutscenes. The goal is to deliver a Summer Blockbuster-like cinematic action story with a combination of new characters, returning allies, and powerful villains.</p>
<p>We also learned the release date, which is set for May 15 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. As with all games published by Bethesda since they were acquired by Microsoft, it will be available to Game Pass subscribers from day one. Pre-orders are open now.</p>
<p>Following the presentation, Martin and Stratton answered several questions. You can find the transcript below.</p>

<p><strong>DOOM has always been about sci-fi. Why the switch to a medieval setting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:</strong> We wanted to do it from the beginning. When you reboot a franchise, usually what you want to do is create an interesting world and give that world a history. Then, you want to have heroes with an interesting past, and if you're lucky enough and the fans are happy with what you did, you get to do more iterations of the IP, and you'll be fortunate enough to explore some of that past. That's what we've been able to do. This is very much a full realization of the Slayer's past, and we thank the fans for giving us the chance to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Can you dive into the difficulty sliders and why you decided to introduce them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:</strong> Sure. There were multiple reasons. The important thing is that you can go up or down to make the game easier or harder. There are a lot of options, and it also works to improve approachability. It allows long-time fans to ramp it up and create these ridiculous high-end experiences, but it also improves accessibility for others who may have motor difficulties, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Will DOOM: The Dark Ages feature any multiplayer modes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton: </strong>It will not. There's only the campaign, and we decided that from the beginning. We wanted to free ourselves to create experiences like the mech and the dragon. Those are both like their own mini-games in the game. We decided to put all our effort into creating the biggest and best campaign we've ever made.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>We didn't do multiplayer so that we could make a better single player game. Like, we couldn't have done the mech and the dragon and all that other stuff if we spread the resources around different game pillars, so we've really just focused on single player.</p>
<p><strong>How is the game a reaction to DOOM Eternal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>It's a reaction to both (previous games). We are really lucky to be able to do the third entry. Any time you get to make a game three times, there's so many lessons that you've learned. I like to focus on the negatives from fans. With the 2016 game, we heard that it was too repetitive, and with Eternal, that it was too hard. I actually think it was too complex, and the complexity of the control scheme led to unnecessary difficulty. You want to be fighting the demons, not the controls. That doesn't mean it's going to be easy to master. Also, we can't just do the same thing again and again. In a trilogy, you want each game to have its own feel.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned the story being out of the codex in DOOM: The Dark Ages, but is there still a codex?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>Yes, there is. It's just not a requirement anymore to read the codex to understand what's happening in the story.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the return of strafing to aim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>What you quickly realize when you play classic DOOM is that there's a lot of movement required to be successful and dodge these slow-moving projectiles. With those, you create a three-dimensional pattern that the player has to weave through on their way to the demons. We've balanced the weapons to be medium to short range so that you're encouraged to take the fight to the enemies, weave through that maze of projectiles as they're whizzing by just like in classic DOOM, and deliver that killing blow up close with the melee, shield, or gun.</p>

<p><strong>Can you explain how the new Glory Kill system works?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah. It's really fluid. That was one of the big pillars, fluidity, because we wanted you to feel like this weapon of mass destruction. With the synced system, player control was taken away, and it kind of broke the flow. It's fantastic, and it was not an issue in DOOM 2016 or Eternal because you're not really taking out three, four, five, or six enemies at a time. But in this game, you are, so it was really important that you could finish off an enemy, transitioning from melee/shield/gun to execution, and not feel like there is a break in the action where you're losing precious seconds.</p>
<p>By leaning on the physics part of our engine, the incredible animators and programmers team made it work. It feels fantastic. Also, because you can do it from any angle, it always looks different because it uses physics, and it helps address the issue of repetition, which was a challenge with the previous Glory Kill system as you started seeing the same animations again and again.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an enemy like the Marauder to push the player to learn the gameplay loop?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, several. Those are the black belts on the battlefield and we certainly have them. They will test your skill, knowledge, and your ability with the parry system. They're enemies who throw combos of attacks, and you don't have to just parry one melee strike, you have to parry several in a row in order to falter them.</p>
<p><strong>Is this an open-world game, or does it just have open-world elements?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton: </strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</p>
<p><strong>Was Quake 1 an inspiration for the setting?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin: </strong>Not really. The inspiration was more something like Batman: Year One and 300. I'm a pretty big comic book fan. But yeah, there were rumors that it was called DOOM: Year Zero and that was what we called it internally. I still think it was a really cool name, although Dark Ages is pretty cool, too.</p>
<p><strong>WCCFTECH: How much side content is there in DOOM: The Dark Ages, and how long do you expect a regular playthrough to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>It's really long. It's the biggest game we made. Although, to be honest, you don't want any single level to overstay its welcome. But overall, it is massive. And if you're a completionist and want to unlock all secrets, it'll last even longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game get DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It will, yes. As part of the Deluxe Edition, you will get access to the DLC.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I'm most excited about the shield. It's a critical part of the loop, as you saw in the presentation. It does so many things, like blocking, throwing, parrying, and deflecting. I think it's really, really cool, and it looks awesome.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What are you most excited for people to experience in DOOM: The Dark Ages?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>I think how much it's DOOM but different. We've literally been in it for eleven years. We release a game, we start working on the DLC, and then the next game. We never get that gap in time where you stop and think about it. There are a lot of people who may play the game and then move on to other games or consume other media. I'm excited for people to come back for this and for new people to experience it and just see how epic and expansive it is and get their hands on this gameplay loop because it's so DOOM, but it's different.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>For me, it's the shield. It's a critical part of the loop, as you saw in the presentation. It does so many things. I think it's really, really cool, and it looks awesome.</p>
<p><strong>With DOOM: The Dark Ages being the third game you've worked on, are you considering it the conclusion of a trilogy or more its own thing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>I don't think I can answer that. We're not supposed to talk about it. Anyway, I like making DOOM games. I wouldn't have a problem doing this for a long time. But this isn't designed to be the end of something.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>We'll also remind you that DOOM: The Dark Ages will be powered by the latest version of the id Tech engine.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You thought <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" rel="nofollow">Doom Eternal</a> </em>was badass? You ain't seen nothin' yet. What <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/id-software" rel="nofollow">id Software</a> has in store for players with <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>is going to redefine the meaning of rip and tear, with more visceral action than ever before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So then, it's no secret this is one of 2025's most anticipated games, and we even got an early look at some gameplay for what Executive Producer Marty Stratton calls the biggest <em>Doom </em>game "by a lot."</p>

<p>After watching a deep dive into the game's mechanics, TechRaptor and other press attended a roundtable Q&amp;A session with Stratton along with Game Director Hugo Martin. We learned more about how <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is hearkening back to the roots of the franchise, as well as what players can expect in terms of weapons, difficulty, and more.</p>



<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>Is&nbsp;a Grand Adventure</h2>

<p>I don't like drawing comparisons to other games unless it's warranted, but the gameplay of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> reminded me most of, well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-review-dynamite" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom (2016)</em></a> and <em>Eternal,</em> of course, but surprisingly, I saw a bit of <em>God of War </em>DNA in there as well.</p>

<p>By <em>God of War</em>, I'm talking about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">2018</a>&nbsp;entry and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow"><em>Ragnarok</em></a>. <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is explicitly said to <em>not</em> be open world, but it does have large, open areas players can explore. Within these areas are "multiple objectives you can complete in any order," said Stratton.</p>

<p>"It is our most expansive worlds that we've ever built," said Stratton. "Kind of goes from, you know, typical, what I would say is normal, linear <em>Doom</em>, to these larger sandboxes we call them, where just, you know, the exploration really kind of opens up."</p>



<p>So basically, while you're ripping and tearing through demons, you can find secrets like collectibles, but also progression items. And progression seems to be the focus here, when it comes to exploration -- that is the main incentive for scoping out these vast open spaces while working your way to the next objective.</p>

<p>"There's secrets everywhere," said Martin, "and as Marty said, the secrets are really tied to the player's progression. So there's a great motivation there."</p>

<p>One aspect the <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> gameplay showcase wanted to emphasize is, in <em>Doom (2016) </em>players were asked to "run and gun," in <em>Eternal</em> to "jump and shoot." This time around, we're asked to "stand and fight."</p>



<p>This "stand and fight philosophy" manifests itself in multiple ways. Enemy projectiles behave more like that of older <em>Doom</em> games from the '90s, meaning you'll be moving around while shooting and slashing away. While there's less verticality in <em>The Dark Ages</em> than there is in&nbsp;<em>Eternal</em>, Martin says the aim is to have each game feel a bit different.</p>

<p>"The board, I would say, is flatter," said Martin, "to create more space for that strafe-to-aim combat loop that we see in classic <em>Doom.</em></p>

<p>"We've balanced the the range of the weapons to be medium-to-short range," Martin added, "so that way, you're encouraged to take the fight to the enemies, move through that maze of projectiles just like in classic <em>Doom </em>as they're whizzing by, and delivering that killing blow with melee, shield, and guns."</p>



<h2>Rip and Tear? No, Hack and Slash!</h2>

<p>That brings us to combat, which is the cream of the crop when it comes to <em>Doom </em>games. We know they're taking a heavier emphasis on standing your ground and really leveraging the Doom Slayer's agile nature to skirt around projectiles and move in to deliver the finishing blow.</p>

<p>To do so, you're armed with an arsenal of new weapons like the Skull Crusher -- a lethal gun that shreds skulls and spits out fragments as projectiles -- but there are also three separate melee weapons, as well as an improved and more fluid Glory Kill system.</p>

<p>Martin compares combat to that one shot from the film <em>300</em>, and this comparison was a driving force behind how the team wanted combat to feel in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>:</p>



<p>"It's a panning shot they're tracking with, Leonidas, as he takes out of, you know, breaks from the phalanx and takes out a bunch of guys... first with a spear, then with a Spartan sword and shield, and the time dilates in and out. And that's, when you see the extended gameplay footage inside of dev direct, I mean, that was a big focus for us."</p>

<p>Melee weapons include your trusty ol' gauntlet, as well as a ball-and-chain-like weapon. Combine that with the shield saw, which you can throw to tear up enemies and even use as a makeshift grapple point, and let's just say the gameplay looks as exciting as ever.</p>

<p>Of course, Glory Kills are iconic to <em>Doom</em>, and we'll be seeing great improvements to this system in <em>The Dark Ages</em>. Glory Kills were already lauded as a fantastic mechanic in the previous titles, but id Software wanted to take it a step further and introduce even more fluidity to this system, so combat goes uninterrupted.</p>



<p>"There's no control taken away so you could stagger -- and this happens a lot, it was in the dev direct -- where there's like 4, 5, 6 enemies that are highlighted, ready to be taken out, and you could just take them out in one run," said Martin.</p>

<p>"When you play it, that fluidity, it plays into everything you're doing," added Stratton, "whether it's your weapons or the way you shield bash. We haven't even talked about it, like, you see it in there, but the shield has a capability to move you very fast through the world, where you kind of lock onto an enemy, and then you lock on with the left trigger, and then you hit the right trigger, and it pulls you through the world long distances... and you smash into the character."</p>



<h2>A Positive Note on Challenge and Accessibility in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2>

<p>Just a hunch, and I could be wrong, but one aspect players might overlook is the way <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> handles difficulty. You have your standard, pre-made difficulty modes, but then there are also sliders allowing players to adjust multiple facets of the gameplay.</p>

<p>These sliders include, but are not limited to: Damage to player; Damage to demons; Enemy projectile speed; Parry window timing; overall game speed and more. This acts as both a wonderful accessibility feature, but also a way to amp the challenge up to ridiculous heights.</p>

<p>"And then even on the accessibility front," said Stratton, "it really does make the game more accessible for somebody who maybe has motor difficulties, you know, wants to dial in the experience just for them. We've actually done a good bit of testing from that front and really gotten great response from from the accessibility side of things too."</p>



<h2>Quick and Noteworthy Info for <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2>

<p>There's so much more we could touch on, but the points that stood out to me most were ones I wanted to highlight above. Though, I do want to mention a few additional notes that may be important for players to know.</p>

<p>One, multiplayer is not in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. This was in order to focus all resources on the ambitious campaign id Software made for<em> </em>this game. Second, there are full-on large areas where you can take control of the dragon and mech. They made sure to emphasize these are not one-time gimmicks, but will be present throughout the campaign. Lastly, the OST is composed by Finishing Move, a renowned team of four known for working on video game soundtracks.</p>

<p>The rest, well, we'll have to see. It won't be long until <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>launches, and I am unreasonably excited. Bridging the gap between old-school and modern FPS gameplay is a recipe for success, and I believe <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>will achieve just that when it launches on May 15, 2025.</p>

<p>This one's all about the perils of water. Ah, water. The old oxo-hydro cocktail. True blue. Pre-caffeinated coffee. I've never really trusted the stuff, and only ever drink it in moderation. The game takes place on Saiadha, an ocean world that appears to intensify the first game's season mechanic, whereby you'd have to deal with inclement weather and cuts to movement and production during winter. Now, you've got to worry about changing ocean levels. Do I detect a climate change fable? Possibly, but it's buried under several layers of fantasy world-building.</p><p>"As the water goes down, the environment itself becomes both an obstacle and a chance for discovery," explains the press release. "Players will have to adapt to these constant shifts, confront ancient threats, and uncover the secrets buried deep within Saiadha. Each cataclysm brings new dangers, but also unique opportunities."</p>
<p>All-new "tidefalls" aside, the game appears familiar. This is a highly asymmetrical hex-based 4X buttressed by generous faction writing and diverse architecture design, with upgradeable heroes who sometimes make the whole thing feel like a turn-based RPG.</p>

<p>"Players need to lead their hero on epic journeys to conquer new territories, earn valuable experience, and build deep relationships with allies and rivals alike," the release goes on. "Select from a variety of factions, each with their own distinct philosophies, strengths, and playstyles, offering a unique gameplay experience. The diversity of these factions is reflected in their asymmetric gameplay, ensuring that no two paths are the same."</p><p>Endless Legend 2 will release pretty soon - it launches into PC early access in early 2025, with four factions arriving initially and two more coming in the full release. That's two less than the original Endless Legend had when it left early access, but I shan't gripe as long as the second game's factions are approximately 1.34 times as intriguing. Going by the trailer, there are a few returning faces.</p>
<p>If you'd rather play it sooner, Amplitude are reopening their Insiders Program on 30th January to let a select group of players test the thing. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3407390/ENDLESS_Legend_2/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We knew a few games that would be featured, including <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>South of Midnight</em>, but Microsoft had also teased a surprise announcement from a mystery studio, and the presentation started by reminding viewers that each game shown will be available on Game Pass at launch. If you want to watch the show yourself you can do so below, but for those who just want the bullet points, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Kicking off the show was the surprise game: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames are working on a new <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>game in the style of the series’ 3D reboot trilogy that ran from 2004 to 2012. It  will feature two playable characters in returning protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and a new character named Yakumo who is following in Ryu’s footsteps to become a master ninja. Platinum seems like a perfect choice for reviving the series, which is known for stylish, fast-paced combat and its punishing difficulty. It will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall.</p></div><div><p>After the <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>showcase, Team Ninja also announced it’s bringing a revamped version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to modern platforms today in the form of <em>Ninja Gaiden II Black</em>. It’s available on PC and Xbox Game Pass, so if you’re a subscriber you can grab it as part of your membership.</p></div><div><p>Next up was Compulsion Games showing off its dark fantasy adventure <em>South of Midnight</em>. The studio showed a bit of protagonist Hazel’s nature-based magic and how she utilizes it when fighting monsters that are inspired by Southern folklore and the game’s “Southern gothic” aesthetic. It’s giving PS2-era action game and I’m here for it. <em>South of Midnight </em>is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on April 8.</p></div><div><p>To give us a quick break between all the action-oriented games, Sandfall Interactive showed off <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. As the name implies, the turn-based RPG follows an expedition of people in a French-based fantasy world that is ruled over by a malevolent goddess who is able to kill people over a certain age. <em>Expedition 33 </em>marries real-time and turn-based combat, though it seems this will be highly customizable and those who prefer to keep the real-time elements to a minimum can do so. The game will launch on April 24 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was an extended look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. The game is a prequel to the 2016 <em>Doom</em> and takes place in a hellscape that feels both futuristic and Middle Ages, a fusion that’s also reflected in the game’s  medieval-style weapons and mayhem. The shield saw, which basically functions like a Captain America shield with a buzzsaw attachment, was the star of the show, and you can use it to deflect attacks or throw it at enemies and watch it slice into them as you close in with your shotgun. Developer id Software also showed off giant mech and dragon combat, and I have to hand it to the <em>Doom </em>series, it knows how to capture “middle-school binder” excess and make it work. The game will launch on PC, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Large open levels, described by Id as “<em>Doom </em>sandboxes,” will include platforms and puzzles, and if you complete these challenges you’ll unlock upgrades to make the Doom Slayer a stronger murder machine. (Okay, I guess it does all come back to killing.) </p><p><em>Dark Ages</em> also features a bunch of difficulty sliders that will let you change how fast and hard the game is, making it easy for everyone to hop in and kill demons. </p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For more, here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-2025-everything-announced">everything announced during Microsoft's Xbox Developer Direct 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb on Ninja Gaiden 2 Black:</p><blockquote>In Ninja Gaiden 2 Black, players assume the role of Ryu Hayabusa, a deadly ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword while embarking on a global battle against a series of formidable foes. The beautiful and bloody remaster utilizes Unreal Engine 5 to significantly enhance the graphic expression, elevating everything from character visuals to environmental backgrounds. In fact, the stages, characters, effects, and lighting have all been completely redesigned and remastered to fully immerse gamers into the story’s dark ninja world.</blockquote><blockquote>Gore elements such as dismemberment and blood have also been remastered to enhance the action experience. The high-speed, violent fights play out in brilliant brutality, utilizing a variety of weapons and techniques including Japanese swords, shurikens, Kusari-gamas, and tonfas. Meanwhile, those looking for a more toned-down experience can simply toggle the dismemberment feature on and off in the Options menu.</blockquote><blockquote>In addition, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black includes extra elements from the spin-off titles released after the original game’s debut, including the ability to control three additional characters: Momiji, Ayane, and Rachel. The remaster also includes “HERO PLAY STYLE”, a mode for beginners that provides automatic support in the most difficult situations, making the notoriously challenging title more accessible for those who may not be so confident in their action skills.</blockquote><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/ninja-gaiden-4-developer-direct-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Team Ninja boss Fumihiko Yasuda explained the decision to remaster Ninja Gaiden 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This simultaneous announcement and same-day release alongside Ninja Gaiden 4 might have caught some people by surprise,” he said. “The biggest reason for developing Ninja Gaiden 2 Black was to address the concerns of core fans who might be wondering, ‘What’s going to happen to Ryu Hayabusa?’ We also wanted to give players something to enjoy as they wait for the release of Ninja Gaiden 4. We chose Ninja Gaiden 2 because it stands as one of the most solid action games in the series. We added ‘Black’ to the title to signal to fans that this is the definitive version, much like Ninja Gaiden Black was for the first game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuda continued: "This version is crafted to satisfy both those who played the original and newcomers discovering it as a current-generation action game. We’ve meticulously incorporated some of the additions of Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 while staying true to the challenge and feel of the original 360 version, including its signature gore and violence. We’ve also adjusted the weapon upgrade system to more align with the original release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Ninja’s infamously challenging Ninja Gaiden series has a long association with Xbox. The developer’s reboot of the action series launched first on Xbox in 2004, propelling master ninja Ryu Hayabusa into the mainstream. Ninja Gaiden Black, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-ninja-gaiden-black-is-the-best-pure-action-game-of-all-time">considered one of the greatest action games of all time</a>, launched the following year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ninja Gaiden 2 came out in 2008 published by Microsoft Game Studios for the Xbox 360. Ninja Gaiden 3 followed in 2012 on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Since then, fans have had the critically panned spin-off Yaiba: Ninja Gaiden Z, and, more recently, Ninja Gaiden: Master Collection, a compilation of Ninja Gaiden Sigma, Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2, and Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor's Edge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Koei Tecmo revived interest in Ninja Gaiden with the announcement of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-ragebound">Ninja Gaiden Ragebound</a>, a brand-new side-scrolling spin-off due out later this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-epic-can-afford-to-keep-spending-billions-fighting-apple-and-google-for-the-future-of-fortnite-on-mobile-for-decades-to-come<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic boss Tim Sweeney has spent quite a lot of money fighting Apple and Google over the way they run their app stores. How much? Billions of dollars. That, you’d think, would be unsustainable for most companies. But for Sweeney it’s an investment — a long term investment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sweeney’s ongoing battle to get Fortnite back on iPhones and Android phones while avoiding paying store fees is well-documented. The gist is this: Epic doesn’t want to pay the now standard 30% store fees on revenue made on mobile games. Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS. In the U.S., nearly five years later, it is yet to return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After multiple costly legal battles Epic is making some progress, mostly in Europe due to the Digital Markets Act, but hardly in the U.S., where there isn’t even a whiff of a legislation that would support Epic’s cause. In August last year, the Epic Games Store launched on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys for mobile. But actually getting the likes of Fortnite up and running on mobile is a nightmare, with various “scare screens” putting up to 50% of users off, according to Epic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/gettyimages-1236597372-1-1737627928821.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Epic's Tim Sweeney is determined to defeat Apple and Google, however long it takes. Photo by SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Epic is taking the next step and launching third-party games on the Epic Games Store on mobile with the same 88/12 revenue share for payments it processes and 0% on third-party payments. Nearly 20 third-party games are now available on the Epic Games Store on mobile (19 new games on Android globally and 16 new games on iOS in the European Union). As part of a new free games program, Bloons TD 6 and Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee are free to download until February 20. To start, there will be new games offered each month until Epic moves to a weekly schedule later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this third-party mobile game push comes with a heavy financial cost. To encourage developers to release their games on the Epic Games Store, Epic is footing the bill for Apple’s controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF). The CTF, which Epic calls “illegal,” would otherwise make releasing video games on the Epic Games Store on iOS financially unviable, Epic said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Epic has found none of the top 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers are willing to make the jump to the Epic Games Store because of the CTF and Apple and Google’s "onerous restrictions and scare screens." Epic says it can’t pay the CTF for developers in the long term, but it’s willing to do so while the European Commission investigates what it calls Apple’s “non-compliance” with the law.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to outlets including IGN ahead of today’s announcement, Sweeney said Epic had invested over $1 billion in the Epic Games Store so far. Sweeney also said Epic has been spending more money than it’s making every year “because we choose to reinvest in growth.” And it’s pumping “the greater part” of $1 billion a year trying to expand its business into mobile — including its fight with Apple and Google.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the spending, Epic has suffered significant layoffs. In September 2023, the North Carolina studio saw 830 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs. In October last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-laying-off-830-employees-tim-sweeney-says-fortnite-maker-epic-is-now-financially-sound">Sweeney insisted the company was now “financially sound,”</a> with Fortnite and the Epic Games Store both hitting new records in “concurrency and success.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/unnamed-9-1737628997875.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">It's been nearly five years since Fortnite was blocked on iPhones in the U.S.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What is the endgame here? How long can Epic keep this huge spending up? Fortnite with its high-profile events and premium skins continues to bring in billions of dollars, and Epic of course has its lucrative Unreal Engine business fueling the video game industry. But for how much longer can Epic justify burning through billions in this seemingly endless fight?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN put that to Tim Sweeney, and here’s what he had to say in response:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think we might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this. But we're determined to fight this out. I expect large parts of this struggle will go on throughout the rest of this decade and we're fully committed to going through it and investing to break through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're seeing this as an investment in Epic's future, both our future directly as a game developer ourselves, we see a much greater opportunity for Fortnite as a business if the market is open and competition is allowed on iOS, on an Android, and these big tech companies and their junk fees aren't crushing market entrances.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we also see opportunity for all developers. And because we have businesses serving all developers, the Unreal Engine and the Epic Games Store, our online services, we see an opening up of the market as offering a real breakout opportunity for Epic as a game company and an ecosystem company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if you look at Epic’s history, we've always aimed big and we've always grown prudently. Our first big 3D game in the era of Doom and Quake was the first Unreal game in 1998. And that sold two million copies. It was pretty cool! And we made Gears of War and expanded to console, and that sold six million copies. And we decided to become an online game developer, and it took years to figure out how to do that, with years without growth. But we figured it out eventually with Fortnite in 2017 and now we're a company with billions of dollars of revenue a year and thousands of employees and an opportunity of the sort that we've never had before. And I do not see this as last phase of Epic's growth and opportunity, if we're successful in what we're trying to do and building online gaming into a much bigger, more social and connected world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some people call it the Metaverse and some people call it just games, but it is real. And you find hundreds of millions of players who are highly engaged in immersive 3D games together with their friends. And we think that if we are successful with this, then someday there will be billions of users of this kind of game. And we think we're in an awesome position to be a leading company or perhaps the leading company in that world if the shackles are removed that prevent us and all developers from actually competing on our own and becoming first class companies in the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And if you back up and you look at the big tech landscape, not a single trillion dollar company anywhere in the world is a vassal in another company's ecosystem. You're either a company that has a direct relationship with customers and freedom to do business with them directly, or you're behind Apple and Google's paywall and you do not have that chance and you cannot grow and most of the profit your business produces will go to Apple and Google who will use it for fuck all… share buybacks and dividends rather than investment in hiring and innovating and building technology and making the world a better place.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Sweeney is essentially saying here is that Epic will keep fighting Apple and Google for decades to come if it has to, continuing to spend billions because it believes that if it wins, it will make many billions more in the long term. There is a huge amount of money at stake here, and Sweeney sounds determined to see it through. IGN has asked Apple for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/23/unnamed-12-1737629038010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Even where it's available, the Epic Games Store is a nightmare to download on mobile. Epic calls these "scare screens."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s not just about how much money Epic has already spent, it’s about how much money it might have made had it bowed to Apple’s store fees, coughed up that 30%, and had Fortnite on iOS for the last five years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN asked Sweeney if Epic had calculated this missed opportunity, and here’s what he had to say:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, this is something we think about a lot and it's always hard to predict because there's just a direct number of users, percentage of users we had on iOS before and that could have continued, but we could have also potentially driven significant new forms of growth on mobile as new opportunities opened up in new markets where they were more mobile than PC and console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The fight against Apple and Google has certainly denied us a billion dollars of revenue, perhaps several billion, and we certainly could have been a higher revenue vassal to Cupertino had we stayed on the App Store and paid Apple's junk fees forever. But I felt very firmly that the proper way to challenge them was to demonstrate to the world the real effects of their policies because Apple... Apple does a good job of hiding it. They don't let developers tell users that they're paying 30% of their fee for nothing or their purchase price is going to Apple for nothing, and it's not widely known.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And so this was largely a supply side dispute between developers and the platform ecosystems. The moment Apple blocked Fortnite, it became about access and about denial of access to markets and about monopoly abuse to further the company's economic objectives. And the moment Apple banned Fortnite, the conversation in the world changed and everybody realized that these companies aren't just some part of the supply chain that takes a cut. They are the sole viable distribution vehicle for platforms reaching billions of users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And around that time regulatory activity perked up and became serious and has come into force through a number of laws that have really begun to shake up the market. We view our company's aims on the scale of decades. We've been in business for 33 years now, which is a pretty long time for a tech company, especially a game developer. There were a lot of game developers in 1991, not many of them are around now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But we think our best days are ahead and we think our best days can only be achieved when we have true freedom and we believe the best way to get to that freedom is to go all in and fighting for access rather than arguing about money as Apple is trying to encourage all other developers to do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And so I have no regrets and I think that in the long run, we'll look back at the event in August 13th, 2020 when we opened up Fortnite and supported direct payment and gave customers savings by purchasing directly and avoiding Apple junk fees, that whole series of events I think will be the thing that instigated the change that is absolutely necessary for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Do you want your kids to grow up in a market where Apple and Google extract all the profit from all digital businesses and control access to all the information? It's not a good world, just like FYI. So no regrets, though it’s been terribly costly. We're really looking at our future opportunity and future value rather than the opportunity that we missed by fighting Apple and Google this way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is this: Epic is working with regulators in the European Union to stop Apple and Google from allegedly breaking the law (it wants both to comply with the Digital Markets Act and enable proper access to the Epic Games Store and its games), and it plans to bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK and Japan at the end of this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about the U.S.? When will Fortnite finally return to iPhone in the country? “Once policymakers and courts in other countries like Brazil, Australia, Korea and the United States make it possible, we’ll bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in those countries too,” Epic said. “We will keep fighting to break down barriers not just for the Epic Games Store, but for everyone.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Arda Kucukkaya/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, Assassin's Creed Shadows has been a long time coming. The setting of feudal era Japan has been one of the dream locales that fans and even Ubisoft developers have had for the franchise's jaunt through humanity's secret history, and it's finally serving as the backdrop for the next entry. But Shadows has also been a game that has seen some notable delays to ensure the developers stick the landing. Simply put, there's a lot of anticipation for what's in store for Ubisoft's big return to a massive Assassin's Creed RPG.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After spending several hours playing Assassin's Creed Shadows, the next entry keeps up with the satisfying action and traversal that the series is known for, but it also showcases a sharper eye for worldbuilding, and giving its two protagonists their time in the spotlight. From my time sneaking through fortresses, taking in the sweeping vistas of the open world, and pulling off slick combat finishers, I got to see just how developer Ubisoft Quebec has improved its balancing act of satisfying action, RPG systems, and rewarding open-ended exploration in a captivating new setting that's been long overdue.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Exclusive Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since Assassin's Creed Origins in 2017, the series has stayed comfortably within the realm of the open-world RPG, offering an expanded scope and narrative decisions to alter the course of the story. While this shift led to some growing pains for the series, it has gotten a better handle on the additional layers to gameplay without compromising the fantasy of being an ancient assassin. With Shadows, the latest attempt at an Assassin's Creed RPG shows that developer Ubisoft may have also cracked the code on the role-playing element with its two unique protagonists, something the series has struggled to present in a way that hasn't muddied the narrative waters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ubisoft may have also cracked the code on the role-playing element with its two unique protagonists, something the series has struggled to present in a way that hasn't muddied the narrative waters.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with creative director Jonathan Dumont, he stated that Assassin's Creed Shadows has an underlying theme about unity. Given the backdrop of Feudal Japan and its period of unification, the game focuses heavily on the bond between the two leads and their growth throughout the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For me, this game has a message about unity, and fighting for those who cannot, which is a responsibility that both of the characters have in the game," he said. "I think that it's about finding your place in that world, and I think both characters represent that and the importance of community and the importance of taking care of each other and going on this journey together through Japan in this period of unrest."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest game puts its sights on a new mystery deep within a revamped Animus program. In this new simulation, we focus on feudal era Japan and the secret history of both Yasuke, a historical African slave who became a full-fledged Samurai, and Naoe, a female Shinobi taking up the mantle of her father's legacy. The pair eventually team up to navigate a radically changing 1500s Japan, rubbing shoulders with other historical allies such as Oda Nobunaga and Kuroda Kanbei while taking down a shadowy cabal of warlords manipulating the country's attempt at unification from within.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent most of my playtime exploring Harima Province, one of the early zones that featured a questline involving an insidious plot to undermine the region's power structure. The world of Assassin's Creed Shadows is massive, but thankfully not to the ridiculous size of Valhalla. That said, plenty of opportunities were packed in this province, and the viewpoints to observe nearby points of interest helped point me in the right direction. A general theme I found compelling was how Shadows emphasized harmonizing with the open world – a cultural element the developers wanted to highlight with the Japanese setting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This theme also extends to the side activities and how the world changes over time with shifting seasons that alter the terrain. Shadows ditches the need for hunting, and instead, you can find and draw rare wildlife found in the wild. It was an odd activity at first, but I found them endearing and a surprisingly wholesome change of pace. I soon found myself being taken in by how atmospheric and thoughtful the setting was. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows also emphasizes the dynamic between the two protagonists and their agency within the world after bonding over being outcasts within the country. I really enjoyed their dynamic within the story, and they play well with each other during cutscenes. Yasuke is a gentle giant and wise Samurai enforcer who offers some poignant insights while learning about Japanese culture. Naoe's growth into an assassin with a heavy legacy to uphold shows an early look at the dramatic highs of the main story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You're free to switch off characters in the open world and during moments in the main story, letting you play as who you want in most key missions. But in an interesting addition, you also have the option of playing in Canon Mode, which presents a defined story without major narrative choices – which was added after developers saw how many fans were debating what the definitive story was for Valhalla and Odyssey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuke and Naoe also represent the different extremes of Assassin's Creed's combat and stealth experiences, which have also seen clear upgrades across the board in Shadows. For combat, there's a heightened need for dodging and parrying strikes, crucial to piercing through armor to deliver a killing blow. It injects Ghost of Tsushima's offense and defensive style of swordplay, but it also has familiar AC combat skills such as power grabs and the always funny kick move I used plenty of times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The setting of Japan was a setting that the developers have wanted to make for some time, and according to game director Charles Benoit, they also saw an opportunity to have the series lean further into its stealth-action roots.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It also has familiar AC combat skills such as power grabs and the always funny kick move I used plenty of times.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the brand in general, we had a lot of stealth focus in the first few games, and then with the RPG, we saw a rise more of a rise with combat in Origins, so I feel Shadows is mixing the whole era of Assassin's Creed and bringing about a return to stealth as a focus," he said. "But combat is still very much a core pillar for us, which is why we wanted two characters. With the Japan setting, we have the archetypes of the Samurai and Ninja, and that gives a great opportunity to develop both equally."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I generally felt pleased with the more thoughtful approach to combat. However, it also comes with more challenges, which unexpectedly made some of the encounters in the game feel a bit more difficult. The game also struggled to present fights with multiple foes accurately, and it can be easy to get overwhelmed by enemies coming in off-screen. Still, when the new combat in Shadows hits, it certainly does hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What impressed me most with Shadows was the revamped stealth gameplay, which appropriately incorporates elements from Ubisoft's other stealth-action series, Splinter Cell. With the new visibility meter, you can see how open you are. Furthermore, there's a greater emphasis on light and darkness; you can even snuff out candles to add some cover. My favorite addition is the ability to go prone, which, as you can expect, is a game-changer for stealth. Playing stealth with Naoe was so satisfying, and it does well to showcase just how much that gameplay style has improved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While both characters can combat and stealth, they also have clear limitations. For instance, Yasuke is a formidable fighter and is capable of ambushing enemies, however his large stature is not ideal for advanced stealth. In addition to being incapable of climbing certain areas, he's also not so great at performing the leap of faith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Naoe, she's a skilled assassin with access to a grappling hook and smoke bombs. However, Naoe's nimble combat style is far more reliant on parrying and dodging, and one hit from an elite enemy's heavy strike can take a chunk of her health bar. While pulling off Naoe's combat skills was satisfying, I often had to resist the urge to take out every enemy and run for it when things got out of hand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing with Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you can manage and upgrade a base of operations. As you recruit allies, they'll head to your hideout to open up shops and offer new side missions that incentivize revisits to previous zones. But Shadows takes this feature a step further by allowing you to build out your custom village in the vein of Animal Crossing. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The town builder mode offers plenty of options to add necessities and some personal touches to the hideout. I spent an unexpected amount of time building more housing and decorating my space with Shinto shrines and pets – such as cats and tanuki. There are also side activities, such as a visually striking meditation mini-game, to help you earn additional perks. It's an unexpectedly cozy side activity for an AC game, and I was quickly taken in by how satisfying it was to walk around a massive village I had made in a reasonably short time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, Assassin's Creed Shadows is shaping to be a solid follow-up to Ubisoft's ambitious Valhalla. Even if the familiar crop of open-world bugs and quirks popped up during my time, I still found a great deal to appreciate with Shadows and its worldbuilding. While this conceit is not an uncommon backup for video games – which can be easy to mess up with insensitive representation – Assassin's Creed Shadows so far does well to justify its take on an open-world RPG set during this culturally rich era, especially in its handling of the two protagonists. With the release coming soon, I'm eager to see how Ubisoft's take on Assassin's Creed's journey to Japan will come together.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

So why did Ubisoft push the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the game director: roofs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At a recent preview event for Shadows, we spoke with game director Charles Benoit, who confirmed that the month delay was "mostly about polishing" and did not change any big systems. The team did update "a couple of things in progression to make it more engaging, also balancing a bit more." But the main feature that needed extra tweaking was the parkour system, which Benoit says was running up against an obstacle unique to Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Japanese architecture, the roofs [are] super complex," he said. "Probably the most complex thing that I ever worked with if we compared to Odyssey and Syndicate. We needed specific codes and specific animations to support something super fluid, changing the transition of the parkour to make it even more fluid. So that's one of the specific feedback that we heard that we wanted to address, and it really improved since the last few months."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Assassin's Creed: Animus Hub Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassin's Creed Shadow was originally planned for release in November 2024, but was pushed to February 2025 and then again to March, with the company citing player feedback as a main reason for the delay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-the-final-preview">our recent preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.

The lengthy look at the upcoming prequel to Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal also showed much more detail about the weaponry, mission structure, and the story.</p><p dir="ltr">Calling this entry a "return to form," Bethesda said that it aimed to shift the feeling of Doom again. Whereas Doom Eternal wanted to make you fight like a fighter jet, Dark Ages makes you an iron tank who can stand your ground. That's thanks largely to the versatility of the new Shield Saw. This piece of equipment lets you block, parry, and attack, with each function complementing your array of firearms. And, Bethesda noted, this means strafing is a viable strategy again. There's also a revised Glory Kill that's more contextual and varied based on your weapons and the angle you're facing the enemy demons.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you'll be spending most of your time killing demons on foot as the Slayer, you'll also pilot both a giant mech and a cybernetic dragon. The studio noted that each has its own suite of abilities and minibosses to fight. In a deep dive into a mission, we saw the Slayer confronting a large battle taking place outside a medieval castle, with an open sandbox to discover secrets and resources. After breaking through the enemy lines, you can go back to the main castle gates to trigger what appears to be a giant boss battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432603-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432603" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432603-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432603"></a><figcaption>Doom: The Dark Ages</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432603-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432596-doomthedarkages_01_battle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432598-doomthedarkages_02_siege.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432599-doomthedarkages_03_harborofsouls.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432600-doomthedarkages_04_fortress.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432601-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432602-doomthedarkages_06_slayer.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432596,1300-4432598,1300-4432599,1300-4432600,1300-4432601,1300-4432602" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432596-doomthedarkages_01_battle.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432598-doomthedarkages_02_siege.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432599-doomthedarkages_03_harborofsouls.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432600-doomthedarkages_04_fortress.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432601-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1585/15855271/4432602-doomthedarkages_06_slayer.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432596-doomthedarkages_01_battle.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432598-doomthedarkages_02_siege.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432599-doomthedarkages_03_harborofsouls.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432600-doomthedarkages_04_fortress.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432601-doomthedarkages_05_ahzrak.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4432602-doomthedarkages_06_slayer.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Story is said to be more front and center in this Doom game, with loads of cutscenes building the story of the Slayer--a living weapon who has been captured by the forces of hell--and his confrontation with the game's antagonist. That means you won't have to read through the codex to understand the game's lore. In a Q&amp;A, Bethesda's Marty Stratton said the story was inspired by Batman: Year One. To that end this is also a campaign-only game, the studio confirmed, without a multiplayer mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The soundtrack will be composed by Finishing Move. Both Doom and Doom Eternal were composed by Mick Gordon, but after a <a href="https://x.com/Mick_Gordon/status/1590343092598878210?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">public falling out</a> it seemed unlikely he would return for this next installment.</p><p dir="ltr">The studio also suggested this will be more approachable than previous Doom entries, with a wide array of difficulty sliders that let you customize different aspects of the combat to your liking. But those sliders go both ways, so if you want to dial up the difficulty, you can always make the action even faster and more brutal. Slider options included a regular difficulty level option, along with finer controls: damage to player, damage to demons, enemy projectile speed, enemy aggression, parry window, daze duration, game speed, and resource values.</p><p dir="ltr">Just after the stream, pre-orders went live, including a collector's bundle for $200. That includes a steelbook with key card replica, 12" Doom Slayer statue, campaign DLC, Divinity skin pack, digital soundtrack and art book, and 2-days early access.</p><hr>

The game follows the character Hazel, who, along with her mother, are preparing for a huge hurricane.</p><p>Here is the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/23/south-of-midnight-developer-direct-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">plot synopsis</a>:</p><p>"The storm proves massive, causing catastrophic flooding-and causing their own home to be swept down river with her mother in it. Its aftermath shows the fictional town of Prospero, located in the southern United States, eerily calm while irrevocably changed from the hurricane’s destruction. Here, Hazel undertakes a journey in search of her mother, while finding out more about herself and her family’s lineage in the process."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4UHyaaWXuw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J4UHyaaWXuw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players will come across the massive talking creature, Catfish, who becomes stuck in a tree after the hurricane. The Catfish tells Hazel that she is a magical being known as a Weaver. Hazel has special powers, including the ability to "conjure" past versions of objects to use them to solve puzzles. Players will also meet the character Two-Toed Tom, who is a blind albino alligator the size of an island.</p><p>"Push, Pull, and Weave are some of the spells at your disposal that give you a tactical advantage during a fight. Timing is everything. Pull distant enemies close to start melee combos, push them back to interrupt and stun their attack, then press the advantage with follow-up strikes," game director Jasmin Roy said.</p><p>South of Midnight also features the mystical character Huggin' Molly, who is a "monstrous woman-spider."</p><p>Finally, Compulsion Games said South of Midnight will take most players 10-12 hours to complete, though as always, your mileage may vary.
