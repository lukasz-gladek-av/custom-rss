		<p>We have two new videos for the remake of Silent Hill 2 from Konami which will be landing on 8th October. The first is almost all cut scenes and gives you an idea of the story of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Story Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CMvrMTmuJuA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This second video is from footage from a preview event earlier this month in Japan. This is a preview build so may not be exactly the same as the final game, and the video focuses on the new features that are found in the game, as well as a decent look at combat which has also been enhanced. Just a quick note, the English captions are auto generated from the Japanese so they’re not perfect.</p>
<p><iframe title="【サイレントヒル2】『SILENT HILL 2』リメイク版の進化を体験。レッドピラミッドシング戦までの序盤を世界最速先行プレイ" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Ni3-2MmMF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In development by Bloober Team, Silent Hill 2 is a big step up for the studio, but one that absolutely makes sense. They’re best known for their work on psychological horror games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/15/layers-of-fear-review-2/">Layers of Fear</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/19/observer-system-redux-review-ps5-series-x/">Observer</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/27/the-medium-review-xbox-series-x-pc/">The Medium</a>. That experience will be vital when updating a game made and designed for the limitations of the PlayStation 2 hardware in 2001.</p>

<p>In terms of the core gameplay, Silent Hill 2 will most noticeably be transformed by a shift away from fixed cameras and tank controls to over-the-shoulder and a more modern control scheme, similar to the treatment that Capcom gave to their Resident Evil remakes.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a massive leap forward graphically, with Bloober Team tapping into Unreal Engine 5 and all the cutting edge technology that this features like Lumen for realistic lighting effects and Nanite for exceptionally detailed 3D modelling and texturing.</p>
<p>It had been a while since Silent Hill 2 was first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/20/silent-hill-2-remake-is-using-unreal-engine-5-with-lumen-and-nanite-graphics/">announced back in 2022</a> – of course, it had been heavily rumoured for a good long time before then – but true to their word, it seems that development had been progressing smoothly in the time since then.</p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 will be released on 8th October 2024 for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview.956532/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-hands-on-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ever since the release of the Resident Evil 2 remake, developers have returned to the well en masse to give their classic games a new lease of life, more often than not with mixed results. From what I’ve seen so far, the upcoming Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t come close to hitting the heights of Resident Evil 2 – a blueprint for how a great remake is made – but it certainly feels like developer Bloober Team has made a lot of the right decisions when building on the survival horror classic’s undeniable legacy, even if at times it feels a little too safe.</p><p>I played the opening three hours of Silent Hill 2 and it was immediately apparent from the off that the remake gracefully captures all the important elements; an oppressive tone and straightforward game mechanics, even when the task itself is being obtuse. As with any Silent Hill game, atmosphere is king, and Silent Hill 2 immediately and consistently puts you into a state of unease. A thick fog surrounds the town like the original, now benefiting from modern lighting and volume thanks to today’s technical improvements. The streets are now filled with a new level of detail, shops are explorable, and strange sounds, cries, and groans are dynamically lurking around every corner.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones.</p></div><p>I can imagine it would have been incredibly tempting to layer music into the Silent Hill 2 remake, bringing the scares more in line with contemporary horror hits. But its slavish resistance is commendable, as the diegetic sounds of Silent Hill are where the game really sings, or rather, drones. Every room in the Wood Side Apartments creates its own version of uneasy tension, subtly assaulting you with an oppressive, unearthly soundscape of pulses and organic audio. From the moment protagonist James enters Silent Hill, the onslaught of bad vibes is present and never lets up for a second. Often fear is driven by anticipation, but Silent Hill 2 is <em>all</em> anticipation, with the sounds of the Lying Figures and co being ever-present. In some ways, it’s a difficult state of mind to be locked into.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Silent Hill 2 has stepped up its visual and audio game, but that’s to be expected for a 2024 release. The bigger and perhaps more impactful change is perspective, with Silent Hill 2 adopting the trusty over-the-shoulder playstyle that’s become a staple of the genre. What could have once been considered sacrilege for the series now serves the gameplay well, helping the unearthly combat encounters feel surprisingly familiar. Like the original, James’ arsenal is limited, with the only weapons available in the section I played being a handgun and his trusty wooden plank. Combat is certainly light and rudimentary, but Silent Hill 2 was never about that. It’s serviceable in a way that compliments the character’s ability – although I imagine it would have been extremely tempting for Bloober Team to strap James up Rambo-style, it would have been a disservice to the character and story it’s telling. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That’s not to say James doesn’t have a new move in his locker though. Silent Hill 2 implements a new dodge mechanic, allowing James to quickly dart out of the way of an enemy’s projectile vomit or Pyramid Head’s swinging blade. It’s a simple quick shuffle, not a Dark Souls-like forward roll, but it’s a tool that helped me to quickly establish a swing-swing-dodge rhythm before the Lying Figures threw up all their guts on me. Perhaps the biggest compliment I can give is that it’s a move that feels like it always should have been in Silent Hill 2.</p><p>From what I’ve seen so far the story is largely faithful, and I visited all the locations I expected to in the first few hours. The opening jaunt through the streets of Silent Hill is expanded, though, tasking you to solve a puzzle involving a jukebox in Neely’s Bar and forcing you to visit several of the town’s locations. Along the way, there’s plenty to examine further and marvel at the detail layered into this once sparse location. While purists might scoff at this addition, I feel it’s a smart move that encourages you to spend a little more time roaming the iconic, foggy streets. It’s a welcome addition before you spend a large portion of the game funnelled down dark hallways in a largely linear path. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them.</p></div><p>Fans of the original will be happy to hear that the remake doesn’t hold back with its returning puzzles. Like the original, the remake scales clues based on your difficulty level ( you can individually choose how challenging both combat and puzzles are in the main menu, although I didn’t get to test out how this is implemented in-game), but even on the normal difficulty setting I found some puzzles momentary head-scratchers that encouraged me to truly absorb my surroundings, especially after hard switching from my ‘kill everything that moves’ head space. Fans of the 2001 classic and the Resident Evil series know exactly what kind of thing to expect – using environmental clues to solve riddles and combinations –  but it felt like there was a little less signposting in Silent Hill 2 than its peers. It’s hard for me to quantify this, but all I can say is my usual urge to brute force the puzzles was quickly replaced by a wish to legitimately solve them. Hopefully that speaks to the puzzle’s design and not the pressures of the play session’s environment. </p><p>Bloober Team’s decision-making when rebuilding this classic has been clever, but it’s not perfect. The dialogue and performances still feel too campy and silly for my taste, often taking me out of the super serious tone. Unlike Resident Evil, where the campy nature is a big part of the vibe, Silent Hill in 2024 requires a subtle touch to complement the same masterful approach in atmosphere and sound design. Purists might celebrate its faithful remaking of the original’s lines, but I felt there was an opportunity here for some subtle rewrites and tweaks. I only got a small taste of the dialogue though, and Silent Hill 2 isn’t exactly known for its long conversations, so perhaps it’s not any kind of deal breaker.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Silent Hill 2 Remake</h3></div></output><p>Another irksome inclusion is the logical, but slightly tedious activity of opening countless kitchen cupboards and drawers to collect handgun ammo and healing items, similar to modern games like The Last of Us. It makes sense on paper, organically placing your collectible items in realistic locations, but I can’t help but feel the process took me out of the atmosphere, altering my thought process from fear to loot every time I entered a new room. Maybe it says more about me than the game, but several times after entering a room I was jumped by a hidden mannequin because I had prioritised scouring for pick-ups instead of enemies. </p><p>Disappointingly, from what I’ve seen so far Silent Hill 2 doesn’t appear to incorporate my favourite feature the best remakes tend to have: Taking your expectations based on what you know about the original and subverting them. 2002’s Resident Evil Remake, which played around with the ‘dogs jumping through the window’ jump scare that all fans expected, is the perfect example of how this can be expertly crafted. The approach allows for the tension of a fake out, and the creative space to drop new scares where you least expect it. This Silent Hill 2 remake doesn’t appear to have any real moments like that and, ultimately, no real big swings that change the landscape for hardcore fans. At least not in the opening three hours. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As a remake, Silent Hill 2 falls more in line with BluePoint’s faithful Shadow of the Colossus rather than Capcom’s rejuvenated Resident Evil 2. It substitutes bold new swings for a slavish dedication to the original, which is by no means a bad thing, just not the radical step some might expect. Silent Hill 2 certainly needed a fresh coat of paint and a tune of the engine, and Bloober Team has provided that in spades, but everything else is an extremely faithful reimagining that mostly resists the urge to alter the successful formula of a stone-cold classic.</p><p><em>Dale Driver is IGN's Executive Producer of Video Programming.

            <p>New week, same old terror of that cyclopean glutton known as the Maw emerging from its cosmic bolthole and swallowing the entirety of Devon. As ever, we have a way of thwarting the Maw's advance, and it's... pasta sauce? Graham, why is there pasta sauce in the Trello? Have Ziff Davis subfranchised us to Dolmio? Oh, I'm sorry! That's just my shopping list. What I meant to say was: new video games! Video games (PC games, specifically) are the only thing that can preoccupy the Maw, the only thing newsworthy enough to distract it from the tempting clifftop maisonettes of Torquay. Let's see what the week has in store for us, eh.</p><!--more-->
<p>Monday 19th August is a quieter one, but my eye is drawn to the early access launch of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116170/CyberCorp/">Cybercorp</a>, a top-down looter-shooter that might amuse fans of The Ascent. Tuesday 20th August is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth Wukong</a> Day, but you might also be keen on misfit words-are-weapons roadtrip <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dustborn">Dustborn</a>. On Wednesday 21st August, a balance of the airily winsome, the sorrowfully puzzling and the seductively monstrous in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mika-and-the-witchs-mountain">Mika And The Witch's Mountain</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1791590/Sunset_Hills/">Sunset Hills</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/my-lovely-empress">My Lovely Empress</a>. On Thursday 22nd August, it's all about spells of defenestration in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tactical-breach-wizards">Tactical Breach Wizards</a>. And on Friday 23rd August, it's all about heroes shooting heroes in Sony's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>.</p>
<p>You can read of yet more video games and related happenings in our weekly news liveblog, below. And now, the traditional Mawpost ending ceremony of stating that there are probably a bunch of cool PC games out this week that I've left out of the round-up, which you should sneeringly mention in the comments so that I can spend the day feeling bad about myself, questioning my life choices, and downing the Dolmio by the flagon. Have a jolly week.</p><div data-live="true">

            <p>
When Bloober and Konami announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">remaking Silent Hill 2</a> as part of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">comprehensive series reboot</a>, it made immediate if slightly deflating sense to me. Silent Hill 2 is the more feted of the Hills - if I were a calculating franchise custodian tasked with 'bringing back' one of the acclaimed original trilogy, that's probably the instalment I and my spreadsheets would fix upon. I mean, it's the game with Pyramid Head in it - the nearest thing Silent Hill has to a mascot, and it's not like there's an issue of cutting out plot material: each game in the Silent Hill series is, on some level, a distinct story with a distinct protagonist.</p>
<p>Still, the decision to 'skip' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">the first game in the series</a>, whose world, narrative themes, music and art direction set the parameters for all the rest, made my brain itch a bit, and when I ran into Bloober's creative director Mateusz Lenart and lead producer Maciej Głomb at a Konami event, I had to ask about it. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"I think Silent Hill 2 just matches our DNA way better," Lenart began. "It's much more emotional, a much more personal story than, for example, the first game or the third game. And we at Bloober were always fans of telling personal stories about people's experiences, people's feelings and how they go through them. Not so much about, you know know, occultism and things from other worlds, right? So I think that was the main reason, basically."
</p>
<p>
Some context: without giving too much away, the original Silent Hill is more of a supernatural affair, with your character Harry swept up in various diabolical doings, though it's also a work of psychological projection. The sequel switches priorities, placing a sorely disquieted brain at the centre, though it keeps one foot in that lineage of occultism. 
</p>
<p>
Lenart added that Bloober prefers to tell stories that are similarly "grounded" and focussed. "Obviously [our games] feature some supernatural elements, but in the end it's all about a specific person, on a specific journey that they need to make to find out the truth about themselves."
</p>
<p>
Of course, the choice of which Silent Hill game to tackle was broadly out of Bloober's hands. "Yeah, Silent Hill 2 is the best match for us as Bloober Team, in terms of our DNA and the games that we've done and that we did previously," Glomb agreed. "On the other hand, it's not like we were making this decision, right? The franchise is connected to Konami's plans.
</p>
<p>
"So we had this proposition, probably because of our DNA, our backgrounds with Silent Hill 2. And we were very glad to do this version of the game, just because it fits our feelings. Even in our previous games, we were so inspired by Silent Hill 2 in more specific aspects - in Layers Of Fear, which is a completely different game, but having those different endings, it was inspired by Silent Hill 2. Having those small things during the game where we don't tell you that it'll lead to a different ending."
</p>
<p>
As I said, if I were a canny Konami exec, I would probably greenlight Silent Hill 2 for the remake treatment before any of the others. As a player, however, I'm curious to know how Bloober's remake will land with people who haven't played the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that started the ball rolling. It's still my favourite of the Hills, and Silent Hill 2 is a richer play for understanding how it responds to the original game - what it preserves, what it rejects.</p>
<p>While there has been a "remake" of sorts in the shape of Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, the first Silent Hill lives on today mostly in the shape of the retro horror scene: its PS1 graphics and visual direction have become a distinct aesthetic, evolving alongside the hi-fi photorealism of later Silent Hill sequels. I guess we'll always have <a href="https://itch.io/games/in-jam/tag-silent-hill">Itch.io</a>.

<section><p>After spending about three hours with Silent Hill 2 Remake, I feel confident the puzzle-driven horror game will honor the original's tones and excite old fans while also creating plenty of new ones.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There is no genre quite like horror. At its best, it's so much more than guts and gore, or tired tropes and torture scenes. It's self-reflection. It's catharsis.</p><p dir="ltr">It's entering an implicit agreement with a work's creator: If you spill your guts out to me (metaphorically <em>or </em>perhaps literally), then I will wade through my own, hold them up, and take note of what makes ours similar to one another. While there are certainly qualities that make for a "good" work of horror, the transcendent variety is subjective; it relies on your own fears, traumas, and beliefs to create resonance with what's laid before you. The more vulnerable a work is, the greater its opportunity to connect with--or possibly alienate--its audience. This is precisely what makes Silent Hill 2 such a memorable and pivotal entry in the horror game genre--it's sheer vulnerability creates a game wherein even alienation <em>feels</em> like connection.</p><p dir="ltr">I say all this to emphasize that the upcoming remake of this 23 year-old game is an incredibly exciting prospect to me. Though the original holds up well, there's no denying that it feels quite dated--and not always in an endearing, "time capsule" kind of way. There's also no denying that the game is incredibly influential; its DNA is woven into countless horror games and horror-adjacent titles, with last year's Alan Wake 2 proving that, even decades later, this continues to be true. This ultimately elevates Silent Hill 2's status from "great game" to a "genre essential," albeit one that is frustrating to play--or even simply access--at the moment. A remake, then, seems entirely warranted.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352147" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352147"></a><figcaption>James approaches an enemy in the fog.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352147-jhry6e-e.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, following Konami's recent treatment of the Silent Hill series--and production partner Bloober's own perceived missteps--many have wondered if the company truly has a grasp on what makes Silent Hill 2 so special and whether it can effectively remake it. It's a fair question, especially after a handful of less-than-impressive trailers. And it's one I kept in mind as I spoke to some of Konami and Bloober's lead developers and played about three hours of the Silent Hill 2 remake at Konami's Tokyo headquarters. While brief conversations and my jaunt through the game's opening hours (including the infamous Wood Side Apartments) can't make for a complete answer, what I saw left me impressed; assuming the game's tone remains in place and that what I played is a proper indication of what's to come, the upcoming remake could be an exceptional and reverent experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Reverence was a consistent feeling throughout my playthrough, as Silent Hill 2 is an <em>incredibly </em>faithful adaptation helmed by a mix of the original game's key developers--who repeatedly expressed their own awe at the game a group of young, scrappy developers managed to pull off--and fresh faces who cite Silent Hill 2 as among their greatest inspirations. I was pleased to note that the game didn't feel entirely reconstructed or reinterpreted as a means to satisfy perceived modern demands, nor does it feel swayed by the urge to add in more jump scares, viscera, or plain ol' <em>content. </em>The game begins the same way it always has , with James examining himself in a derelict bathroom mirror and explaining, somewhat chillingly, what brings him to Silent Hill. James' new voice actor Luke Roberts nails the delivery of this and every one of his monologues, managing to sound both Completely Normal while also slightly… off. Breathy. Dissociative.</p><p dir="ltr">As he makes his way down the winding, fog-drenched footpath that leads to Silent Hill, he passes a familiar red symbol--one of those long-forgotten save points that, yes, remain <em>vital</em> and are the only form of saving progress in the remake. James then offers the same strange, meta remark he did in the original game: "Looking at this makes me feel like someone's groping around inside my skull." Though it seems a small thing to be excited by, the game's retention of these minor, surreal situations. ("There was a hole here. It's gone now." is another that comes to mind and is still present) feels like proof that the team understands how these quiet moments ultimately establish a more extreme level of dread than a high-fidelity Pyramid Head jumpscare might.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352150" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352150"></a><figcaption>James examines a window covered in newspapers. It reads: There was a hold here. It's gone now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352150-hole.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In fact, just the sheer retention of the game's opening slow burn feels like a triumph. According to Bloober Team's Maciej Glomg, the lead producer of Silent Hill 2 Remake, the team <em>did</em> attempt to develop a faster-paced opening to the game before realizing it simply didn't feel right. Silent Hill 2 earns and relies upon the way its opening minutes--and the grotesque creatures found within them--crawl.</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, the team repeatedly noted that Silent Hill 2 is "not a combat-oriented game." It is not fast-paced. It is not punchy. The same can be said for its remake, which improves upon combat by making things a bit more fluid and adding an extremely helpful dodge button and an aiming reticle, but does not necessarily overhaul the overall experience. For some, this could be frustrating, as it still has a light dusting of PS2 jank, for lack of a better term, that something like the Resident Evil remakes have more or less done away with. However, I found that the remake's combat actually feels perfectly in service to the rest of the game. Part of what makes Silent Hill 2 as terrifying as it is are those small bursts of panic and tension that arise from its cumbersome combat; the remake seems to accept and build upon this, taking away the more unruly and frustrating aspects of combat while letting the game retain its sense of friction. Combat feels solid in Silent Hill 2, but it's not at the forefront.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately, the team being so forthcoming about that means that combat is treated truly as a secondary part and doesn't feel awkwardly pushed to the front and promoted only for it to feel less polished than your average survival horror game in 2024. Another way they emphasize this within the game is by retaining the remaster's choice to separate the combat and puzzle difficulty settings, allowing you to fine-tune your experience and select what level you wish to engage your brain or brawn. It's also worth noting that the main menu contains an impressive amount of accessibility options; we're talking pages of them. Whether a player has visual, auditory, or motor impairments--or merely likes to be able to tweak a robust amount of playstyle preferences--the option to do so probably exists in Silent Hill 2's remake. You can change the color and boldness of your reticle, alter the game's color palette to adjust for multiple types of color blindness, set text to account for dyslexia, and more. This is just another way Silent Hill 2 emphasizes constant, meaningful upgrades rather than embracing complete AAA modernity at any cost.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352144" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352144"></a><figcaption>James points his pistol at an approaching Pyramid Head.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352144-pyramid.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Of course I can't gloss over the most drastic of all these changes: the game's visuals. With the recent and ongoing wave of remasters, remakes, and the like, the number one thing I ask myself when playing one of them is, "Does this feel like an attempt to make things sleek and modern, or did they successfully create the bridge between what was once there and how my imagination expanded it when I played it years ago?" The Silent Hill 2 remake does the latter, and it does it exceedingly well. And this was a welcome surprise, considering how rough some of the trailers published by Konami and Bloober look.</p><p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill 2 remake is a gorgeous game that doesn't abandon the grime, grotesquerie, and yes, fog, that made the original game so mesmerizing. In fact, it regularly amps it up. Locations are expanded upon, with a handful of new buildings and eerie shops to walk through and plenty of smaller details and objects that make the world seem more grounded in reality--even if that reality is one of horrific isolation. Neely's Bar, for example, no longer feels like merely a small, derelict cube, but looks like an actual abandoned bar. And, as you stumble upon notes from off-kilter former residents, these locations transform into places with greater meaning.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352142" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352142"></a><figcaption>James examines the counter at Neely's Bar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352142-bar.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">And yet everything still <em>feels </em>the same. It still <em>feels</em> like Silent Hill. Suffocating. A place where the air feels tainted by a tangy, metallic scent and its people, hellish cerebral forces. Though there was some uncertainty around the game's character models, those I encountered--while not on the same level as the game's environments--looked surprisingly good. Though Angela's appearance in trailers seemed a bit off, to put it lightly, I found that her movements and VO were not particularly jarring in game. And yet, what impressed me more than anything I've listed so far was the game's music and audio.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Silent Hill 2 composer Akira Yamaoka, creating a new yet reminiscent soundtrack for Silent Hill 2 Remake was incredibly important to him; however, doing so proved to be not only a difficult process, but an impossible one. Yamaoka said he tried repeatedly to enter the same mindset he was in when he composed the original title's music; mid-20s and "financially unstable," he added with a laugh. He recounted how he didn't own a bass guitar at the time of recording, meaning he was resigned to tuning his guitar extremely low to create the same effect.</p><p dir="ltr">Yamaoka admitted that there was no going back to that space; that that younger version of himself felt foreign to him now. And yet, none of that was apparent when I listened to his new take on the iconic soundtrack. Though the game's music has been reworked, it feels familiar, with its iconic motifs wrapped in all-new layers of dissonance, static, synth, and intensity. And along with the new music is a focus on 3D "depth-oriented sound direction," meaning steps, scrapes, creaks, moans, and shrieks feels even more unsettling (though remarkably more helpful, as well).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352145" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png" data-ref-id="1300-4352145"></a><figcaption>James approached a pair of wooden double doors. The room is tinted red and filled with cages.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4352145-james.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While tracks I heard felt similar to what already existed, everything feels a bit deeper now, a bit darker. And it works incredibly well. As danger encroaches out on the streets of South East Vale, sharp, abrupt, and dissonant chords get your heart beating faster. In especially tense situations, the sound takes on a life of its own; it feels like it is breathing alongside you. As you approach Pyramid Head for the first time, his hulking frame staring blankly from behind a set of bars, the synth and accompanying static are horrifying. Despite him doing <em>nothing</em>, it was the scariest portion of the already frightening preview.</p><p dir="ltr">In short, I was incredibly impressed by the time I spent with Silent Hill 2 Remake. It is surreal, cerebral, horrifying, and grotesque--all of the things that made the original title such a remarkable title not only for Konami, but for the horror genre as well. Considering I was resigned to the game's beginning hours (and it's worth nothing here that I'd estimate we're looking at a 8 or so hour experience in total based on what I managed to accomplish within the three or so we were given), it's hard to tell if the game will nail its tone and message; if certain plot twists will remain as vile and unnerving and the studio will fully commit to creating a suffocating, psychological hell above all else. But after my time with Silent Hill 2 Remake--and after months of witnessing the internet (and myself) hem and haw on whether or not this Remake even has the capacity to be great--I am no longer on the fence. I am thrilled the wait for the full experience is almost over, and will be brushing up on my bravery until the game launches on October 8.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NZXT Capsule Review: Low-Cost, Crystal-Clear Microphone]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-capsule-review-microphone/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nzxt-capsule-review-low-cost-crystal-clear-microphone.956469/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nzxt-capsule-review-microphone/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been using the NZXT Capsule for a few weeks and have finally pulled together enough experience with it to assemble a full review. I picked it up from NZXT with open expectations after moving across from the HyperX Quadcast, which had been a capable microphone for me for four years.</p>



<p>I wasn’t sure if the low price point was representative of the quality of the NZXT Capsule, but now I believe that the company isn’t charging enough for his stellar peripheral. </p>



<p>Read on to check out this full NZXT Capsule review before you buy the microphone.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-seriously-heavy-stuff">Seriously Heavy Stuff</h2>



<p>The NZXT Capsule is a cardioid-based USB microphone designed to stand upright on a desk or attach to a boom arm – which NZXT also sells. At just $59.99, the NZXT Capsule is one of the most affordable microphones on the market, coming in at less than half the price of the HyperX Quadcast S.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the NZXT Capsule looks <strong>very </strong>attractive. It’s available in either solid white or solid black, and everything from the build of the base unit itself to the uncompromising, shock-resistant desk stand feels premium. It has a nice braided cable in the box and a few adapters, just in case you want to mount it to a boom arm.</p>



<p>One of the things that surprised me the most was the weight of the microphone with the desk stand attached – it’s <strong>heavy</strong>. That translates nicely into a more ‘expensive feel’ for the unit, which is made of tough, resilient plastic and aluminium. On the face of the microphone sits two dials, one to control the voice volume and another to control the volume of a headset.</p>



<p>That second dial is important, as it leans into another feature – you can run a headset <strong>through </strong>the NZXT Capsule.</p>



<p>With a quick-release implementation, solid cardioid microphone pattern, and crystal-clear audio capabilities, the NZXT Capsule could be the Quadcast killer we’ve been waiting for. On stream, my viewers noted that it sounds much better than the Quadcast, and the built-in shielding does a stronger job of masking background noise.</p>



<p>I can’t find much of a fault with <a href="https://nzxt.com/en-GB/product/capsule#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the NZXT Capsule</a>. I was going to suggest that it’s perhaps <strong>too big</strong>, but there’s a Mini version available if you’re limited on space. I can wholeheartedly recommend giving the NZXT Capsule a shot if you’re a streamer looking for a solid microphone.</p>



<p>You’d hardly believe it has been on the market since September 2021 – it’s brilliant.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zotac Gaming Zone Handheld Available to Preorder Now]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zotac-gaming-zone-handheld-available-to-preorder-now.956463/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zotac-gaming-zone-preorder-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zotac Gaming is the latest hardware manufacturer to break into the handheld gaming market. It has just been revealed that the ‘Zotac Gaming Zone’ is available to preorder. Zotac unveiled the Zone at Computex 2024 in June, announcing its intention to enter the growing handheld gaming race.</p>



<p>This means that the Zotac Gaming Zone will start to compete with the likes of the ROG Ally, the Lenovo Legion Go, Steam Deck, and MSI Claw.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-generation">Next Generation</h2>



<p>The Zotac Gaming Zone is a fine contender compared to the current market leaders. It boasts an AMD Ryzen 7 8840U with RDNA 3 graphics and Zen 4 architecture for maximum gaming power. It enters the running with 16 GB of LPDDR5X-7500 RAM, which means it’s half as capable in that respect as the ROG Ally X released just weeks ago.</p>



<p>Out of the box, the Zotac Gaming Zone features a full HD AMOLED display, which is the best screen currently available in the realm of handhelds. It will be capable of putting out a 120Hz refresh rate and is rated at 800nits of brightness, which edges out the ROG Ally X and the new MSI Claw.</p>



<p>It’s perhaps restricted slightly by the 512 GB NVMe SSD, but it does have a UHS-II microSD card reader for expansions.</p>



<p>Perhaps where the Zotac Gaming Zone shines the brightest is in the overall build of the unit and the controls. It features a few innovations that are sure to make it stand out among the competition:</p>



<ul>
<li>Drift-resistant analog sticks</li>



<li>Hall-effect triggers with two-stage adjustment</li>



<li>Radial dials around the sticks for on-the-fly tweaking</li>



<li>Dual trackpads (like the Steam Deck)</li>



<li>Dual USB ports rated for rapid charging</li>



<li>Front-facing camera and onboard microphone</li>
</ul>



<p>All that and it also has a touch of RGB to really impress the gamer in you.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed how much the Zotac Gaming Zone will cost, but it’s expected to retail for around $800. It was recently announced that the Zone will be playable at Gamescom, so we’ll be hands-on with the device later this week.</p>

It is called the “Suuransen (Number War).” Since the olden days, this periodically-fought war has been determining the rankings of the Suuke, as well as selecting a “Soyogi” who leads and controls the Suuke. This war was thought to never take place again after one number broke away. However, since the sudden re-emergence of “the number that should not exist,” the conditions for the Suuransen to be held have now been met… “When the time comes in which the ten numbers assemble, The carved seal shall guide you to the field of battle.” Her name is Reisaki Hiroka. She is the one who signals the beginning and the end.

<p>On the other side of the competition, Young was able to secure his Grandfinals spot by beating Team Falcon’s Abumakkah, 7-2. Both matches had a time limit, which was the same for Grandfinals, where Jafonso and Young faced off against each other.</p>

<p>Team Vitality has lifted the IEM Cologne trophy in the Cathedral of Counter-Strike, netting a $400,000 grand prize and earning qualification to both IEM Katowice <strong>and </strong>the BLAST Premier World Final. It’s a monumental moment for the team, as no player on the squad has won this trophy previously, despite some having made it to the grand finals before.</p>



<p>Vitality handed the final loss to Natus Vincere, who as recently as yesterday was speaking honestly and openly about the need to sharpen up if it was ever going to beat a dominant Vitality side.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-the-cathedral">In The Cathedral</h2>



<p>IEM Cologne is one of the most important and legendary events in the Counter-Strike esports calendar. This massive victory marks the first major win for Team Vitality in 2024, and it was achieved in a historic fashion. As Vitality carved through the group stage, it effortlessly powered past FURIA, FaZe, and MOUZ to qualify for the playoffs.</p>



<p>From there, the squad eliminated SAW from the tournament and then pulled off a 3-1 win over Natus Vincere, typically one of the most stalwart teams in the CS2 scene.</p>



<p>HLTV has mentioned that this is a competitor for the game of the year, with both teams putting on quite a show for the thousands of fans in attendance in Cologne. There was a special commendation handed to Mathieu ‘ZywOo’ Herbaut, who clutched up for Vitality in numerous spots and managed to secure more than 100 kills throughout the series, earning him his 20th MVP award.</p>



<p>As the sun sets on IEM Cologne, esports fans can now look forward to IEM Rio 2024, which is the next event under this banner that’ll take place in October in Brazil. Elsewhere, we’ve still got the ESL Pro League Season 20, BLAST Premier Fall Final, Thunderpick World Championship, BLAST Premier: World Final, <strong>and </strong>Perfect World Shanghai to play out before the year wraps up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-cod-esports-world-cup/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>This weekend, the best Call of Duty teams in the world descended upon Saudi Arabia to take part in the Esports World Cup. Over a four-day window, 16 squads took to a grand stage in Riyadh, with $1.8 million on the line, but following a dominating streak, it was Atlanta FaZe that secured the $600,000 grand prize.</p>



<p>It was a relatively surprising event all around. From Toronto Ultra being ejected from the playoffs by 100 Thieves to Cloud9 crumbling <strong>again </strong>against OpTic, this weekend proved to be just as exciting as one of the biggest events in the Call of Duty League calendar.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-monumental-performance">Monumental Performance</h2>



<p>It wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but there’s no denying that the Esports World Cup has been exciting of late. This weekend, Modern Warfare 3 entered the limelight, with a range of CDL and Challengers-grade teams competing for a massive cash prize. As the group stage unravelled, eight teams fell at the first post:</p>



<ul>
<li>OMiT Brooklyn</li>



<li>Vegas Legion</li>



<li>G2 Esports</li>



<li>Gentle Mates</li>



<li>Stallions</li>



<li>Team Heretics</li>



<li>Lore Gaming</li>



<li>Team Falcons</li>
</ul>



<p>When the tournament progressed into the playoffs, <strong>only </strong>the CDL teams remained in the running, which made it feel like COD Champs all over again. Many thought OpTic Gaming would snatch the top spot after steamrolling over OMiT, Carolina Royal Ravens, and Cloud9, but Atlanta FaZe proved to be too powerful for the reigning world champions to overcome.</p>



<p>Bizarrely, the grand final took place between Atlanta FaZe and 100 Thieves, represented by the LA Thieves squad. These teams hadn’t met at this point in a tournament for years, and the hype train was in full flow as the grand final kicked off. To get there, 100 Thieves had to eliminate Toronto Ultra and Vancouver Surge, and the squad entered the GF with immense momentum.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Atlanta FaZe’s respawn game was just too clean, with the team securing the first and second rounds of Hardpoint. Two huge map wins were landed by 100 Thieves in the first rounds of Control and Search, but yet another win from FaZe in the second Search seemed to all but seal the deal.</p>



<p>Going into the second round of Control, Atlanta FaZe maintained the pressure with a scoreline of 3 – 2 (in a best-of-seven), 100 Thieves put up one hell of a fight, but with FaZe dominating the round on Invasion with ease, it wasn’t long before the squad of Cellium, aBeZy, Simp, and Drazah was lifting the tournament trophy and celebrating a $600,000 win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-ps5-remake-is-expected-to-retail-at-60-consumers-will-have-to-pay-the-sony-tax/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming "remaster" version of Until Dawn will be released with a "pricey" tag, as a leak by Dealabs suggests that the title could be off to retail at $60.</p>
<p>For those unaware, a new PS5 version of Until Dawn is expected to hit stores in the upcoming months. The title won't have many changes in terms of the storyline, but the key differences would lie in the transition to the next-gen platform, ultimately enhancing the overall graphics and cinematics of the title. The developers have recreated the game in Unreal Engine 5 with the aim of giving players access to a more intimate experience throughout the unfolding horrific events.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credits: PlayStation</figcaption></figure>
<p>With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-launches-on-playstation-5-and-pc-october-4/">recent emergence of the release date of the title</a> (on both PS5 and PC, where the game will make its debut), we now have an idea of the price point at which Until Dawn is expected to retail, credited to a leak by the famous whistleblower Billbil-kun on <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-combien-coutera-la-version-amelioree-de-until-dawn-sur-ps5-et-pc-58568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dealabs</a>. Interestingly, a dedicated physical disk for the new title will also be released alongside, and in terms of pricing, here is how they will look like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$59.99 for US Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>€69.99 For European Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>109.95 AUD For Australian Markets</strong></li>
<li><strong>79.99 CAD For Canadian Markets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Some PlayStation fans consider the pricing outrageous, given that other remaster counterparts, such as The Last of Us Part II, initially retailed at €49.99 on PS5, and the original version of the title is much cheaper nowadays. The pricing move will certainly raise questions about whether the newer Until Dawn will do any good for Sony in the markets. Despite the hype around the title, such high prices will certainly lower consumer enthusiasm, which can reflect poor sales.</p>
<p>Let us know your thoughts on Until Dawn's price model. Is it adequate, given the graphical improvements we are receiving?</p>

            <p>A new "modern camera" mod is now available for Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill 4: The Room on PC.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZealotTormunds">ZealotTormunds</a> has developed a mod that gives Silent Hill players both a first-person perspective and a more contemporary over-the-shoulder camera.</p>

<p>Both Silent Hill 3 and 4 typically use fixed camera angles. By freeing up these locked perspectives, Zealot provides players with the chance to get a closer look at the game's textures, enemies, and environments.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, getting the original Silent Hill 2, 3, and 4 on PC is neither easy nor cheap, but for those lucky enough to have them, this mod enables players to experience the horror in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>No, not all fans are <a href="https://x.com/denshirenji04/status/1823145054908600726">happy</a>, with some criticising the mod for stripping away the game's original intent. However, as Zealot said on X/Twitter, yes, "a huge part of Silent Hill's identity is its camera, but this is just a mod that lets you play differently".</p>
<p>"This is just a mod that lets you play differently, see the scenarios from a little closer and appreciate the art of the game," they added. "The original SH3 is still there, and you can play it as intended.</p> <div>
