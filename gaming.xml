			<p>This coming <strong>Thursday, February 12, 2026</strong>, is when <strong>Sony</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> will host the first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong> event of 2026. It is set to air at <strong>2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm BT,</strong> and we now know that it's not the only showcase event of the evening. <strong>Konami</strong> has revealed that it will host a <strong>Silent Hill Transmission </strong>event that same night, featuring news about what's next for the Silent Hill franchise, including <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall.</strong> And it'll kick off approximately an hour after the State of Play ends.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a short post on the official Silent Hill social channels, with SH: Townfall being the only game directly called out. Outside of that, the event will include "<em>the latest updates from the Silent Hill series</em>," and it'll premiere at <strong>4pm PT / 7pm ET</strong> on Thursday, and at <strong>12am BT</strong> on <strong>Friday, February 13.</strong></p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are excited to reveal the latest updates from the SILENT HILL series in a new SILENT HILL Transmission on February 12 at 4:00 PM PT. 🌫️ </p><p>We’ll share the latest news on SILENT HILL: Townfall. The streaming link is coming soon so stay tuned! 👀 </p><p> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SILENTHILL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SILENTHILL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Townfall?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Townfall</a> <a href="https://t.co/Se0uJDhUqJ">pic.twitter.com/Se0uJDhUqJ</a></p></div>— Silent Hill Official (@SilentHill) <a href="https://twitter.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>We don't yet have a release date for SH: Townfall, and neither Konami nor <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong>, which is developing SH: Townfall alongside Konami, have shared a release window. What we do have, however, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">a <strong>March 26, 2026,</strong> date from a retail listing</a> that popped up in November 2025. It could be the release date, but it could also have been just a placeholder. At the end of the day, we know that SH: Townfall has been in development for a number of years, even making it through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-is-still-in-development-despite-annapurna-interactives-woes/">massive shake-up at Annapurna</a>. A March 2026 release date doesn't feel like the most far-fetched idea. </p>



<p>We also have confirmation from Konami that it wants to keep up the pace of releasing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/">new game in the Silent Hill franchise every year</a>. A strategy that the company hopes to maintain after putting out <strong>Bloober Team's</strong> remake of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Silent Hill 2</a></strong> in 2024 and last year's wonderful new entry to the series, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">Silent Hill f</a></strong>, both of which saw strong commercial success.</p>



<p>Besides SH: Townfall, this could be the showcase where we finally get to see what Bloober Team has been working on with regard to remaking the first Silent Hill game. With that reportedly set to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-2027-launch/">arrive in 2027</a></strong>, it may just be early enough for us to get our first tease of the remake, though it's just as likely that we won't see it until a bigger showcase later on in the year.</p>



<p>What's also interesting to consider with this event, specifically due to the timing of it following the State of Play, is that we could get a trailer for SH: Townfall during the State of Play, only for Konami to follow it up with a deep-dive into the gameplay during the Transmission event.</p>



<p>Between the State of Play, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">DICE Awards</a></strong>, and now this, it's clear that Thursday, February 12, 2026, will feel like a busy night in the video game industry.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/sony-san-diego/" id="2183">Sony San Diego</a> has shared an update on upcoming content for the “Road to The Show” mode in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mlb-the-show-26/" id="3187">MLB The Show 26.</a></p>



<p>This year, Sony is touting more control than ever for players looking to take their custom baseball player to the Hall of Fame. This control includes a new career simulation method, new Perks, and higher stakes in every game.</p>

<iframe title="WHAT'S NEW?! Road To The Show in MLB The Show 26" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Yx_Ci_OTfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<h2>Amateur Years Gameplay Extended</h2>



<p>Of course, no baseball player starts their career in the MLB. As such, not only will you go through the amateur years in MLB The Show 26, but you’ll also have the option to extend them. Your character will be recruited out of high school to one of 11 new colleges, with 19 colleges in total, each offering recruiting packages. The package you choose will influence your skill development, equipment, scouting exposure, and more.</p>



<p>That level of control doesn’t stop at the amateurs, however. Once you’re in the major ranks, you can request trades and talk with coaches about potentially changing positions. You’ll also have more leverage to make big mid-season moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-changes-to-perks-in-mlb-the-show-26">Changes to Perks in MLB The Show 26</h2>



<p>This year, specific requirements unlock Perks for your ballplayer. This means you can pursue the options you believe will benefit you most. Also, a revamped menu simplifies learning and upgrading your player’s Perks.</p>



<h2>Simulate More and Simplify Your Career to Your Liking</h2>



<p>In MLB The Show 26, you can simulate parts of the career mode experience. Your sim options will be driven by your overall rating. Achievements such as hitting streaks will temporarily boost your ballplayer’s overall, improving performance in simulated games.</p>



<p>However, players are also alerted when big moments in their careers are approaching. This will allow you to regain control and stop the simulation experience if you choose.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is fast approaching its first anniversary, meaning if it were a real human baby it would be legally unable to do anything really because have you met a one year old? Still, ahead of that anniversary, Capcom has outlined the game's next big update which, shock horror, includes a new monster to hunt, a new weapon to hunt with, a collab with basically itself, and more coming on February 18th. Oh, and there's DLC coming! But once again, the horror, the shock.
</p>
<p>
First, that new monster; this one is the 10 star Arch-tempered Arkveld which is joining as part of a permanent event quest. He's a big, dark, lightningy looking guy, not much to say about him. That new weapon is a doozy, at least stylistically, as it's basically what if Cloud's Buster Sword was a broken mirror. Looking mighty fine honestly, and comes as part of a weapon design contest, made by one Nolan Lu. Nice work Nolan!

<p>
The aforementioned collab is specifically with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> 3: Twisted Reflection (you see, itself!), which features a new side mission you can only get if you have a hunter rank of nine or higher. It's permanent though, so don't worry about missing out on it. The mission itself sees you teaming up with Rudy, a more cel shaded Palico from Stories 3, who needs you to find some monster eggs he dropped. Deliver enough eggs, and you can get rewards like a Rudy costume for your Palico, and a few different pendants too.
</p><p>
From the release of this update on February 18th through to March 18th, there'll be an anniversary event where you can "collect a special anniversary login bonus, and join in the seasonal festivities—a weekly rotation of each previous Festival of Accord!"
</p>
<p>
In terms of the DLC, details are slim pickings, but it will apparently be a "large-scale expansion," with plans to share more details about it in the summer according to this <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/526493182068786774">Steam blog post</a>. It's something I guess! Look forward to it at your own risk.

            <guid>1431754</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The name makes this sound like something that’s either a mobile strategy game with deeply <a href="https://aftermath.site/so-i-dont-totally-hate-those-hero-wars-ads/"><u>misleading Facebook ads</u></a>, or something for the ‘<a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/master-and-commander/master-and-commander-the-far-side-of-the-world-russell-crowe-paul-bettany-oceans-battlefields?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Oceans are now battlefields</u></a>’ crowd to play while they all <a href="https://aftermath.site/medieval-iii-total-war-fifa-netflix-delphi-announce/"><u>wait and hope for <em>Total War</em> to go back to its historical roots</u></a>. Lucky for me, you and all of us, <em>Master of Command</em> is the latter.</p><p>It’s a roguelike <em>Total War</em> game (bear with me!) set in 18th-century Europe during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Years%27_War?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the Seven Years’ War</u></a>, and puts you in command of an army that has to roam the countryside attracting new recruits, scavenging for supplies and upgrading your gear. Which sounds slightly mad given the historical context–I’m a general in the British Army, surely I have maps and supply chains, why am I wandering around fields looking for boxes of apples and hiring French regiments–but the narrative justification for all this meandering makes enough sense that I stopped questioning it pretty quickly and just rolled with it.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAED5vzMEHw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Master of Command | Release Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>It’s not like the idea of coats-and-muskets armies being multinational forces was an alien one; the British army regularly included German troops, and Napoleon’s Grand Armee featured everyone from Poles to Austrians to the Irish. And living off the land was also a legitimate tactic; Napoleon himself relied on it all the time, which is one of the biggest contributors to his disastrous retreat in Russia, whose winter left nothing for him to scavenge. Putting a roguelike slant on all this is close enough to the time period’s reality for it to make sense.&nbsp;</p><p>And in this context it’s maybe the most interesting thing about <em>Master of Command</em>. We’ve played tactics games and shooters and card games with roguelike tendencies, but <em>Total War’s</em> enormous real-time battles are something new, and as a huge fan of that series I’ve been really impressed with <em>Master of Command’s</em> attempts at replicating Creative Assembly’s formula. And I do mean replicate: from the main menu down to the in-battle interface, <em>Master of Command</em> isn’t so much looking over<em> Total War’s</em> shoulders as it’s just tracing right over its lines.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is fine, because aside from cavalry being kinda broken and OP, and there being a few less tactical options for your units, for the most part <em>Master of Command</em> plays exactly like a battle in <em>Empire </em>or <em>Napoleon Total War</em>. In some ways it’s even better, like the way units will break much more easily here, resulting in lower and more realistic casualty counts, while some nice battlefield additions like a musket reloading progress bar over your units helps you better plan your tactics.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There’s a campaign and a loose act-based structure here, where you have to complete sidequests before tackling an end-of-level army, but the basic loop throughout remains the same. You fight real-time battles, you wander around reinforcing, having random encounters and messing with your army, then you get back on the battlefield and do it all again, juggling your resources and keeping an eye on your objectives the whole time.&nbsp;</p><p>I really like it. The battles are snappy enough that I never feel too bogged down playing so many of them in quick succession, and the roguelike structure makes me <em>very </em>invested in keeping as many of my guys alive as possible. I’d also like to take this opportunity to apologize to both the game and its art; I was recommended this game by many, many people last year and noped out immediately because the art shown in the game’s trailer looked <em>so bad</em>. On the screen, though? It’s fine! Many of the loading screens are better than fine, they look great!</p><p>Even if you’re not a huge muskets and horses person, the roguelike implementation here is still really interesting. Seeing these trappings added to an existing genre is something we all encounter at every waking moment of our lives these days, but the way it’s done here, and how it slides so seamlessly into your feeling of investment and control over your army, is fantastic. If this had just been a tactical RTS I’d be nowhere near as into it as I am, knowing how much it costs to replace every casualty I suffer and every musket ball I expend.</p>

            <guid>1431739</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>With the second season of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/battlefield-6/" id="1961">Battlefield 6</a> set to launch, the game’s communications team has shared a list of updates players can look forward to.</p>



<p>While new maps and challenges are already known to be coming to Battlefield 6<a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/status/2021313449754755403?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">, major updates are also on the way,</a> bringing quality-of-life improvements, faster progression, and more.</p>



<p>One such change includes faster Battle Pass progression. The team notes that this season will be more rewarding and that Battle Pass Tokens earned from Career XP have been recalculated, allowing players to progress faster through regular gameplay and weekly challenges.</p>



<p>Additionally, in-game movement has been improved. The team behind Battlefield 6 now says it feels more predictable and readable during fast-paced action changes, including acceleration curves, smoother vaulting, and smoother ladder transitions. The team has also made fixes that reduce visual inconsistencies and unexpected behavior.</p>







<h2 id="h-updates-coming-to-redsec">Updates Coming to REDSEC</h2>



<p>REDSEC is Battlefield 6’s Battle Royale mode. This community update notes that there will be more rewarding progression in the mode, as Career and weapon XP earn rates have been increased. Hopefully, baseball helps progression feel more balanced between the regular gameplay experience and Battle Royale.</p>



<p>Also, they are increasing overall armor availability in REDSEC. Plus, they’re introducing a cooldown on Vehicle Keycards as a mission reward after players acquire one. This is intended to help balance tank access in Battle Royale mode.</p>







<p>Learn more about what’s coming in season 2 of Battlefield 6 at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-2-launches-next-week/" id="175564">this link.</a></p>

And it's largely thanks to its collaborations with other brands, via its Universes Beyond and Secret Lair releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its earnings call today, Hasbro revealed that MTG revenue was up 59% year-over-year, in no small part thanks to the Avatar: The Last Airbender set last year, which is now the third highest-selling set in Magic history after Final Fantasy and Lord of the Rings. Other Universes Beyond sets, as well as Secret Lair, also had a hand in the success.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That 59% is a huge increase, and one that is responsible for Hasbro's overall numbers looking good. The company overall was up 14% year-over-year, almost entirely driven by 45% growth in the Wizards of the Coast and Digital Gaming segment (Monopoly Go! also helped a little). Its other segments, Consumer Products and Entertainment, both saw declines of 4% each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The revenue-raising capabilities of Universes Beyond and Secret Lair are a helpful look for Hasbro's C-suite, which has found itself the target of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lawsuit-claims-hasbro-misled-investors-regarding-sales-of-controversial-magic-the-gathering-anniversary-set">shareholder lawsuit on the very subject recently</a>. The lawsuit alleges that Hasbro has mismanaged Magic: The Gathering by overprinting sets of cards, specifically Universes Beyond and Secret Lair, thereby devaluing existing cards. The complaint itself contains some pretty sharp accusations that the company's top brass have been holding such sets in reserve to deploy whenever the rest of the company is struggling.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Avatar: The Last Airbender x Magic: The Gathering - Tea Time at the Jasmine Dragon Scene Box</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Hasbro has stated that such claims have "no merit," and has recently moved to dismiss a similar lawsuit with very similar accusations filed in 2024 by the West Palm Beach Firefighters' Pension Fund and City of Miami General Employees &amp; Sanitation Employees' Retirement Trust, on the basis that the complaint has been amended so significantly since it was originally filed that it is no longer related to the original issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hasbro reached out to share the following updated statement on these lawsuits as pertains to its earnings today:</p><blockquote>As we shared when you covered the matter in January, these claims have no merit. Our strategic plan for Magic was implemented, and the results underscore the strength of that strategy.

It’s already made back the cost of its roughly seven-year development, blew past internal sales expectations, and is currently approaching the highest peak concurrent player count of Isaac itself – and it only launched today at 6am PT.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So far this is beating expectations by quite a lot,” developer Tyler Glaiel tells IGN, saying it likely took less than three hours for development costs to be fully recouped. “Its a bigger launch than any of the Isaac expansions already, and its only been a few hours.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">His partner Edmund McMillen, best known for games like Isaac and Super Meat Boy, put just how wide of a gap that is into a perspective: “I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac:] Rebirth, and it sold 40,000 units I think day one.” By comparison, McMillen says Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in its first five-and-a-half hours. “Isn't that kind of insane?”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mewgenics is also sitting at more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>63,000 concurrent players</u></a> on Steam at time of writing, creeping steadily towards Rebirth’s all-time peak of 70,701. “We knew the game was good and would do good,” Glaiel says, “but Isaac is *HUGE* so we thought it was unlikely to beat that.” There are also almost 85k people watching it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/mewgenics" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Twitch</u></a> – one of which is McMillen himself, who says he’s enjoying watching <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/northernlion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Northernlion</u></a> be so immediately good at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The critical reception for Mewgenics has been glowing as well, currently sitting at an 89 on sites like <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/mewgenics/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Metacritic</u></a> and 96% positive user reviews on Steam (with roughly 1,700 in at the moment). IGN’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-review"><u>Mewgenics review</u></a> gave it a 9/10, saying it’s “a fantastic tactical RPG that's good for more than a hundred hours of roguelike runs. Just when you think you have it figured out it'll throw something completely unexpected and hilariously gross at you – and probably a catchy new original song, too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Associate Reviews Director.

The company revealed new age verification requirements on February 9 that would lock users out of certain features, like “age-restricted experiences,” unless they upload a face scan or a picture of their ID. The blowback was swift and loud, with calls to boycott Discord’s paid Nitro subscriptions and return to old-school website forums.</p>

 <p>Maybe that’s why Discord returned a day later to post a “<a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">novel</a>” that goes into more detail about its new age assurance rules. “Discord is not requiring everyone to complete a face scan or upload an ID to use Discord,” the company promised in a new addendum on February 10. “The vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today, without ever being asked to confirm their age.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hmm let me play the roll of Clippy and help you</p> <p>Your Age Inference model is already running and has much more then just Age predictions. <a href="https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI">https://t.co/oj7j81DjNI</a></p> <p>Not requiring everyone: because you are already using your AI to capture data and age predict Age, Sex, etc. Hence…</p> <p>— Rakunvar 👀P.R. for @StreamerHouse🏘️ (@Rakunvar) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rakunvar/status/2021320521011560775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>That’s because Discord’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7czEt1_Zeic">AI&nbsp;inference model</a> will be used to guess most users’ age. If it guesses a number that’s 18 or higher, you’re in the clear. If it doesn’t, you’ll have to give the company your sensitive data in order to get around the new teen safety protocols. But Discord is quick to stress that this doesn’t apply to most people because most people don’t ever access adult content on Discord.</p>

 <p>“You must be a confirmed adult to access age-restricted content and experiences such as age-restricted servers and channels or to modify certain safety settings,” the company <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">explains in a new FAQ</a>. “The majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content and will never go through a facial age estimation flow or ID verification. In the minority of cases where we cannot confirm you as an adult and you need to access age-restricted areas and settings, then you will be asked to go through additional steps.”</p>

 <h2>Archived servers and canceled Nitro subs</h2> <p>All of this “our big announcement wasn’t actually a big deal” energy came after an immediate user revolt that saw, among other things, Discord <a href="https://x.com/discord_support/status/2020863471550927243">repeatedly get community noted on X</a>. People didn’t like the idea that Discord is already constantly surveilling its users to <a href="https://x.com/Vuthakral/status/2020893257987748166">build an anonymous profile of you</a> that I’m sure it’s not hoping to further monetize <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-discord-union-rockstar-leaks-2000657761">once it reportedly launches its secret IPO</a>.</p> <p>It doesn’t help that all of this is coming after a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">pretty bad hack of a Discord vendor last year</a> that saw age verification materials, including photos of users’ faces, obtained by malicious actors. The company says it doesn’t keep this information tagged to your user data, but if you think there’s a safe way to digitally transmit your face and/or your government-issued ID to a company over the internet in 2026, then I have some <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">totally not killer AI robot assistants to sell you</a>.</p>

 <p>While the backlash has been noisy, it’s not clear how many people will actually shift away from Discord over the new rules, though some diehard users on the Discord subreddit already claim to be calling it quits. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/1r09lrn/bailing_and_i_want_to_archive_my_server_are_there/">One popular thread</a> had a server owner looking for help with archiving it before they leave the platform. Some users on social media, meanwhile, have been making <a href="https://twitter.com/KuroSekaiAnime/status/2020954657502515520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2020954657502515520%7Ctwgr%5Ee4437406b5c679e87bcd39b015eb003b843caf6c%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fdiscord-nitro-cancelled-age-verification%2F">public displays of canceling their paid memberships</a>, Discord’s main source of revenue.</p> <p>So far, non one seems to be biting on the company’s latest attempt to deescalate people’s fears. “If this isn’t reversed I will be cancelling my Nitro and all Boosts,” one user wrote on X. “I recommend everyone does the same.” Discord’s amended announcement, like the original, is already well on its way to getting ratio’d.</p>

      <p>Following in the commendable tradition of gargantuan charity bundles like <a href="https://aftermath.site/palestinian-relief-bundle-games-wandersong-short-hike/"><u>the Palestinian Relief Bundle</u></a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser/"><u>Play For Peace</u></a>, over 600 game developers have come together to assemble a <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota?ref=aftermath.site"><u>No ICE In Minnesota bundle</u></a>. Just one day after release, it has already smashed through its initial $100,000 goal.</p><p>“We created this bundle to raise funds for Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota in response to the Trump administration sending ICE agents to the Minneapolis area and the reckless murder of an innocent people by ICE agents,” wrote the bundle’s organizer, a tabletop charity content creator who goes by the handle <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jesthehuman.itch.io?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jes The Human</u></a> on the bundle’s itch.io page. “ILCM provides free immigration legal representation to low-income immigrants and refugees in Minnesota and North Dakota. They also work to educate the community about immigration matters and advocate for public policies which respect the universal human rights of immigrants.”</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k_JPei0YNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="No ICE in Minnesota Charity Bundle Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>The bundle includes 1,439 games for a minimum donation of $10, which is a steal so preposterous that you’ve gotta admire the audacity. Highlights include modern puzzling classic<em> Baba Is You</em>, fellow modern puzzling classic <em>A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</em>, cozy game by which all others are judged <em>A Short Hike</em>, internet detective adventure <em>Hypnospace Outlaw</em>, cat cafe sim <em>Calico</em>, and multiple gun-focused games from <em>Demonschool </em>studio Necrosoft. There are also <em>over 1,000</em> physical games – tabletop role-playing games and things of that nature – ensuring that you’ll never need to rack your brain to figure out something to do when your friends come over ever again.</p><p>The bundle will be available until March 13.&nbsp;</p><p>"ILCM provides services based on capacity and has a generally high demand for services," wrote Jes The Human.

If you like your board games a little less physical, and a little more not technically a board game any more if we're being honest but that's fine because it's a neat looking, strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now, then boooooy howdy do I have the game for you! Those familiar with the dungeon crawling tabletop game Descent will be interested to learn that it's getting a video game adaptation in the form of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent.
</p>
<p>
Before we press on, I'd just like to say that it's specifically Terrinoth with the all rights reserved symbol, <em>then</em> it says Heroes of Descent. That's silly! Don't do that! It makes your game name look weird. Anyway, this just so happens to be the first game adaptation of the modern classic board game, and it's sounding like a pretty tight experience overall.
</p>

<p>
For starters, there's eight different adventurers to choose from, which judging from the trailer includes some guys that can do magic, some gals that can slice 'n' dice or shoot a bow and arrow, a thiefy lookin' fellow, the usual kind of fantasy RPG type characters. Dungeon crawling is still the name of the game too, with apparently 20 dungeons to play through, all with different storylines, and characters that'll adapt to whichever adventurers make up your party.
</p><p>
I quite like that on the Steam page it highlights that the different missions you can complete in the main campaign can be beaten in one night, makes it feel like it's going for a "getting the gang together for DnD" kind of vibe. Which you can do! Because there's co-op for up to four people at once.
</p>
<p>
The combat is described as accessible, though that is more meant in terms of it being not annoyingly complex as opposed to having accessibility features. It's turn-based, with a big emphasis on positioning, elevation, line of sight, and timing, all that jazz. For those more familiar with the board game's story, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is also a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, but that'll probably mean more to those in the know than it does to me.
</p>
<p>
And there's even a demo you can try out right now, which is quite nifty as there's no release date other than sometime this year, so it'll give you something to mess around with until then. You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929630/Terrinoth_Heroes_of_Descent/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The patch notes for Overwatch’s Season 1 are here. Updates include general quality-of-life fixes, updates, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>recently announced that, with the launch of its next season, it would revert to the name “Overwatch” after several years as “Overwatch 2.” Along with these changes comes a story-focused mentality and a new Rise of Talon story arc.</p>



<p>The February 9 patch notes detail a new conquest event and some updates fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The conquest event will be a 5-week-long event. Players will choose their faction each week and can represent either Overwatch or Talon. After making their selection, there will be weekly faction challenges with their own rewards. Once the entire pass is unlocked, players can choose to switch factions and earn all of the faction-specific rewards on that side as well.</p>



<p>Learn more about the faction warfare and new Heroes added to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-to-be-renamed-overwatch-with-next-update/" id="174168">here</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-mode-update-clash-leaving-quick-play">Game Mode Update: Clash Leaving Quick Play</h2>



<p>In a game mode update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>announced that Clash has been removed from Quick Play. This also means removing Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis from the map selection. It is stated that the mode will remain in Stadium, and it may return to Quick Play in the future.</p>



<p>“We have some amazing new maps lined up for the next year, and our reworks will continue…and get bigger. Redesigns that completely change how certain areas of our maps play are coming soon.”</p>







<h2>More Information on the General Updates to Overwatch</h2>



<p>New updates also feature a revamped UI that focuses on your friends and favorite Heroes. Loot box updates include a selection of Cosmetics from Seasons 15 through 20. Also, players can now adjust the Field of View on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro consoles.</p>



<p>Much more is included in the official notes. Read the full patch notes <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/">here</a>.</p>

But it sounds like, rather than moving onto the fourth game, the end of the Kiwami series is here (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/no-more-yakuza-kiwami-games-after-kiwami-3-story-changes-new-series-could-happen">Push Square</a>!).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wCglSfda04">Ryusta TV livestream</a> broadcast earlier today, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama said that "I think 'Yakuza Kiwami 3' will be the last one, and the 'Kiwami line will come to an end." (translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1r17x0o/yokoyama_announced_kiwami_3_will_the_last_game_in/">u/Dastanovich on Reddit</a>.)</p><div><figure data-videoid="MWHW8NC1uMo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytMWHW8NC1uMo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8af228tlhrzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, that's far from the end of the Yakuza — after all, we need more Ichiban in our lives (especially on Switch 2) — and Yokoyama elaborates that "I don't think it'll continue as the 'Kiwami' series anymore. I think a different series will begin. And not something like 'Like a Dragon 9,' but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning."</p>
<p>This sort of sounds like new timeline stuff, but it also means that Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5, and Yakuza 6 will be skipping the remake treatment — presumably. But with Yakuza Kiwami 3 reportedly making some controversial cuts and changes to the game's story, there's perhaps too much friction between the Kiwami games and the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Yokoyama seems to suggest that's the case, as he says the decision to stop the Kiwami games "... might be something you'll understand once you play 'Yakuza Kiwami 3.'"</p>
<p>Reviews for the upcoming remake have been more on the mixed side than Yakuza is used to. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">We scored it a 6/10 on Switch 2</a>, for example, with our own Ollie Reynolds calling it "a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen."</p>
<p>So, what's next for Yakuza / Like A Dragon? A break? The next game? RGG <em>is</em> also working on a brand new IP, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stranger_than_heaven">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, and appears to be unrelated to RGG's premier franchise.</p>

I ranked it as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">best Switch 2 controller</a> you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller.</p><p>I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM7Z4D7D/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can get the black version for $41.99, and the blue and white version is $44.99.</p><p>I’d wager that most people aren’t willing to spend $89.99 on Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller. Even for those who have the cash to splash, the S10 proves to be just as comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. Aside from lacking the Switch 2 Pro’s 3.5mm headphone jack that’s used for private listening, this controller is functionally identical. My biggest issue with the S10 is that the Screenshot, GameChat, and Home button placement is cramped, leading to some accidental presses. But at this price, it’s easier to overlook a small design flaw.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/876544/easysmx-s10-switch-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[No, AI Written Romance Novels Are Not Inevitable]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ai-romance-novel-new-york-times/</link>
            <guid>1431643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/business/ai-claude-romance-books.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The New Fabio is Claude</u></a>,” the New York Times speaks to romance novel “authors” who claim that AI is the future of the genre. This is both obviously untrue, but also not at all what these two authors have demonstrated with their financial success from using AI.</p><p>The Times spoke to two authors who use AI to write entire books. One, who uses the pen name Coral Hart, says that by using prompting and Claude, she can generate an entire book in 45 minutes. Interestingly, she also sells courses about how to best use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. Hart has become an A.I. evangelist,” the article reads. “Through her author-coaching business, Plot Prose, she’s taught more than 1,600 people how to produce a novel with artificial intelligence, she said. She’s rolling out her proprietary A.I. writing program, which can generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.”</p><p>Out of curiosity, I checked out the Plot Prose website. The “script the draft” package on the homepage of Plot Prose promises it can deliver “your next novel 90% complete and fully packaged for publication,” saying you can skip the “hardest part” of writing, which is writing. She also offers “AI creation kits,” which are pre-packaged drafts and outlines that also include “AI-writer optimized scene beats for fast execution.”</p><p>Another so-called “author,” Elizabeth Anne West, says that eventually, readers won’t care if a book is written by AI. Coincidentally, West <em>also</em> sells courses on how to use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. West, who also teaches classes on how to write with A.I., has gotten blowback from opponents of the technology, including occasional death threats on social media,” the article says. “But she believes that in time, A.I. generated fiction will become widespread and popular.”</p><p>In between these two buried pieces of context–that both of these writers have an economic interest in the success of AI in the writing space because they sell courses on how to use AI to write books–this article only barely describes whether or not these books are any good or if readers like them. Another author who uses AI to write romance novels even admits that the technology is pretty bad at doing so.</p><p>“Whenever Ms. Rompoti’s curvy protagonist, an event planner named Sienna, was in a scene, the A.I. constantly referenced her weight, for example, noting that a chair groaned when she sat down,” the article reads. “‘When you make a point that someone is plus size, it will exaggerate, somebody is suddenly humongous,’ Rompoti said.”</p><p>Both Hart and West claim that their courses are popular—Hart makes the claim that even authors who are against AI in public sign up for her classes–but of course they would. They both run businesses that depend on the idea that romance novels are best written with AI. Except, curiously, West also says that the books that have a disclaimer about AI being used in the writing process don’t sell as well.</p><p>“If you hide that there’s A.I., it sells just fine,” she told the Times.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy/"><div><p>You Don’t Need AI To Write A Novel - Aftermath</p><p>AI isn’t a privilege issue, no matter what National Novel Writing Month says</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure><p>My response to this as a journalist and reader of the occasional romance novel is: of course she would say that. Of course she would say that “eventually, audiences won’t care.” Hart and West have a vested economic interest in this technology succeeding in the literary space. Hart claims she made six figures off of her AI-published romance novels, mostly because she uses AI to produce a manuscript in under an hour. She said that her 200 AI books garnered collectively 50,000 sales, meaning each book sold on average 250 copies. The only way this is a viable business model is if you don’t care if the books are good or if people like them.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, my friend and romance novel author Ella Dawson pointed out that the GoodReads presence for both Hart and West paints a sobering picture of how these books are received. Most of Coral Hart’s books on GoodReads<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/54945185.Coral_Hart?ref=aftermath.site"><u> are rated one or two stars</u></a>. West’s work seems better received, but I think it’s worth pointing out that it appears that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/5204939.Elizabeth_Ann_West?ref=aftermath.site"><u>every single piece of fiction she has published is fanfic about <em>Pride and Prejudice</em></u></a>, a work currently in the public domain, making her entire output dependent on the work of another author as a baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>“This reporter got snowed,” Dawson told me over text. “The New York Times has a bumpy track record when it comes to taking the romance genre seriously (a Fabio headline? In 2026? Seriously?) but I’m still baffled by their decision to profile these AI-reliant con artists masquerading as authors.”</p><p>For these AI evangelists featured in this article, finding a dedicated audience and reaching those readers through the quality of your work is not the goal. Writing for readers to “feel seen,” as Rompoti describes in the Times’ article, is immaterial. The goal is to make money using fiction. These people have already decided that the fiction they produce is not art—it is content, and the best way to make money through content is either to produce a lot of it, or sell a course on how to get rich fast by producing a lot of content.</p><p>Even according to the Times’ own reporting, readers do not seem to like AI romance novels. One of the two AI critical sources quoted in the article said that she would never knowingly pick up a book written by AI. Another, an author whose work had been scraped by Anthropic to train their AI model, pointed out that flooding the zone with slop makes it much harder for real human authors to be discovered by readers.&nbsp;</p><p>What I found most curious was Coral Hart’s reasoning for using a pseudonym in the article. Coral Hart is a retired pen name and the source would not give any of her current pen names “because she still uses her real name for some publishing and coaching projects. She fears that revealing her A.I. use would damage her business for that work.” Huh! That’s weird!</p><p>The lack of care paid to the actual readers of these AI books feels like a deliberate exclusion. The article describes romance readers as “voracious” and romance novels as “reliant on formula." Ergo, romance novels don’t have to be good, because romance readers will read any old shit as long as it has a Happily Ever After!</p><p>“Credulous reporting like this does nothing but prop up the lie that these ‘authors’ and AI companies desperately want us to believe: that the proliferation of AI across every industry is inevitable .It isn’t! I mean seriously, why would you ever take the word of a self-proclaimed coach who sells courses on using AI to create novels?” Dawson told me. “Readers are not ATMs, romance novels are not content to farm, and if you can’t write a book without firing up a plagiarism machine, you’re not meant to be an author.”</p><p>There’s not much daylight between what these two women do and what’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3xSJuoUnN8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>described in this Super Eyepatch Wolf video about “Influencer Courses” grifts</u></a>. Through the course of this video, the improbably named John Walsh actually takes some of the YouTube influencer courses only to discover that the people selling these courses don’t even have the YouTube numbers to back up the claims they make. One person selling a multihour lecture about how to be successful on YouTube only had 4,000 subscribers.</p><p>It’s the same model for these grifters. If you make the claim that you are successful—claims which the Times makes very little effort to confirm independently—then you can become a subject matter expert, and sell your expertise for a pretty penny. And the content itself can be complete bullshit that sucks and no one likes, because the content is merely an advertisement for the courses you sell. And those courses don’t have to be good, either! You can just charge $250 for bullshit!</p><p>To me, this is all evidence that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>AI is still a forced meme</u></a>. You don’t have to listen to the grifters who tell you that “eventually” everyone will be using this technology and that no one will mind if their books are written by AI. That eventuality is not a guarantee, and there is no real indication that it will ever arrive. Similarly, Christa Désir, vice president and editorial director of Bloom Books, says that AI books will become “undetectable at a certain point.” Handily, to make a prediction like this, you don’t have to provide any evidence to support your claim. You can just say shit, and the Times will print it.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><div><p>AI Is The Ultimate “Forced Meme”</p><p>There are few things in this world more insufferable than a rich person trying to force their shitty ideas on everyone else.
