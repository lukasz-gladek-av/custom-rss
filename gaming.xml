            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywalls-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;Activision and Treyarch are considering putting some of the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game's limited-time modes behind a paywall.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Ghost of Hope</a>, the next game (which, in a break from tradition, will apparently be&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>) will have more seasonal limited-time modes, but "the only way to play [them] will be to have the battle pass".</p>

<p>Right now, anyone can enjoy&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s seasonal limited-time modes regardless of whether they pick up the battle pass or not, but under these proposed changes, it seems you'd need to pay up for the privilege.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=hlW83aKO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=pmEKbaNH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s future crossovers could be behind paywalls.</figcaption></figure><p>The Ghost of Hope says that Activision and Treyarch, who will be developing the game, are "planning on taking the higher tier skins, loot, and crossover operators" obtained through limited-time game modes and "making them only accessible to battle pass owners".</p>

<p>According to Hope, purchasing any paid battle pass for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>will get you access to the limited-time game modes under the new system, although premium-tier Blackcell pass would probably get a little something extra.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game hasn't officially been unveiled yet, so this information should definitely be taken with a pinch of salt. Given Activision's eagerness to monetize <i>Call of Duty</i>, though, as well as its many high-profile crossovers, it wouldn't surprise me if limited-time event monetization is on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=0SDRRtbG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=YK5Emw0F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with a number of high-profile properties.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Call of Duty</em>'s major high-profile crossovers include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Squid Game</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-skins-coming-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-cod-modern-warfare-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, and while not all of the crossovers arrive with limited-time modes, many do, meaning these crossovers could end up behind paywalls in future.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Activision has in store for the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>to find out whether this leak is true or not. If the timing of<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">Black Ops 6</a></em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">'s announcement</a> is anything to go by, we can probably expect a reveal for the next game in the series in summer.</p>

Due to the film’s popularity, it will be re-released in IMAX from May 15th until May 21st, but until then, we have created a list of films and shows that you can watch if you still need a bit of a horror or southern gothic stories in your life. In this list, you will definitely find something to keep you entertained and maybe a little bit spooked!</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Sunday, May 4.</em></p></div></div><div><p>If you want more Black vampires, then Blacula might be the film for you. Dracula [Charles Macaulay] turns an African prince, Prince Mamuwalde [William Marshall], into a vampire and traps him in a coffin. But chaos ensues when Prince Mamuwalde wakes up two centuries later and winds up in 1970s LA.</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s first film “Get Out,” is a movie that will have you clutching at your pearls! Chris [Daniel Kaluuya] is an African-American man dating a white woman, Rose [Allison Williams]. Things start to take a spine-chilling turn when he goes to meet her creepy family for the first time.</p></div><div><p>This 2008 drama is not very Black, though the series had memorial black characters and is filled with Vampires. In this show, Vampires struggle for equal rights to live amongst non-vampires, while anti-vampire organizations grow in popularity. So, what happens when Sookie Stackhouse [Anna Paquin] falls in love with a 174-year-old vampire and has to deal with the difficulties of their relationship?</p></div><div><p>Interview With The Vampire is centered around the life of Louis de Pointe du Lac [Jacob Anderson] as he recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy [Eric Bogosian]. The show based on a popular book by Anne Rice  is spooky, sexy, and intense. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Octavia Butler novel, Kindred follows Dana [Mallori Johnson] who gets pulled back in time to a nineteenth-century plantation where she is summoned to save Rufus, [David Alexander Kaplan] the white son of the plantation owner. The series follows Dana as she tries to understand what is happening to her and why.</p></div><div><p>If you like the idea of horror mixed with religion then Midnight Mass might be what you’re looking for. After a charismatic young priest shakes up the life of an isolated community, frightening events begin to occur. This film will have you on the edge of your seat.</p></div><div><p>Based on the Stephen King novel, Salem’s Lot follows Ben Mears [Lewis Pullman] on his return to his childhood home as he looks for inspiration for his next book, but what he discovers is much spookier than he could’ve imagined.</p></div><div><p>On the run from the police, brothers Richard Gecko [Quentin Tarantino] and Seth Gecko [George Clooney] film themselves running into a gang of vampires who are out for blood!</p></div><div><p>In this spine-chilling series, a plague starts to spread across humanity that leaves people acting like vampires. Dr Ephraim Goodweather [Corey Stoll] is called to investigate what is happening and figure out how to stop it.</p></div><div><p>Eve [Jurnee Smollet] finds out that her perfect father is hiding illicit affairs. After growing increasingly frustrated with her father’s actions, Eve seeks out a voodoo curse to be set on her father. The film is very spiritual and heartbreaking as you watch the hardships of this Creole-American family.</p></div><div><p>According to an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coogler did with Proximity Media</a></span>, “The Thing” was one of the films that inspired the way Sinners was shot. Coogler even has a poster of the film in his office. This 80's sci-fi horror follows a group of researchers in Antarctica as they deal with an alien that takes on the form of its victims.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jennifer Svedberg-Yen responded to one of his Reddit posts asking for voice actors, and she was cast as a major character initially. But then she transitioned to serving as the lead writer for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Meanwhile, Broche plucked composer Lorien Testard from Bandcamp, even though the musician didn't have any background working on video games. "We have, I think, an amazing team mostly of junior people, but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented," said Broche.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, the rest is history, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out a couple of weeks ago and quickly sold 1 million copies</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horror-at-highrook-is-a-mysterious-card-based-investigation-game-and-also-there%E2%80%99s-a-cat.1181136/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/horror-at-highrook-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years I owned this huge illustrated Lovecraft book that I knew I should get rid of but which I struggled to finally take out to the curb: not from any attachment to the works themselves, but because the weight of the book made it perfect for pressing tofu. But I’m often curious about how works inspired by Lovecraft deal with questions of mythos and knowledge, which made recent indie card-based game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836860/The_Horror_at_Highrook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Horror At Highrook</em></a> intriguing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Horror At Highrook - Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drjG1Pj8HGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Highrook</em> is, thankfully, only Lovecraftian in the sense of having cosmic beings and groups devoted to them, but in my time with its first three chapters has had more of a Victorian horror vibe in the form of people going into a grand house they should totally not be going into. You play as four investigators hired to unravel the mysterious disappearance of the wealthy Ackeron family, and you quickly learn that what seemed like a domestic issue involves the occult. Each of your characters has skills specific to their role, and those skills align with certain rooms of the Highrook manor. Astor is a mechanic who can tinker with items in the machine room; scholar Vitali is suited for research tasks in study and archives; Atticus Hawk is fit for physical tasks in the courtyard and cliffs; and Doctor Caligar can craft potions in the laboratory. Characters also have skills that align with other rooms: I found Astor best suited to cooking meals in the kitchen, while Hawk was useful for exploring the manor’s cellar.&nbsp;</p><p>Each room of the manor has a slot for a task card–a mysterious box to open, a code to break, a book to read–and a slot for one person to do that task. You need a certain amount of points in the room’s skill to be successful; if your character doesn’t have the base attributes, you can bolster them with additional cards representing items you can find or craft. While the early game felt like it started a little slow, with a bit of waiting for the right items to boost my stats or move the plot to appear, in my later play I’ve found myself with plenty to do, multitasking around the investigation while juggling my characters’ light survival needs for food and sleep. <em>Highrook</em> has often taken on the feeling of a cooperative board game, even though it’s just me playing: Hawk searching for useful items, Caligar crafting potions to boost Astor’s stats so she can unlock a code to open a new room, Vitali researching mysterious tomes found in the last box Atticus dug up.&nbsp;</p><p>The game so far has been somewhat linear, with certain plot items appearing rather than me moving the story forward on my own. Many of those plot threads have involved finding enough pieces of an occult symbol to unlock the next story bit about what precisely Lord Ackeron was dealing with. The writing has been a little heavy-handed at times, but it’s teased a compelling picture of how Lord Ackeron’s occult obsession affected his family, who are more than just foils to his pursuits. Your investigators also have their own conflicts and motivations, and I’ve enjoyed the tension of deciding whether I should use my stat-boosting items on the main quest or on their side quests, eager to learn more about them.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The symbol you piece together. (Nullpointer Games)</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the big bads you’re pursuing, there are also smaller creepy beings around the mansion. In the early game there’s been a ghost that hops from room to room, raising the madness level of anyone it comes in contact with. I’ve had to fight beings unleashed from performing an arcane ritual in the chapel, matching the points in the room they appear to banish them back to the void. In my first encounter with these beings I found fighting them in the machine room my best bet, and I’d hurry to move my character cards from other rooms they appeared in to avoid their negative effects. Besting them unlocked items I could use to level up my investigors, making them more than just a nuisance. There’s also been a cat who wanders the grounds, sometimes taking up a character card slot and forcing me to wait to do a room’s task until he decides to move, just like a real cat.</p><p>As you can imagine, your board in <em>Highrook</em> quickly becomes cluttered with cards, though the game provides storage space where you can organize your items. Information isn’t always quite as clear as I’d like–I sometimes had to click through piles of cards to remember which one I needed, or cycle through my investigators to remember all their skills–but overall the game does its best to tame its chaos, and I always knew how to find the information I needed. The game also keeps your characters’ meters for hunger, fatigue, health and sanity clearly displayed, so when I was suddenly informed that a character was exhausted and had to be sent to the guest room and its sleep-inducing item to recover, I knew it was my own time management that had caused the situation rather than the game not warning me what I was headed for.</p><p>I’ve quickly been sucked into <em>Highrook</em>’s story and world, and I’ve found its linearity to be a good offset to the potential overwhelm of tasks and cards. I have tons of rooms of the manor left to unlock, and I’m excited to play more.

						<h5>Revenge of the Savage Planet</h5><p><span>May 8, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4</span>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>If you've been following Raccoon Logic in anticipation of Revenge of the Savage Planet coming out, then you're probably already aware of the journey the studio has been through to get here.</p>
<p>Founded in Montreal in 2017 as an independent team under the name Typhoon Studios and acquired two years later by Google, Typhoon would end up being hit by the collateral damage caused by Google not knowing what to do with Stadia. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia was shuttered</a>, Typhoon went with it.</p>
<p>And, as we've seen before in video games, it didn't matter that their first game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, was a hit. At least, it didn't matter to Google. Typhoon Studios quickly became <a href="https://wccftech.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-dev-reforms-raccoon-logic-sequel/">Raccoon Logic</a>, and years after those events, it feels like the team didn't lose a step in all of it. More than that, it feels like Raccoon Logic picked up an edge with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.05-00.34.07.10.png"></a></figure>

<p>The studio's ordeal with Google heavily influenced the tone of this sequel, which takes every opportunity to poke fun at corporate culture and the machinations of giant corporations. Right off the top of the game, when you land on an unknown planet, an enthused new employee of Alta Interglobal, the giant conglomerate that acquired your previous employer, Kindred Technologies, you learn that you're actually an enthused former employee of Alta Interglobal.</p>
<p>You and every other Kindred Aerospace employee were laid off while you were on your way to a planet in some backwater corner of space. You're stranded and are forced to make do with the bits of technology and everything else that Alta left behind. The message is not lost in the science-fiction of it all when Alta directly tells you that you, and the rest of the technology you have at your disposal, were left behind because it was too costly to send a ship out to get you.</p>
<p>And that's just how the game starts. As it evolves, Raccoon Logic doesn't pull any punches, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is a better game for it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.57.38.91.png"></a></figure>

<p>The absurdist commercials for products that are most certainly killing their customers or the ads for the galaxy's biggest influencer, Shama Lama Ding-Dong and his Ding-Dong Academy, which is 'guaranteed' to make you the next biggest influencer alive, all hit the right notes for me. I appreciated how Raccoon Logic walked the line in these ads and within the messages from Alta, or any other corporate caricatures, between hyperbole and something you'd believe could happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>Which is great, because the story didn't connect with me beyond that. The jokes were great, and the commentary felt sharp, but it didn't feel like it had anything behind it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-13.28.24.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>There wasn't a strong emotional core to hold it all together or give it any punch, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Revenge of the Savage Planet is more about its satire and providing a solid gameplay experience. It's successful at that, for the most part. Its early hours are, however, annoyingly tedious in a way that I know would have turned me off the game entirely if I hadn't been playing this for a review.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.03-20.25.41.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>If there's any advice I can give someone looking to jump into Revenge of the Savage Planet, it would be to do your best to golden-path your way through the game until you've acquired a few key upgrades. After that, the whole gameplay experience opens up in a much more engaging way, but before that, it still feels annoying to gain some momentum on a quest and in the story, shallow as it is, only for it to grind to a halt because you need to get a different upgrade.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm completely against the Metroid structure of needing to come back to an area when you have the right equipment. When that kind of game pacing works, it works because there's a period halfway through the game where I know I'm not fully kitted out, but I feel like I can take on the game's toughest challenges. Where I've found a satisfying flow to the gameplay, and have moved past the underpowered underdog feeling that the game opens with.</p>
<p>That middle ground doesn't really exist in Revenge of the Savage Planet. I felt underpowered for the majority of the game, and it wasn't until nearing one of the game's three endings that I started to feel like I had solid options for how I could approach a situation, whether that's combat, exploration, or platforming. It's unfortunate that the pacing and often tedious tasks you're asked to complete to progress dampen the experience right up to the end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.21.25.93.png"></a></figure>

<p>Where it Revenge of the Savage Planet shines, is in the level design across the four core planets you'll visit, the creature designs, the animations, the audio work with each fire of your blaster and the soundscape of every new biome on each of the planets you'll stomp across, and the visual design of each planet. The boss fights are also solid spectacles that were welcome breaks in the gameplay to change things up for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The platforming challenges and environmental puzzles were also quite enjoyable, even if the floaty-jumping of the former took some getting used to. The combat wasn't anything to write home about, but by the time you're able to take advantage of the environmental systems at play on each planet, leaning into those systems can allow you to create a lot of your own fun. If you try to use your blaster for every situation, not only will it not work most of the time, but you'll bore yourself away from playing Revenge of the Savage Planet ever again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-11.54.13.36.png"></a></figure>

<p>It's every whimsical step you take and every oddball animation you see that keep you from quitting out of Revenge of the Savage Planet, and make you want to keep searching for the next upgrade. The game survives on its charm and satire, and on the gameplay still feeling good, after you put in the time to get the necessary upgrades.</p>
<p>Speaking of upgrades, I did not expect Revenge of the Savage Planet to have me very seriously thinking the whole way through that I should upgrade my PC sooner than I planned. Even at medium settings, and Racoon Logic's recommended GPU, an RTX 2060, I never went very long without some kind of framerate hitch, or full freezes for a second or longer. My PC isn't anything special, it's a very modest build, but I still have had better experiences with modern games than with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.11.10.17.png"></a></figure>

<p>I also consistently ran into UI bugs, where I had to close and re-open the journal and map because they stopped working. I even ran into an issue where the surprise launch addition of the Dave the Diver outfit was entirely missing when I loaded into the game. It took two restarts for it to reappear, which, again, isn't the biggest issue in the world. But it was yet another technical issue on top of the constant technical issues that plagued my entire time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<p>It's not unplayable by any stretch, or at least it's not in this state, so even if the day-one patch can't solve all these issues, you won't be jumping into an entirely broken game. Just be aware that there's still a few touch-ups that the game clearly needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</p>

<p>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking.</p>

		<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is going to be release on September 5th, Marvelous has announced alongside a new trailer. The new trailer has been released to show off the combat mechanics that will be present in Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion, including how to exploit weaknesses and the different types of weapons that can be equipped.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Combat Basics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QNs0jh_Z5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Arsenal’s in Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion can equipped up to six pieces of equipment including a shoulder mounted weapon, an auxiliary, a left weapon, a right weapon, and two side weapons. The weapon types are medium range rifles, blades for close quarter combat, bazookas for long range attacks that can do high damage, bows that can target weak points, and for groups of enemies you can use missiles and railguns. Auxiliary’s are used as support items to help in battle, and the gameplay has been designed to allow switching between weapons with ease.</p>
<p>Before engaging in a battle, players can scan enemies to find their weaknesses. For example, enemies that have have a hard exterior are more susceptible to laser damage while soft exterior enemies have a weakness to physical weapons. When in combat, players can use knockdown and grab attacks to tear off armour to expose weak areas.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Daemon X Machina review, Miguel said,<em> “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</em></p>

<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is going to be release on September 5th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is suing accessory maker Genki over the latter's "Glitch 2" Switch 2 accessory range, alleging trademark infringement and false advertising under federal and California state law.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Post</a>, Nintendo's lawsuit, which was filed last week, claims Genki used Nintendo's "Switch" and "Joy-Con" trademarks in order to make it seem as though the accessory company's products were approved by Nintendo.</p>

<p>This, according to Nintendo's lawsuit, included the demonstration of what Genki claimed to be accurate Switch 2 mockups at the CES 2025 trade show, which took place prior to the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">official announcement in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=nIE3RlrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=_blZoz9b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genki is currently advertising accessories for the "Glitch 2", and I'm sure you know what they're really intended for.</figcaption></figure><p>In the lawsuit, Nintendo goes on to say that Genki's semi-April Fools' Day joke, which saw it holding a suspiciously Nintendo Direct-style showcase in which it revealed a range of accessories for the so-called "Glitch 2", was an "obvious reference" to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant says that Genki's claims of compatibility on "day one" for the Glitch 2 range was misleading and illegal, because Nintendo hadn't provided Genki with a Switch 2 prior to release.</p>

<p>This means the accessory maker either wasn't in "possession of a genuine console" and thus couldn't make claims of compatibility "in good faith", or said console (or information pertaining to its specs) was "unlawfully or illicitly obtained".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says Genki's use of its trademarks would make it likely consumers would "falsely perceive a connection, association, sponsorship, or affiliation" between the two companies where no such partnership exists.</p>




<p>As for what Nintendo wants from the lawsuit, it's asking the court to put a stop to Genki selling Switch 2-related accessories. In The Game Post's words, it wants Genki to "destroy any products or ads that use Nintendo trademarks", as well as handing over profits related to Switch 2 accessory sales.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6s-delay-just-affected-the-entire-video-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto fans, there is some good news and some bad news. The good news is finally, after all these years, we have an actual day-and-date release time for GTA 6. The bad news? It’s around six months later than the ‘Fall 2025’ we were originally told. To many in the video game industry, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">new date of May 26, 2026</a> is a welcome sigh of relief – dozens of publishers and developers of all sizes were fearful of meticulously planning their release campaigns  only to later discover they’d be releasing in the same month as this herculean title. However, there are many undated heavy-hitters due to land next year that will now be frantically searching for a new date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s clear is that Grand Theft Auto 6 has found itself touted as the lynchpin to the video game industry’s near future – any news on the project’s development has a huge ripple effect. So how does a six-month delay reflect a significant change in Rockstar’s corporate culture, call into question this year’s console market revenue, and potentially affect the Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, the video game industry’s total revenue hit $184.3 billion, a 0.2% increase from 2023. Contradicting analyst <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictions </a>of a slight downturn, it prompted a sigh of relief for video game manufacturers and publishers. However, in the console space, revenue dropped by 1% – and we’re already seeing the consequences. A downturn of console hardware sales combined with a heightening technology tariff war has forced prices up for both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday">Microsoft </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-ps5-is-getting-more-expensive-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand-again">Sony</a>. This generation needs a definitive console-shifting title – it needs Grand Theft Auto 6. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Research groups estimate the crime sequel to make $1 billion off pre-orders alone and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">$3.2 billion in its first year of launch</a>. It took Grand Theft Auto 5 three days to make $1 billion, could it take Grand Theft Auto 6 just 24 hours? Circana analyst Mat Piscatella believes that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-game-spending-down-2-is-circana-analysts-most-optimistic-outlook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“there’s probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry,”</a> because the game’s impact will help define our understanding of the video game industry’s potential growth over the next decade. There are rumors that it could be the first-ever $100 video game, making it a new watershed moment for the industry. That new benchmark could give the industry the shot-in-the-arm growth many analysts say it needs. However, it’s also possible Grand Theft Auto 6 is simply too much of a monolithic outlier to create progress outside of itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2018, Rockstar Games had a publicity crisis on its hands. Reports of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/15/rockstar-exec-clarifies-statement-about-red-dead-redemption-2s-several-100-hour-weeks">100 hour weeks</a> alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/in-wake-of-red-dead-2-crunch-discussion-rockstar-office-now-explicitly-told-overtime-is-optional">formerly mandatory overtime</a> whilst developing Red Dead Redemption 2, plus former and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/18/rockstar-grants-permission-for-developers-to-talk-about-working-conditions">current employees</a> speaking on intense crunch periods stemming from Grand Theft Auto 4, painted a stark picture of one of gaming’s titans. Since then, the company has reportedly undergone an internal reinvention of sorts – according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a>, contractors being converted to full-time employees and a ‘flexitime’ policy enabling workers to take time off for every hour of overtime worked are just two of the many more compassionate policies enacted. Earlier this year, Rockstar’s old reputation threatened to rear its head as staff were made to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developers-criticise-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-force-staff-back-to-the-office">return to the office five days a week</a> to close out Grand Theft Auto 6’s development – a move which makes the reason behind the delay pretty clear. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier confirmed as much on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueSky</a>, explaining that his own Rockstar sources said that there’s “Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch.” Rockstar can’t properly deliver a game that will change the video gaming world if it slips back into old habits; while the delay is disappointing to those playing, it’s undeniably a huge relief to those developing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This generation needs a definitive console-shifting title – it needs Grand Theft Auto 6. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a publisher, releasing your game at the same time as Grand Theft Auto 6 is akin to throwing a bucket of water into a tsunami. Discussing the formerly scheduled ‘Fall 2025’ release window, a report by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> highlighted how such a nebulous date was affecting publishers worldwide. One studio boss called Rockstar’s game “a huge meteor and we’ll just have to stay clear of the blast zone,” while another questioned “if we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” (An unsurprisingly predictive worry). We even have the likes of EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">implicitly commenting</a> on the game’s looming shadow in the context of the new Battlefield, citing “some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, huge releases don’t always overshadow those around them. Despite launching at the same time as Bethesda’s Oblivion remake, Kepler Interactive’s original RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">sold over one million copies in just three days</a>, with senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan even joking that it was the video game industry’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week">Barbenheimer moment</a>. It’s hard to believe such a moment can exist for Grand Theft Auto 6, of course, and so it goes unsaid that such a quirky idea will not be part of any publisher’s campaign plans. Don’t expect a Grand Theft Fable moment in 2026.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/05/screenshot-2023-12-05-134403-1701813164554.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, it’s unclear to what extent the new May 26, 2026 release date will shake up the plans of other publishers and developers. There are still many heavy-hitter titles that are undated including the likes of Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, EA’s new Battlefield title, Mass Effect spiritual successor Exodus and more. There will certainly be some developers now scrambling to change their internal release date plans, but the wider public will be none the wiser. However, this flag planting by Rockstar no doubt means that developers and publishers will feel more confident in announcing their release plans to the world. But they might want to hold on a minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems very unlikely that this will be the final date for Grand Theft Auto 6 for two reasons. Both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">subject to two date delays</a>, with the first delay being to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/22/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-spring-2018">second quarter of the next year</a>, followed by a second delay to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/01/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-october">third quarter of that same year</a>. Right now, Grand Theft Auto 6 is replicating that exact same timeline, delayed from Fall 2025 to May 2026, so one more delay to October/November 2026 seems a reasonably educated prediction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That October/November window seems even more likely when you consider the potential for both Microsoft and Sony to create a new console bundle including the crime sequel, which will surely shoot up sales around the holiday period. Sony sold 6.4 million PlayStation 4s during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/ps4s-sales-dominance-slackens-slightly-in-holiday-quarter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October - December 2014</a>, more than double the consoles they sold between April and September of that year. Of course there would have been the classic Christmas boost, but what else happened in that time frame? Grand Theft Auto 5 released on PS4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rockstar only has one shot to get this right – what’s six more months after 13 years?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What could be the bigger surprise, though , is that Nintendo may be one of the parties most affected by this delay. Recently, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-on-switch-2-publisher-pledges-support-says-era-when-nintendo-was-just-for-kids-is-over" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pledged full support for the Switch 2</a>, leading fans to speculate about if Grand Theft Auto 6 may also be eyeing a Switch 2 launch. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy’s Definitive Edition saw a surprise launch onto the Nintendo Switch, so there’s precedent for an adult franchise on a typically family-friendly console. Many believed the Switch technology wasn’t powerful enough to run a game like Grand Theft Auto, however last year modders released a video showing off an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modders-use-leaked-source-code-to-get-gta-5-running-on-switch">in-progress port of GTA 5 running on Switch</a> using the game’s leaked source code. While it does seem unlikely that Nintendo would have factored Grand Theft Auto 6 into the Switch’s first-year success, there’s a clear, strong relationship between publisher Take-Two and Nintendo that shouldn’t be ignored. When looking at the console market as part of the overall video game industry, Nintendo is still a huge part of that no matter how much of an island they may seem. The Nintendo Switch was still host to an array of generation-defining games including The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Metal Gear Solid, Crysis and more. And with Cyberpunk 2077 arriving on Switch 2 at launch, complete with its current gen-only Phantom Liberty expansion, we shouldn’t ignore the potential for “miracle” ports. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s clear is that there is a hell of a lot riding on Grand Theft Auto 6. Many different head honchos of the video game industry, from studio heads to chief analysts, believe that this generation-defining game will be the one to break the industry’s growth stagnation. It’s hard to deny the global feverish demand and anticipation for a game that has effectively been in the works for over a decade. There are impossibly high expectations on the teams at Rockstar Games to deliver something that not only single-handedly restores the video game industry back to its pre-pandemic growth, but also presents an entirely new kind of video game experience that will become the new benchmark for developers and publishers moving forward. Rockstar only has one shot to get this right – what’s six more months after 13 years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">over the weekend</a>, Warhorse said that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a rather impressive three million <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-moved-forward" rel="nofollow">in three months</a>, thanking players for "making history" with the studio.</p>

<p>The figure means that sales of the game have slowed down a little since its meteoric beginnings;&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>managed to surpass a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">in its first day on release</a>, going on to break the two million barrier <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">in under two weeks</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=3tJMmDVY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m-combat.jpg?itok=WsDrtQ9j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is selling pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>Even so, three million sales is a pretty impressive figure for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>places a heavy emphasis on realism rather than traditional RPG fantasy elements, so the fact it's managed to find an audience this wide is no mean feat.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's the sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">the 2018 original</a>. Much like its predecessor, the game is a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and it follows the blacksmith's son Henry of Skalitz as he navigates a web of political and historical intrigue.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>boasts a world twice the size of the original game, and it's also got a script that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">runs to a formidable two million words</a>, according to Warhorse Studios.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch - Virtual Game Card Update Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Eurogamer report has discovered a workaround that will allow two Switch systems to play the same game, though without online play, via a new Online Licenses option in the console settings. For this to work, when a Virtual Game Card is sent from one Switch to another, the Online Licenses options must be activated on both consoles. Then:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">The Switch console that received the Virtual Game Card must play the game offline</li><li dir="ltr">This will allow the Switch console that sent the Game Card to play the same game, as the console doesn't recognize offline play, and therefore will not be able to "see" the Virtual Game Card in use by the console that received it.</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Multiple online forums, including ResetEra and Reddit, have voiced displeasure with the change, with one <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1kb76rm/the_ability_to_play_the_same_game_at_the_same/mps8q1p/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit user noting</a> that this will now force families with multiple Switch systems to buy a copy of a game for each Switch in order to continue playing online. "With two kids, game sharing saved us a lot of money, given that each digital game was effectively two copies," user Synkhe writes. "This update doubles our cost on all games going forward."</p><p>Nintendo has also announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-game-sharing-for-all-switch-consoles/1100-6530545/">GameShare feature</a> that will be available with the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. However, this feature will only be available for certain games, and it will only work when each Switch console is connected to the same local network.</p>

			<p>At CES 2025, video game accessories manufacturer Genki surprised everyone by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-full-unit-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showing off a mock-up replica of the Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> well ahead of the official announcement. It didn't take long for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">notoriously litigious company</a> to explore legal steps, which have now been officially filed in the United States, in the Central District of California. You can read the whole filing <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but these are some of the accusations levied by Nintendo:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Genki’s claims of compatibility would be impossible to guarantee without unauthorized, illegal early access to the Nintendo Switch 2. Thus, Genki has misled and is misleading the public as to its ability to guarantee the compatibility of its products with the Nintendo Switch 2.</em></li>
<li><em>Additionally or alternatively, Genki in fact illegally and/or illicitly gained access to a pre-release model of the Nintendo Switch 2, rendering its statements otherwise objectively false.</em></li>
<li><em>Defendant’s infringing use of Nintendo’s trademarks in its advertising is in direct competition with Nintendo’s and its licensee’s legitimate marketing of Nintendo’s new console and authorized accessories. </em></li>
<li><em>Nintendo has not authorized Defendant to use its marks, including the NINTENDO SWITCH Marks, in connection with Defendant’s business or products. </em></li>
<li><em>Defendant had prior knowledge of Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks before using those marks in connection with its marketing and accessories.</em></li>
<li><em>Defendant intentionally reproduced Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks on its fabricated mock-up of Nintendo’s next-generation console in order to simulate Plaintiff’s well-known brand and exploit and appropriate for itself the public goodwill associated with Plaintiff’s NINTENDO SWITCH Marks.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Genki, which is currently <a href="https://www.genkithings.com/collections/ns2-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking pre-orders for its Nintendo Switch 2 accessories</a>, publicly shared the following response <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via X</a>:</p>
<p><em>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</em></p>
<p><em>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</em></p>
<p><em>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week. </em><em>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will launch in exactly one month. You can read everything we know about it <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our roundup article</a>.</p>

			<p>There is something wonderfully unhinged and peculiar about the world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/moroi">Moroi</a>. Inspired by Romanian folklore, there’s a story and setting that feels original and unexpected, but the same can’t be said of the gameplay itself. The exploration and combat of this top-down hack ‘n’ slasher are solid and dependable, but not groundbreaking in a way to live up to the rest of the Moroi’s presentation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moroi - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AMjRymEJz18?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narratively, Moroi is deliberately obscure and vague – even after completing the game with what I assume is the default ending I was left with far more questions than answers. This is not a criticism, as the weirdness and defamiliarisation is absolutely core to the experience. I haven’t had a chance to try a replay and look for the secrets that I guess will lead to a better ending sequence, but I’m hoping that it reaches a wide enough audience that this process will be helped along by forum discussions and guides. The broad story is that you wake up in a prison cell and must find your way through the world of the Cosmic Engine to recover your memories and find out what led to your incarceration.</p>


<p>Aesthetically, Moroi succeeds in offering up a grotesque and nightmarish vision of a world gone awry. Character models and enemies have an uncanny, almost claymation look and feel whilst everything is covered in oozing slime and blood. There are some distinct areas with their own style and sense of place as you progress and many of the NPCs you meet stand out as some of the weirdest this side of a Zeno Clash game. Whether it’s an imprisoned cannibal who decides to go out by eating his own flesh or a clownish villain who bursts out of a tortured corpse and slides around like a manic slug, almost every character is unique.</p>


<p>Exploration takes place in a top-down action RPG style, with many environmental puzzles blocking your path. These often follow familiar patterns – find a lever, the clues for a coded door etc. but none are taxing enough to become frustrating. The exception was a late game area that sees you following the orders of a powerful Djinn who insists that you find something within a strict time limit but the location appears to be an empty circle of rooms. Once I figured out the trick this was relatively simple to complete but there perhaps needed to be some clearer signposting here.</p>
<p>Combat is the core of much of the game, with regular battles, arena fights and some disgusting bosses. You begin your journey unarmed, but as you work through the world you’ll find an assortment of melee and ranged weapons. Despite the ostensibly medieval setting your first ranged weapon is not a crossbow but instead a minigun. This is powerful but overheats quickly so must be used tactically. Later weapons are just as out of place but also fun to wield. Your starting sword is relatively puny, though this can be powered up by using the teeth you are given by a talking duck – did I mention this game was weird?</p>

<p>Boss fights are memorable, but not always for the right reasons as there are some frustrating difficulty spikes on the standard setting. Some of these were due to having to learn the patterns and attacks but other times I seemed to take very little damage for no obvious reason compared to previous attempts. The same is true for some overly long arena battles and both of these are exacerbated by the combat not feeling that great. This wouldn’t be such a problem if it wasn’t such a core component of the game but sometimes it felt like I was enduring the combat just to get to the next character interaction.</p>
<p>There are various secrets and written pieces of lore scattered throughout the game and I found probably around 75% of these in my playthrough of just under 6 hours. The replayability mostly comes from the different endings that are hinted at by the achievement list and I do want to revisit Moroi to find out whether these hidden endings provide more answers.</p>

			<p>The first Oblivion Remastered 4K texture pack is now available for download, introducing high-quality upscaled textures that significantly improve the vanilla ones.</p>
<p>The Unchained Texture packs, which have been created by Canarious and are available for download from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/2189?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, are part of a work-in-progress project that aims to feature every texture in the game upscaled to at least 4K with a base resolution of 1024 and lower. The current version of the project features AI-upscaled textures for equipment items such as weapons, armor, and clothing, and should be followed by upscaled textures for landscapes, vegetation, and buildings. You can check some of these upscaled textures before downloading in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Like many other titles, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered features some low-resolution textures, but they in no way diminish the excellent job Virtuos did in updating the classic game's visuals, bringing them to new heights. You can learn more about how the remaster manages to update the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda while remaining extremely faithful to the original in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Enhancing the original where it mattered most while preserving what made it truly unique, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered stands as the definitive way to experience Bethesda’s classic. Although the shift in atmosphere and noticeable performance issues will put some players off, as will the dated gameplay, the game couldn't have debuted on current gaming platforms in a better way.</em></p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-4-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Red flares, strung-up corpses, and a little bit of A-ha. </h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 4.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Last of Us season 2 hits its midway point with its strongest episode so far. It adapts one of the most memorable sections of the game – Seattle Day One – and so that means we get Ellie and Dina checking out Downtown before moving onto the Channel 13 TV studio and escaping the WLF through the subway tunnels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are five key sequences from the original game that are adapted for this episode. Here we’ve compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Downtown</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/05/music-shop-1746427277512.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie and Dina arrive in Downtown Seattle shortly after this episode begins. This section of the game was open by design, and so allowed you to look around several different buildings. We get just two of them in the show; Weston’s Pharmacy and Valiant Music Shop. The pharmacy gets only a couple of minutes of screentime but it does feature an adaptation of The Last of Us’ key gameplay mechanic: opening drawers and looking for junk. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valiant Music Shop, meanwhile, gets more love. The show’s set has windows adorned with music-themed vinyl decorations, just as it does in the game. On the ground floor is the same red drumkit, and Dina plays around with them just as she does in the game. It’s upstairs where the main event happens, though, when Ellie discovers a guitar in an overgrown room. Bella Ramsey’s performance of A-ha’s Take On Me is very similar to that seen in the game, with a talk-y vocal style and slow melody.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Forward Base</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/05/torture-1746427300083.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Episode 4 introduces us to the leader of the WLF, Isaac Dixon. This sequence is adapted from much later in the game’s sequence of events, when you play as Abby rather than Ellie, although due to the game’s overlapping dual timeline structure it seems likely that this sequence takes place at the “correct” time in the show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Abby’s half of the game, we see her visit the WLF’s forward operating base. There she meets Isaac, who is briefly seen conducting a torturous interrogation on a member of the Seraphites. In the show, we see a version of this scene play out in its entirety. Similar to the game, the WLF’s captured Seraphite has been stripped completely naked, but the show sees them tortured in a kitchen rather than a bathroom. Isaac’s brutal methods of torture were only implied in the game, but in the show we see him actively injuring his prisoner in an attempt to learn more about the Seraphites’ plans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Channel 13 </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/05/tv-studio-1746427317253.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Ellie and Dina’s trip to the Channel 13 TV studio was naturally going to be the central event of this episode. In the game this is the sequence when the duo are first confronted with the murder cult-like methods of the Seraphites, as well as marking their first move towards finding where Abby is. The show recreates the key elements of the TV studio in grisy detail; WLF soldiers are strung up above the studio floor, and the Seraphites’ symbol is drawn on the wall in blood just as it is in the game. Ellie’s investigation of the area is interrupted by members of the WLF who, as in the game, are horrified to see what has become of their comrades. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The escape from the TV studio is shown to be a little more frantic than it is in the game, and the stormy weather adds even further drama to the scene, but in general the set design and pathway Ellie and Dina take feels authentic to the game, even if it’s not a one-to-one recreation. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Tunnels</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/05/subway-tunnels-1746427334489.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">One of The Last of Us Part 2’s most exhilarating sequences is Ellie and Dina’s journey through the Seattle subway tunnels. Bathed in red light and infested by clickers, it’s a genuinely terrifying level. Unsurprisingly, HBO went to lengths to capture the striking visuals here, with the abandoned subway cars eerily lit by the WLF’s red flares and searching flashlights. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are key differences between the game and the show's version of events, though. This is very much a survival horror sequence in the game, with just a small but incredibly deadly collection of infected to avoid. The show, meanwhile, makes this more action packed – rather than have the infected lurk around the subway cars, they arrive as a charging, clawing horde. This makes the sequence much more action-oriented, with Ellie and Dina scrambling to get away rather than sneaking through the tunnels. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are changes made to the sequence’s climax, too. In the game, Ellie gets trapped in the turnstile and Dina saves her by shooting an attacking clicker in the head. In the show, both Ellie and Dina get trapped in the turnstile, and Ellie allows herself to be bitten by the attacking clicker to protect Dina. It’s this bite that results in Ellie revealing her immunity to Dina. In the game, that reveal comes a few minutes prior, when Ellie’s gas mask is shattered by an attacking runner. Because spores are not a concern in the show (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-three-reasons-spores-need-to-return">at least for now</a>), the characters do not wear masks and thus this turn of events couldn’t be used. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">I’m Pregnant </h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/05/pregnant-1746427356476.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The last scene of this week’s episode recreates the culminating part of the game’s Seattle Day 1: Dina reveals to Ellie that she’s pregnant. In both versions, Dina shares the news at the Pinnacle Theater, which the duo has made their home base. In the game, it’s a subdued and anguished moment, with Dina looking notably stressed by the idea. The show’s take is quite different, as the reveal pretty much instantly turns into an impassioned kiss between Ellie and Dina. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-4-review-secrets">spoiler-filled review of the fourth episode</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-breaks-3-million-sold-previous-game-surpassed-10-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Kingdom Come Deliverance developer Warhorse Studios <a href="https://x.com/WarhorseStudios/status/1918999047735857429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two important sales milestones for the franchise. To begin with, the sequel that launched around three months ago has sold over three million units to date. It had previously become <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sells-1-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a million seller in just a single day</a>, while the two million milestone <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was reached after two weeks</a>. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is definitely selling a lot faster than its predecessor, which only reached three million sales over two years after its debut.</p>
<p>It's not too surprising, anyway, given that it had established a strong fanbase with the original and it received excellent reviews, including a perfect score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here on Wccftech</a> by Chris Wray:</p>
<p><em>I would genuinely argue that this could be judged as a benchmark on how to do an open world, and even though I'm over fifty hours in, there's more I want to do and see. There are side quests to complete, easter eggs to hunt, wenches to fornicate with, and bandits to kill. I didn't want to write this review now, not in the slightest; I wanted just one more day to give even more context, and I know I would have wanted just one more day after that.</em></p>
<p><em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>
<p>Lots of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still on the way, too, with three premium DLCs coming in Summer, Fall, and Winter.</p>
<p>But the original game is also still selling reasonably well. Last we heard, it had reached 8 million units sold <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just six months ago</a>, and it has now broken through the 10 million sales milestone. Of course, it's heavily discounted at this point, but it's still an impressive figure for a game that began as an indie title funded on Kickstarter.</p>

          <p>New episodes of season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>&nbsp;are premiering on HBO every Sunday night, and Ars' Kyle Orland (who's played the games) and Andrew Cunningham (who hasn't)&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/series/hbos-the-last-of-us-season-two/">will be talking about them here after they air</a>. While these recaps don't delve into every single plot point of the episode, there are obviously&nbsp;<strong>heavy spoilers</strong>&nbsp;contained within, so go watch the episode first if you want to go in fresh.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: We start this episode from the perspective of a band of highly armed FEDRA agents in 2018 Seattle, shooting the shit in a transport that somehow still has usable gasoline. Maybe it's just the political moment we're in, but I was not quite emotionally prepared for these militarized characters in my post-apocalyptic escape show to start casually using "voters" as an ironic signifier for regular people.</p>
<p>"LOL, like we'd ever let them vote, amirite?"</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: We've spent so little time with FEDRA—the post-collapse remnant of what had once been the US government—since the very opening episodes of the show that you can forget exactly why nearly every other individual and organization in the show's world hates it and wants nothing to do with it. But here's a reminder for us: casual cruelty, performed by ignorant fascists.</p>
<p>Of course as soon as you see and hear Jeffrey Wright, you know he's going to be A Guy (he's an HBO alum from <em>Boardwalk Empire</em> and <em>Westworld</em>, among many, many other film, TV, vocal, and stage performances). He just as casually betrays and blows up the transport full of jumped-up FEDRA jarheads, which is a clear prestige TV storytelling signifier. Here is a Man With A Code, but also a Man To Be Feared.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yeah, Isaac's backstory was only broadly hinted at in the games, so getting to see this big "Who This Character Is" moment in the show was pretty effective.</p>
<p>What I found less effective was Ellie playing a very able A-Ha cover when she discovers the abandoned guitar room. In the game it serves as a welcome change of pace from a lot of frenetic action, and a good excuse for an endearing guitar-playing mini-game. Here it felt like it just kind of dragged on, with a lot of awkward dwelling on close-ups of Dina's creepily enamored face.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: You know what, though, I do appreciate that the show at least made an effort to explain why this 30-year-old guitar was still in pristine condition. I don't <em>instantly</em> buy that the silica gel packets (which Ellie, wisely, does not eat) in the guitar case would have lasted for that long, but at least she didn't pull a mossy guitar straight off the wall and start tuning it up. Those strings are gonna corrode! That neck is gonna warp!</p>
<p>I do also think the show (and the game, I guess, picking up your context clues) got away with picking one of the goofiest songs they possibly could that would still read as "soulful and emotionally resonant" when played solo on acoustic guitar. But I suppose that's always been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c745E7T_Wvg">the power of that particular instrument</a>.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Both the game and the show have leaned heavily on the '80s nostalgia that Joel passed on to Ellie, and as a child of the '80s, I'll be damned if I said it doesn't work on me on that level.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's also, for what it's worth, exactly what a beginner-to-intermediate guitar player is going to know how to do. If I find a guitar during an apocalypse, all people are going to be able to get out of me are mid-2000s radio singles with easy chord progressions. It's too bad that society didn't last long enough in this reality to produce "Boulevard of Broken Dreams."</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Not to cut short "Guitar Talk," but the show cuts it off with a creepy scene of Isaac talking about high-end cookware to an initially unseen companion on the floor. The resulting scene of torture is, for my money, way worse than most anything we're exposed to in the games—and these are games that are not exactly squeamish about showing scenes of torture and extreme violence!</p>
<p>Felt to me like they're taking advantage of HBO's reputation for graphic content just because they could, here...</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: Definitely gratuitous! But not totally without storytelling utility. I do think, if you're setting Isaac up to be a mid-season miniboss on the road to the Dramatic Confrontation with Abby, that you've got to make it especially clear that he is capable of really nasty things. Sure, killing a truckful of guys is ALSO bad, but they were guys that we as viewers are all supposed to hate. Torturing a defenseless man reinforces the perception of him as someone that Ellie and Dina do <em>not</em> want to meet, especially now that they've popped a couple of his guys.</p>
<p>Because Ellie and Dina have unwittingly wandered into the middle of a Seattle civil war of sorts, between Isaac and his militarized WLF members and the face-cutting cultists we briefly met in the middle of last episode. And while the WLF types do seem to have the cult outgunned, we are told here that WLF members are slowly defecting to the cult (rather than the other way around).</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: I will say I appreciated the surprisingly cogent history of the "chicken and egg games" beef between the two factions, as discussed between torturer and torture victim. Definitely a memorable bit of world-building.</p>
<p>But then we're quickly back to the kind of infected attack scene that now seems practically contractually obligated to happen at least once an episode. At this point, I think these kinds of massive setpiece zombie battles would work better as a light seasoning than a thick sauce that just gets dumped on us almost every week.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: People in and from Seattle seem to have a unique gift for kicking up otherwise dormant swarms of infected! I know we'll get back to it eventually, but I was more intrigued by the first episode's reveal of more strategic infected that seemed to be retaining more of their human traits than I am by these screaming mindless hordes. Here, I think the tension is also ratcheted up artificially by Ellie's weird escape strategy, which is to lead the two of them through a series of dead ends and cul-de-sacs before finally, barely, getting away.</p>
<p>But like you said, gotta have zombies on the zombie show! And it does finally make the "Dina finds out that Ellie is immune" shoe drop, though Dina doesn't seem ready to think through any of the other implications of that reveal just yet. She has her own stuff going on!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Yes, I've had to resist my inclination to do the remote equivalent of nudging you in the ribs to see if you had picked up on the potential "morning sickness" explanation of Dina's frequent vomiting (which was hidden decently amid the "vomiting because of seeing horrifying gore" explanation).</p>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It does explain a couple of things! It does seem like a bit of a narrative shortcut to make Ellie extremely invested in Dina and whether she lives or dies, and given this show I am worried that this zygote is only going to be used to create more trauma for Ellie, rather than giving us a nuanced look at parenting during an apocalypse. But it is sweet to see how enthusiastically and immediately Ellie gets invested.</p>
<p>A question for you, while spoiling as little as you can: Are we still mostly just adapting the game at this point? You'd mentioned getting more Isaac backstory (sometimes the show expands on backstories well and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/hbos-the-last-of-us-episode-8-ruins-one-of-the-games-best-villains/">sometimes it doesn't</a>), and some things have happened a bit out of order. But my impression is that we haven't gotten a full departure a la the Nick Offerman episode from last season yet.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: At this point it's kind of like a jazz riff on what happens in the game, with some bits copied note for note, some remixed and thrown into entirely different temporal locations, and some fresh new improv thrown in for good measure.</p>
<p>I'm definitely not a "the game is canon and you must interpret it literally" type of person, but the loose treatment is giving me a bit of whiplash. The reveal of Dina's pregnancy, for instance, is not greeted with nearly as much immediate joy in the games. That said, the moment of joy Ellie and Dina <em>do</em> share here feels transplanted (in tone if nothing else) from an earlier game scene that the show had mostly skipped thus far. It's like free association, man. Dig it!</p>
<p>The show also spends an inordinate amount of time discussing how pregnancy tests work in the post-apocalypse, which for me pushed past world-building and into overexplaining. It's OK to just let stuff be sometimes, y'know?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Andrew</strong>: It's jazz, man. It's about the zombies you <em>don't</em> kill.</p>
<p>However it's been rearranged, I can still tell I'm watching a video game adaptation, because there are stealth kills and because important information is conveyed via messages and logos scrawled in blood on the walls. But I am still enjoying myself, and doing <em>slightly</em> less minute-to-minute missing of Joel than I did last episode. Slightly.</p>
<p>The episode ends with Ellie and Dina hearing the name of someone who has the same name as someone who knew Abby over a WLF walkie-talkie they nabbed, which gives them their next objective marker for Abby Quest. But they've got to cross an active war zone to get where they're going (though I couldn't tell from that distance whether we're meant to be able to tell exactly who is fighting who at the moment). Guess I'll have to wait and see!</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Personally, I'm hoping we see the moment where the newly out-and-proud bisexual Dina finally realizes "what's the deal with all the rainbows." Show your post-apocalyptic pride, girl!</p>

I’ve been pretty harsh toward the show’s second season for fundamentally misunderstanding so many of the bold creative decisions of the game on which it’s based. This week’s episode, however, was the best—or at least the least frustrating—one yet. We’re firmly in Seattle for Ellie’s revenge tour, and while she doesn’t quite get to any of her targets this week, we do get plenty of time to see her and Dina be cute and gay together, as well as an explosive intro to one of the best characters in the show, and some new details about the war between the Seraphites and the W.L.F.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ll still have critiques to get into, but overall I enjoyed Ellie’s first day in the Emerald City.

This episode opens with a flashback to 2018, roughly 15 years after the outbreak begins in the show’s timeline. A FEDRA squad is riding through the Seattle quarantine zone, sharing jolly stories about their time enforcing the will of the fascist military organization. Peck’s unnamed soldier is the focus of the scene until someone asks why FEDRA calls citizens “voters,” then the real star of the scene makes himself known: Isaac (Jeffrey Wright).</p><p>In the corner of the car, Isaac has been mostly quiet through all the hooting and hollering. But then he gives them a history lesson. He explains that the “voter” pejorative comes from FEDRA’s fascist rise, in which the military took away citizens’ right to vote, and started using the term to mock people’s newfound powerlessness under their regime. Peck’s character, clearly unsettled by Isaac’s interruption, says he “didn’t mean anything by it.” To which the sergeant replies that of course he didn’t, because he’s “thoughtless.”</p><p>As the truck moves along the Seattle streets, it comes across a blockade. The FEDRA squad prepares their guns, but Isaac insists that he’ll go out and talk to the approaching civilians alone. As he exits the truck, he tells the FEDRA soldier who inquired about the “voters” to come along with him, saying he might “learn something” from the interaction. And what transpires is certainly instructive, though Isaac’s conversation with the civilians’ leader ends up being pretty short. After verify each other’s identities, Isaac lets out a sigh and casually tosses two grenades into the back of the FEDRA truck. He guns down the driver and then nonchalantly shakes the civilian leader’s hand as she says, “Welcome to the fight.” He looks at the FEDRA rookie and tells him to make his choice.</p><figure id="" data-id="e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-recommend-id="image://e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-recommend-id="image://e50b0e9a59d65f99b816c805fda5c36a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac wears a set of FEDRA armor." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Isaac is far and away one of the best parts of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season, and not just because they got Wright to reprise the role from <em>Part II</em>. In the game, he got remarkably little screen time for as much impact as he has on the events of Seattle, and the show makes great use of him with new scenes illuminating his role as the Washington Liberation Front’s top dog. From this scene alone, I was immediately drawn in by Wright’s unsettling but charismatic performance and genuinely could not wait to see how the show would make the most of our extra time with him.</p><h2 id="h807962"><a id=""></a><strong>“I’ll be comin’ for your love, okay”</strong></h2><p>Back in the present day, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Dina (Isabela Merced) are scavenging the remains of Seattle for supplies. The pharmacy they’re looking through doesn’t have much, but it does have one thing that catches Dina’s eye. She grabs a box off one of the shelves and shouts to Ellie that she’s gonna take a quick pee break. Considering her sudden stomach issues last episode, you can probably see where this is going.</p><p>When Dina reunites with Ellie and their horse Shimmer, Ellie senses something is off and asks if she’s alright. Without missing a beat, Dina says everything’s good and reminds her they need to get moving. They’ve got “people to kill.”</p><p>As the two ride around, they note that Seattle is surprisingly well-preserved for a city that was bombed at some point during the outbreak. They also note there are a lot of “rainbows” around this part of the city. Ellie theorizes the Pride flags—for which she has no context—were a sign of optimism within the city before the infection tore it asunder. This moment has an equivalent in<em> Part II</em> in which Ellie and Dina enter a queer bookstore and note the rainbow flags and gay literature, but don’t know what any of it is. I still find this to be one of the most compelling examples of<em> The Last of Us </em>acknowledging that culture is just as much a casualty of the apocalypse as people are, as these two queer girls are standing in a place which, at one time, would have likely held some significance to them, but no one ever taught them what a Pride flag was in a quarantine zone.</p><figure id="" data-id="001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-recommend-id="image://001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-recommend-id="image://001decacf5b0fd891d43c4136423f864" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina looks lovingly at Ellie off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Any notion that the rainbows were indications that Seattle was a happy place immediately goes away when the pair turns a corner and finds the aftermath of a FEDRA battle. The bodies that are decaying on the street have been here for a long time, and the aftermath tells Ellie that FEDRA might have been dealing with infighting in the city. As she looks inside a molded-over tank, she finds burnt bodies and says it’s like the Apollo 1 disaster, as she gets to flex her astronaut knowledge. “At least they died for something worthwhile,” Dina says. Ellie agrees and says these FEDRA corpses are just “assholes killed by other assholes.”</p><p>Dina then notes W.L.F. graffiti on a TV station a ways out, which Ellie nearly starts booking it toward before Dina points out that barreling on horseback to an uphill station in the middle of the day is an easy way to get themselves killed. The show does a good job of illustrating the contrasts between Ellie’s blind rage and Dina’s more considered approach. Ellie would probably have gotten herself killed on the way here if not for Dina’s thinking. Now, if only she could apply all that consideration to her love life.</p><p>The two take Shimmer and hide out in an abandoned record store. Ellie looks through some of the old selections, from Bob Marley to Tears for Fears. Most of the instruments in the store have been destroyed by the elements, but Ellie finds an acoustic guitar remarkably preserved in its case. It just needs a little tuning. Then she starts singing an acoustic rendition of A-ha’s “Take On Me,” now iconic from its use in the game. Dina hears it from downstairs and heads up, then urges Ellie to keep playing. Just like Ashley Johnson’s rendition in <em>Part II</em>, Ramsey’s performance is understated, and Ellie doesn’t come off as a vocal powerhouse or anything. But it’s incredibly earnest, and you can see Dina falling in love with her as she performs it. She says her skills with the gee-tar are from all the lessons Joel gave her over the past few years.</p><h2 id="h807963"><a id=""></a><strong>Fake wars about real ones</strong></h2><p>Well, now that we’ve had a healthy helping of cute gay shit, it’s time to go back to The Horrors. We see a slightly older Isaac cooking in a kitchen and telling someone off-screen that when he would try to impress women in his younger years, he’d cook for them. He wanted better tools, though, and dreamed of owning fancy Mauviel cookware to make the most of his culinary talents. He finally achieved that dream of having Mauviel at his fingertips here in Seattle, though what he’s using them for in this scene is quite different from what he probably imagined all those years ago. We finally pan over to see who it is Isaac’s been regaling with romance advice, and it’s a chained-up, naked, bloody Seraphite. Or “Scar,” as the W.L.F. call them. In the back and forth, we learn that the Seraphites follow a prophet, but there seems to be some disagreements within the cult about whether she was just a person or a Christ-like figure capable of miraculous feats. Isaac’s not interested in debating this, however. All he wants to know is where the Seraphites will attack next. When the man refuses to answer, Isaac tells him to put out his hand before he presses the hot Mauviel frying pan against his skin.</p><figure id="" data-id="1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-recommend-id="image://1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-recommend-id="image://1ef1f73d637cc24f98f2f7ee86b75aa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Isaac looks at something off-screen in a kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Annoyingly enough, the <em>Last of Us</em> show does what it does best and ensures that we know this is bad. Outside of Isaac’s torture chamber, we see one W.L.F. lackey say to another, “This is so fucked!” only to be told to shut up because Isaac knows what he’s doing. You know, in case you didn’t realize that torturing people with scalding hot cookware is not very cash money. Isaac is a bad guy, just so we’re clear. Are we all on the same page now? Do we all understand that, as compelling as Wright is on screen, he’s playing a bad dude? Great. Mission fucking accomplished, <em>Last of Us</em> show.</p><p>These asides, in which <em>The Last of Us </em>clarifies what you’re supposed to feel, are somehow more frustrating when the episode was doing a great job of just letting characters talk to each other like they don’t know a camera is in the room. Isaac’s introduction is a no-nonsense character moment that tells you everything you need to know about him through his actions, and his gleeful, torturous monologue puts Abby’s ridiculously overwrought one from episode two to shame. But then we get to see this nameless dude be like, “Hey, are we the baddies?” instead of letting the audience figure that out themselves. Just cut that shit out. (They won’t. It’s going to get so much worse.)</p><p>After Isaac removes the pan from his prisoner’s skin, the Seraphite prays to the prophet, asking her to “fill [his] soul.” Isaac asks if the prophet was “filling his soul” when he shot a W.L.F. child. The two then go back and forth about where all this violence between the two factions began, and it becomes clear that this has been going on for so long that these two can’t even pinpoint who started the fight in the first place. The Seraphite says that the W.L.F. will lose this war either way. Isaac isn’t convinced, given the cult is using archaic weaponry against their heavily militarized militia. But the cultist doesn’t believe that this war will be won by force; he believes that eventually the wolves will see their prophet’s light. When it becomes clear that his conviction can withstand another round with the scalding hot frying pan, Isaac pulls out a handgun and kills the cultist. We then get another cutaway to the W.L.F. lackeys, in which one dude is uncomfortable with what’s transpired while the other is hardened to the violence because Scars are “animals.”</p><p>In a vacuum, the Seraphite and W.L.F. conflict is meant to serve as a large-scale reflection of the cycle of violence Ellie and Abby are caught in. Isaac and the Seraphite can’t even pin down when this whole war started, and they’re both so devoted to their cause that it doesn’t matter anymore. This is the tit-for-tat these two women are inflicting on one another, on a scale that goes far beyond dead dads and sad daughters. But beyond its use as a thematic mirror reflecting the inevitable self-destruction that comes from the cycle of violence the protagonists are engaged in, the Seraphite/W.L.F. war is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://time.com/7275781/the-last-of-us-controversy-israel-gaza/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://time.com/7275781/the-last-of-us-controversy-israel-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">inspired by the ongoing real-world conflict between Palestine and Israel</a></span>. And there’s no escaping the fact that <em>Part II</em>’s vision of its two warring factions is mostly centrist in a way that points fingers at both sides, suggesting both are equally misguided in continuing their pointless war with each other, rather than presenting a situation in which one faction is struggling for survival and the right of freedom and self-determination against an infinitely more powerful oppressor. And as the general public has become more aware of what’s happening in Palestine in the years since <em>Part II </em>released, it’s become impossible to reconcile the game’s, and now the show’s, fictional war, which we’re meant to believe both sides are equally complicit in perpetuating, with the real-world conflict that inspired it.</p><p>In the case of Ellie and Abby, the “both sides” framing is a kindness that the narrative extends to its two leads. It meets both women where they are, acknowledges how they got to places of such violent retribution, and frames them both as victims and perpetrators worthy of sympathy in this cycle of violence their fathers started. When it comes to entire factions of people being swept up in a war, sanding down all the people within them into the arms of fanatical forces who can’t even tell you when this war began, the “both sides” framing loses nuance. Given the real-world inspiration, it’s naive and irresponsible at best, and could be condemned as straight-up propaganda at worst. It may not be explicitly pro-Israel, but fence-sitting is still making a choice. What are we meant to take away from a story inspired by a real-world event, but so divorced from the reality that it doesn’t actually say anything about it?</p><h2 id="h807964"><a id=""></a><strong>Now, kiss!</strong></h2><p>Back to Dina and Ellie’s big gay murder party. As the pair makes a game plan for infiltrating the TV station, they make a pact that they’ll kill any wolves, even if they weren’t part of Abby’s crew. But as luck would have it, they won’t have to, because the wolves in the station have already been taken out by Seraphites. Their bodies have been strung up and gutted, and one look at the carnage sends Dina’s stomach churning. Ellie verifies that none of these are members of Abby’s crew, and realizes that the group they saw slaughtered in the woods was responsible for this violent display. Dina finds a working walkie-talkie on one of the corpses that they might be able to use to intercept W.L.F. comms, but unfortunately it was also used to call for backup, which arrives fully armed. Dina and Ellie hide, but overhear the wolves giving a kill-on-sight order for whoever’s left in the station, so it’s time to skedaddle.</p><p>Ellie manages to make it to the upper floors, but the windows are locked and there’s seemingly no way out. Just when it seems like she’s been cornered by a pair of wolves, Dina comes in with the save, shooting the window which they promptly jump through, though they’re not out of the woods yet. As they run away from the station, they crawl into the public transit tunnels, but they’ll have more than wolves to deal with in the subway.</p><p>As the wolves throw out flares and fan out to find our little lovebirds, we hear the distant screeching of infected. The W.L.F. squad didn’t expect to see any infected in the Seattle subway, much less an entire horde, and though this situation puts Ellie and Dina in danger as well, they try to use it to their advantage. The two take shelter in one of the subway cars, only to find it littered with bodies they have to crawl over. The infected trample over each other in their mindless fervor, giving the girls a chance to escape through the emergency exit hatch. With the horde on their heels, Dina and Ellie push through a rusted revolving gate. Ellie makes it to the other side, but the gate gets stuck as Dina’s trying to push through. If she were here with anyone else, Dina might have met her end right here as an infected darts towards her with teeth at the ready, but Ellie puts her arm through the grate and lets the infected take a big ol’ bite out of her so Dina can fire one good shot into its stomach. As the two try to collect themselves, Dina can’t help but stare at the bloody bite mark next to Ellie’s tattoo. Even though the two are still running away from wolves and infected, Dina is more focused on the fact that she’ll probably have to kill her best friend before the end of the night.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-recommend-id="image://cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-recommend-id="image://cdb2890f9b07df2fc04077a9e2b961a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dina aims a gun at Ellie, who has her hands raised on the other side of a theater lobby." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s here that Ellie and Dina find what becomes their base of operations in Seattle: an old theater. Ellie is so fixated on finding shelter and barring the door that she doesn’t even notice Dina keeping her distance until she finally pulls out her gun. She’s distraught that Ellie seemingly sacrificed herself for her and asks her not to make this any harder than it has to be. Ellie says that she would die for her friend, but that isn’t what happened here. She finally has to give up the facade and tell Dina that she’s immune to the cordyceps infection. That sounds like nonsense to Dina, but she’s already hesitating, so she’s open to delaying the inevitable as long as possible. Ellie suggests that she sleep on the other side of the room while Dina keeps her gun trained on her, and if she doesn’t turn, she’ll know she’s telling the truth. This reveal was something the show was always going to have to handle differently than the game because of the changes it made to how the infection spreads. HBO’s version of the cordyceps isn’t spread in the air through spores, and Ellie’s immunity was revealed without any room for doubt in the games because she was able to breathe in the fumes without it affecting her respiratory system. Here, the show has to work within the lines it drew for itself so that it wouldn’t have to cover Pedro Pascal’s face with a gas mask half the time, and I was really pleased with how it took this chance to illustrate how Dina cares for Ellie, even when that care takes the form of hesitating to do what she’s been trained to do for her entire life.</p><p>Morning comes, and of course Ellie doesn’t turn. She’s completely asymptomatic, but Dina hesitates to put her gun down until Ellie shows her that the bite isn’t showing any signs of infection. Dina slowly walks over to Ellie and, rather than say another word about the post-apocalyptic miracle happening before her eyes, she drops another bomb: “I’m pregnant.”</p><p>All of these feelings collide, and Dina, with no intoxication to explain it away, kisses Ellie and then the two have at it on the theater lobby floor. There’s been some understandable concern around the cadence of Dina and Ellie’s relationship in the show, given that Dina has gone back to Jesse (Young Mazino) in the time since Joel’s death, seemingly to make sense of the pregnancy storyline given the show’s elongated stretch of time between the inciting incident and Ellie’s departure from Seattle. It does color Dina and Ellie’s extracurricular activities here differently, as it paints Dina as a far messier bisexual woman figuring her shit out. It works in the show’s favor in some cases, giving us the catharsis of the two finally doing the deed after four episodes of will they/won’t they tension, but I wouldn’t blame anyone who wasn’t thrilled that Dina’s new arc ends up playing into some shitty stereotypes around bisexual people as cheaters, and moves her away from the confident, self-assured queer woman she was in the game. If nothing else, we did get all the important pieces of <em>Part II</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IN0mtmC7s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03IN0mtmC7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weed scene</a></span> over the course of a few episodes, but once someone pointed out that the “rate our kiss” scene from last week’s episode no longer passes the Bechdel Test, it was hard not to feel like something special had been lost in translation.</p><p>This feeling that we might have lost the plot only grew with the pillow talk scene that came after. As the two wake up and make out a little more, Dina inspects the bite wound, then asks about the first time she was bitten. The original bite mark that started it all is barely visible anymore because Ellie burned it off, ostensibly so she could wear short sleeves again. I had always imagined that Ellie’s self-inflicted burn also came from a place of not wanting the painful reminder of the cure she didn’t get to be, so I’ll chalk her explanation here up to flirty banter. But then shit gets serious, Ellie asks why this is finally happening now. Dina explains that seeing someone get bit in this world puts things in perspective, and if you have a second chance to say or do something, you’d be a fool not to take it. She also apologizes for taking so long and reveals that she knew Ellie had feelings for her, but says she was unsure of herself after her mother flatly said “no, you like boys” when Dina was questioning at a young age. Even after her death, it took until now for Dina to shake off her mother’s dismissive words.</p><p>This is where the<em> Last of Us </em>show’s take on homophobia differs from that of the games. In <em>Part II</em>, Seth’s bigotry is treated as an obvious fringe case by everyone around him. It’s an uncomfortable relic of a time before that no one even considers until they’re face-to-face with it. We’re trying to survive in an apocalypse where mushroom-faced monsters use echolocation to hunt humans down, and you’re worried about who’s swapping spit with someone of the same gender? It is so trivial and petty that everyone around him is like, “What the hell is this guy doing?” and his beliefs aren’t given any credence because they’re so obviously archaic. Why would you put any energy into being this brand of shitty in the post-apocalypse?</p><p>Jackson’s relative normalcy and small-town America feel might have made people like Seth more comfortable in going back to their old ways. It’s a status quo that Maria, as the town’s leader, is clearly willing to uphold for the sake of keeping the peace. But in general, the <em>Last of Us</em> games haven’t held up queerphobia as a prevailing belief in a post-cordyceps world. At least, not the boring, old school “Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve” shit that Seth touts (the Seraphites are a conversation for another day). He felt like the smallest man who ever lived because everyone saw how ridiculous it was that he would harass two young women for kissing in the middle of a dance floor.</p><p>The show’s approach, however, is different, as evidenced by the reveal that, in this continuity, Dina was actively told to suppress all her gay thoughts by her mother, even amid the outbreak. It implies that such thinking isn’t merely some bullshit Seth dragged with him through the decades since the pandemic began, and there will be another example of this to talk about down the line as well.</p><p>In the games, Dina and Ellie not knowing what a Pride flag implied a collective loss of culture for everyone in a post-cordyceps world. Jackson is, as best as we can tell, a settlement with a broad shared culture mostly lacking in the kind of distinct elements and signifiers that members of certain subgroups once would have known and clung to before society fell apart, elements seemingly lost in the collapse or left behind in evacuations and trips from one safe haven to another. That tragic loss of culture and history seemed to apply to everyone equally. But now, as the show weaves prejudice into the post-apocalypse, the loss of queer culture feels like a more targeted one. I had long assumed Ellie knew fuck all about queer history because a FEDRA military school wasn’t about to teach anyone anything that didn’t have to do with survival or killing Fireflies. Hell, she doesn’t even know what Halloween is in <em>Left Behind</em>. But in the show, the continued presence of homophobia has larger ramifications for the worldbuilding that I don’t know if Mazin and company thought through. Yes, it’s well-meaning, and queer kids in the real world are still facing the shit Dina’s mother said to her as a child. But in trying to replicate a real-world queer experience, <em>The Last of Us </em>may have inadvertently undone one of the more compelling and quietly devastating anthropological phenomena of its post-apocalyptic world.</p><figure id="" data-id="6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-recommend-id="image://6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-recommend-id="image://6bcb9af48e5a8283334bafcb03b344ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Dina look at something off-screen in the distance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After all the heavy shit, Ellie asks how Dina knows for sure she’s pregnant, and she says that after barfing at the bloody Seraphite aftermath, her period being late, and peeing on four pregnancy tests, she’s pretty sure there’s a bun in the oven. Despite her doubts, Ellie seems pretty on board with a three-person co-parenting situation between the two of them and Jesse, which contrasts greatly with how this revelation nearly caused a rift between Dina and Ellie in the games. She even says, “I’m gonna be a dad,” which I’m sure will just thrill anyone who already viewed this storyline as an example of heteronormative nuclear family dynamics in the game. I don’t count myself among them, to be clear. The joys and stresses of having children shouldn’t be exclusive to breeders who make them, and queer parents have every right to child support checks, too.</p><p>The tender moment is interrupted by radio chatter and explosions. The wolves on the other side of the walkie-talkie mention that Nora (Tati Gabrielle) is at the Lakehill Hospital and will likely know where Abby is. The girls head to the roof to get a better lay of the land and figure out where to go, but Ellie asks Dina to consider staying behind because things are different now that there’s another life on the line. Dina hesitates, but agrees and holds Ellie’s hand as the two reaffirm that they’re in this together. They’ve come this far; time to get a taste of the revenge Ellie’s been craving. But will she bite off more than she can chew?

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Earlier this year, accessory maker Genki showed off a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed mockup</a> it said was based on the Nintendo Switch 2’s official dimensions just days before the console’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/23872810/nintendo-switch-2-next-generation-console-features-trailer">first official reveal</a>. The company has since started offering Switch 2 accessories that it says will be compatible with the system at launch. Now, Nintendo is suing the company, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/">reports <em>The Game Post</em></a>.</p><p>Filed May 2nd, <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.1.0.pdf">Nintendo’s complaint</a> alleges that Genki is guilty of five counts of “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising,” and that its actions violated multiple laws, including the Trademark Act of 1946. It claims that Genki’s use of Nintendo’s trademarks is confusing to buyers, who are “likely to impute any shortcomings, defects, or lack of quality in Genki’s products to Nintendo” itself.</p><p>Nintendo’s lawyers write that although Genki has promoted its products as compatible with the Switch 2 at launch, it has been inconsistent about whether their designs are truly based on unofficial access to the console itself. Nevertheless, they claim customers will probably think the products are Nintendo-authorized, and that Genki is “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Nintendo asks that the court require Genki to stop selling products marketed with Nintendo’s trademarks, and for compensation for any damages Nintendo sustained from the the alleged offenses, and more.</p><div><p>Genki addresses the lawsuit in a statement <a href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231">posted to X</a>, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-began-working-on-switch-2-shortly-after-the-release-of-switch-1-new-genki-lawsuit-papers-reveal"><em>Eurogamer</em> spotted</a>:</p></div><div><blockquote><p>You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us. We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.</p><p>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.</p><p>While we can’t comment in detail, we’re continuing preparations to fulfill orders and showcase our newest products at PAX East this week.</p><p>We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers. —Team Genki</p></blockquote></div><p>Genki isn’t the only company that unveiled accessories for the Switch 2 before Nintendo officially revealed it. Dbrand announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/13/24320659/nintendo-switch-2-dbrand-killswitch">Switch 2 case</a> in December, and before that, smaller accessory makers announced things like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">screen protectors</a>. These sorts of early accessory announcements aren’t unusual in the world of smartphones, where case makers turn to leaked specifications to make risky bets <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23892671/iphone-15-pro-action-button-case-maker-problems">that don’t always pan out</a>. But for Nintendo, Genki at least seems to have crossed a line that it simply isn’t willing to tolerate.</p><p>Nintendo did not immediately respond to <em>The Verge</em>’s request for comment.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
