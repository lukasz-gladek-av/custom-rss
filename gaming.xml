            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, as part of a flurry of showcases <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">announced to start 2026,</a> the studio hosted a <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-roadmap-housing-blizzcon-2026/"><strong>World of Warcraft: State of Azeroth</strong> showcase</a>, which dug into the roadmap the company has for the long-running MMORPG in 2026. Following that showcase, in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/five-things-i-learned-from-my-world">The Game Business</a>, game director <strong>Ion Hazzikostas</strong> and executive producer and vice president <strong>Holly Longdale</strong> went further into what they envision for the future of World of Warcraft, and the <strong>"<em>bigger vision</em>"</strong> they have for the franchise.</p>



<p>It's clear that Blizzard has a lot coming for World of Warcraft. The game's next major expansion, World of Warcraft: Midnight, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-officially-launching-march-2-2026/">is due to arrive on <strong>March 2, 2026</strong></a>, with several major additions coming to the game in the expansion. It'll be the game's eleventh expansion since it launched in 2004 and completely changed the landscape of the video game industry forever. Even after all those years of massive success, over 20 years later, Blizzard is looking to the future for Warcraft's best days.</p>



<p>"<em>We firmly believe <strong>that our best years are ahead of us</strong>,</em>" said game director Ion Hazzikostas. "<em>It's game design, but it's also social design, and it's thinking about how we meet a new generation where they are. That's going to mean thinking outside the box in some places compared to what our game has traditionally been. But <strong>we're excited to keep taking big swings</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>That could also potentially include new games within the Warcraft universe that aren't an MMORPG. With <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/">BlizzCon 2026</a></strong> arriving in September, and Blizzard promising it'll be "<em>one for the ages</em>," we could really start to see the Warcraft IP branch out. A new <strong>RTS</strong> is one possible avenue, but the reality is, with how expansive the Warcraft universe is, Blizzard could really take the franchise in any direction it feels fits within the world, and offers something new to its audience.</p>



<p>The drive for Blizzard to expand and do more with Warcraft comes in part from the fact that the game is now, in 2026, <strong>22 years old</strong>. It's old enough to drink in the US, and that means there are people who started playing it in their early to middle age who lived a whole life and are now retired, still choosing to spend their time in Azeroth. At the same time, there are young people getting into the game for the first time today, and Blizzard has to find a way to satisfy the game's whole audience.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We've got a lot of players that say to us, 'Give me something I can play with my kids, or play with my partner,'"</em> added Holly Longdale. "<em>We have so many players and the ability to really dig into how they play, it's given us a lot of interesting opportunities to be able to broaden </em>out.<em> We are <strong>aiming to be a game that's approachable for anyone</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Breadth is really the key</em>," continued Hazzikostas. "<em>It's less about change in the sense of moving away from something and becoming something different, and more about being broader and more approachable in our offerings and meeting people where they are</em>.<em> We already do have retired folks playing World of Warcraft, and a generation of young students who may have all the time in the world. 20 years ago, there was a sense that, for a lot of people, the game might be something that appealed to them, but they don't have the time for it, because it might be all-consuming</em>.<em> That is not what we are anymore. It's not what we've been for a long time. But we still have that depth for those who want it. If you only have 20 minutes to play, you can accomplish something. But if you have an entire weekend or a vacation, and you want to go deep, that's there as well.</em>"</p>



<p>How that breadth of experiences materializes is something we'll see as Blizzard continues to update and work on the game going forward. Though we know that, at least for now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/">that won't include a console version of Warcraft</a>, bringing the game to other platforms and making it playable in new ways is definitely one avenue Blizzard might explore.</p>



<p>It's World of Warcraft: Classic offering is one avenue it's already deep into, as Hazzikostas explains that there's an entirely different audience of players who go for Classic, over the modern World of Warcraft. "<em>Classic players are completely different, for the most part, than modern players. They behave differently. They want different things. We don't have a whole lot of crossover between both games</em>."</p>



<p>Wherever Blizzard takes World of Warcraft, it's clear that Blizzard sees more for the game, with Longdale going so far as to say that it's currently an "<em>underutilized</em>" IP.</p>



<p>"<em>It’s a fantastic IP. In my humble opinion, it’s been underutilized, and I just want to bring it to as many people as possible. And that means <strong>evolving what Warcraft means, what it is, and where it’s going</strong>. We want it to be approachable</em>," Longdale said. </p>



<p>"<em>And at the same time, we want to take advantage of 20 years of stories that have been told and not told, and start bringing it out to the world in a broader way. That’s my goal and vision</em>. <em>We’re never going to stop doing the things people love</em>. <em>But at the same time, <strong>we have a bigger vision than simply being an MMORPG</strong></em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has a big year ahead for Xbox as it marks its 25-year milestone. After the tough decision to release more Xbox games on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">rival consoles two years ago</a>, 2026 is a chance to refocus on the platform and celebrate some of Xbox’s biggest franchises. It’s also an opportunity for Microsoft to define its vision for the future of Xbox, after months of confusion from fans and plummeting Xbox hardware sales.</p><p>Xbox kicked off 2026 with its annual <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/865573/xbox-developer-direct-2026-the-biggest-games-and-announcements">Developer Direct</a> last month, a preview of some of the games it’s publishing this year. Microsoft is lining up its “four horsemen” for 2026: <em>Forza</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears of War</em>. These franchises have been the driving force behind Microsoft’s own Xbox games over the past 25 years, and I’m told there’s a big effort internally to ensure all four games debut on time this year.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> is first up on May 19th, and sources at Microsoft tell me that <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved </em>is tentatively targeting release over the summer. Microsoft is planning to release <em>Fable </em>in the fall, with <em>Gears of War: E-Day </em>also scheduled for the second half of 2026. I understand Microsoft has a good idea of when both should launch, but it’s also keen to avoid being too close to <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>’s November 19th date. Rockstar’s modern day Vice City could still slip further, but Take-Two <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/032e3067-32cd-4c82-b4dd-2bd20a153a6a">announced this week</a> that marketing for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> is due to start in the summer.</p><p>Outside of the big four, I understand Double Fine is also preparing to launch its new <em>Kiln </em>game in April. Bethesda is also working on new content for <em>Starfield</em> that looks set to debut soon. I wouldn’t be surprised if we also hear about a PS5 version of <em>Starfield</em>, years after it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/4/24057433/microsoft-bethesda-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release">first rumored</a>. Don’t be surprised if any of these game dates slip or change — such is the reality of video game development.</p><p>Blizzard is also celebrating 35 years, with a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24250351/blizzard-showcase-viewers-guide">series of showcases</a> for <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Hearthstone</em>, and <em>Diablo</em>. <em>Overwatch 2</em> is now back to being just <em>Overwatch, </em>and there are plans for <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24246206/overwatch-spotlight-the-reign-of-talon-begins/">10 new heroes</a> over the course of the year, new maps, and more.</p><p><em>Fallout</em> fans are also desperate for news about the <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster we heard about in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">FTC documents from 2023</a>, or news of a <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> remaster. The <em>Fallout</em> season 2 TV show finale debuted on Tuesday, and many fans were hoping a <a href="https://fallout-s2.amazonstudios.com/#main">countdown website</a> was hinting at a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster. The game is still in active development, and I understand Bethesda is keen to ensure it’s as well polished as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649795/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-release-date">surprise release</a> of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em>last year.</p><p>Beyond Xbox games, 2026 is also an important year for Microsoft’s Xbox hardware and software platforms. The release of the Xbox Ally handhelds from Asus last year marked a new effort to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">bring Windows and Xbox closer together</a>. This model of third-party devices now looks like the future of Xbox hardware and software.</p><p>Microsoft is working on several improvements to the Xbox “full screen experience” that powers the Xbox Ally devices. An Automatic Super Resolution (Auto SR) feature, which uses an NPU to upscale games, is set to debut in the coming months for the Xbox Ally X. Microsoft is also planning to use the NPU inside the Xbox Ally X to launch a new highlight reel feature that uses AI models to automatically capture gameplay and make it easy to share the footage on social media.</p><p>An improved Xbox PC UI is also being developed. It’s based on the changes Microsoft has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/868434/xbox-cloud-gaming-new-ui-future-xbox-console-design">been testing</a> in the new desktop mode for Xbox Cloud Gaming. It features a floating Xbox guide interface and smooth animations, and I expect to see this UI unified across Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud.</p><p>We’ll probably hear more about Xbox PC plans and further hints at the direction of Xbox consoles at the Game Developers Conference (GDC) next month. Microsoft has used GDC in the past to detail key developer changes to Xbox, as well as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173004/microsoft-xbox-series-x-xcloud-plans-features-details-gdc-2020-live-stream">next-gen Xbox development plans</a>. While I’m not expecting to hear full details about the next Xbox, I’d expect the various sessions will shed further light on the plans to merge Xbox and Windows, as well as more of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/620839/microsoft-xbox-ai-gaming-muse-model-notepad">AI work in gaming</a>.</p><p>We won’t be seeing a next-gen Xbox release this year, though. AMD CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873490/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-console-2027-date-amd">hinted this week</a> that Microsoft could launch its next-gen Xbox in 2027. “Development of Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox, featuring an AMD semi-custom SoC, is progressing well to support a launch in 2027,” said Su in an earnings call on Tuesday. Microsoft has only vaguely teased its next-gen Xbox plans so far, and I’m hoping that a bigger teaser is set for later this year.</p><p>Xbox fans will get a new controller this year, though. I’m hearing that Microsoft has greenlit next-gen Xbox controllers that include Wi-Fi connectivity to reduce Xbox Cloud Gaming latency. A new Xbox controller was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880809/microsoft-xbox-leak-gamepad-sebile-stadia-steam-sony">originally planned for 2024</a>, alongside a canceled Xbox Series X refresh. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond"><em>Windows Central</em></a> also expects an Xbox Elite Controller Series 3 debut in 2026, which would align with a rollout of next-gen Xbox controllers.</p><p>New Xbox controllers that connect directly to Xbox Cloud Gaming could help boost Microsoft’s Game Pass numbers and complement plans for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864261/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ads-testing">free ad-supported access</a> to cloud games. I understand Microsoft is getting close to testing free Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming with Xbox Insiders, ahead of a broader rollout this year.</p><p>While the free Xbox Cloud Gaming won’t be a new Game Pass tier, sources tell me Microsoft is in the early stages of exploring ways to expand its Game Pass subscription lineup. After a Game Pass Ultimate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">price hike in October</a>, I understand that Microsoft is looking at ways to bundle third-party services with Game Pass subscriptions and potentially even merge Xbox Game Pass Premium and PC Game Pass together. I wouldn’t expect to see any major changes to Game Pass this year, though.</p><p>Microsoft already added PC games to its various Xbox Game Pass subscriptions in October, with the dedicated PC Game Pass subscription rising by nearly 40 percent to cover the cost of day one releases. Microsoft is still seeing growth in PC Game Pass subscriptions, but it needs to clear up its fragmented subscription options if the future of Xbox consoles is PC.</p><p>All of the Xbox platform changes and pressure on big game releases add up to an important year for Xbox as it marks its 25-year anniversary. I’m certainly hoping that by the end of the year we’ll have a much better idea of Microsoft’s vision for the next 25 years of Xbox.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>Microsoft is experimenting with a top menu bar for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft’s PowerToys team is contemplating <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/870663/microsoft-windows-11-top-menu-bar-powertoy-experiment">building a top menu bar for Windows 11</a>, much like Linux, macOS, or older versions of Windows. The menu bar is actually a dock for Microsoft’s Command Palette PowerToy, and will provide quick access to tools, monitoring of system resources, and much more. You’ll be able to position this dock at the top, left, right, or bottom edge of a screen, which already makes it more flexible than the Windows 11 Start menu. We’re now waiting to see if Microsoft goes ahead and fully builds this dock or not.</span></li><li><span><strong>Jeffrey Epstein was permanently banned from Xbox Live. </strong>Microsoft booted <strong>Jeffrey Epstein </strong>from its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871425/jeffrey-epstein-xbox-live-ban-microsoft-sex-offender">online gaming platform in 2013</a>. It was part of a ban wave of registered sex offenders. It’s not clear if Epstein ever played Xbox, and the rest of the so-called Epstein files don’t reveal much more about Epstein’s Xbox habits.</span></li><li><span><strong>Former Windows 8 boss recruited Epstein to help negotiate his messy Microsoft exit. </strong>Not only did the Epstein files reveal an Xbox ban for Epstein and claims that Microsoft cofounder <strong>Bill Gates</strong> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/871879/bill-gates-epstein-files-absolutely-absurd">allegedly contracted an STD</a>, they also appear to show how former Windows 8 boss <strong>Steven Sinofsky </strong>recruited Epstein to negotiate his messy exit from Microsoft. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/872073/steven-sinofsky-jeffrey-epstein-files-emails-microsoft-exit-settlement">The emails appear to show</a> that Sinofsky constantly sought Epstein’s advice as he negotiated his surprise exit from Microsoft in November 2012, forwarding emails to him in nearly real time as talks progressed. Sinofsky also appears to have forwarded a confidential email between Microsoft executives to Epstein in July 2013 that details the issues around the launch of Surface, warning that the Surface RT tablet was “about to catastrophically fail in a very public way.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft says it’s building an app store for AI content licensing. </strong>Microsoft is creating a new Publisher Content Marketplace (PCM), a licensing hub that could make it easier for AI companies to pay for “premium” content. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873296/microsoft-publisher-content-marketplace-ai-licensing">Microsoft says it’s been codesigning PCM</a> with companies including <em>Verge </em>parent Vox Media,<em> The Associated Press</em>, Condé Nast, <em>People</em>, and others. It’s certainly an improvement over scraping and ingesting content into AI models without payment, but <em>The New York Times</em> is still in the middle of a copyright lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, claiming that the companies built their AI models by “copying and using millions” of the publication’s articles.</span></li><li><span><strong>Call of Duty tries to block XIM and Cronus cheaters again. </strong>Activision is trying to crack down on third-party hardware cheating devices in <em>Call of Duty</em> again. Devices like XIM, Cronus Zen, and ReaSnow S1 can enable unfair advantages that exploit aim assist, and now <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/872976/call-of-duty-xim-cronus-reasnow-s1-ban-detections">Activision is introducing new detections</a> to ban the devices. Activision attempted to detect the devices in the past, but it’s now switching its detection software to focus on player inputs, rather than attempt to detect devices that are designed to be hidden. The new detections will go live with season 2 of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>this week.</span></li><li><span><strong>Google Cloud’s customer chief returns to Microsoft as head of security. </strong>In a surprise move, Microsoft announced a new head of security this week. <strong>Hayete Gallot</strong>, who left Microsoft in October 2024 to become the president of Google Cloud’s customer experience, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873930/google-cloud-hayete-gallot-microsoft-security">returning to the software giant</a> as the executive vice president of security, reporting directly to CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong>. This leaves <strong>Charlie Bell</strong>, Microsoft’s former security chief, in a new role at the company. While Bell and Nadella claim this move was planned, Microsoft’s security record over Bell’s four years in charge speaks for itself. In 2024, the Cyber Safety Review Board concluded that “Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul,” after a series of high-profile security issues. Microsoft has been focused on cybersecurity ever since, in a bid to win back trust.</span></li><li><span><strong>GitHub adds Claude and Codex AI coding agents. </strong>GitHub is making Claude by Anthropic and OpenAI’s Codex AI coding agents directly available inside GitHub this week. A new public preview <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/873665/github-claude-codex-ai-agents">adds Claude and Codex to GitHub</a>, GitHub Mobile, and Visual Studio Code, for users with a Copilot Pro Plus or Copilot Enterprise subscription. GitHub is increasingly embracing multiple AI models to build its Copilot offering. Developers are already able to access models from Anthropic, Google, xAI, and OpenAI in GitHub Copilot, so integrating in rival AI coding agents feels like a natural next step.</span></li><li><span><strong>Windows 11 testers can now try out built-in Sysmon. </strong>Microsoft announced at Ignite in November that it was planning to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration">add Sysmon into Windows</a>, and now Windows Insiders can <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2026/02/03/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-26300-7733-dev-channel/">test this integration</a>. Sysmon was first released in 2014 as a utility for security analysis into the Windows Event Log, and adding it to Windows will make it easier for security teams to detect and respond to threats.</span></li><li><span><strong>Inside Xbox, a game studio is trying to reinvent itself. </strong>Bloomberg’s <strong>Jason Schreier</strong> takes an inside <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-02-03/xbox-studio-behind-grounded-outer-worlds-is-charting-new-path">look at Microsoft-owned Obsidian Entertainment</a> this week, profiling the prolific Xbox game developer. Studio head <strong>Feargus Urquhart </strong>reveals that Obsidian is trying to cut game development timelines to three or four years per title, instead of the more than six years it took to ship <em>Avowed </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. Urquhart also appears to acknowledge Microsoft’s aggressive 30 percent profit margins for games and hopes Microsoft will still fund riskier projects and accept that “maybe where we are going to be from a profitability standpoint isn’t going to be 30 percent.” </span></li><li><span><strong>Nvidia is investigating PC gaming issues with Microsoft’s latest Windows update. </strong>The ongoing saga of the January 2026 Windows 11 update isn’t slowing down. After shutdown issues, Dropbox crashes, and boot failures, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/user/15//581575//?comment=3591316">Nvidia now says</a> shadow artifacts in games like <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>could be related to the January 2026 update. “Even though it started after a Windows 11 update, we are looking into it,” says Manuel Guzman, a software QA at Nvidia. “As far as I know, the only way to resolve it appears to be uninstalling KB5074109.”</span></li><li><span><strong>Xbox achievement redesign spotted in Xbox Cloud Gaming UI refresh. </strong>Microsoft appears to be redesigning its Xbox achievements system. Xbox fans have <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/xbox-achievements-redesign">spotted a new achievement design</a> inside the Xbox Cloud Gaming overhaul. Rare achievements have an updated purple diamond icon, and regular ones have a new trophy surrounded by a wreath. It’s not clear if this same design will appear on Xbox consoles anytime soon, though.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As AI continues to encroach on game development, the worry that the studios that make your favorite games are dabbling in the tech, especially for art assets and written dialogue, grows ever greater. Sometimes this concern and the scrutiny that comes with it are well-founded, but other times it leads to witch hunts with fans seeing AI-generated art where it actually doesn’t exist. Blizzard’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team</span></a><span> has been the subject of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>these moments of mass hysteria</span></a><span>. So what exactly is Blizzard’s stance on genAI? Well, it sounds like the company itself is of one mind, while the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team itself is in a different camp.</span></p> <p><span>In a group interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus last month that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>leadership was asked by </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-president-supports-generative-ai-exploration"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span> if the company had been integrating genAI into its workflow. Blizzard president Johanna Faries said the company wants to take a “dev-led” approach that allows its teams to use whatever tech is out there to “the extent that they’re comfortable” and in line with what the company believes is “responsible.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We do actually, at Blizzard, have a centralized governance team specifically focused on AI and the role it can or should play in our development cycles,” Faries said. “What’s great about that is it’s very cross-functional, so you’re going to have voices from around the horn thinking about not just what’s hot-topic now, but where do we want to be five, 10 years from now? What’s the implication on our teams? What’s the implication on our values? How do we make sure that we don’t stymie the opportunity for devs, artists, whomever, to want to play with new tools and play in the sandbox, if it unlocks creativity or gets rid of drudgery or what have you? We want happy devs, right?</span></p> <p><span>“But to the extent that it can be an accelerant in our creative process, we also want to make sure that it’s a responsible tool and aligned with how we want to show up as a company,” she said. “So I feel very good in terms of the process we have in terms of vetting: is it secure, is it safe, is it values led? But I keep coming back to: I want the teams to feel safe, to explore to the extent that it drives joy in the work. And I think we have a good process, all up, in terms of making sure we’re doing it in a responsible manner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>So it sounds like, as a company, Blizzard is open to allowing its developers to use AI if they want to, though Faries didn’t get more specific about the parameters under which it considers its use “secure,” “safe,” or “values led.” But what about the </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> team, specifically? Game director Aaron Keller doesn’t sound like a fan. In an interview with </span><a href="https://x.com/gamespot/status/2019127667899961722"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>, he said the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team wants the hero shooter to be a “handcrafted universe.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch 2 director Aaron Keller speaks out against adding AI-generated content to the game. <a href="https://t.co/44ZznZWiXJ">pic.twitter.com/44ZznZWiXJ</a></p> <p>— GameSpot (@GameSpot) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameSpot/status/2019127667899961722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“We don’t want to put AI-generated content out in front of players,” Keller said. “It’s just not something that we’re comfortable doing. I know it’s a moving space, right? I don’t know where players or society’s perception of this is going to be five years or 10 years from now. So it’s not like, I don’t think that there’s ever gonna be a ‘Hey, here’s a forever policy around it,’ but that’s just where we’re at right now. We want this to feel like a handcrafted universe, and it is a handcrafted universe.”</span></p> <p><span>So it sounds like, for now, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>won’t have genAI-created heroes, maps, or skins. These questions come after Microsoft, which acquired Activision Blizzard in 2023, has been reportedly pushing for AI use within the company. Blizzard teams, including those behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><i><span>Diablo</span></i></a><span>, recently unionized, with concerns about AI replacing artists being top of mind among organizers.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is undergoing a revamp next week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from its title</span></a><span>, adding five new heroes, and restructuring its seasonal content to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-cinematic-doomfist-vendetta-death-reign-talon-2000665013"><span>prioritize linear storytelling</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Next Expedition Rewards and Date Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/next-arc-raiders-expedition-rewards-date/</link>
            <guid>1427245</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has unveiled the slate of rewards coming later this month when the <strong>second </strong>expedition window opens in ARC Raiders. This is the mechanic that allows players to reset their account, going back to base and starting all over again with a ‘new’ character. It also yields exclusive unlocks, bonuses, and temporary buffs.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, what’s being unlocked the second time around isn’t amazing, which is proving to be a concern for the game’s die-hard fanbase.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-second-expedition-rewards-explained">ARC Raiders Second Expedition Rewards Explained</h2>



<p>On February 25th, the second <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/second-expedition-rewards-and-requirements">ARC Raiders Expedition</a> window will open, running until March 1st, when all Raiders participating in the event <strong>leave Speranza</strong>. The team at Embark Studios has made some major changes to how the Expedition works, based on feedback received from the community in recent weeks.</p>



<p>First, it will now cost way less to acquire the five extra skill points you get for leaving Speranza. Instead of one million credits per skill point, the requirement is now 600,000 credits per skill point. Additionally, if you missed the full allotment of bonus points during the first Expedition, you can now unlock those bonus skill points at a discounted rate of 300,000 credits per skill point.</p>



<p>That means if you did your Expedition last time with <strong>zero </strong>extra skill points, you can get <strong>TEN </strong>bonus points in February, provided you can rack up 4.5 million credits.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With that being said, here are the other rewards waiting for you as the second Expedition rolls around:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Patchwork Outfit (Evolved)</li>



<li>Scrappy Cosmetics</li>



<li>The Expedition Indicator Icon (Upgraded)</li>



<li>24 extra Stash spaces</li>



<li>Bonus skill points</li>



<li>5 – 10% XP boost</li>



<li>6 – 12% Scrappy materials boost</li>



<li>60 – 70% Repair value increase</li>
</ul>



<p>The latter items are a range because you get <strong>a bigger boost </strong>if you’ve already completed your Expedition in December. If not, you get the <strong>lower </strong>end of the scale. It’ll face a consecutive boost <strong>again </strong>during the third Expedition, which should arrive in April.</p>



<p>Fans are disappointed that we don’t even get a new outfit for the second Expedition, just an ‘evolved’ one.</p>

The post, which Hamaguchi wrote in both Japanese and English, reads as follows:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve announced that FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH will launch on June 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the addition of Switch 2 and Xbox, the game will be released as a full multi‑platform title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This year, we plan to share more updates on the FINAL FANTASY VII Remake Project than ever before.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We look forward to celebrating together with even more players around the world."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve announced that FINAL FANTASY VII REBIRTH will launch on June 3.<br>With the addition of Switch 2 and Xbox, the game will be released as a full multi‑platform title.<br>This year, we plan to share more updates on the FINAL FANTASY VII Remake Project than ever before.<br>We look… <a href="https://t.co/GFImeiPiC7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/GFImeiPiC7</a> <a href="https://t.co/f0TaiDHlhJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/f0TaiDHlhJ</a></p>— 浜口直樹 /FFVII REBIRTH launches on Switch2&amp;Xbox Jun 3 (@nhamaguc) <a href="https://twitter.com/nhamaguc/status/2019428998875590885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 5, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">This is exciting news for Remake fans, who have been on the edge of their seats for the last few years, waiting for news of the third game in the trilogy, which we have yet to see at all. Though Hamaguchi didn't outright say it, this feels like a tease for a reveal this year. Rebirth left the story on one heck of a cliffhanger, with players left doubting whether the game's most famous twist really took place or not. The third game has a lot of work to do to land the plot plane set up by Remake and Rebirth, and it will be interesting to see how Square Enix does it. Fans have already been speculating as to what Part 3 will be called, following the "Remake" and "Rebirth" titles as well as "Reunion" on the recent Crisis Core remake. Popular suggestions include Reincarnation, Revival, Reawakening, Redemption, and Return.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Remake first launched in 2020. At the time we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-review">gave it an 8/10</a>, saying that it "breathes exciting new life into a classic while standing as a great RPG all its own." The game was originally a PS4 exclusive, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-announced-ps5-upgrade-details-revealed">came to PS5 in its fancy DLC-filled form with Final Fantasy 7 Remake: Intergrade</a>, later to PC and Nintendo Switch, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-review-update">Nintendo Switch 2 as well just last month</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was also excellent, with us <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying it "impressively builds off of what Remake set in motion, both as a best-in-class action-RPG full of exciting challenges and an awe-inspiring recreation of a world that has meant so much to so many for so long."

Further clips show dinosaurs getting pelted with beach balls, repeatedly flattened and set on fire by various objects, electrocuted by a tripwire,  rammed by a minecart and yanked off by a robot arm. Honestly, it's enough to make you feel sorry for them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As well as hairy velociraptors, other Zino species include one that looks like a vampire bat, and another hairy creature that looks a cross between a dragon and that thing from The Neverending Story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A life-or-death struggle begins deep below Tokyo, where clear thinking and split-second decisions could make all the difference," reads an official blurb. "You play as Anne, a survivor who finds herself in a network of subterranean caverns overrun by Zino – mysterious creatures that resemble dinosaurs. Use stealth, strategy, quick thinking and unwavering determination to escape the prehistoric world alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most interesting thing about the game is your ability to share control with up to three other players across Switch and Switch 2 consoles via GameShare. Here, control of Anne's movement, actions, abilities and even the game's camera can be portioned out to a group.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tokyo Scramble launches exclusively for Switch 2 on February 11 via the Nintendo eShop.

The result is a new design language grounded in embodiment, iteration, and accessibility.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/extended-reality/meta-shutters-three-vr-studios-as-part-of-reality-labs-layoffs" target="_self" data-discover="true">Meta shutters three VR studios as part of Reality Labs layoffs</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Moving from a controller, where people are used to pressing A or B or pulling a trigger, introduces a lot of new factors," said Alex Covert, Lead Gameplay Engineer. "Every time we design a new appliance for a dimension, we ask: How will the player actually grab this?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expert System Engineer, Marc Huet, describes this shift as both philosophical and technical. "Our goal was to make hands feel present and believable—to minimize dissonance between what you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>see</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and what you </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>feel,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">" he explained. "That meant always keeping hands visible, supporting many grip types, and ensuring the virtual hand never broke immersion."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Challenge">The Challenge</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. Lessons Learned from Early Failures</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early prototypes exposed the hidden complexity of human motion. "We had issues with hand sizing," Covert explained. "People felt uncomfortable using a giant hand that didn't match their own."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The fix wasn't a player-facing slider. The system now scales the virtual hands to match the player's tracked hand size automatically—one of those invisible changes that quietly removes discomfort and makes everything feel more ‘you.' Small change, big comfort wins. It became a shorthand lesson internally: the best UX improvements are often the ones nobody notices because nothing feels wrong anymore.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes, the obstacles weren't ergonomic but systemic. "We realized that a sock-puppet prototype conflicted with Meta's hand-tracking system," Covert recalled.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/extended-reality/former-meta-employees-allege-company-squashed-research-into-vr-child-abuse" target="_self" data-discover="true">Former Meta employees allege company squashed research into VR child abuse</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem was less technical than behavioral. The first thing most people do with a puppet is talk to themselves. In practice, that motion turned out to be identical to Meta's system menu gesture. Instead of animating a character, players were repeatedly summoning the OS.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was no clever workaround. The gesture belonged to the platform. So the team didn't redesign the interaction — they cut puppets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet's early experimentation echoed those constraints. "At first, our grab detection was binary—you were either grabbing or not," he said. "It worked for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vacation Simulator,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> but it didn't feel alive. We wanted to see your fingers react, your hands </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>exist</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the world."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team's first step toward that goal was rebuilding their "grab logic" from the ground up. Huet described the process as discovering just how unpredictable real human motion is: "There are so many valid ways to grab something—we had to decide which of those looked </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in VR."</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. Natural vs. Intuitive</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through hundreds of hours of playtesting, the team learned that natural and intuitive don't always align.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Every person does it differently," Covert said. "Some pinch, some grab. The closer we get to how people actually use their hands, the less we have to explain."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet's research helped formalize that variability. Drawing from human-factors research on everyday grasping—such as a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7243327">2016 IEEE study</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by robotics researchers Tomáš Feix and colleagues that categorizes common human grips based on form and intent—Huet built a library of grab techniques for VR. This includes grips like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>corner, clump, cylinder, hilt,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>wand</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—each mapped to real-world use.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We looked at how people hold cups, phones, and tools," he explained. "Every grip has a story—a context—and we wanted that reflected in VR." He also coined internal terms like "closedness," a 0-to-1 measure of how open or closed the player's hand is to define when a grab occurs.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Some players over-grab, some pose-match," Huet said. "You have to balance both so things don't feel sticky or slippery. It's subtle math that ends up shaping </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>how</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> people play."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This systematization allowed the team to move beyond imitation toward consistency. "It's fascinating research," Covert noted. "Marc showed pictures of different hand poses people use when grabbing things — holding a phone versus holding a cup. It grounded our approach."</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Approach">The Approach</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. Designing for Accessibility Through Simplicity</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Removing controllers didn't just change the interface — it opened the door for more inclusive play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of our big considerations is one-handed players," said Covert. "At one point, we had a two-handed twist-style pepper shaker, but that created accessibility concerns. So we added a shake alternative."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This philosophy carried through every mechanic. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DDS </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">introduced "snap points" for setting items down easily, freeing a player's hand mid-task.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In the diner, the squeeze bottles have a threshold for how hard you need to squeeze," said Emma Atkinson, Technical Designer. "But if that's difficult, you can just tilt them and they'll pour out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving to hand tracking also meant removing unnecessary instruction. Instead of teaching players new button metaphors or gesture rules, the team focused on subtracting friction and trusting existing human intuition. Because people already know how to use their hands, many interactions could be learned simply by doing—without prompts, overlays, or step-by-step tutorials.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet extended that philosophy to invisible design systems. "Accessibility isn't always about menus or toggles," he said. "Sometimes it's about thresholds—if a player's range of motion is limited, we can scale the sensitivity so a smaller gesture still counts. The goal is to let everyone feel capable in VR."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That sensitivity scaling, originally built for testing, became a subtle yet powerful accessibility feature. "You don't have to announce accessibility," Huet added. "You can just design it in."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. Creating Self-Haptics</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Without vibration motors or triggers, the team reimagined tactile feedback from the ground up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The squishable UI buttons and keyboards give tactile feedback because your fingers touch each other," Covert explained. "That's what we call self-haptics. You feel yourself performing the action instead of relying on vibration."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Atkinson added, "You don't want your hand to become the object—you want to hold it. We try to minimize cognitive dissonance between what you see and what you feel."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet built on that idea technically, integrating collision physics that made contact feel grounded. "The raw hand data comes straight from the device," he explained. "We then run physics updates to see where your virtual hand </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>should</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be after impact. There's a little tolerance—enough to give you that ‘hit' feeling before it breaks through."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He described it as "letting physics fake haptics." "You're not feeling a vibration," he said, "but when the virtual hand resists or stops, your brain fills in the feedback."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That philosophy—turning embodiment itself into feedback—became core to Owlchemy's design lexicon, alongside "bubble pass," the intuitive hand-to-hand object transfer system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. Designing for Shared Gestures</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early builds tried to make passing explicit: both players had to perform a synchronized ‘handoff' gesture. The team replaced it with what became the ‘bubble pass'—an idea from Tim Winsky, implemented by Systems Engineer Marc Huet—where a thrown item hovers in front of the other player long enough to be grabbed. The result is more playful, and it teaches itself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even during internal playtests, people discovered the new pass system and had that moment of joy when they figured it out on their own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The change was data-driven. "We added analytics to see how often players used the old passing system and found that almost no one was using it," Covert said. "That told us it was time to rethink the design."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet's grab system played an unseen role here too. "When you toss something, timing matters; milliseconds affect how real it feels," he said. "So we built in what we call ‘sticky' and ‘slippery' release thresholds. It's how you tell the difference between handing off a mug and throwing a beach ball."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His experiments revealed that velocity and openness need to respond to intent. "If you open your hand slowly, the object should linger. If you open fast, it should fly," Huet explained. "Those little cues make shared gestures feel believable." It also learns what ‘I'm ready' looks like: hand up, waiting. When it sees that, it helps the object meet the hand—so catching feels intentional instead of accidental.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4. Designing Around Technical Limits</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hardware realities still present creative challenges. "When you point away from yourself with the sprayer, your hand can block the headset cameras, so it doesn't always detect the motion," Covert explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Instead of seeing such limitations as setbacks, the team treats them as opportunities for innovation. "We've even talked about adding aerosol spray cans where you press the top with your index finger," Covert added. "We don't have support for that yet, but it's on the wishlist."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet elaborated on those constraints: "Hand occlusion, lighting, tracking speed—those are constant battles," he said. "If a hand moves too fast or leaves the camera's field of view, tracking breaks. So we design around that by keeping actions close, within this invisible box in front of you."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Environmental conditions also shape interaction design. Hand tracking behaves differently depending on lighting, camera visibility, and the underlying capabilities of the headset itself. In low-light or high-occlusion situations, tracking data can become noisy.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why?&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Well, not all systems compensate for that noise in the same way. Some systems include infrared illuminators to support hand tracking in low-light conditions, while others degrade faster as lighting drops.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather than treating those moments as failure states, the team designed interactions to be forgiving by default: dropped objects recover, missed grabs self-correct, and small errors never cascade into frustration. The guiding principle was simple: Players should never feel punished by physics or hardware constraints.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Results">The Results</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hand tracking didn't just expand accessibility. It made play feel human.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players naturally gestured, waved, and improvised together. They learned by doing, not by reading.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We almost don't need to design new ways of doing things," Covert said. "The closer we get to how people actually use their hands, the more natural the game feels."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Huet added, "Our success is when people stop noticing the system. When your virtual hand feels like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>your</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hand—when you don't think about grabbing, you just grab—that's when VR disappears and embodiment takes over."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Across development, the team's iterative design language. Terms like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>self-haptics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>bubble pass became</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shorthand for a culture of experimentation and discovery. "You could almost make a dictionary of the words we've made up," Atkinson laughed. "It's our own language."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Owlchemy Labs, hand tracking reaffirmed its core philosophy: interactions should be instinctive, inclusive, and joyful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're still improving our authoring tools," Huet said. "But every iteration teaches us something new about how humans move—and how to make VR move with them."</span></p><p>Image via Owlchemy Labs/Google</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Key Takeaways</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hand tracking is both interface and embodiment.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Designing gestures means understanding how people feel feedback: not just how they perform it.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Authoring meets procedural motion. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Strong hand-tracking systems allow developers to lock poses when precision matters (i.e., picking up a cup one way) while still allowing motion to adapt to how players actually reach, slide, and settle into a grab.

<p>The lovely folk over on our sister site, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, had an <em>okay</em> time with Time Stranger when it arrived on PS5 last year, though felt that it squandered its potential. "Despite being packed with such clear potential," their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/digimon-story-time-stranger">review</a> reads, "Time Stranger ends up feeling like a frustrating misfire".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is expanding its <em>Horizon</em> universe again with <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em>, a “cooperative action game” in development by franchise creator Guerrilla for PS5 and PC.</p><p><em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> lets “up to three players team up as heroic Hunters to protect a world under threat from deadly machines,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/">according to a blog post</a>. “Combat is tactical, reactive, and deeply skill-based, building on the tactical precision of the Horizon games while embracing the dynamics of team play.”</p><p>You’ll be able to select a character from a roster of “Hunters” with different play styles, and you can customize them with different roles and roguelike-style perks and upgrades. There will be a narrative campaign, and each of the Hunters “have their own motivations and personal struggles.”</p><p>The “foundation” of <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> is focused on “challenging and replayable hunts.” The development team is initially showing off two game modes: “Machine Incursion, a high-intensity mission where waves of machines pour out from underground gateways, led by a formidable boss; and Cauldron Descent, a longer, multi-stage trial in which ever-changing rooms push Hunters to their limits, from brutal machine encounters to hidden doors that promise power and reward for teams prepared to open them.”</p><p>If you don’t want to play with other people, single-player is an option; instead, you’ll have two NPCs on your team, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-hunters-gathering/">Sony says</a>.</p><p>Sony hasn’t shared a specific release window for the game, but there will be a “small-scale closed playtest” coming at the end of February.

It’s also developing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819657/horizon-steel-frontiers-mmo-sony-ncsoft-playstation">an MMO in the <em>Horizon</em> universe called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em></a> and is set to launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/864146/bungie-marathon-release-date-march-5th-price"><em>Marathon</em> in March</a> after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/688479/bungie-marathon-delay-sony">a delay</a>.</p></div><p>Guerrilla also wants you to know that it isn’t pivoting fully into multiplayer games. “We absolutely love making single-player games and we’re going to keep making them,” studio director Jan-Bart van Beek <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JubgL46Xkmk">says in a video</a>. “They’re a huge part of who we are as a studio.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/874434/playstation-sony-horizon-hunters-gathering-live-service-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
It took them long enough, but Sony and Guerilla have finally announced that other online Horizon game (the one that isn't an MMO), and it's called Horizon Hunters Gathering. On the offset it sort of looks like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter</a> clone gameplay wise, especially being a co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game, though there are some definite differences between the two.
</p>
<p>
And there's plenty of differences with the main series too, the most obvious being that radical art style change. I'm certainly for it, the Horizon games admittedly have quite nice colours but ultimately have a forgettable art direction, whereas this one is clearly following in the 3D animation pseudo revolution that was Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. There's a hero shooter-esque quality to it, as you can only choose from pre-set characters as opposed to making your own a la Monster Hunter, all of which have a couple of classes to choose from themselves.

<p>
There's a guy with a big ole warhammer, another who's speedy as hell with a bow and arrow, a woman with a fancy looking spear, a fair amount of variety on display (those three will also be the only characters available to choose from in the game's first closed playtest, which you can only access through the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">PlayStation Beta Program</a>). The combat itself looks flashy and crunchy enough, and like in the original games you still have to find weak points on the robo dinos.
</p><p>
This first playtest will have a couple of mission types to try out, the first one being Machine Excursion, where you have to fight off a bunch of the machines and defend your home, collecting random power-ups along the way, so a touch roguelikey. There's also a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>-esque ring that closes in more and more to keep you on your toes. The other mission type is called Cauldron Descent, which sort of looks like a dungeon crawly, puzzley take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades">Hades</a>, as you choose different rooms to go through as you progress.
</p>
<p>
There's also a Monster Hunter style hub area where you can upgrade equipment, or just hangout in a campsite that you can customise yourself. Overall it feels like a real mish mash of different games, and looks cohesive enough in its first trailer, though I do wonder if it's able to find its own identity amongst it all. In any case, no release date or even window in this one, so if you're interested, just have patience.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nvidia is reportedly opting not to release new graphics cards this year, and is looking at cutting back its GPU production. </p>



<p>In a new report from The Information (<a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/nvidia-delay-new-gaming-chip-due-memory-chip-shortage?rc=v4bmzs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>), it’s claimed that Nvidia has decided not to release its latest GPUs this year—the long-rumored GeForce RTX 50-series Super refresh—in 2026. Those who spoke to the outlet on the condition of anonymity say Nvidia is doing it to focus on AI chips and datacenters due to the RAM shortage.</p>







<p>The report ads that Nvidia is also going to cut production of the current RTX 50-series graphics cards due to the shortage. A shortage that has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-ram-costs-more-than-new-graphics-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prices of memory soar</a> to the levels beyond anything that many have ever seen. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Nvidia for comment on the report. As of publishing, a response ahadn’t been received, but this story will be updated should one come in.</p>



<p>The decision to cut back on graphics cards production comes as Nvidia’s profits continue to break records. The company’s latest earnings report in November saw a 62% year-over-year growth in revenue at $57 billion. Those profits have resulted in Nvidia being the largest company in terms of market cap with a value of $4.259 trillion. It’s likely that those numbers rise hire when they report their FY26 fourth quarter earnings on February 25.</p>







<p>Nvidia has also said that to help with the shortage, it would revive older hardware. Cards as old as the 30-series <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-re-release-geforce-rtx-3060-in-q1-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">could be relaunched</a> to alleviate the shortage, though, by relaunching cards that are over a half-decade old, gamers are likely to miss out on current, modern-day features.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-internal-town-hall-fails-to-reassure-employees-on-its-future/</link>
            <guid>1427182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft held an internal Town Hall Q&amp;A meeting with employees yesterday to instill confidence in the company’s upcoming changes, but, according to over a dozen employees who spoke to Insider Gaming anonymously, it appears to have had the opposite effect.</p>



<p>The Town Hall featured a host to read out the questions, along with Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Executive Vice President Cécile Russeil, Chief People Officer Sébastien Froidefond, CFO Frederik Duguet, and Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer Marie-Sophie&nbsp;de Waubert, in a roundtable format.</p>







<p>According to those who spoke to Insider Gaming, employees described the Town Hall as an expert class in avoiding questions, with executives repeatedly sidestepping or recycling earlier statements.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming was sent a recording of the Town Hall under the condition that it would not be made public.</p>



<p>Ubisoft Yves Guillemot opened the Town Hall, once again reinforcing the decision for the 5-day return to office mandate, stating, “It’s a decision we have not taken lightly, but we feel strongly that it will bring more efficiency, innovation, and velocity. As it already has since we came back, three days per week. Working in person brings stronger performance, especially in the tech and creative industries.”</p>



<p>Yves addressed concerns about a supposed ‘hidden agenda’ to lay off employees, stating, “Our only objective is to get Ubisoft back on the right path as soon as possible, to share success and profits. I founded Ubisoft with my brothers, and as you can imagine, my goal is to continue to make it flourish for many years to come. It’s thanks to your strengths and collective talents that we will succeed.”</p>



<p>The host said that more than 300 questions were submitted for the Q&amp;A, with sources noting that some had 700-800 upvotes, 3-4 times the number from past Q&amp;A calls. When asked why they thought this was, many said it was due to the frustration, anger, and betrayal employees felt from the current announcements.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-office-mandate">Return to Office Mandate</h2>



<p>One of the biggest questions that had the most upvotes was around the Return to Office mandate that will see all employees across all studios return to office five days per week.</p>



<p>As has become a constant frustration with criticism of RTO mandates, the updated comment focused on whether Ubisoft has any actual data to support the claim that productivity and collaboration have increased since 3-day RTOs were enforced.</p>



<p>Chief Studios &amp; Portfolio Officer,&nbsp;de Waubert said, “What we hear, both internally and externally, is that when it comes to creative, the more people that are present together, the more all of those things we mentioned earlier improve from a collective perspective.”</p>



<p>Marie-Sophie&nbsp;went on to cite competitors like Riot Games, Activision Blizzard, Rockstar, etc. have already implemented RTO mandates. Marie-Sophie&nbsp;also cited companies outside of the industry, including Instagram, Paramount, and many others, that have also implemented RTO.</p>



<p>“Of course we will keep flexibility exceptions, but in a clear hybrid policy,” she said.</p>



<p>In response to a follow-up question about flexibility and how many “at-home days” will be granted, among other details, Froidefond said that these decisions will not be made until July.</p>



<p>A question around why Ubisoft won’t meet developers’ requests to have a 4-day RTO was also shot down by Froidefond, stating, “We have already explained this in the past, and our position remains the same; we are not considering a 4-day office workplace.”</p>



<h2 id="h-significant-headcount-reduction">Significant Headcount Reduction</h2>



<div><p>One question cited Insider Gaming’s recent prediction that the recent cost-cutting measures could see a reduction of 2000+ jobs, to which Frederik Duguet responded,</p><p>“First of all, we must state very clearly that we have never shared such numbers externally, and as I’ve just said, we won’t share any more decisions today. Again, it is, however, true that we will proceed with additional targeting restructuring as we need to resize the organisation and reduce our costs.”</p></div>



<p>Duguet later added that in May’s yearly financial results (which will end March 31, 2026), “We [Ubisoft] should expect our headcount in March to be <strong>significantly lower</strong> than it was in September”. No further elaboration on what “significantly lower” entails.</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s headcount in September 2025 was 17,097.</p>







<h2 id="h-acknowledged-lack-of-communication">Acknowledged Lack of Communication</h2>



<p>One positive from the call was that Ubisoft acknowledged the lack of communication about the announced structural changes, with Executive Vice President Cécile Russeil acknowledging that most employees learned about many of the upcoming changes from media reports. </p>



<p>Russeil acknowledged that the live Q&amp;A session that took place at the end of the day was the wrong decision, as employees found out about a lot of the details from media rather than the company itself.</p>



<p>“We heard you, and in the future, we will attach the press release with an internal email so that you get all of the information at the same time of media and investors.”</p>



<p>Duguet weighed in to mention that Ubisoft is a publicly traded company and “we have disclosure duties with our investors, which means, in concrete terms, that we cannot share anything that is sensitive internally at large before updating the market on these very elements.”</p>



<h2 id="h-selling-a-creative-house-assets-is-possible-in-the-future">Selling a Creative House / Assets Is Possible in The Future</h2>



<p>One of the biggest questions in the call revolved around Ubisoft’s Creative House structure and what will happen if a Creative House fails to be profitable.</p>



<p>On that, CFO Frederik Duguet said, “First, I would like to repeat that we are setting up the Creative Houses for success. We want them to win. It’s the whole purpose of what we’re doing. Of course, we should keep in mind that not all of them might not be profitable on day one, but the important element will be for the five of them to project into the next years and see to what extent they can continue to the overall Ubisoft performance improvement.”</p>



<p>He continued, “Now, if in some years from now a house is not profitable, if it underperforms versus management expectations, then ultimately we will look at the root cause. We will discuss with the GM and the team in charge to see whether there is a way to bring it to performance and profitability.”</p>



<p>“So, selling a house will be a possibility, but it shouldn’t be the first route to work on. If we open the perspective, and the options, if we find a powerful and motivated partner, and we agree on long term vision, and it comes with an important cash injection, with the force to invest in the future of the brands, if this is good for the house or Ubisoft, it is something to consider.”</p>

<p>Those employees who spoke to Insider Gaming under the condition of anonymity say that the Town Hall did very little to reassure them about the future. </p>



<p>Many of the critical questions were seemingly dismissed or danced around, and did little to ease the feeling that the company faces uncertain times.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Cygames has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/granblue-fantasy-relink-endless-ragnarok">Granblue Fantasy: Relink</a> is making its way to Switch 2 in a new 'Endless Ragnarok' package.</p>
<p>Set to come out way on <strong>9th July</strong>, this is the same Relink experience that so many know and love from back in 2024, with a couple of new bells and whistles to mark the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>Chief among the additions is a playable Eustace and Beatrix, who join the 20-character roster with their unique fighting styles — Beatrix up close and personal with her swords, and Eustace from further afield with his guns.</p>
<p>Both local and online co-op are enabled, too, so you'll be able to team up with pals and take on enemies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Embark on an epic journey in the Sky Realm. In this visually stunning action RPG, players will journey alongside a diverse cast of allies, exploring breathtaking floating islands and battling powerful foes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> had a great time with Relink when it launched on PS5 back in 2024, stating, "whether you're playing alone or in co-op, there's a real thrill to Relink's combat system, which combines precise hacking and slashing with underlying RPG stats and mechanics," in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/granblue-fantasy-relink">8/10 review</a>. Let's hope things look just as bright on Switch 2, eh?</p>

<figcaption><em>Timberborn </em>is finally getting a 1.0 release.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As noted by Mechanistry in the aforementioned post, <em>Timberborn </em>has come a long way since launching in Early Access back in 2021, having received a number of major updates adding new features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/folktails-vs-iron-teeth-in-timberborn-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bb42b48a-a7ed-45d4-ac0d-3e0e65fc6fce" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">distinct factions</a>, 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6f3a308-53b5-4b6b-98c6-0d19b287537f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">physics</a>, and new maps, plus lots more.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Timberborn</em>, it's a colony-building sim that takes place on an Earth ravaged by the worst excesses of mankind. Humans have disappeared, but it's okay; beavers are here to pick up the slack.</p><p>You'll guide your colony of beavers through the early stages of building their city, and you'll tend to important management aspects like food production, protection from the elements, and environmental engineering.</p><p>You can check out the new <em>Timberborn </em>lore trailer, which should give you a good sense of what kind of world the game takes place in, right here. Take it away, Shaun.</p>
<p>Upon launching into Early Access, <em>Timberborn </em>proved a pretty major success for Mechanistry, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="66101916-f924-4827-b377-416c6d46fbb6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">attracting over 100,000 sales</a> within the game's first week of release. Here's hoping it can replicate that early interest for the 1.0 release.</p><p><em>Timberborn </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's getting its 1.0 release on March 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>Get in cover and 10/4 your sit reps, soldier! Battalion developers Bulkhead have revealed a new military sandbox shooter set to arrive in early access at some point this year. It's called Wardogs and it'll see matches featuring up to 100 mercenaries mercilessly murder each other in teams, with the reward being a stack of money to spend on upping the ante with their next loadout.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCnEi5npoTE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>Our first thought upon seeing the player count per session was that the thing seems quite Battlefieldy, but Bulkhead say that - at least in terms of the game's main mode - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arma-3">Arma 3</a> mod <a href="https://armakoth.com/">King of the Hill</a> was the main inspiration. For clarity that's a mod with three team sector control missions featuring lots of walkie-talkie enthusiasts rogering each other, not the TV show about a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XA6EdFZD8s8">man with a very small bottom</a> and his son who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy3qk4ohwFA">doesn't know you, but knows that's his purse</a>.</p>
<p>So, each match'll see you flown out to Eastern Europe's famous derelict industrial mountains, assigned to one of three teams fighting for control of a randomised 2x2KM central control zone within a 256KM² map, and told to keep your bottom in the control zone until your squad rack up the 100 points needed to win.</p><p>Destructible environments designed to be shaped in fortified defence points, makeshift bases, or vicious deathtraps feed into the territorial struggles, and Bulkhead say tactical nous will be rewarded. In line with that, throughout each battle you earn cash through actions like "reviving squadmates, transporting friendlies to the zone, or controlling the objective", encouraging folks to work together.</p>
<p>The contents of your cute camo wallet persist between matches, and are what you use to buy different bits of the loadout you take into each fight. Which weapons, gear, utility bobbins and vehicles you pick will influence how the action plays out, with stuff like whipping out your big tank or chopper at the exact right time having the potential to turn the tide drastically.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks like something the bit of my brain that quietly loves a bit of multiplayer shootering could dig, even if I'll spend 90% of the time being told off by teammates for being too much of a coward to poke my head out of cover and heal them.</p>
<p>Wardogs is set to release in early access at some point in 2026, with Bulkhead planning to have this last "around 12 to 18 months" while they work on "expanding content, improving systems, refining balance, and responding to player feedback". Until then, you can wishlist the shooter on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1867240/WARDOGS/">Steam</a> if you're so inclined.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-8-in-1-usb-c-docking-station-crashes-to-an-all-time-low-barely-any-margin-left-at-this-price-2000665542</link>
            <guid>1427119</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re looking to expand your workstation with more devices, or just want to manage the gadgets you currently use, a docking station can help. Anker makes some of the top options around, and right now you can snap up its 8-in-1 option without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">Amazon just knocked the Anker 8-in-1 docking station by 26%, bringing its price down to $40, from $54</a>. There are no shipping charges to worry about, either, so $40 is all you’ve got to pay today. The only thing to keep in mind is that the offer – as you’d expect – is selling out fast. That means you don’t have a lot of time left to bag the savings. It’s best to grab it as soon as you can to avoid paying the full price later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Productive Setup</h2>
<p>It’s a compact docking station that packs a mighty punch. It’s equipped with a USB-C PD-IN charging port, two USB-A data ports, two HDMI ports, an Ethernet port, and a microSD/SD card reader. That’s all you need to create a productive workstation for all your office and entertainment needs. The station is also compatible with USB-C Power Delivery to provide high-speed pass-through charging up to 85W, so you can juice your essentials up while catching up on work deadlines.</p>
<p>There’s support for a dual display setup via HDMI ports. You can stream or mirror content to a single device in sharp 4K at 60Hz, or connect to two external screens to both HDMI ports in 4K@30Hz. For instance, if you’re planning to game with friends, add a high-quality external monitor to enjoy breathtaking visuals and smooth performance. Working on an office project with colleagues? Having two external screens lets you take quick meetings on one, while viewing reference materials on the second and working on your primary screen. Note that Windows users can use each screen for different content, but macOS mirrors the same content across both external monitors.</p>



<p>As for compatibility, the docking station supports USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections. It plays nicely with a range of devices, including MacBook (macOS 12 and newer), Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, and laptops equipped with DP Alt Mode and Power Delivery. Included in the box are the 8-in-1 USB-C PD hub, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for added peace of mind. A charging cable isn’t included, so you’d either have to buy one separately or use what’s already available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7057/">There’s a lot more to appreciate here, especially now that the hub is going for just $40 at Amazon.</a> Again, the deal is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders without wasting much time. That said, we’re spotting plenty of other discounts across the tech section at Amazon. Everything from smartphones to laptops, gaming monitors, and tech accessories is going for less. We’re covering the top deals, so be sure to check back to discover the latest drops worth your money.</p>

              <p>Astonishingly, we are already eight months into the life of Nintendo’s Switch 2 console. And three-quarters of a year in, it’s perhaps fair to say there’s not exactly been a rollercoaster of must-have games released. Given the disappointment of&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, and the sheer paucity of other first-part originals, it’s becoming tricky not to think of it as a $400 <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> machine that has a side-hustle in ports. With a desperate need for the console to be given any sense of vitality in 2026, today’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> not only did very little to take away from the impression of stagnation, but if anything seemed to go out of its way to endorse it.</p> <p>It was a very peculiarly put-together showcase. Any who try to fathom the decisions made by Nintendo are doomed to spiraling madness, but after the very pretty but previously announced <em>Orbitals</em>, we saw a visual novel sequel, a soccer anime oddity, and then what looked like a 2002 PC shovelware knock-off of a generic Capcom game, <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>. It was a deeply inauspicious start, suggesting that these desultory offerings were the games Nintendo thought we should be most excited about in 2026.</p>

 <p>This was then further cemented by longer looks at two years-old ports. First up was&nbsp;<em>Valheim</em>, the 2021 PC survival game, arriving on Switch 2 without a new addition or significant update, presented looking choppy and blocky (which I suppose are at least thematic) for the brand-new console. This five-year-old game still has a loyal following on Steam, with 30,000 people playing every day, so it’s not exactly forgotten, but it’s a weird pick to make such a fuss of. Then came the two-month-old news that the original 2017 <em>Hollow Knight</em> is receiving a free upgrade for the Switch 2. Very welcome, of course, and a great move by Team Cherry, but you know, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-dlc-sea-of-sorrows-switch-2-2000653816">something that was announced back in December of last year</a>.</p> <p>Somehow this was followed by&nbsp;<em>another</em> soccer game, a previously announced cross-platform Square RPG, another previously announced and previously released cross-platform Square RPG (OK, I’m being slightly facetious, people are excited to play <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Switch 2), and then two more long-ago-revealed but still potentially interesting cross-platform titles, <em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>and <em>Turok: Origins</em>. At this point the Direct seemed completely lost, just stringing together games we already knew were coming to Switch 2, but also coming to Xbox, PlayStation and PC, and all with little new information nor even release dates. The whole thing felt more and more like a proof-of-life for the console, rather than a showcase of reasons to be excited.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666069">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps you’re delighted by the reveal of a sequel to 2015’s PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Xanadu</em>, a long-awaited revival of Nihon Falcon’s classic ’80s/’90s <em>Xanadu </em>series, and all power to you if so, but this alongside <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> also felt like pretty weak offerings. But wait, hold on to your socks and hats, because up next was&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em>! You know&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy</em>, right? The 2014 mobile game? Or perhaps you’re more of a fan of the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy Versus</em> games that came to, er, PS4 and Xbox One? Even&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink</em> didn’t come to Switch in 2024, instead arriving only on PlayStation and PC.</p>

 <p>Finally, way too late into the stream, some previously unreleased games with broader name recognition appeared. We got the already very well-known <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which would have been a massive deal if they hadn’t already been announced for the system last year, and in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em>‘ case, via a previous Nintendo Direct. Between these, we also had the welcome news of a collection of literally 40-year-old classics, and a rapid-fire montage of yet more previously announced games. But why <em>Star Trek Voyager – Across the Unknown</em> and&nbsp;<em>Reanimal</em> were confined to this purgatory, and the rest of this dismal half hour was not, is anyone’s guess.</p> <p>And then the big finish! An 11-year-old, two-year-old, and 20-year-old game, each from Bethesda. <em>Fallout 4</em> and <em>Oblivion</em> are last year’s versions, but still games that have been re-released a comical number of times across the decades. And honestly, the fact that it felt borderline exciting that 2024’s <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was revealed as a Switch 2 game really underlined just what a dreadful Direct this had been. “Oh my goodness, a big-name game that was released in this decade!”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666070">© Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This was a Partner Showcase, which is to say a Direct which features no first-party Nintendo announcements at all. But given just how little of those first-party efforts we know about at this point, it needed to do some damned heavy lifting to offer hope to Switch 2 owners who might be wondering exactly why they upgraded over the holidays. Next week’s <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> from Camelot will likely be a lovely 8/10 sports game, and there’s reason to hope that next month’s&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Pokopia&nbsp;</em>will offer us a fresh face for an&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing</em>-like, but neither feels like a console-selling blockbuster. A repolished&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> at the end of March is…sure, great. Then we have&nbsp;<em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> set for spring, and that’s it for games with even that vague of a release date. At some point in 2026 we should get <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Wave</em> and it’ll be gratefully received, but seriously, fucking hell, that’s it. Apparently there’s another&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em> at some point in the distant future, too.</p> <p>It is surely impossible that Nintendo doesn’t have something up its sleeves for&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em>‘s 40th anniversary, right? But then it also feels impossible that Nintendo launched a brand new console without a 3D&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> title even announced, let alone released, and that’s somehow still true.</p> <p>Given all of this, today’s showcase needed to have some massive third-party announcement, some huge reveal that everyone would be buzzing about. And we didn’t even get close. It was abysmal.</p>

<p>WWE 2K26 reintroduces classic features, as shown in a new gameplay trailer.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26/" id="172879">WWE 2K26</a> will be released worldwide on March 13. Players who pre-order any premium version of the game will gain access on March 6. The first <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report from 2K Games</a> focused on new gameplay additions, including previously reported match types, new interactive environments, and AI customization that delivers greater realism than ever before.</p>

<h2>AI Settings and Customization Features in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>The ability to simulate WWE matches is a massive draw in modern video games. As such, AI must control certain WWE Superstars so they act as they would on WWE Raw or WWE SmackDown every week. In WWE 2K26, a significant upgrade gives players greater control over how the AI handles certain professional wrestlers.</p>



<p>The new AI Sequences system, available in the Create-A-Moveset section, lets players string together a sequence of signature moves to tell the AI exactly how to use a specific WWE star. Once these sequences are configured, the AI will always attempt to execute the selected moves in the configured order. Also, AI has been retooled to display more natural reactions and authentic animations between moves.</p>







<h2 id="h-start-of-match-actions-return-in-wwe-2k26">Start of Match Actions Return in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>WWE 2K26 reintroduces “Start of Match Actions.” This means that at the start of every match, wrestlers will perform a brief sequence to enhance realism. Whether that is chain wrestling, a rock-paper-scissors-like system first added to the games over a decade ago, a handshake offering, the ability to trade blows and a striking exchange, or simply playing to the crowd, this adds more realism to each match and harkens back to the original WWE SmackDown vs. Raw from 2004, where there were also opening match sequences.</p>



<p>Entrances are also more interactive this year, allowing players to control key gestures, taunts, heavy pyro customization, and much more.</p>



<p>Not only is all of this added, but so is the ability to launch surprise attacks, stack tables, fight on barricades, use title belts as a weapon in new ways, and more. The additions of Booker T and Wade Barrett to the commentary table were touted as well.</p>
