                <p>Elden Ring Nightreign's newest patch, 1.01.2, is out now, and it's exclusively focused on bug fixes.</p><p>The new update fixes a bug that would prevent the Demon Merchant from appearing in some scenarios. It also addresses an issue where Libra, Creature of the Night, would "repeatedly perform some actions." Additionally, the patch fixes a problem that could cause stability issues with the game in the battle sequence against Adel, Baron of Night.

Players can flip the open world by driving into the stained-glass window of Princess Peach on her castle at the center of the map, though there is a catch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/">Mirror Mode must already be unlocked</a> through the Grand Prix and Knockout Tour Cups--on top of some other requirements.</p><p dir="ltr">Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hides-mirror-mode-free-roam-behind-a-mario-64-easter-egg" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://x.com/Ninjinaut/status/1931248124208496810" rel="nofollow ">account on X called Ninjinaut</a> showcased the Mirror Mode Easter egg in Free Roam for Mario Kart World. The video sees Baby Rosalina jumping into the window, which is a direct callback to Super Mario 64's mechanic for accessing new worlds.

Baby Rosalina then shoots out of the window, with the open world now in Mirror Mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that Free Roam is only playable in single-player, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-is-missing-one-feature-people-really-wanted/1100-6532133/">as people realized co-op was missing for the mode</a> when Mario Kart World launched last week alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-rhythm-action-rival-no-straight-roads-is-getting-a-sequel<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Rhythm action game No Straight Roads is set to receive a sequel across PC and consoles next year.</p>
<p>The sequel will continue the adventures of its rock star duo Mayday and Zuke, as they embark on a world tour to "climb the international charts" along with two new playable band members with unique musical and combat styles.</p>
<p>No Straight Roads first released in 2020, followed by an Encore Edition in 2021. Set in a cartoonish world where "real" rock music is overthrown by evil EDM, it fuses combat and platforming with rhythmic timing.</p>

<p>Sound familiar? Essentially, No Straight Roads walked so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-review-an-unrepentant-riot-of-rhythm-action">Hi-Fi Rush could run three years later</a>. And while Tango Gameworks' game is a superior realisation of rhythmic action, Malaysian studio Metronomik's game is still a lot of fun.</p>
<p>For starters, No Straight Roads has an infectious soundtrack, with each song performed in both a rock and EDM style to match the genre clash of the narrative. What's more, the soundtrack dynamically shifts between genres depending on how successfully you're able to beat up the bad guys.</p>
<p>The sequel promises all-new music from previous game's composer James Landino, as well as additional musical guest stars. It will also have "revitalised" combat with collaborative link attacks, a greater focus on action, and a "huge" roster of megabosses to defeat.</p>
<p>"We are SO excited to reveal the first look at NSR2 to fans today," said Wan Hazmer, CEO and game director at Metronomik. "We're taking everything players loved about the first No Straight Roads and turning it up to 11. Expect incredible music, wacky bosses and engaging, imaginative cities to explore on Bunkbed Junction's rocketok tour across the globe! We can't wait for players to rock out with NSR2 in 2026."</p>
<p>Eurogamer described the game as "a quirky but overly simplistic action-adventure" in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-straight-roads-review-a-quirky-but-overly-simplistic-action-adventure">No Straight Roads review</a>. Hopefully the sequel can add some extra depth when it arrives next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a third person shooter that, especially with the sequel launching last year, has become something of a cult classic, though definitely feels like a game from its era.</p>


<p>The Master Crafted Edition, then, is an attempt to modernise the game, bringing updated controls, 4K resolution, improved textures and character models, remastered audio, and additional lines for the Orks to shout at you. You definitely notice the better resolution and the improved textures, especially on enemy models. There was a specific enemy in the original that appeared to lack detail in the facial area, but in this newer version you get much more detail making them a bit more intimidating to look at. The level environments also look more detailed, though there is only so much you can do when a lot of the game is set in corridors with the colour palette of a muddy puddle in an abandoned warehouse. However, as the enemy models stand out more, the game looks decent across the whole campaign.</p>


<p>The modernised controls also attempt to make the game more accessible for today’s audience, but there are some issues. First the weapon selection is not as intuitive as it could be, with the weapon wheel being a bit stiff. Post-patch there is a minor improvement in that the wheel doesn’t just stay on the screen, but there are still some minor delays that can impact the flow of the Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine Master Crafted Edition. In addition, there was an odd decision to originally map the grenade throwing to the right stick. The issue here that to activate the fury meter you have to press the left stick and right stick, which led to grenades being thrown instead of the fury mode being activated which was very frustrating in some areas. Again, an update came out that seems to have addressed this but for the majority of my own playtime this was a regular issue.</p>
<p>There are some minor bugs and issues that also cropped up, including enemies getting caught on the terrain and running in place, and a couple of times where enemies did not react to my presence even when shooting at them. This only happened a couple of times, but it breaks any immersion as you watch a soldier just run against a bit of debris.</p>

<p>If you have played the original release you will be thankful to know that the gameplay remains intact, with the feeling of heavy hitting through out especially when using the hammer and jetpack. Combat can be intense especially when facing the rushing waves of enemies that will quickly swarm you, but the Master Crafted Edition felt a bit easier than the original version, though this could be down to knowing what to expect in each area having recently played through the campaign. All in all, it’s a fun six or seven hours to spend in the Warhammer 40,000 universe, revisiting this game to compare to the newer Space Marine 2.</p>
<p>There is also support for the game’s multiplayer modes, with the original modes including 8v8 play, though this wasn’t an area that we could test prior to release.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine Master Crafted looks very good with its 4k resolution, improved textures, and upgraded character models. It gives people the opportunity to play through the original story of Captain Titus, maintaining the feel of the original release. There were issues with the Master Crafted edition I do not remember experiencing when playing the Anniversary Edition including enemies getting stuck and control issues, though these will hopefully be patched out soon.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156709/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>When was the first time you played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a>? For me, it was right back at its initial launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/no_mans_sky">in 2016</a>, a launch that, for reasons that have been recounted ad nauseam by now, left me fairly miffed overall. Here was a game that was very obviously a huge task for its small (and, as it turned out, phenomenally determined) dev team, a game that promised much — very excitedly — pre-launch, but ultimately failed to deliver in its earliest form.</p>
<p>Fast-forward through what's been <em>quite</em> the nine years since, and here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>; a beefed-up, beautified, and breathtakingly bold space adventure that's got everything Hello Games promised in the first place - plus way, way more besides. It's also a free update for existing owners of the Switch version.</p>
<p>Yes, we may have gotten off to a rough start with this infinitely playable survival classic, and I think we can call it a classic by now, but boy-oh-boy has it grown into something <em>phenomenal</em> at this point. Pre-this review, my last outing with No Man's Sky was a few updates back, so it's been a little bit - and a whole lot extra has been added.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156710/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One of this Switch 2 port's most exciting aspects is that it arrives alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/no-mans-sky-is-landing-a-free-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-on-launch-day">the latest 'Beacon' update</a>. This adds a bunch of settlement management aspects, a new Autophage enemy type, base infestations, building upgrades, new base structures, and more besides. Basically, it's given us the tools to get busy actually affecting, managing, and influencing settlements and their various alien inhabitants, right down to fending off attacks.</p>
<p>It's just another great big wrinkle in what's been a procession of notable new wrinkles over the years, with flying and tameable pet pals, vehicles, improved combat, space dogfights, freighters, corrupted planets...the big additions go on and on. And during all of this, of course, the underlying game, mechanically, visually, and in terms of accessibility (Hello Games goes big on accessibility here), has gone from strength to strength.</p>
<p>Is it perfect? No, it absolutely tries to do too much all at once, and as a result you don't get the very best of everything.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156674/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat, as an example, is fine — it does the job — but it's not a match for a proper action adventure, and those who spend their time in 'serious' space sims may find the systems of commerce, space pirating, and all that good stuff a bit too simplistic. Them's the breaks when you try to fit an entire universe inside a game, I guess.</p>
<p>What the game does nail though — and all of its systems, no matter if they're a little flaky, help in this regard — is the atmosphere and vibe of being in space, a great big infinite, colourful, wild and bizarre space, where you really can get lost, explore, and exist in your own little loops of interest forever.</p>
<p>From the first moments, where you'll be walked through its tutorials (God knows how many times I've done this now), to getting your ship, taking your first flight, finding your first space station...it grows around you until you're consumed, locked in for the long haul.</p>
<figure><a title="No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156673/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The strange narrative that pushes you forward, should you choose to follow it, is beguiling, otherworldly and odd enough that it keeps me hooked, even when I'm occasionally totally overwhelmed by new things. And being overwhelmed can be an issue in the earlier parts of the game, where you unlock a whole lot of tech and have a bunch of mechanics explained to you in fairly short order.</p>
<p>It's worth sticking with, though, because once you're au fait with scanning and collecting, refining, crafting and creating, the feeling of adventure here is pretty much unmatched. Certainly on consoles, at least, and even moreso on consoles that let you play portably.</p>
<p>I've been willing the performance and visuals to be a match for the content on Switch 2, then, because as much as I enjoy No Man's Sky on Switch 1, it is held back a little by a lack of image clarity and sluggishness in combat. This is an experience that deserves to be played without such barriers, and with this Switch 2 version, we're officially in business, as it's pretty much a match for its other console counterparts. Yep, it looks that good - and runs that smoothly - in both docked and handheld, with only the very smallest of stutters (loading into new areas seems to do it) and a handful of minor visual glitches and graphical downgrades here and there.</p>

<p>You should note that, at the moment, it seems some players are having issues using their cross-save files from other consoles due to the fact that this version number isn't a match just yet. Of course, this will be addressed with an update in due course, so it's an annoying but somewhat understandable issue given we're in the first days of this new console.</p>
<p>We also had some bother getting into multiplayer over the first few days with the game, as it turns out this was a bug of some sort, nobody was able to access online, but it's now been remedied, meaning that, for the first time, Switch gamers are getting all of the multiplayer goodness involved in the various modes on offer. The old Switch just couldn't deal with this aspect of the package, but it's all in this time around, and from what I've played over the past day or so, it works as it does on other versions.</p>
<p>As I mentioned a little earlier, there are a ton of accessibility options here, too - you could get lost in these accessibility menus. You've got motion controls, individual Joy-Con sensitivity settings, a choice of button layouts, HUD scalings, colour filters, and adjustments for tap/hold on actions, and a whole lot more besides. Heck, you can even unlock the frame rate.</p>

<p>Indeed, I'm almost certain this is my very first Switch 2 game where I've been blessed with the option of a quality or performance setting. The game is (reportedly, I'm no Digital Foundry) 1080p/40fps and 1440p/30fps at these settings, and that seems about right in my experience. On TV, it can look a little less slick than, for example, my Series X version — which is 100% reasonable — but it's avoiding the Switch 1 issue of having its graphical excisions and cutbacks exposed when on a large screen. It's easily nice enough-looking to be acceptable on a 47-inch TV. (The same, I'm afraid, cannot be said for myself.) With regards to DLSS, I'm not sure I've noticed it thus far. It all looks very sharp, though, so I guess that means any implementation there is going on here is doing a bang-up job.</p>
<p>This really is No Man's Sky without any constraints or excisions, cuts or concessions to tech that can't keep up. And it's a majestic thing, as you'll likely know full well by now. The Beacon update adds more depth for those who want it in the base-building and management aspects, but at this stage, it really is all gravy.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky has long since become a must-play for fans of space survival adventures, and Switch 2 just got itself a bona fide banger of a port. That's all you really need to know. Now, where have I put my hydrospanner?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No Man's Sky - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition brings this excellent, constantly evolving space survival adventure to your new Nintendo console in fine style. This is an almost-perfect match for other versions of the game, barring some very minor hiccups here and there.</p>
<p>Combat is still a bit naff, especially in space, and hardcore pirates might not get all they need from the systems in place here, but other than that, this is an almost perfect port of an almighty behemoth of a game. The sky, it seems, really has no limits.</p></section>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have unleashed the latest twist in the game's Galactic War, with urban battles against the Terminids now on the cards. Rather than defending cities on Super Earth, this time the task is swatting bug invasions of population centres across multiple planets.</p>
<p>A tough assignment, but to be fair, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">successfully protecting their home planet</a> against the still-at-large Illuminate should have given players plenty experience of street fighting (not the Ryu and Chun-Li kind).</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Massive Terminid outbreaks erupted simultaneously across multiple Super Earth cities," reads the latest briefing from developers Arrowhead, "This unprecedented assault of Fascism into highly-populated areas puts millions of citizens in grave danger. The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> must respond immediately."</p>
<p>The order, which dropped not long after the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516337874624317890?l=english">latest patch</a>, is shipping players off to five planets with cities that are being overrun by the bugs. Fighting's already started on Crucible and Alta V, with Volterra, Caramoor, and Inari also on the list of worlds the divers need to hold onto until the end of this order to secure a victory.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">MAJOR ORDER: The remnant Illuminate forces have evaded Justice. Some of their remote bases endure. The unprovoked Illuminate assault on Super Earth will never be forgotten. Justice for the Illuminate atrocities has not been averted—merely postponed, for a greater and more… <a href="https://t.co/WY24mVg21y">pic.twitter.com/WY24mVg21y</a></p>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1932426600030609880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>It's news that, while obviously terrible from a lore perspective, will no doubt be music to the ears of Helldivers 2 players that prefer squashing the bugs over battling the game's other enemy factions. This group, referred to in the HD2 community as "bugdivers", have caught some flak from their fellow soldiers in the past for not lending enough of a hand during non-Terminid MOs. At least this one should put that minor bickering to bed for a little while.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting the result of the last mission if you're returning to the game to fight these bugs following a bit of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">post-battle for Super Earth</a> break. Remnants of the Illuminate, supposedly reeling from that failed invasion, were the target and proved too tough for the divers to overcome.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly given wiping the faction out totally would leave the game with just its two oldest foes, the squids were hiding more in reserve than it first seemed, so they're still kiciing around on remote bases across the galaxy.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the usual bug swarm battles translate to the urban biomes, but this certainly explains why this morning's HD2 patch reworked stealth detection around Terminid spawners and places that kick out flying enemies.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's been five years since Naughty Dog released The Last of Us: Part 2, and with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-showrunners-tease-season-3s-new-direction/1100-6531811/" data-ref-id="1100-6531811">Season 3 of the HBO series in the works</a>, the anticipation and clamoring for a Part 3 has never been higher. However, showrunner Craig Mazin admittedly knows just a hint of the story for the potential game, but isn't sure if it'll ever happen.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__flfZc9JCc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-it-cant-be-for-nothing/1900-6418351/" data-ref-id="1900-6418351">Season 2</a> of The Last of Us, Mazin said game creator and co-showrunner Neil Druckmann told him some ideas he had for a Part 3, but would be okay if the game never came into fruition.</p><p>"I am familiar with some concepts that Neil has kicked around for a potential third game. I don't know if he's zeroed in on one of them. I don't know what will happen there," he explains, adding that although he'd like Part 3 to happen, he also thinks maybe less is more. "Sometimes I think, maybe you should just be happy. Don't be sad it's over--be happy that it happened at all! I think Naughty Dog is an incredible game studio. They make beautiful art, and their ability to convey what we can do in television through animation is pretty remarkable."</p><p>He continued with how he could be selfish and beg Druckmann to make Part 3, but feels as though he would rob the studio of other potentially great games it could make instead.</p><p>"It's not like what I want is going to matter.

That is taking up all of our time," he said. "I am treating these projects like it's the last thing I will ever work on. So my assumption is that there will be no more [The Last of Us games]. If the stars align, and everything comes into place, who knows?"</p><p dir="ltr">Naughty Dog is currently working on multiple games. Alongside Intergalactic, a mystery second game is in development.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-launch-ever-in-the-uk-but-it-still-didnt-beat-the-ps5-or-xbox-series-x-s/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>, data firm NielsenIQ shows that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is the biggest Nintendo console launch in the UK ever. Still, it's not the biggest console launch in the region ever, with the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series consoles still ahead of it.</p>
<p>While the report doesn't provide a specific number, The Game Business says the Switch 2 beat out week-one launch sales in the UK for the Nintendo Switch "<em>by more than two to one,</em>" and also pointed out that the Nintendo Switch managed to sell a little more than 80K units in the UK when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo 3DS, which used to have the record for the best UK launch for a Nintendo device, sold 113K units in its launch.</p>
<p>The Game Business also listed the top-10 console launches in the UK by sales units, with the Nintendo Switch 2 now firmly in fourth place. Here's the full list, per The Game Business:</p>
<ol>
<li>PlayStation 5</li>
<li>PlayStation 4</li>
<li>Xbox Series</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch 2</li>
<li>PlayStation 3</li>
<li>Xbox One</li>
<li>Nintendo Wii</li>
<li>Nintendo Switch</li>
<li>Xbox 360</li>
<li>Xbox One X</li>
</ol>
<p>Reports from the PS5's UK launch claimed it sold more than <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sources-ps5-was-the-uks-biggest-ever-console-launch/">250K units in just two days after launch</a>, and more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-best-selling-next-gen-uk/">450K by the end of 2020</a>. So, until any actual sales numbers are reported, we know that the Switch 2 sold more than 113K units and less than 250K.</p>
<p>It didn't set the all-time record for the UK, but there's no denying that somewhere between 113-250K is a very strong launch for just one region. The Switch 2 also might've set all-time records elsewhere, as it's currently claimed that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/">Switch 2 is now France's fastest-selling console ever</a>, and that Nintendo moved 200K units in France in the console's opening weekend.</p>

<p>That's according to data from NielsenIQ shared by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/switch-2-is-nintendos-biggest-uk">The Game Business</a>. Switch 2 has reportedly outsold the original Switch at launch by over two to one in the UK and has also beaten the Nintendo 3DS, which was previously the company's biggest launch.</p>
<p>While NielsonIQ doesn't share numbers, for comparison the original Switch sold over 80,000 at launch in the UK, and the 3DS sold 113,000.</p>

<p>It's an impressive start, then, as the company has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-predicts-switch-2-will-outsell-its-predecessor-at-launch-despite-demand-exceeding-expectations">predicted globally Switch 2 will sell 15m units</a> from release until the end of the financial year - about on par with the previous console.</p>
<p>However, in the UK at least, Switch 2's launch sits behind its rivals.</p>
<p>In terms of the biggest UK console launches of all time (excluding handhelds), Switch 2 is the fourth best-selling in terms of units - it's behind the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, the Switch 2 is the third best-selling console in the UK - it's beaten the PS4, which was sold for a lower price.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait for official word from Nintendo until we find out the full global numbers for the Switch 2 launch.</p>
<p>At the least, in France the Switch 2 has reportedly sold over 200,000 units in its first weekend to record the best ever console launch in the country (according to <a href="https://x.com/GyoJvfr/status/1932014842652590330">French content creator Gyo</a>).</p>
<p>The news comes despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-switch-2-actually-cheaper-than-the-original-console-cost-in-the-uk-and-whats-the-situation-with-switch-2-pricing-globally">criticism of the console's high cost</a>, as well as the price of its games and accessories around the world.</p>
<p>As for the previous console, Nintendo stated in its previous financial report it expects to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-expects-switch-1-to-become-its-best-selling-hardware-ever-this-year-but-fall-just-short-of-ps2-record">sell a further 4.5m Switch units this year</a>, which would see it overtake the Nintendo DS as the company's best-selling hardware ever.</p>
<p>Globally, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-shipped-an-impressive-4-7m-in-four-months">original Switch sold 4.7m units in its first four months on sale</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has announced Splatoon Raiders, the first spinoff game from the popular ink-splatting shooter, which is coming exclusively to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. There’s also a Switch 2 enhanced update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> coming later this week.</p>
<p><iframe title="Research Report from Squid Research Lab - Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splatoon Raiders will take player to the Spirhalite Islands alongside the splat-tacular Deep Cut trio, casting them as a mechanic to aid in their adventure.</p>
<p>More details will be coming in the future on what this game will actually be like, though it’s no doubt got something to do with the community-led decision in the final Splatfest from last summer.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, there’s some fresh love for Splatoon 3, with an update that adds more content and some Switch 2 enhancements.</p>

<p>The new update for Splatoon 3 will give the game on Switch 2 more detailed visuals and smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds, without affecting play across generations.</p>
<p>All players will also get access to the Splatlands collection. This adds new weapons from the Barazushi and Emberz brand that are based on previous ones, but have been combined with new sub and special weapons. 30 new weapon kits are being added. Oh, and what’s this? Urchin Underpass from the original Splatoon will be added to the stage rotation, too.</p>
<p>All very exciting for Splatoon lovers especially as Splatoon 3 had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/19/the-final-splatoon-3-splatfest-takes-place-in-september-and-it-could-have-big-implications/">its final Splatfest last summer</a>. I’ll admit that Splatoon 3 is a game that I wish I’d played more of. For our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/07/splatoon-3-review/">Splatoon 3 review</a>, I wrote: “Splatoon 3 is a bit like your mum making your favourite meal when you head home for the holidays. It’s been a few years since the last game —&nbsp;while there have been some great improvements and additions, it’s the same old Splatoon we know and love, and that’s still pretty great.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-games-revealed-fall</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-officially-reveals-apple-games-app-coming-this-fall.1214457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-games-revealed-fall<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has officially revealed its new Apple Games app, which the Cupertino tech giant says is intended to become "a dedicated destination for people who love playing games on their Apple devices".</p>

<p>The app was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-gaming-acquisition-rac7" rel="nofollow">reported to be in development by Bloomberg</a> earlier this year, but in a new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/games-app/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Apple confirms that the Apple Games app is available now in developer beta, with all iOS, iPadOS, and macOS users getting the new app this fall.</p>

<p>Apple Games will consist of five distinct tabs: Home, Play Together, Arcade, Library, and Search. Home shows things like highlights, "personalized recommendations", and "editorial selections", as well as friend activity and other game-related info.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=hyXJVi5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-app-what-the-clash.jpg?itok=CTbpJOGQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's new Apple Games app is coming this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Play Together is, as you've probably guessed, a tab that shows you what your friends are up to, while Arcade is the place to go if you're a subscriber to the Apple Arcade service.</p>

<p>Finally, your Library tab collects all of your games in one place, and the Search tab lets you look for specific games, collections, or charts. It's all pretty self-explanatory stuff, really.</p>

<p>With Apple Games, it looks as though Apple wants to create a unified hub for all things gaming on your iOS or macOS device, so if you're the kind of person who routinely whips out your phone for a quick go on an Apple Arcade game, this app is for you.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for Apple Games yet, but it's likely that it'll roll out alongside iOS, macOS, and iPadOS 26, so whenever that major update for your device's operating system arrives, that's also when you'll be able to check out Apple Games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=sN__kk2l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-games-ios-26.jpg?itok=-KL3HeXM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple Games will likely roll out alongside iOS 26 this fall.</figcaption></figure><p>Alongside Apple's acquisition of&nbsp;<em>Sneaky Sasquatch&nbsp;</em>developer RAC7 last month, it seems that this new app is part of a wider push towards gaming. Could this all culminate in the release of a dedicated Apple gaming console? Probably not, but we can dream, right?</p>

<p>In other Apple-related gaming news, Epic's battle royale game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">finally restored to iOS devices</a> last month following a protracted spat between the two companies. Epic previously alleged that Apple blocked the release of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on its devices, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">causing a worldwide outage</a>.</p>

SAG-AFTRA says more about the deal will be shared after members vote to ratify it in the coming weeks. The two sides are still hashing out the terms of the strike suspension agreement, however, so actors will remain on strike for a little longer. <br></p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike,” SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a press release. “Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179">The strike began last July</a></span>, and while it involved demands for pay raises and better onsite working conditions, the biggest sticking point throughout negotiations was the role AI might play in voice recording and performance capture. While actors are currently paid on a session by session basis for specific performances, AI models would make it easy for companies to take that data and replicate an actor’s voice or movements, either altering their creative output or replacing it altogether. </p><p>Back in March, Ashly Burch who plays Aloy in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412">shared her concerns</a></span> about AI replacing actors after an internal tech demo at Sony showed an AI-controlled Aloy having a conversation with a player. SAG-AFTRA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401">recently filed an unfair labor practice</a></span> against Epic Games for using an AI-voiced Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> while still in negotiations. Meanwhile, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545">has said he foresees a possible future</a></span> in which all NPCs are AI-controlled. </p><p>As the strike continued throughout last fall and into 2025, actors in some games saw themselves replaced by other artists in projects like<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, as game companies sought to continue releasing updates. Games like <em>Destiny 2</em>, meanwhile, simply left some characters completely silent who would have otherwise voiced dialogue. Some SAG-AFTRA actors voiced their frustration with the duration of the strike in recent weeks. </p><p>“I hope SAG-AFTRA is aware that, either intentionally or through negligence, an environment has been created around IMA negotiations whereby it is impossible to express a good-faith disagreement without being dismissed as anti-union, a management shill, or both,” voice actor William Salyers, who voiced Otto Octavius in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, wrote on Threads last week. “The damage being done by this will persist long after the strike is settled.” Jennifer Hale, best known as Commander Shepard in <em>Mass Effect</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a></span>, “Vilifying those differences only divides the community.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It doesn't appear to be a hardware problem either, as Switch 2 users have reported that the console isn't correctly registering how much of a battery charge is left, resulting in them being told that they're almost out of power after playing for only a short amount of time.</p><p><a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68272/~/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo" rel="nofollow ">According to Nintendo</a>, the quick fix for this problem is to enter the secret Recovery Mode on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>This should reset the console battery, and it can be done by following these steps:</p><ul><li>Make certain that your Switch 2 has the latest system update</li><li>Power off your Switch 2 completely</li><li>Press and hold down the volume up (+) and volume down (-) buttons, then press the power button <strong>once</strong> to turn the system back on</li><li>Keep holding down the volume buttons until the menu for Recovery Mode appears</li><li>Power off the console again by pressing and holding the power button until it turns off</li><li>Power the console back on</li></ul><p>Our testing confirms that this method does work--my Switch 2 would only charge up to 82% with the power-saving mode enabled but it now reaches a charging percentage of 89%--and there is a second solution here just in case this one doesn't work.</p><p>This requires a few more steps, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/support/articles/the-battery-charge-indicator-or-percentage-displays-incorrectly-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo advises charging the Switch 2 to 100%</a> and then letting the battery drain until it is <em>almost </em>empty--a complete drain is harmful to overall battery life--and then charging it back up to 100% again. Doing this several times should "gradually" improve the battery charge indicator, Nintendo says.</p><ul><li>Ensure the console has the latest system update</li><li>Set all three Auto-Sleep mode settings to "Never"</li><li>Connect the AC adapter directly to the console</li><li>Allow the console to charge until the battery is 100% fully charged, or until the console has been charging for at least three hours</li><li>Leave the console alone and connected to the AC adapter for an additional hour</li><li>When an hour has passed, disconnect the AC adapter from the console and allow the console to display the Home menu for approximately three to four hours</li><li>The remaining battery life must be depleted as much as possible</li><li>Once the battery charge is almost depleted, power off the console and leave it alone for at least 30 minutes</li><li>Repeat these steps 3 several more times</li><li>The battery charge indicator will improve gradually by repeating this process several times</li></ul><p>If that's not enough to fix the problems on the Switch 2, Nintendo recommends sending it in to be serviced. With the Switch 2 now out, owners have discovered several tips for ensuring that the device runs in peak condition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-improve-switch-2-battery-life/1100-6531649/">There are several ways to ensure that the Switch 2 battery has a long life</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-psa-set-up-auto-uploads-to-the-switch-mobile-app-now/1100-6532300/">auto-upload screenshots and videos to the mobile app</a> if you enable that option. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-important-hdr-setting-is-hidden-on-nintendo-switch-2-heres-how-to-find-it/1100-6532293/">An important HDR setting is also hidden on the Switch 2</a>, but enabling it is quite easy.</p>

                <p>Get your Splattershots ready--Nintendo's beloved shooter series Splatoon is getting its first spin-off game. The Nintendo Today app shared the announcement of Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off featuring the Deep Cut idol band from Splatoon 3. It's coming out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a>, while Splatoon 3 is receiving a free Switch 2 update this week.</p><p>The Splatoon Raiders trailer depicted Deep Cut members Shiver, Frye, and Big Man on a helicopter, discussing their next treasure-hunting destination, the Spirhalite Islands. Their helicopter crash-lands, setting the stage for an island adventure. Players will take the role of a mechanic, exploring the mysterious new locale with Deep Cut.</p><p>While the Nintendo Today video showed some action, it didn't share any specific objectives or details about the gameplay loop of Splatoon Raiders. The video also lacked any details about a release window.</p><p>Watch the announcement video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ve2zWmkEA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d7ve2zWmkEA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Meanwhile, the upcoming Splatoon 3 update, scheduled for June 12, will freshen the game up for Nintendo Switch 2. Along with improved visuals and performance, especially in hubs like Splatsville, which were capped at 30fps on the original Switch. More importantly, this version 10.0.0 update for Splatoon 3 includes new weapons.</p><p>The Splatlands Collection of 30 weapons features familiar ink-splatting artillery but with different loadouts of sub- and special weapons, along with unique visual designs. And for the more hardcore competitive players, the upcoming patch includes a new stat in the ranked Anarchy Battles called Series Weapon Power, which tracks win/loss ratios per weapon and matches players with others with similar ratings.</p><p>The Splatoon 3 update is a welcome surprise, considering Nintendo only planned to add new content to the game for two years after its September 2022 launch. It's also another fun addition to the growing list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">Switch 1 games getting a free update</a> for the new hardware. And while Splatoon Raiders isn't necessarily a proper fourth installment, the spin-off may satisfy Splatoon players, especially all those Big Man fans out there.</p>

<p><span>"Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike," SAG-AFTRA national executive director and chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland writes in a press release.

Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified, we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation.

<p>Elsewhere in today's Squid Research Lab Report, Nintendo revealed that version 10 of Splatoon 3 is on its way. It will feature the Splatlands Collection, which consists of 30 weapons from the series' past but refreshed for the game. Plus, weapon freshness caps will be raised, and players can earn new in-game badges. And in the Anarchy Battle Series, players can utilize the Series Weapon Power, a new stat that tracks your effectiveness with a weapon based on your win-loss ratio in battles. It will also be used in matchmaking to put you up against players with similar stats.&nbsp;</p><p>That's not all, though. Nintendo also revealed that Urchin Underpass, a map from the first Splatoon game, will return to the rotation of Splatoon 3. And for Switch 2 players, an upgrade will bring improved visuals, including better resolution and more. The company says this update won't affect play capabilities between Switch and Switch 2 players when it launches this week on June 12.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for this update, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/splatoon-3/multicolored-mayhem"><em>Game Informer's </em>Splatoon 3 review</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope Splatoon Raiders is?

            <p>Early access life sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> will be releasing on Mac this August, the team has announced.</p>
<p>Those interested in picking up InZoi via Mac are able to pre-order now, with the site touting a 20th August release date. "Let your imagination lead the way," the <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1932241322573983768">team wrote on social media</a>, sharing the news.</p>

<p>InZoi was initially released in early access this March, quickly going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">on to break records for publisher Krafton</a>. It crossed the 1m sales mark one week after its debut, however since then the game has struggled to keep its player numbers as high as they were not even three months ago.</p>
<p>Over on Steam, the game currently has a peak concurrent player count of 87,377, which it reached during its launch period. Since then, player numbers have sharply declined, with its current 24-hour peak sitting at a comparatively tiny 1,753. That is a player decline of 97.99 percent (so, 98 percent).</p>
<p>While declining numbers are to be expected following a game's launch, this is a big drop in a pretty short period of time. To compare, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> currently has a 24-hour player peak of 35,871, so InZoi evidently isn't the 'Sims killer' (at least not yet) that some had wondered if it could be.</p>

<p>Even <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-3">The Sims 3</a>, which initially released in June 2009, currently has a similar player count to InZoi, which given that game debuted 16 years ago is quite eye-opening.</p>
<p>Maybe its release on Mac will turn InZoi's fortunes around.</p>

			<p>Big news today for Splatoon fans, as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/splatoon-raiders-the-first-ever-splatoon-spinoff-game-is-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo announced</a> the first Nintendo Switch 2-exclusive Splatoon game with Splatoon Raiders, a spin-off game where players will head to the Spirhalite Islands as a mechanic along with the Deep Cut trio. Nintendo also announced that a new update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/splatoon-3-fresh-yet-familiar/">Splatoon 3</a> will be available on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 later this week on&nbsp;<strong>June 12, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Nintendo announced the news through its Nintendo Today! mobile app, with a short teaser trailer introducing the new adventure. There's not much we know about Splatoon Raiders, like whether it'll be a single-player adventure or if it is a multiplayer-focused game, but the emphasis on the game's core party of characters in this announcement, like the protagonist and the Deep Cut trio, and the short bits of gameplay shown in the trailer seem to suggest it's a narrative-driven title in some sense.</p>
<p>According to a post from the official <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonNA/status/1932423796964606143">Splatoon America account on X</a>, our protagonist for Splatoon Raiders is "<em>an expert mechanic with a mysterious background. That ink tank and walking robot look rather intriguing, wouldn't you say?</em>"</p>

<p>Nintendo also failed to mention when we can expect to see Splatoon Raiders on store shelves, though, as a Switch 2 exclusive, it will be interesting to see how Nintendo prices the game. Since it's a spin-off title, will it come in closer to, say, $50, or will it be the latest Switch 2 exclusive to be priced at $80?</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the Splatoon world, and in the same video following the Splatoon Raiders announcement, Nintendo confirmed that Splatoon 3's version 10.0 update will launch later this week, bringing along with it the return of the Urchin Underpass map from the first Splatoon game, a new set of weapons and cosmetics from the Splatlands Collection, new stats for players to track, and most importantly for Switch 2 owners, "<em>more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds</em>" when playing on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>The update will also add support for Splatoon 3 cross-play between Switch and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/682063/the-new-york-times-nyt-games-crossplay-scrabble-pips<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games team is trying something new: it’s about to start testing a <em>Scrabble</em>-like game it calls <em>Crossplay</em>, but instead of folding the game into the main NYT Games app, <em>Crossplay</em> will be a standalone app. The game is soft launching in New Zealand on iOS on June 10th.</p><p>I was recently shown a demo of the game by Jonathan Knight, head of games at <em>NYT</em>, and I think it will look familiar to any fans of <em>Scrabble</em> or <em>Words with Friends</em>. The game takes place between two players. Each turn, your goal is to build a word out of the up to seven letter tiles on your tray and the letters already on the board. Every letter has a different point value, and you can boost your score by taking advantage of bonus tiles on the board that multiply your letter or word scores.</p><p>(The <em><em>NYT</em></em> did not provide screenshots I could publish; Knight says that a screenshot of the game right now doesn’t represent where it will be when it launches more widely.)</p><div><p>“We’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game”</p></div><p>The <em>NYT</em> has a few of its own tweaks to differentiate <em>Crossplay</em> from similar games, including different positions for bonus tiles and a different letter distribution, Knight says. The end of the game has a clever twist, too: after all of the letter tiles have been drawn from the virtual bag, each player gets just one additional turn instead of having to clear their tray of tiles to end the game.</p><p>Knight argues that <em>Crossplay</em> is its own app because it’s an experience that would be hard to fit in another app. “We’re very specifically wanting to reach all new audiences with this game,” particularly people that love to compete and love word games, he says.</p><p><em>Crossplay</em> requires a free <em>NYT</em> account to play, and your friends from the main <em>NYT</em> Games app will carry over, Knight says. “Certain aspects” of the game will be exclusive to paid subscribers, such as a feature that will help you review your matches. But he says <em>Crossplay</em> won’t have many of the things that can make other free mobile games frustrating.</p><p>“In a world where mobile games have become little mini casinos, and it’s often hard to find the game itself behind all of the treasure chests and friction and aggressive monetization tactics and coins and all of that, we’re really presenting a very pure, classic, elevated version of the game that you can just get in and enjoy without all that business,” Knight says.</p><p>The <em>NYT’s</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition">acquisition of <em>Wordle</em></a> arguably kicked off the race for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279439/news-games-crossword-wordle">daily puzzle games</a>, with places like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23984103/puzzmo-acquired-hearst-zach-gage">Hearst</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152045/linkedin-games-crossclimb-queens-pinpoint">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276945/netflix-is-getting-a-daily-word-game-from-ted">Netflix</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24295846/words-with-friends-single-player-daily-puzzles-wordle">Zynga</a> putting their own stamps on the genre. Overall, the <em>NYT’s</em> games business is growing, according to Knight, including “tremendous downloads,” growing app use, and subscriptions.</p><p><em>NYT</em> puzzles were played 11.1 billion times in 2024, according to statistics shared with <em>The Verge</em> by <em>NYT</em> spokesperson Jordan Cohen. <em>Wordle</em> was played 5.3 billion times, “3.3 billion successful <em>Connections</em> were made,” and <em>Strands</em>, the <em>NYT’s</em> word search game, was played 1.3 billion times.</p><p>The <em>NYT</em> games team is still developing new puzzles for the main games app, such as <em>Pips</em>, a logic game, that it started beta testing in Canada in April.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
