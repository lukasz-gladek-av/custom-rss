His videos and his mod hit the headlines in January as information-starved GTA fans flocked to experience a fan-made approximation of what they can expect to play officially when GTA 6 launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S this fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last week, Dark Space received the dreaded strike notification from YouTube after Take-Two issued a copyright removal request. If a YouTube channel receives multiple copyright strikes, it runs the risk of being terminated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Dark Space removed all download links to his mod, despite the fact he has yet to be asked to do so by Take-Two, and published <a href="https://youtu.be/7LmLfJAuR_U?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a response video</a> on his channel calling out the company for its actions and suggesting it was the result of the mod's take on GTA 6's map being "probably a little too accurate."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space was more philosophical in a follow-up interview with IGN. “I expected this would happen based on their past takedowns,” the modder said. “I went into this project knowing it was a possibility, and the fact that it happened does not surprise me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark Space said he believes Take-Two went after his mod because it was based on an online GTA 6 community mapping project that uses leaked coordinate points to “perfectly” map out the upcoming virtual space, and as a result might have ruined the surprise for players and the internet at large.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's probably the biggest red flag, although most of the work in my map was based on the trailer shots,” Dark Space added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think my map could have ruined the surprise of their map, which I get. If you spent years building out this amazing game world just to have some YouTuber spoil the experience of the map's shape, size, and vibe... I'd want it removed too.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Dark Space’s GTA 6 mod project is no more. And that’s not just for YouTube videos of it, that’s for the entire thing. “Well they clearly do not want this project to exist,” Dark Space said. “So it's not just under threat, it's eliminated. There’s no point putting more time into something that goes directly against what they’re willing to allow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just going to keep making videos that people hopefully like. I probably won't do anything else modding GTA 5 in relation to GTA 6, since it seems dangerous.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now concerns that the GTA 6 community mapping project could be next in Take-Two’s sights.

			<p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 might be nearly at the end of its long and troublesome development cycle. It's been over 20 years since Troika Games released the original game, which, between its lack of polish and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simultaneous release of behemoths</a> like GTA: San Andreas, Counter-Strike: Source, Halo 2, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Half-Life 2, and MGS 3: Snake Eater, couldn't sell enough to keep the developer afloat. However, there was an excellent roleplaying game buried underneath those bugs, and it quickly became a cult classic.</p>
<p>Bloodlines 2 was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in March 2019. Developer Hardsuit Labs, previously known for Blacklight: Retribution, had successfully pitched a sequel to IP owner Paradox Interactive. The wait wasn't supposed to be long at all, with the game immediately pinned for an early 2020 launch window, and with the original writer Brian Mitsoda onboard, the anticipation was building quickly.</p>
<p>However, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-to-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to 2021, and that was really just the beginning of its troubles. A few months later, Mitsoda <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-loses-creative-director-writer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the team</a>. The real shocking news came in February 2021, though, when Paradox announced it had lost faith in Hardsuit's capacity to deliver a solid product. As such, the developer was being <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely-as-its-developer-is-being-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a>. Later that year, the Paradox CEO <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-almost-cancelled-after-hardsuit-labs-was-taken-off-the-project-paradox-ceo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> the game had come close to being canceled, but another studio had successfully delivered a new pitch that kept it alive and kicking.</p>
<p>We had to wait two years to <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn</a> that the studio was The Chinese Room. The new project's launch window was Fall 2024, which obviously didn't happen. However, there's light at the end of the tunnel. The ESRB has now <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> Bloodlines 2, which is a good guarantee it will launch within the next six months at the latest. The rating is Mature (17+), the same as the original; we've posted the regulator's overview below, though beware of slight spoilers.</p>
<p><em>This is an action role-playing game in which players help two vampires regain their memories and their powers to stop an uprising. From a first-person perspective, players explore city streets, investigate murders, interact with characters, and battle vampires in melee-style combat. Players use physical attacks (e.g., claw slashes, kicks, feed/bite attacks) and vampiric powers (e.g., telekinesis, possession) to kill enemy vampires. Players can also employ stealth attacks (e.g., neck snap, feed attack) to kill enemies discreetly. Battles are frenetic, accompanied by impact sounds, realistic gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks can result in close-up sequences of players' character decapitating and/or impaling enemies. A handful of areas depict decapitated corpses in pools of blood; large bloodstains also appear in several environments. The game contains suggestive/sexual material in the dialogue (e.g., "snacking on wh*res,"; “p*ssy musta...real sweet”; and “D*ldo of consequence don't come lubed, does it?”). The word “f**k” is heard in the game.</em></p>
<p>This will be The Chinese Room's first role-playing game, so fans are naturally apprehensive about the outcome. Still, the UK studio has been very forthcoming with details, publishing developer diaries on practically every aspect of the game.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon.1142859/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/minecraft-to-get-vibrant-visuals-graphics-update-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the weekend's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zcZJcXRdw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft Live stream</a>, Mojang announced the upcoming 'Vibrant Visuals' update that will land soon for the Bedrock Edition of the best-selling game ever.</p>
<p>The developers described it as the studio's vision for what the game should look like when injected with modern graphics features, such as directional lighting, volumetric fog, dynamic shadows, water reflections, and more.</p>
<p>Improvements such as volumetric lighting mean players will see the sun's rays cut across the overworld, with each block casting its own shadow. Light will shine through windows, and you'll be able to see reflections not only in water but also on the surface of metal blocks, while subsurface scattering adds a soft glow to leaves and grass.&nbsp;Mobs and items will also have more glow - spider eyes will be even more menacing in the dark, and torches will cast a glowing path back to your build. This will be particularly striking while in the deep dark.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Mojang clarified that Vibrant Visuals is merely a cosmetic update to Minecraft. As such, it won't affect the gameplay mechanics in any way. This means that existing lighting mechanics, such as when enemy mobs are allowed to burn, crop growth, daylight detectors, mob farms, and more will continue to work exactly as before. This is important because it makes it so players in the same realm can all play together, whether they are using Vibrant Visuals or not. During Minecraft Live, Art Director Jasper Boerstra said:</p>
<p><em>Vibrant Visuals is backward compatible with Old Worlds, and it runs locally - so you can play with friends who don't have it enabled.</em></p>
<p>The developers are currently testing Vibrant Visuals on various devices compatible with Bedrock Edition. Soon, this version will be available via beta or preview for users to test. Mojang also said they will eventually port this graphics update to the Java Edition, too.</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a powerful PC with GeForce RTX hardware, <a href="https://wccftech.com/minecraft-rtx-beta-primer-info-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minecraft With RTX</a> remains the best way to experience the game from a visual standpoint.</p>

<p>Atlanta FaZe is shaping up to be the most dominant team in Call of Duty esports after decimating all comers this weekend at Major II. The Call of Duty League was FaZe’s plaything these last few days, and a 4-0 sweep in the grand final against Vancouver Surge proved that without any doubt.</p>



<p>This is FaZe’s third LAN win back-to-back, counting the Esports World Cup in Riyadh. The team is in monumental form and has achieved a feat that hasn’t been seen since 2016, plus they’re on a 13 LAN map win streak to boot.</p>



<p>Incredible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-up">FaZe Up</h2>



<p>This Major II tournament was light work for Atlanta FaZe. I referred to it as ‘Sweep City Central’ because almost every match was a 3-0 result, except for a few, and only one match went to a game five. Atlanta FaZe enjoyed the lion’s share, walking all over Minnesota Rokkr, Cloud9, and Vancouver Surge <strong>twice</strong>.</p>



<p>Everyone thought an underdog win would happen, given that Toronto Ultra had gone on one of the most impressive lower bracket runs in COD esports history. Ultra produced a perfect record in the form of a 12-map streak before meeting Vancouver Surge and succumbing in the elimination finals.</p>



<p>FaZe’s sweep in the ultimate stage was nothing short of monumental. The flow state that we know the team is capable of was achieved and Vancouver Surge – even with the late addition of Neptune – just couldn’t respond. Except for the round of Control, every map was a wash, with FaZe barely giving Surge space to breathe.</p>



<p>Cellium secured the record for the highest finals KD in CDL history at 1.72, and Drazah earned himself another chip and yet another reason to stand above the haters with their classic chant.</p>



<p>This was a phenomenal Major, and now we look to Major III, which will take place in Florida between April 24 – 27.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-has-been-refused-classification-in-australia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Automated RC rating is unlikely to be the end of the story.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>UPDATE:</strong> There is added confusion over Silent Hill f's classification in Australia. The rating reported below has been removed, and the Australian Classification Board has confirmed it has not actually been rated at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> Konami’s upcoming Silent Hill f has been refused classification in Australia, meaning the game would not be able to be sold within Australia at this time. However, Silent Hill f’s RC rating has been assigned by an automated rating tool and not via actual Australian Classification Board members so, based on precedent, it’s unlikely this is the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami does not distribute its own games locally in Australia, but IGN has contacted its third-party distribution partner for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The specific reason for Silent Hill f’s RC rating has not been supplied at this time. Since the introduction of an adults-only category for games in Australia (R18+) in January 2013, games that have been refused classification in Australia are only typically flagged for sexual activity with a person who appears to be a child under 18, visual depictions of sexual violence, or tying incentives and rewards to drug use. 2008’s Silent Hill: Homecoming was initially refused classification in Australia in the lead up to its release due to a high impact torture scene but that was several years prior to the introduction of the R18+ rating, which now accommodates high impact levels of violence. Silent Hill: Homecoming was later released in Australia with altered camera angles for the problem scene, rated MA15+.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What we already know, however, is that Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia has actually been assigned by an online tool maintained by the International Age Rating Coalition – which is a classification system designed for mobile and digitally delivered games. The IARC classification tool is an online questionnaire where applicants simply answer a series of questions about a game’s content. The IARC tool will subsequently assign an automated rating from each territory based on the classification standards from each participating country. In Australia's case, the IARC tool then sends the decision to be published automatically on <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia’s National Classification Database.</a></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/24/iarc-1742775870177.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, the tool can only be used for digitally-distributed games (it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/29/major-australian-classification-amendment-passes-senate"><u>adopted in 2014</u></a> due to the fact that, while the Australian Classification Board was rating an average of 755 games per year, over 40,000 games were being released annually on the iOS app store alone at that time). There have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/22/no-kingdom-come-deliverance-we-happy-few-are-not-banned-in-australia"><u>a number of instances where automated IARC ratings have demonstrated a tendency to trend higher than human ratings</u></a> from the Classification Board. For example, in 2019 Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few were widely reported to have suddenly been banned in Australia when they had not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IARC tool is free to use, which particularly benefits small publishers and developers. Importantly, all physical releases are still required to be rated by the Classification Board itself so, if Silent Hill f is planning to have a physical release in Australia, a submission to the Classification Board was always going to be mandatory, anyhow. The Classification Board itself can override any classification given by the IARC tool if it disagrees with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, game publishers can either have staff members who are accredited classifiers or authorised assessors. Accredited classifiers are in-house staff who complete training from the Classification Board and can classify games themselves, and their decision will take effect as an official Classification Board decision. Authorised assessors are staff or contractors who have similar training, but their classification decision is limited to a recommendation made to the Australian Classification Board, which must then decide whether to apply it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it’s too early to say whether Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia will be upheld after further actions or not. It is, however, the first Silent Hill game to get <u>an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/new-system-old-me/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I spent a good portion of last weekend breaking in a new gaming PC that I ordered the day Nvidia 50XX series cards were listed. It was a new calendar year, so it was at least justifiable as a business expense. I also figured that, if we were rocketing towards a major global recession <em>and </em>authoritarianism in the United States, I’d at least have gotten a nice PC before everything went to hell.</p><p>I have found this less comforting than I imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, on Saturday morning I was unboxing a new PC and slowly logging back into every gaming service under the sun. With each new game library I added, I scanned the list of games looking for the ones I was most eager to try-out with new hardware.</p><p>This ritual used to mean more: in the breakneck pace of video card development in the late 90s and early 2000s, a new card meant that every game from the last three years might be utterly transformed. The game that barely ran at 640x480 a couple years ago was now running with silky-smooth framerates at a godlike 1024x768. Who could ever need more? Except of course there was always this year’s new hotness, mocking your upgrades. Because in the time it took you to save up for and install a new graphics card, a new wave of cards was about to come out and developers were targeting<em> those </em>specs instead.&nbsp;</p><p>That “keeping up with the Joneses” quality of PC gaming was frustrating, but was also responsible for one of my favorite aspects of the hobby: with every upgrade, you kind of re-gifted old games to yourself. This Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87tvXIIMJes&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>video on <em>MechWarrior 2</em></u></a><em> </em>does a great job of showing just how radically a game might change within the span of a few years, via new editions for different video cards or later “complete / collector” releases that rolled together expansions and a slew of updates. The <em>MechWarrior 2 </em>I played in 1995 looked and felt completely different than the version for ATI cards I was playing a year later, which was again different from the version of <em>Mercenaries </em>I was playing in 1997. What did the sky look like in <em>MechWarrior 2</em>? Well, it depends on what you played it on.</p><p>That doesn’t happen anymore. Performance gains are far more marginal and improvements in graphics technology and techniques are more subtle. You can give yourself eye strain trying to spot the difference between “high” and “ultra” graphics on a lot of newer releases, and the fancy upscaling that does such a good job of stabilizing framerates also means that it’s harder to tell without benchmarks how well a game is actually running. Nowadays, the only place I can really feel the difference in hardware is when I turn on ray-tracing and see whether the result is beautiful but unplayable, beautiful but nauseatingly choppy, or beautiful and tolerable.</p><p>Nevertheless, I still perform the ritual. I load up games whose performance and visuals I know intimately, and that I’m always happy to return to even if they’re increasingly unable to challenge modern systems. And then there are always a few games I have saved for later, knowing they are made to be technical showcases.</p><p>These are my current benchmark games. For the most part, they're old standbys, the ones that make a new system feel like home and remind me what great artists can do with all the tech crammed into a PC case.</p><h3 id="total-war-three-kingdoms"><strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong></h3><figure><div></div></figure><p>It’s really time to move on from this as a hardware trial, but this has been the first game I install on a new PC since it came out. Some other <em>Total War </em>games are harder to max out, but there are no recent ones I find as beautiful as this one and it’s easily the best strategy game Creative Assembly ever made. It couldn’t make a 4090 break a sweat on max settings, but I’ll be damned if I don’t love seeing huge armies crawling across&nbsp; those huge expanses of Han China, or zooming the camera into the fray under a canopy of falling leaves in an autumn rainstorm. </p><p>Does Zhang Fei hit any harder when he dashes into a line of soldiers like a meteor striking the earth when you’re easily hitting 120 FPS on a big-screen TV? No, but it <em>always </em>looks awesome and reminds me of why I got into tactics games.</p><figure><figcaption><span>When your new computer has already lost the mandate of heaven.</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, there <em>are</em> times an older games makes you start to wonder if the increasing number of tricks graphics cards are employing to eke out performance gains, and the scorching heat that modern systems generate, aren't going to wreak havoc with some older games. For instance, I have no idea why occasionally <em>Three Kingdoms </em>has a bunch of textures just come in as pure green pixels. But it doesn't seem good!</p>

<p>According to graphics uncovered by billbil-kun, pre-orderers will get The Last Crusade pack, which includes the travelling suit outfit and the lion tamer whip, while those who buy the premium edition will secure two days' early access to the DLC The Order of Giants, as well as a digital art book and the Temple of Doom outfit, on top of the pre-order bonuses. It seems the premium edition will be available as both a digital and physical version.</p> <div>

<p>Billbil-kun has also asserted that a game disc will be included in the physical version of the premium edition, although it seems "an internet connection will still be required to download the game and its content".</p>
<p>Challenged on their sources, Billbil said the information comes via "metadata".</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five-star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames".

<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>
