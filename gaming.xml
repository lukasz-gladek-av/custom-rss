            <p>It is that time of year again, folks.</p>
<p>Steam has announced that its summer sale - often lauded as being one of PC gaming's most important and beloved annual oppurtunities to save some money - will kick off in just a couple of days, on 27th June.</p>
<p>"Fighting games? Check. RPGs? Check. Relaxing? Hack &amp; Slash? Adventure? FPS? Check, Check, Check, Check. In other words, ALL genres," Valve teased in the sale's promo video, which you can watch below. That includes deals on some of this year's most popular releases, such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> (pictured above) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/manor-lords-tips-how-to-get-started-and-what-to-do-first-9431">Manor Lords</a></p>

<p>In addition to deals on games, the company is also offering <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">15 percent off its Steam Deck 64GB LCD and 512GB LCD models</a>. This deal will be available "through the end of the Summer Sale", Valve said. </p>
<p>The Steam summer sale will run until 11th July. So, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">have you got your eye on anything</a>?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-0-to-introduce-120-fps-support-on-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s.910422/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch will bring plenty of visual improvements to the MMORPG, as well as 120 FPS support on consoles and NVIDIA DLSS support on PC, among other things.</p>
<p>As confirmed by the preliminary 7.0 patch notes found on the game's official website, the upcoming patch will introduce 120 FPS support on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game, however, is not expected to run at the maximum framerate all the time, so it will be very interesting to see how it will run with the new visual improvements the patch will bring, which include improved hair and face textures, changes in lighting due to the passage of time, soft shadows, improvement for lenses in glasses and other glass objects, metallic material on certain gear, water and waves, fog, textures of distant terrain when riding a Mount and more.</p>
<p>The upcoming Final Fantasy XIV patch will also bring some PC-specific improvements, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-benchmark-test-previews-nvidia-dlss-amd-fsr-additions-and-graphics-improvements/">AMD FSR 1.0 and NVIDIA DLSS 2.0 upscaling</a>, which were both announced a while back, anti-aliasing via TSMCAA and SSAO via GTAO.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy XIV 7.0 patch also brings plenty of additional content as part of the new Dawntrail expansion. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XIV is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game could be released on Nintendo Switch 2 as well, but not in its launch window.</p>

            <p>
Square Enix has released the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d">full patch notes for Patch 7.0</a>, ahead of Dawntrail's early access launch later this week.

</p>
<p>
The notes give a rundown of what additions and tweaks players can expect from the new expansion. Much of this includes known and expected changes like level cap increases and new quests, on top of a look at new locations and duties. If you're avoiding spoilers, you may want to skip the notes.
</p>
<p>
However, there are also some smaller but welcome additions worth pointing out, as well as a stark look at the visual changes the graphical update will bring.

<p>

Firstly, though, it should be pointed out Final Fantasy 14 will be unavailable to access from 26th - 27th June as maintenance is performed across all Worlds in preparation for Dawntrail. These patch notes explain what will be implemented.
</p>
<p>
As already widely reported since the announcement at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-next-expansion-dawntrail-will-be-the-very-best-summer-vacation">Las Vegas Fan Fest</a>, Patch 7.0 will introduce a graphical update that's been applied for all Dawntrail content, with similar updates coming to older content in future updates. The update includes improved textures and lighting, as well as other more subtle effects and changes.
</p>
<p>
In the patch notes, a couple of slider images indicate the improved textures - it looks like wearing glasses after having blurry vision. The aim of this update is to futureproof the game for years to come.
</p>
<p>
To ensure players are happy with the graphical changes to their characters, everyone will receive a free Fantasia item with which to edit their character. Now, though, players will have up to 60 minutes of in-game time in which to re-edit their character should they change their minds once seeing their character in action.
</p>
<p>
Further, the patch will introduce new hairstyles, the ability to add two colours when dying gear, and a separate option for facewear - so now you can wear glasses and a helmet together.
</p>
<p>
Two other tweaks are very welcome. The first, as previously mentioned in the Live Letter from the Producer but worth reiterating, is that other players around a quest giver can be temporarily hidden - a major tweak considering the high number of players expected for Dawntrail's launch.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Secondly, quest objectives that require following an NPC now have visual indicators to help avoid detection. Endwalker introduced a number of these stealth missions, but they sometimes proved frustrating.
</p>
<p>
Other small tweaks include: the ability to use a DualSense Edge controller on Windows; trophies and achievements unlocking from play on other platforms; and the addition of the mute list and term filter for better safety.
</p>
<p>
And, very importantly, there is now a new adorable llama mount.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the notes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-server-capacity-increased-by-roughly-50-compared-to-launch-of-endwalker">reiterate measures temporarily implemented to reduce server congestion</a>: restricting travel between certain Worlds and data centres; automatic logout after 30 minutes of inactivity; and new areas being split into multiple instances.
</p>
<p>
Dawntrail releases in early access this Friday, 28th June, with the full launch arriving on 2nd July. This was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-dawntrail-wont-release-until-the-end-of-june-so-you-can-play-the-elden-ring-dlc">pushed back a week</a> due to the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree.
</p>
<p>
I played a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">preview version of Dawntrail last month</a> and described it as Final Fantasy 14 "at its most colourful".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-1080p-not-smart-performance-concerns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is rumored to feature a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-conservative-hardware-evolution/">1080p screen</a>, but this may not be the smartest decision due to various reasons, including mishandled backward compatibility.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QzCkpTE0bM0?si=k3F_0juuhO3ZK0nc&amp;t=5007" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DF Direct Weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry answered a fan question regarding the next Nintendo console, commenting on how a 1080p screen may not be the best of choices. If the console supports backward compatibility with the original Switch games, as rumored, it could lead to some image quality issues, as games in portable mode on the current console output at 720p resolution, which would look blurry on a 1080p screen. To address this issue, the Nintendo Switch 2 would essentially have to use backward compatible game's docked mode, which output at 1080p resolution, while running them in portable mode.</p>
<p>Even for Nintendo Switch 2 games, a 1080p screen could be an issue. While developers can certainly target 720p resolution, it wouldn't look good on such a screen. On the other hand, NVIDIA DLSS support could be quite helpful in this regard, as 540p resolution upscaled to 1080p would look better than 720p resolution on a 1080p screen. Digital Foundry, however, feels that a 720p screen would be more beneficial for the system, as a lower resolution could leave more performance headroom in portable mode and would still look good, as proved by the Steam Deck. HDR support would also be quite an update over the current Switch models.</p>
<p><iframe title="DF Direct Weekly #168: Starfield Series S 60FPS, New PS2 Emu For PS5, ARM Windows Gaming Disappoints" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QzCkpTE0bM0?start=5007&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Nintendo Switch 2, but more information on the system, rumored to launch in the first few months of 2025, should be coming before the end of the year.</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has booted a bunch of fans from a Pokémon card art contest, after claims several entrants used AI to aid their submissions. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1805430785056588279">statement</a> today from The Pokémon Company claimed that "select entrants" among the competition's top 300 quarter-finalists had been found to have "violated the official contest rules", leading to their disqualification.

<p>
The statement does not name AI specifically as the reason behind the action being taken, but a quick glance at the company's previous announcement on the matter shows an array of complaints from fans on social media pointing to what they believe to be AI art making the contest's quarter-final cut.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">it's all the submissions that follow the V_____ K______ naming convention. Pretty brazen of them tbh. These scores are wildly high, meaning very little editing was done to the AI renders.

The Pokémon TCG Illustration Contest is a semi-regular oppurtunity for fans to show off their artistic prowess and win both prize money and a chance at getting their creation printed on an actual Pokémon card. The top cash prize is $5k, around £3940.
</p>
<p>
300 pieces of artwork from finalists were posted to the Pokémon website two weeks ago, though various entrants (some with strikingly similar artist names) were quickly highlighted as likely being AI-generated. 
</p>
<p>
There's no explanation by Pokémon today of why it failed to detect likely AI involvement before now, or why numerous similar author names were not flagged as suspicious. 
</p>
<p>
Still, at least this time Pokémon players weren't <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/03/spanish_pokemon_team_disgraced">disqualified for flinging poo</a>.

            <p>A little show called Fallout released back in April - you may have heard of it - which received scores of praise on its release, including in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">our own Fallout review</a> that called it "a lovely, if blood-spattered, surprise". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Fallout's original creator Tim Cain also had nothing but praise</a>  for the adaptation.</p>
<p>During its first 16 days on Amazon Prime, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">65 million viewers tuned in</a> to follow Lucy, Maximus and The Ghoul as they made their way through the Fallout wasteland. It ultimately came as no surprise when the series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>.</p>
<p>But, what does season two have in store? The first series finished with an obvious story thread for the Fallout team to follow, and now the showrunners have confirmed one video game character that will definitely show up when season two hits the streaming service. Please note, <strong>there will be spoilers for the Fallout series (game and show) below</strong>.</p>

<p>The first season of Fallout ends with disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean in his pinched Brotherhood of Steel Power Armour, fleeing towards a ruined New Vegas. Showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-showrunners-discuss-season-two-location-and-why-the-series-doesnt-need-to-follow-a-canon-ending">previously confirmed the next season will head to New Vegas</a>, adding its ruined state is to show the audience that "things have happened" to the location since the events of New Vegas the game (which, canonically, were 15 years prior to the show).</p>
<p>But while things have clearly happened between the events of the game and the show, one popular character will still be featured in some way for season two - that of Robert House, aka New Vegas' enigmatic leader Mr. House.</p>
<p>"Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound," Wagner said in conversation with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8Q0Ch50lNU">Variety</a>. "Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House's town. Robert House will be involved in season two."  Robertson-Dworet added coyly House "might have something to do with it".</p>
<p>Robert House had a brief cameo in the first season of Amazon's Fallout show, popping up during a meeting between Vault-Tec executives and various other corporation heads and CEOs. It was during this meeting the notion that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-show-finale-answers-long-running-series-mystery">Vault-Tec itself may have dropped the bombs</a> was first floated.</p>

<p>As to <em>how </em>House will appear in season two, for now that remains unknown. Will he still be leading in some way, or will his name merely be that of a time now past, spoken by those still left in New Vegas? Or, will his part be explored via flashbacks? We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fallout's showrunners said they want to get the second season of Amazon's adaptation out swiftly, with Robertson-Dworet and Wagner stating the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">Fallout team is "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible"</a>.</p>

            <p>Deadrop developers Midnight Society have "terminated" their relationship with studio co-founder and celebrity streamer Herschel "Guy" Beahm, aka  "Dr Disrespect", over fresh allegations about the reasons for his infamous Twitch ban in 2020. </p><!--more-->
<p>At the time of the ban, which came just a few months after Beahm and Twitch announced <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/dr-disrespect-signs-multi-year-deal-stay-twitch-1283878/">a two-year exclusivity contract</a>, Twitch <a href="https://x.com/Shannon_Liao/status/1276617617730568195">commented only</a> that Beahm had been jettisoned for acting "in violation of our Community Guidelines". Beahm himself described the move as "a total shock" in a later conversation with the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/07/16/dr-disrespect-is-speaking-again/">Washington Post</a>. In August 2021, he <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/dr-disrespect-is-suing-the-fuck-out-of-twitch/">took Twitch to court over the ban</a>, but the dispute was eventually <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/drdisrespect-settles-his-lawsuit-with-twitch/">settled</a> with neither party admitting any wrongdoing. </p>
<p>Last week, however, former Twitch strategic partnerships account director Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">alleged in a Xitter post</a> that an unnamed person "got banned because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang." (Twitch Whispers is a now-retired private 1-to-1 messaging service.) According to two anonymous former Twitch employees <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">cited by the Verge</a> in a subsequent investigation - one of whom worked on Twitch's trust and safety team at the time of the ban -  the unnamed person in question was Beahm.</p>
<p>As to why it's taken Conners this long to make the allegations, he posted <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1805086524247245217">a rather elliptical comment</a> just yesterday suggesting that "the information had been so normalized, declawed in the circles that I ran in that could be reduced to allusion and entendre.</p>
<p>"For everyone who has since said "that’s fucked" — I agreed with you on Friday night before you wrote it," Conners went on. "I should have agreed with you sooner."</p>
<p>Beahm hasn't yet addressed these latest claims about his behaviour, beyond <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">tweeting last week</a> that "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet. I didn't do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."</p>
<p>Beahm's and Conners' statements have, as you'd expect, been the subject of much discussion on social media. Responding to this, Beahm told viewers of a Twitch stream yesterday (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">Eurogamer</a>) that he needed to take a "step back" from his work at Midnight Society. "I mean I'm gonna have to relay this to the Midnight Society, but, you know, maybe I step away from there too," he said. "Just completely remove myself from the scene. It's what I need to do." </p>
<p>Shortly after that stream, The Midnight Society <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">ran a statement of their own</a> acknowledging the allegation, and declaring that they would part ways with Beahm "in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals" following an internal inquiry. Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder's Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.</p>
<p>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act.</p>
<p>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </p>
<p>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've mailed a representative of Beahm to ask for comment about Midnight Society's statement.</p>
<p>Back in 2020 around the time of Beahm's ban, there was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/industry-hit-with-second-wave-of-abuse-allegations">a wave of revelations about abuse, manipulation and predatory behaviour</a> on the part of streamers and influencers across Twitch and Youtube, alongside a few developers or journalists. In September 2022, Twitch was the subject of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitch-problem-with-child-predators/">Bloomberg</a> report into cases of child grooming, following which the platform holder <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Our-Work-to-Combat-Online-Grooming?language=en_US">announced plans</a> to improve safety measures, including better moderation and "expanding the signals" for catching and blocking users who are younger than 13.</p>

        <p>Korean developer currently under investigation by the Ministry of Labor and Employment as it amassed millions in debts</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Challengers Games is shutting down, with its latest title Second Wave no longer available as of yesterday.</p>
<p>In a long post shared on the <a href="https://www.challengersgames.com/goodbye-heroes-of-armantia-and-koji-villagers/">studio's website</a>, CEO and studio head Koji Tamura shared that the Seoul-based firm has ₩2.4 billion worth of debts (around $1.7 million), and is currently under investigation by the Ministry of Labor and Employment.</p>
<p>The company's accounts have been seized, and the teams have not been paid since March 2024, he added, saying they were "hoping for a miracle."</p>
<p>This follows ongoing struggles with funding and development  of its titles Illang and Second Wave, the latter having been poorly received when it came out in Early Access last month.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that Second Wave will unfortunately not be able to continue in July, because quite frankly, we have absolutely no money to pay for the servers, and ultimately the servers will end up shutting down," Tamura said,.</p>
<p>He continued: "I wanted to make the game a success, but I apologise to everyone for not being able to do so. I also feel a heavy responsibility for the overdue wages. I will find a way to pay everyone."</p>
<p>Tamura said it's not impossible that Challengers Games will be back though, adding: "We will start over and we will announce things when we are ready."</p>
<p>Players who purchased Second Wave on Steam will be refunded, and its Discord server will shut down in July.</p>

            <p>
Monster hit Palworld is yet to receive any formal legal threat from Nintendo or The Pokémon Company, the game's developer has confirmed, despite continuing close comparisons between its creature designs.
</p>
<p>
Palworld's breakout success at the beginning of this year - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">and its obvious similarities to Pokémon</a> - prompted a rare public statement from The Pokémon Company, which pledged to "investigate and take appropriate measures to address any acts that infringe on intellectual property rights related to the Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
But, speaking to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">GameFile</a>, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe said that threat was never followed up behind the scenes.

<p>
"[We heard] nothing at all," Mizobe said. "Nintendo and the Pokémon Company didn't say anything to us."
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Mizobe discussed how his career as a game developer got started via a year-long training programme backed by Nintendo. As a student in the programme, Mizobe ultimately helped launch a free downloadable game for the Nintendo DSi (a simple shooter named The Tentai Show launched only in Japan, it tasked players with defending Earth from impending meteoroids).
</p>
<p>
"I always think: To make new things is very hard," Mizobe said when asked what he'd learned from working with Nintendo.

<p>
"In game development, of course, sometimes we have to do it, but, as much as possible, I try to avoid creating new things."
</p>
<p>
Next up for Mizobe is continuing work on Palworld, which will this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">get a new island to explore and a PVP arena</a>, and the ongoing addition of more "Pals". A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">PlayStation 5 version of Palworld</a> has also been teased as on the way.
</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan, who worked at the company for 12 years, said earlier this year that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">he was "surprised" Palworld had "got this far"</a>.</p>

            <p>A corn dog is something I’ve never eaten, because they’re not really a thing in UK. I am morbidly curious about them, although I cannot ascertain their texture just by looking, which worries me. A Khorne dog, however, is a texturally simpler proposition. You can tell just by looking at today’s new legendary hero for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War Warhammer 3</a> that he’d be quite difficult to chew, should you get to that point. Either way, the price is definitely easy to swallow - he’s completely free as part of today’s patch 5.1.0, which also brings substantial changes to multiplayer.</p>

<p>The headline items for the patch - which precedes a promised deep dive into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greenskins-ogres-and-khorne-are-all-coming-in-the-next-dlc-for-total-war-warhammer-3">the next DLC </a>tomorrow - are mostly centered around multiplayer. First up, there’s the new competitive multiplayer Conquest Mode. They’re effectively land battles but with a single capture point in the middle of the map. “With the addition of a capture point that serves as an alternate win condition, we incentivise players to fight in the centre of the map,”  <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war-warhammer/blogs/23-total-war-warhammer-iii-patch-5-1-0?page=1">reads the blog</a>, with the aim of disincentivising cheese strats like corner camping.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a series of new community and developer maps are being added to Domination mode, and the mode itself can now be played against AI, alongside some other tweaks and changes. Lords, for example, can no longer be summoned and unsummoned. I have a passing interest in domination mode, which is to say I like watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@turinRTS">Turin</a> cast games, so I’ll wait to hear his opinions so I can pass them off as my own.</p>
<p>Other changes include the Daemons of Chaos now being playable in quick battles, free-for-all battles now being playable against the AI, and the usual round of nerfs, buffs, UI updates, and general rebalances. Of note here is a change to Collision attacks so they apply full weapon strength damage, making chariots more useful. Also, they nerfed the Thunderbarge, praise the lord/that’s a grudging, depending on your allegiance. Make sure to pop back tomorrow when we should have some more details about the DLC. Ogres, Orcs, and Khorne are currently slated to be getting some new toys.</p>
<p>Creative Assembly themselves have<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-total-war-dev-accuses-creative-assembly-of-mismanagement-and-says-strategy-series-ai-is-limited-by-design"> come under fire recently</a> from a former developer who took to Medium to allege a culture of mismanagement during his time there. As he takes time to say though, it’s clear the folks in the trenches are still dedicated to make their games as good as possible.</p>

            <p>The Northern Ireland Assembly All Party Group on Reducing Harm Related to Gambling has called for stronger loot boxes regulation in the country.</p>
<p>While it didn't call for a ban, it's recommended that "gambling within video games be severely limited to the greatest possible extent in the second phase of gambling legislation in [Northern Ireland]."</p>
<p>This is part of a report put together following an inquiry that ran between December 2022 and January 2024, gathering evidence on the impact of gambling on public health. The APG believes that Northern Ireland is "in an advantageous position to lead the way on the regulation of loot boxes."</p>
<p>As part of recommendations made to the NI Executive and the UK government, it called for legislation to "regulate the structural characteristics, availability and accessibility of gambling mechanics within video games, including loot boxes."</p>
<p>It also recommended that companies take a more nuanced approach to loot boxes, for example offering direct purchasing options, or the guarantee to get the content of a loot box after a certain amount has been spent.</p>
<p>Regulation shouldn't be relying solely on games companies changing their approach though, the APG warned, but should be "based on stringent, legally mandated regulations, with attention paid to the structural characteristics and overall availability of loot boxes."</p>
<p>The report also called attention to free-to-play social casino titles, supporting their restriction so they can't be easily accessed by minors.</p>
<p>Researcher Leon Y. Xiao, who regularly <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/authors/leon-y-xiao">contributes to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> on the topic of loot boxes regulation</a>, was part of the NI inquiry and held a special evidence session.</p>
<p>He commented: "Players in Northern Ireland would benefit from the industry self-regulation coming into force in the UK regardless of Stormont's [the Northern Ireland Assembly] approach, but Stormont can seek to provide a higher degree of consumer protection (than that which will be enjoyed by other UK players), if it deems doing so to be necessary and appropriate."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-miniclip-jagex-loot-box-ads-broke-uk-advertising-rules">UK's Advertising Standards Authority warned EA, Miniclip, and Jagex</a> after they failed to disclose presence of loot boxes in some of their titles, violating the country's advertising rules.</p>

            <p>
An Elden Ring dataminer has unmasked the NPCs of Shadow of the Erdtree, revealing what their faces look like beneath the armour.
</p>
<p>
The DLC includes a number of new characters, from the followers of Miquella seen in the game's trailers to other quest givers in the Land of Shadow.
</p>
<p>
Dataminer Zullie the Witch has released a new video that reveals the unique faces of these NPCs, to give a proper look at who they really are.

<p>

Take Hornsent, for instance. As his name suggests, he has small horns protruding from the wraps around his face, yet underneath he's just a regular, grubby looking bloke. As Zullie suggests, he should probably have horns on his character model but this would require a unique model outside the capabilities of the character creator.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, we see beneath the hefty armour of characters like Moore, Sir Ansbach, Redmane Freyja, and Needle Knight Leda, who are all met in the early hours of the DLC.
</p>
<p>
While seeing their faces doesn't reveal anything major about their characters, it does show their diverse characteristics. What's more, it indicates FromSoftware's creation process: using its own character creator to develop the models before slapping some armour on top.

<p>
Zullie the Witch is well known for revealing the grotesque details of enemies and characters across the Soulsborne games. 
</p>
<p>
A similar video was done for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-npcs-unmasked">NPCs in the base game of Elden Ring</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-rings-gargoyle-enemies-are-actually-made-of-human-flesh">closer examination of the gargoyle enemies</a>.


</p>
<p>
Another Shadow of the Erdtree character has also been unmasked: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modder-de-robes-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-lion-boss-and-yes-two-little-guys-really-are-hanging-out-under-there">Divine Beast Dancing Lion boss</a>. Or that should be disrobed: now we know what, or who, is hiding beneath its cloak.

            <p>The Steam Summer Sale is kicking off this week, say Valve, purveyors of fine games and thousands of crap ones too (don't worry, we help you tell the difference). The sale begins on Thursday June 27th and runs until July 11th. That's a full two weeks of sun and soulslikes, beach balls and beat 'em ups, paddling pools and puzzle games. I don't know any other objects associated with this mythological "summer" people talk about, I'm from Ireland. But I can tell you at least some of the games that'll be in the sale, according to some bargain-teasing by Valve.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://x.com/Steam/status/1805299921853333557">advertised the upcoming sale on Xitter</a>, a handy reminder. In that video they point out a few headliners, like Pokénot sweatshop simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a>, princess-befriending farm 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a>, and managerial peasantry botherer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a>. But don't say how much of a saving there'll be. They also mention a category of sales items they're calling "deep discounts". Which I'm guessing might simply be a list of all games on sale for more than 50% or 75% off, or something like that? Who knows.</p>
<p>Valve schedule these sales far in advance. They once used kept upcoming sale dates to themselves but not anymore. You can see the planned dates for all future sales in 2024 in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3970553774441642998">a post on their Steamworks blog for developers</a>, for instance. After this year's summery sale comes smaller sales like Tower Defense Fest and Fighting Games Fest, both in August. But the next big seasonal blow-out will be the Steam Autumn Sale, which is planned to run from November 27th to December 4th. </p>
<p>The sales are easier to resist when you already own a catalogue of unplayed platformers gathering cobwebs and moaning like forgotten skeletons at the bottom of your game library. But yes, it's worth keeping an eye out in Steam's sometimes bargainous bucket for that thing-wot-you-always-kinda-wanted-but-not-THAT-much. Here's hoping you find it for pennies.</p>

            <p>Aside from its naturally satisfying rhythm and the cool audio dings of success that usually accompany it, I find something innately hilarious about parrying. Yes, yes, it’s a deeply skilled expression of martial prowess that turns your enemy’s aggression back at them. But it’s also a pleasingly low-effort method to make your opponent look very silly - the combat equivalent of waving your outstretched hand and shaking your head in unison. I assume so from videogames, anyway. In reality, I could not parry a nerf dart with a metal bin lid.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you’re <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shadow-of-the-erdtrees-mixed-steam-reviews-paint-a-different-picture-to-the-critical-reception">having trouble</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>’s bosses, why not make the game temporarily more difficult for yourself, but then eventually easier, with a slightly obscure item that effectively turns <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>  into stabby <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> ‘em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro</a>?</p>
<p>The Deflecting Hardtear is an item for your Physick flask. You’ll need to beat the first fire golem you encounter in the shadow lands, which you can more or less spot from the first site of grace. Mix it in, get it down you, and you’ll gain the following effects:</p>
<blockquote>Damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.</blockquote>
<p>To see this - surprisingly massive expansion of the combat to be hidden behind an optional item - in action, here’s someone using it to parry Melania’s infamous Waterfowl Dance i.e the boss move in the game voted most likely to have been ported over from an unreleased Sekiro DLC.</p>


<p>The effects last for five minutes, which should be more than enough to embarrass Melania's first phase at least. This isn’t the only crystal tear in the DLC of course, and you might want to have a peek at Ollie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-boss-locations">guide to boss locations</a> if you want to track down the rest. You could just play Sekiro, of course. It's got massive chickens in it.</p>

        <p>Developer says its in response to allegations related to the streamer's Twitch ban</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Game studio Midnight Society has parted ways with co-founder and streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm.</p>
<p>In a statement issued to <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">social media</a>, the developer said it had become aware of allegations last Friday related to Beahm's Twitch ban in 2020.</p>
<p>"We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved," the company said. "In order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. For this reason, we are immediately terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm.</p>
<p>"While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the 55 developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">The Verge</a>, a former Twitch employee who worked on the platform's trust and safety team alleged that Beahm was banned due to messaging a minor on the platform, and reportedly tried to organise a meet up with them at TwitchCon.</p>
<p>Beahm has since denied these allegations on <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">social media</a>.</p>
<p>"This has been settled, no wrongdoing was acknowledged, and [Twitch] paid out the whole contract," he wrote.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">Beahm was permanently banned from Twitch in 2020</a>, a year into a two-year contract with the platform.</p>
<p>A reason for the ban was not given at the time. Twitch simply said it had taken action in response to a violation of its Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Beahm sued Twitch in response to the ban, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/drdisrespect-banned-from-twitch-again">the case was settled in 2022</a> after a resolution found that "no party admits any wrongdoing."</p>

			<p>Korean game developer Shift Up held an IPO press conference today, <a href="https://www.khgames.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=229298" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> that its latest game, Stellar Blade, has sold over a million units since its late April launch. That's not very surprising, considering that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-helldivers-2-npd-circana-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">topped the US sales charts&nbsp;that month</a>.</p>
<p>Once codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-eve-looks-stunning-in-first-playstation-5-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Eve</a> and announced for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, the game was later confirmed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. Its results are, therefore, all the more impressive for the availability on a single platform, not to mention that it's a brand-new intellectual property, which is inherently riskier than any established franchise.</p>
<p>The developers from Shift Up also shared some additional equally impressive figures. The Stellar Blade demo has been played more than twice compared to the demo of the highly anticipated Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Moreover, the studio believes significant sales are still possible, and they will continue updating the game to keep players' interest high.</p>
<p>The long-awaited Photo Mode will be added with an update slated for August. New character skins for protagonist Eve will be released after October, and a 'large collaboration' is being prepared for late 2024. Moreover, Shift Up CEO Kim Hyeong-tae confirmed that the team is working on DLCs and the PC version, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> (alongside a sequel, which is obviously further off in the future).</p>
<p><em>In the case of Stellar Blade, we created it to deliver a complete experience as a game created without considering purchasing additional content. As time goes by, we are identifying new needs and developing Stellar Blade. There is a possibility of developing paid DLC for elements such as external collaboration.</em></p>
<p>The game received a 9 out of 10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> written by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-craxy-taxi-jet-set-radio-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first rumors</a> from April 2022 that Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi were being brought back by SEGA, the Japanese publisher appeared during the last edition of The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-revives-5-of-its-classic-ips-golden-axe-crazy-taxi-jet-set-radio-shinobi-and-streets-of-rage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirm</a> that those two franchises (in addition to Golden Axe, Shinobi, and Streets of Rage) would return as part of a big plan to revive SEGA's dormant IPs.</p>
<p>Today, some work-in-progress pictures and a brief video of a Jet Set Radio remake have leaked only. You can watch the footage in the embed below, although be quick—chances are SEGA may take it down sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>There are reportedly two Jet Set Radio games in production: a full remake of the first installment and a free-to-play live service reboot. Best manage the hype, though, as the current expected release window is 2026. Crazy Taxi is reportedly <a href="https://imgur.com/Kmb6xgr" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a similar schedule</a>, with a remake of the first game due in Q1 2026 and a free-to-play online multiplayer live service reboot slated by the end of 2027.</p>

<p>As for the Jet Set Radio remake, we know it will be an open world game. SEGA management previously said that players will be able to make friends, increase their fans, and create a movement. The game will once again be set in Shibuya, Tokyo, and characters like Beat, DJ Professor K, Gum, and Combo are returning.</p>
<p>With the last mainline installment now being 21 years old and still another couple of years left before the launch of this remake, fans might want to check out spiritual successors like <a href="http://wccftech.com/hover-revolt-gamers-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hover</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-the-funk-is-with-ya/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</a> in the meantime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-g-has-a-new-gaming-keyboard-and-its-impressive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Logitech G has <a href="http://logitechg.com/g515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced its latest</a> gaming keyboard, the Logitech&nbsp;G515 Lightspeed TKL. It’s a low-profile and lightweight keyboard that Logitech is hoping sees as a jack of all trades kind of device.</p>



<p>Retailing for $139.99 wireless and $99 wired, the Logitech G515 TKL sits at just 22mm high with low-profile keys featuring switches with a 1.3mm actuation distance. The switches come in the form of tactile or linear.</p>



<p>“With the iconic G915 gaming keyboard, Logitech G delivered a first-of-its-kind low-profile<br>keyboard renowned for its exceptional quality, top-tier performance, and premium design<br>features. With the G515 low-profile design, we have pushed the boundaries even further,” Arnaud Perret-Gentil, Head of PC Gaming at Logitech G said.</p>



<p>“With the G515, we’ve maintained the sleek design while also including our latest technology innovations, such as LIGHTSPEED, LIGHTSYNC, and KEYCONTROL, to give gamers an advanced and high-performance gaming keyboard experience.”</p>



<p>Other features of Logitech’s newest gaming keyboard include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Lightspeed connection allows multiple peripherals on a single dongle</li>



<li>Tri-mode connection — Lightspeed, Bluetooth, wired</li>



<li>Layers for mapping allow for more custom key mapping up to 15 custom functions</li>



<li>Custom shortcuts, modifiers, and RGB lighting using the Logitech G Hub software</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-this-logitech-gaming-keyboard-is-a-comfortable-use">This Logitech Gaming Keyboard Is A Comfortable Use</h2>



<p>For the better part of the last week I’ve been using the Logitech G515 TKL keyboard, and to say it meets all of the marks you may be looking for in a keyboard would be an understatement. </p>



<p>Its low profile reduces the angle your wrists need to be at when typing, gaming, or anything really. It limits the stress you put them under, helping you enjoy longer playtimes. It’s not perfectly ergonomic, but that’s not something it claims to be. For what it does on that front, it does it really well.</p>



<p>The keys are responsive and feel great when I’m playing any time of game or writing this article. For what it’s worth, I was sent the G515 TKL with tactile switches. But I’m sure the linear feel just as good if that’s what you prefer. What makes them feel so nice are the pre-lubed switches and slightly concaved keys that make your fingers just fit and slide between presses seamlessly all over the board. It’s hard to describe just how smooth it feels without you using it yourself, but picture a hot knife going through butter, only better.</p>



<h6>READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review – As Powerful As It Is Big</a></h6>



<p>The battery life is advertised as up to 36 hours on a full charge. Like I said, I’ve used the keyboard for the last week as my main keyboard and I’ve only had to charge it once during that time. </p>



<p>The only real issue I have with the Logitech G515 Lightspeed TKL is the lack of dedicated media controls and volume wheel. Most keyboards, even other TKL boards I’ve used over the last few years, have had a volume wheel and media controls. It’s not the end of the world to not include them, and it’s clear the decision was made to not have them in order to keep the low profile universal, but it still feels like a weird omission. You can still control media and volume through the function key, but it’s an extra step that’s I didn’t find necessary. </p>



<p>Overall, the Logitech G515 TKL is a solid gaming keyboard across the aisle, especially for the price.  </p>

<p><em>NOTE: Logitech provided a G515 TKL for the purpose of review/impressions.</em></p>

<p id="7e50o5">Neither of these mushroom Pokémon see any use in raids, gyms, or PvP content. Their shinies are great, since they go from a spring coloring to a nice autumn red-yellow-brown.</p>
<h2 id="wepEXU"><strong>What is the shiny rate for Morelull in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="NElmhN">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), the shiny rate for Pokémon on a regular day is approximately one in 500. Morelull is not a confirmed Pokémon that gets a “permaboost” (meaning that it’s a rare spawn and thus gets a boosted shiny rate).</p>
<h3 id="TZ4GJv"><strong>What can I do to attract more shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="r3MqkW">Not much, unfortunately. It appears to be random chance. Shiny Pokémon catch rates are set by developer Niantic, and they are typically only boosted during special events like Community Days or Safari Zones, or in Legendary Raids. There are no consumable items that boost shiny Pokémon rates.</p>
<h3 id="thj8sX"><strong>Where can I find a list of available shiny Pokémon?</strong></h3>
<p id="WRj9xa">LeekDuck maintains <a href="https://leekduck.com/shiny/">a list of currently available shiny Pokémon</a>. It’s a helpful visual guide that illustrates what all of the existing shiny Pokémon look like.</p>

            <p>

High-profile streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm has been ousted from Midnight Society, the game development studio he co-founded in 2021, after new allegations relating to his much-publicised Twitch ban surfaced late last week.
</p>
<p>
Beahm was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-banned-by-twitch">permanently banned from Twitch</a> in the summer of 2020 - a year into a two-year exclusivity contract with the company - but neither party has ever revealed why. The closest Twitch came to an explanation was a statement shared at the time of the ban, saying it takes "appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service... regardless of status or prominence in the community." In August 2021, Beahm announced he was suing Twitch over the ban - but the legal dispute was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/drdisrespect-settles-legal-dispute-with-twitch-over-2020-permanent-ban">later settled</a>, with neither party admitting to any wrongdoing.
</p>
<p>
And that appeared to be the end of the matter, until last week. On Friday, Twitch's former account director of strategic partnerships, Cody Conners, made a <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">post on social media</a> alleging an unnamed person "got banned because [he] got caught sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch Whispers product. He was trying to meet up with her at TwitchCon. The powers that be could read in plain text. Case closed, gang."

<figcaption>Midnight Society is currently working on extraction shooter Deadrop.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io0ptzjAQOs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
While Conners did not name Beahm directly, the connection was quickly made - and his claims were corroborated by two former Twitch employees in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">subsequent report by The Verge</a>, this time explicitly linking the allegations to Beahm.
</p>
<p>
And it's in the wake of these allegations that game developer Midnight Society - which is currently working on free-to-play first-person extraction shooter Deadrop - has now officially parted ways with Beahm, who co-founded the studio with former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021.
</p>
<p>
"On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect", the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">statement shared on social media</a>. "We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act."
</p>
<p>
"For this reason," the statement continued, "we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players."
</p>
<p>
While Beahm hasn't yet formally commented on his split with Midnight Society, the streamer did share a statement on social media after the new allegations began circulating last week. "Listen, I'm obviously tied to legal obligations from the settlement with Twitch but I just need to say what I can say since this is the fucking internet," he <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">wrote</a>. "I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid."
</p>
<p>
During <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E73nGJocgAA">a stream</a> almost immediately prior to Midnight Society's announcement, Beahm told viewers he "definitely [needed] to take a break from everything" and take a "step back", adding, "I mean I'm gonna have to relay this to the Midnight Society, but, you know, maybe I step away from there too. Just completely remove myself from the scene. It's what I need to do."

Amazon currently has a <a href="https://zdcs.link/Oy5Yn" target="_blank">TEAMGROUP GO 1TB Micro SDXC card</a> for only $63.99. For most people, this will be enough space for the entire lifespan of your Switch and at a great price. There's only one Micro SD card slot in the Switch console so you want to make sure you get the biggest card you can afford.</p><h2>1TB Micro SDXC Card (Switch Compatible) for $63.99</h2><div id="195360"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Go 1TB U3 A1 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The Nintendo Switch is an outstanding console, but it doesn't give you much space to install many games out of the box, especially if you purchase digital games off eShop. The Switch and Switch OLED have 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, respectively, with some of it reserved for the OS. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom uses up 16GB and Breath of the Wild about 13.5GB. If bought digitally, those two games alone would take up all of your internal storage on the OG Switch console. Fortunately, the Switch features a single memory card expansion slot. It supports up to 2TB Micro SDXC cards, but since 2TB Micro SDXC cards don't exist in the mainsteam market, a 1TB or 1.5TB card is the maximum you can get.</p><p>The 1TB TEAMGROUP Micro SDXC card is compatible with virtually any device that accepts the Micro SDXC card standard. That includes the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong>, Steam Deck, ASUS ROG Ally, any recently released smartphone that supports expandable memory, GoPros, cameras and much more. Despite its low price, the TEAMGROUP is faster than your average Micro SDXC card. It has a U3 A1 rating and boasts transfer speeds of up to 100MB/s read and 50MB/s write. Although TEAMGROUP isn't as well known of a brand as SanDisk or Samsung, this brand has been around for a while and is a legitimate manufacturer of flash-based storage. This particular model has plenty of good reviews on Amazon.</p><h2>Need a faster speed? Choose this one instead.</h2><div id="195361"><p><h3>TEAMGROUP Pro Plus 1TB U3 A2 Micro SDXC Card</h3></p></div><p>The TEAMGROUP PRO PLUS 1TB Micro SDXC card is U3 A2 rated with transfer speeds up to 160MB/s read and 110MB/s write. This extra speed can't be exploited in a Nintendo Switch, but this is a better Micro SDXC card for mobile electronics that often handle bitrate heavy files like GoPros, smartphones with 4K video recording, DSLR cameras, and PCs with an available Micro SD or SD card slot (an adapter is included).</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 24, 2024 11:25 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

These buttons can be remapped on the fly on the controller itself.</p><p>Other notable features include a turbo function, rumble, clicky buttons and D-pad, and a tactile grip that appears to match the texture of 8BitDo's higher-end Ultimate controllers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png" data-ref-id="1300-4324290"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2C Wireless Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324290-8bitdoultimate2c.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4324291,1300-4324292,1300-4324293,1300-4324294,1300-4324295,1300-4324296,1300-4324297" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324291-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324292-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324293-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324294-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324295-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324296-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_6.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4324297-8bitdo_ultimate_2c_controller_7.jpg"></figure><hr><p>The Ultimate 2C supports 2.4GHz wireless with Windows 10/11, Android 9.0 and above (with a USB-A adapter), Steam Deck (with a dock), and other handheld PCs with a USB-C hub or dock, including the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1820028544647762629%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus ROG Ally</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM74YFSP%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2F8bitdos-new-30-wireless-pc-controller-has-anti-drift-sticks-and-remappable-buttons%2F1100-6524462%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lenovo Legion Go</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185172/dr-disrespect-midnight-society-termination<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the game studio co-founded by Dr Disrespect, has terminated its relationship with the streamer.  In a post on X, <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1805341504086622355">the studio wrote</a>, “On Friday evening, we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founder’s Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect.” </p><p>That is the day and time that former Twitch employee Cody Conners <a href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1804309358106546676">posted a tweet about</a> the alleged reason for Beahm’s permanent ban, saying it was for “sexting a minor in the then existing Twitch whispers product.” Robert Bowling, a former Infinity Ward developer and fellow Midnight Society co-founder, posted shortly after, <a href="https://x.com/fourzerotwo/status/1804390727541305548">saying</a>, “I’m now aware and I’m dealing with it... I landed from Stockholm, reconnected, saw the tweet and immediately began an investigation to learn everything I need to know so I can ensure a full follow through.” </p><div><p>On Sunday, <em>The Verge</em> reported a second Twitch employee who worked on the platform’s trust and safety team at the time of the incident <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/23/24183875/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-explanation">had come forward to corroborate Conner’s post</a>.</p></div><p>“We assumed his innocence and began speaking with parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act,” reads the post from Midnight Society. “For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately.”</p><p>The announcement came barely an hour after Beahm <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Flive%2FE73nGJocgAA%3Fsi%3DWPtWVjG5lcitonh5%26t%3D11574">ended his first stream</a> since the allegations surfaced. In the stream, Beahm said that he was “fatigued” and was considering “removing himself from the scene.” He suggested that he could leave Midnight Society as part of that process. “Maybe I step away from there, too,” he said.</p><p>In 2020, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304907/dr-disrespect-twitch-ban-no-reason-given">Beahm was banned from Twitch</a> at the height of his popularity and shortly after signing a two-year exclusivity contract with the platform. Neither Twitch nor Beahm would <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326873/dr-disrespect-interviews-twitch-disappearance-stream">state the reason why</a>, leading to four years of mystery and speculation. On Friday, </p><p>Beahm <a href="https://x.com/DrDisrespect/status/1804577136998776878">denied the allegations in posts to X</a>. “I didn’t do anything wrong, all this has been probed and settled, nothing illegal, no wrongdoing was found, and I was paid,” he wrote on Saturday.</p><div><p>In 2021, Beahm <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/robert-bowling-dr-disrespect-and-others-create-midnight-society-studio/">co-founded Midnight Society</a> with Bowling and Quinn DelHoyo, who worked on the <em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>series. In 2022, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/08/02/dr-disrespect-reveals-deadrop-his-fps-along-with-the-first-real-gameplay-footage/">Midnight Society announced <em>Deadrop</em></a>,<em> </em>an extraction shooter that, at one time, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2022/05/31/dr-disrespects-midnight-society-is-going-hard-on-nfts-with-polygon-partnership/?sh=3d6658d6552e">sold NFTs as a part of its monetization strategy</a>.</p></div><p>In its post announcing its termination of Beahm, Midnight Society wrote, “While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.”</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 24th:</strong> Added post from Robert Bowling and clarified Midnight Society’s post.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following this weekend’s controversy that saw allegations levelled against Dr Disrespect, the super-sized streamer announced on stream that he’s taking an indefinite break from creating content. This announcement came around the same time that Midnight Society, Dr Disrespect’s game studio working on his extraction shooter, DEADROP, revealed that it would be cutting ties with the creator.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-don-t-know-how-long">‘I Don’t Know How Long’</h2>



<p>This weekend, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dr-disrespect-allegations-twitch-ban/">allegations rose against Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm</a>, with an accusation being made that in 2020, he was banned from Twitch permanently for soliciting a minor via the platform’s whisper feature and attempting to meet up with them at TwitchCon. The original allegation came from a former Twitch employee, and while many labelled the claim a grab for attention, other information has come to light that doesn’t look good – such as Midnight Society cutting connections with the creator.</p>



<p>Here’s what Midnight Society said:</p>



<p><em>‘On Friday evening we became aware of an allegation against one of our co-founders Guy Beahm aka Dr Disrespect. </em></p>



<p><em>We assumed his innocence and began speaking with the parties involved. And in order to maintain our principles and standards as a studio and individuals, we needed to act. </em></p>



<p><em>For this reason, we are terminating our relationship with Guy Beahm immediately. </em></p>



<p><em>While these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the fifty-five developers and families we have employed along with our community of players.’</em></p>



<p>Around the same time, Dr Disrespect was live on stream, and before he wrapped up, he started talking about how he was tired ‘of all this’ and referenced hating being on social media. He then started rambling slightly, talking about an upcoming vacation and suggesting he’d extend that indefinitely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I did have a planned vacation coming up. I think I might just extend that starting today, starting now. One of these… Let’s take a step back. I mean, it is what it is, people get fatigued, right champs? To be honest, I don’t know how long my vacation is, but you know, maybe I extend that. We’ll see. We’ll see.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He requested that his ‘Champions Club’ keep an eye on the socials for signs of his inevitable return, but we’ll have to see how the current situation plays out before that comes around. In his last stream, Doc referenced being tired of being on the camera and stressed that the industry has ‘changed so much’ since he started streaming in 2009, but this claim of being fatigued is believed to just be a front for the potentially devastating circumstances he’s found himself in. </p>



<p>Coincidentally, he suggested he’d ‘step away’ from Midnight Society too in an effort to remove himself from the scene, so he either knew this separation was coming or he was trying to save face. </p>
