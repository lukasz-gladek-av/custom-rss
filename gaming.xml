<p>After what felt like an age of early access waiting, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> finally arrived as a console exclusive on Switch and Switch 2 back in September. Two months on, and that Switch 2 release has scored a physical edition — what's more, it's a beauty.</p>
<p>We were lucky enough to get our hands on the new box today, and feast our eyes on all of the goodies within (a download code to a digital soundtrack, a 'Character Compendium' booklet, and the full game complete on cart). The nicest surprise of all, however, was the reversible cover art, giving us an option between the standard red banner of a Switch 2 physical, and something more... artsy.</p><div><figure data-videoid="JmOlmniuSog" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytJmOlmniuSog" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JmOlmniuSog?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed624b7cprlzyn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Flipping the cover insert over, you're treated to alternate artwork featuring the game's protagonist, Melinoë, on the front of the box, while a dark and brooding image of Hecate adorns the back.</p>
<p>It's a neat touch, and one that we're sure you'd like to check out for yourselves, so we've assembled the following gallery detailing everything you get in the Hades II Switch 2 physical edition, and a closer look at the all-important art. <em>Enjoy!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Xbox 360, the most successful video game console from Microsoft, turns 20 years old on November 22. Over its lifespan, the console saw over 2,000 games released including some of the industries greatest games of all time. While the original Xbox was Microsoft’s first attempt at a mainstream video game console, the Xbox 360 was the one that put the industry on notice. It sold nearly three-and-a-half times more systems than the first Xbox (~85.73 million(M)), and, according to the latest known numbers, has even outsold the Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S combined.</p>



<p>But what games from the 2nd-generation Xbox went on to become major hits? These are the best-selling Xbox 360 games of all time.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-selling-xbox-360-games-ever">Best-Selling Xbox 360 Games Ever</h2>



<p>The global data you’ll find below comes from custom data firm <a href="https://data40.com/articles/best-selling-xbox-360-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Data40</a>, where the provide numbers for the best-selling Xbox 360 games since the system’s launch in 2005.

Should any discrepancies be found or more accurate information arise, this article will be updated and noted.</p>



<p><strong>10. Grand Theft Auto 4</strong></p>

<iframe title="Grand Theft Auto IV Trailer 1 &quot;Things Will Be Different&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M80K51DosFo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>GTA 4 took players back to Liberty City during one of the most memorable eras in the series. Instead of focusing on wild chaos like earlier games, this one leaned into a more grounded story about Niko Bellic trying to start fresh while getting pulled into one bad situation after another. It felt gritty, personal, and completely different from anything the franchise had done before, which is why so many fans still talk about it today.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales</strong>:</strong> 11.1M</p>

<p><strong>9. Halo 3</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo 3 - First Announcement Trailer  [HD] - E3 2006" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T9Ezd2FqxAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Halo 3 was the Xbox Live game everyone seemed to be playing. The campaign delivered huge set pieces and emotional moments, while multiplayer kept people up late night after night. Forge mode and Theater mode were ahead of their time and gave players tools no other shooter offered. For a lot of fans, Halo 3 represents the peak of the franchise.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 12.13M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>8. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Call Of Duty- Modern Warfare 2 Official Trailer (Eminem ft Nate Dogg)" width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZcsEQPFs_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 arrived with incredible hype and somehow still lived up to it. The campaign had several moments that stuck with players for years, but it was the multiplayer that kept people coming back. Quick scoping battles, chaotic lobbies, and broken loadouts became part of gaming culture. Everyone who played during that era has at least one Modern Warfare 2 story. And most of them, unsurprisingly, involve the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7vBol8wud0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">most controversial and infamous mission</a> in franchise history.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.49M</p>

<p><strong>7. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Skyrim was one of those games you picked up for a quick session and suddenly realized hours had gone by. With dragons flying overhead and a world full of caves, towns, and secrets, every playthrough felt different. Even on Xbox 360, players found creative ways to explore, break, or completely reinvent the game. Almost everyone who touched Skyrim has a unique tale about their time in it.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 13.7M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>6. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Official Reveal Trailer | Call of Duty: Black Ops 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x3tedlWs1XY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 changed things up by jumping into a near future setting and giving players choices that affected the campaign. It also delivered some of the most memorable multiplayer the series has ever had. The maps were tight, the pacing was fast, and the competitive scene was extremely active. Zombies mode continued to grow here and became a nightly ritual for many groups of friends.</p>



<p><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong> 13.7M</p>

<p><strong>5. Call of Duty: Black Ops</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>The original Call of Duty: Black Ops put players into a Cold War spy thriller with a style that set it apart from other entries in the series. The campaign introduced characters that fans still quote and reference today. Multiplayer became a massive hit thanks to iconic maps and a progression system that kept players hooked. Zombies mode became a lasting obsession for entire friend groups.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.55M</p>



<hr>



<p><strong>4. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</strong></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Reveal Trailer | Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/coiTJbr9m04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 wrapped up the original Modern Warfare storyline with nonstop action and a campaign that kept the pressure high from beginning to end. Multiplayer continued to dominate Xbox Live with fast matches and an enormous amount of customization. Whether players preferred MW2 or MW3, almost everyone spent time in this one when it launched.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 14.72M</p>

<p><strong>3. Minecraft: Xbox 360 Edition</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>Minecraft on Xbox 360 brought the world of crafting and block building to console players in the best way possible. It quickly became a favorite for families and groups of friends thanks to its simple controls and endless possibilities. To add to it, it allowed friends to play online together in an easier way than the original PC version. Many players who grew up during the 360 era still think of this version as their first real introduction to Minecraft. Fast-forward years later, and Minecraft is the most successful video game of all time with over 350 million copies sold across all platforms.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 21M</p>

<p><strong>2. Grand Theft Auto 5</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>GTA 5 launched on the Xbox 360 in September 2013 and immediately became one a top-selling game. The three-character structure felt fresh, and the world of Los Santos was filled with detail and personality. Even after finishing the story, players kept coming back to explore, find secrets, and try new things. The early days of GTA Online also started here, giving the game a long life on the console. As of October 2025, global sales of the game have hit 220M, putting it behind only Minecraft.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 22.95M</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Kinect Adventures was bundled with the Kinect, which meant almost every Kinect owner tried it at some point. It offered simple but energetic minigames that got people moving and laughing, and it was one of the few games that actually showed what the Kinect could do. It worked well for families and parties and became a surprisingly memorable part of the Xbox 360 era.</p>



<p><strong><strong>Estimated Xbox 360 Sales:</strong></strong> 24M</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-aim-assist-strength-will-be-increased-soon.1360036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new video uploaded on social media, Treyarch revealed that Black Ops 7’s aim assist strength will be ‘increased over range’ very soon. This follows a period of monitoring based on community feedback that stressed that the aim assist felt too loose compared to previous games.</p>



<p>This is in addition to a bunch of other tweaks coming in, such as a reduction in the efficacy of the Drone Pod field upgrade, damage tuning for Hardcore modes, and an increase in the visible range of the minimap in multiplayer.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-spongy-aim-assist-is-being-adjusted">Black Ops 7’s Spongy Aim Assist is Being Adjusted</h2>



<p>In the clip uploaded earlier today on social media, Treyarch confirmed that aim assist is being adjusted soon:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Aim assist is a big conversation out there; we have been closely monitoring that conversation, and of course, looking at our internal data. We’re fairly happy with where we’re at, but we will be making some very nuanced changes and slightly increasing aim assist strength over range ahead of season one.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team will also perform some fine-tuning of spawns, adjusting spawn logic ‘across the board’ and attacking points of contention on particular maps that have less-than-desirable spawns in certain game modes, including Hardpoint.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Our first post-launch Dev Talk is here with a lot to cover:</p><p>✅ Unlocking Endgame<br>✅ Weapon balancing<br>✅ Aim Assist update<br>✅ Spawn tuning<br>✅ Equipment buffs<br>✅ Drone Pod nerfs<br>✅ Mini-Map range increase<br>✅ Zombies boss fight nerfs<br>✅ Relic updates<br>✅ Cursed in Survival?<br>+ more <a href="https://t.co/Qoc6UOoR1U">pic.twitter.com/Qoc6UOoR1U</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Black Ops 7’s aim assist came under fire at launch, even from some of the most capable Call of Duty League pro players. It was dubbed ‘insane and not in a good way’ <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-no-aim-assist-cod-world-champ/">by Shotzzy</a>, potentially the winningest Call of Duty player in the world right now.</p>



<p>All this is lumped into some major changes, such as Activision’s teams unlocking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/">the ‘Endgame’ mode</a>, which exists at the end of Black Ops 7’s campaign, and making it available universally. This means you no longer need to complete the campaign to access it.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 hasn’t had a terrible launch, but it’s certainly struggling against some tough competition in Battlefield 6, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/">best-selling shooter in years</a>, and ARC Raiders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-all-time-high/">most successful extraction shooter</a> ever.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Treyarch has released its first post-launch <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1991582585005437374" rel="nofollow ">Dev Talk video</a> to reveal some major changes the studio is preparing for the launch of Season 1 next month. This discusses the community feedback regarding Black Ops 7's aim-assist, weapon balancing, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7's assault rifles feel really powerful in multiplayer, while most of the guns in the submachine class have struggled to feel viable. Treyarch associate design director Matt Scronce confirms that a buff is coming across the entire submachine gun class. Scronce says no plans are made for adjustments to the marksman rifles or snipers, but the team is monitoring the data.</p><p dir="ltr">"The overall goal with those weapons in Black Ops 7 is that they are a bit more present without being too dominant," Scronce says.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8JKDfXT1pg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f8JKDfXT1pg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The developer is also aware of the community debate around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-aim-assist-changes-are-inspiring-lots-of-debate-and-discussion/1100-6536208/">Black Ops 7's aim assist</a>, which features reduced rotational aim-assist compared to recent Call of Duty games. "We have been closely monitoring that conversation and looking at our internal data," Scronce says. The developer also reveals the studio is "fairly happy" with where the game's aim-assist is at, but there will be a slight increase to aim-assist strength at range. This change will arrive sometime ahead of the Season 1 update.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch's planned update includes spawn adjustments for Hardpoint, Free-For-All, and Team Deathmatch modes. A nerf is also coming for the game's overpowered Drone Pod field upgrade.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer announced that Endgame mode, which players can unlock after completing the campaign, will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-endgame-will-soon-be-playable-for-everyone-right-away/1100-6536359/">available to everyone</a> starting on November 21. Players who unlocked Endgame naturally by beating the campaign will receive a variety of rewards, including XP tokens, GobbleGums, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">For Zombies changes, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discusses the difficulty level of the boss fight for Ashes of the Damned. The developer says it was designed to be challenging, but it is more difficult than intended. Adjustments will be made to the barnacle spawns needed to help Ol' Tessie, so players can spend less time repairing the Wonder Vehicle and more time driving. The developer says it's slowing down the speed boss's missile barrage attack.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7s-nuketown-2025-map-goes-live-tomorrow-see-it-in-action-now/1100-6536356/">Nuketown arrived to Black Ops 7 today</a>, and this is a new 2025 variant of Treyarch's classic map. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-season-1-content-new-maps-and-holiday-events-confirmed/1100-6535666/">Season 1 of Black Ops 7</a> begins in December, which will add the game's first battle pass, Warzone integration, additional maps, and more.</p>

                <p>You'll need to take a trip to the Spaceport map to complete the A Lay of the Land quest in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>. This quest tasks you with finding multiple items in a single trip to the map, so you'll want to come prepared to make a long trek and survive for quite some time. Let's take a look at everything you'll need to do to get this quest wrapped up.</p><p>Knowing that you'll have a lot of traveling and surviving to do on Spaceport for the A Lay of the Land quest, we'd recommend you bring guns you're comfortable with, as well as plenty of healing items. Additionally, it's a great idea to bring in an augment that has a safe pocket, as you'll need to extract with a specific item to complete the quest back in Speranza.</p><p>When you're ready to head out and begin A Lay of the Land, follow the guide below.</p><h2>Where to find the shipping notes in the foreman's office</h2><p>The first objective requires you to collect some shipping notes in the foreman's office at the Jiangsu Warehouse. This POI is located on the northwestern side of the Spaceport map. It's not usually a very busy spot, but keep your eyes open for nearby raiders nonetheless.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895" data-ratio="0.56039807824296" data-width="2914" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4606895"></a><figcaption>Jiangsu Warehouse location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4606895-share_20251118_1037090.jpeg"></figure><p>Once inside, you'll notice there's really not much to this warehouse.

			<p>Today's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">Xbox Partner Preview event</a> showcased 16 games and announcements, one of them being a new trailer for IO Interactive's upcoming James Bond game, 007 First Light. Though it wasn't a huge new showcase of gameplay, a deep dive into the game's mechanics, or even a behind-the-scenes look at the game's development, it did highlight a key element of any James Bond video game: the car that Bond drives.</p>



<p>The short, fifty-second trailer shows off Bond's Aston Martin Valhalla, a stunning car even without all of the special agent gadgetry that Q details in his narration of the trailer.</p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by the groundbreaking Aston Martin Valkyrie and infused with advanced Formula 1 technologies, the Valhalla showcases aerodynamic mastery, race-derived engineering, and exquisite craftsmanship</em>," writes IO Interactive senior global communications manager, Yann Roskell,<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/007-first-light-xbox-partner-preview/"> in an Xbox Wire post</a>. "<em>Limited to just 999 units worldwide, this supercar sets the standard for automotive innovation, showcasing unparalleled speed and precision.</em>"</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Okay, perhaps it would have been better to get a deeper look at gameplay or some more insight into how the game was made, <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">similar to what we saw in September</a> during a State of Play presentation. But a James Bond game will live and die by how well it truly captures the allure of the character that has captivated fans for decades.</p>



<p>Bond's taste for gadgets, clothes, and of course, cars, are all mixed in with that allure, so it makes sense that IO Interactive would put something like this together to further display how it is trying to capture the essence of James Bond.</p>



<p>That said, hopefully we don't have to go too long before getting a more detailed dive into what we can expect from the game ahead of its release on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm a big fan of <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>,</em> and when I can't find the time to get a group of friends together, I'm always down to try different experiences that seek to recreate the experience. The latest of these is <em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em>. A tabletop experience where abilities are replaced by cards as you go dungeon crawling through the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9cb3f917-f831-4c81-8cb8-54e040b09040" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-forgotten-realms-heroes-of-faerun-and-adventures-in-faerun-review" rel="nofollow">Forgotten Realms</a>, but where does it successfully recreate the experience, and where does it falter?</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>is, as the name would suggest, a new title in the <em>Demeo </em>series of turn-based RPGs that leans into recreating the feeling of moving miniatures around a board and taking on waves of enemies as you dive deeper into interesting dungeons. This time around, the game has received a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> coat of paint with character classes reflecting those from the TTRPG, cards of popular abilities and spells, and the campaigns are now set in the Forgotten Realms.</p>

<p>At launch, the game will release with two Campaigns, <em>Embers of Chaos</em> and <em>Crown of Frost</em>. In my time previewing the game, I dove into Embers of Chaos. Here, the surrounding areas of Neverwinter are in turmoil, and stress is rising between groups of humans and elves as strange attacks are on the rise.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-world-map.jpg?itok=a9oxiU3r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-world-map.jpg?itok=V46ssOAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Through the early moments of the campaign, you'll find yourself fighting off bandits, saving the town of Thundertree, enjoying a drink at a local tavern, and diving deep into a mushroom-infested cave system. While there's certainly a number of name drops and references, it's still very clear this is a combat and tactics forward game, and not as much into building any kind of vast story.</p>

<p>There's no worry with not creating that experience, it's just good to make sure you don't go in expecting that.</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Gameplay Works Like A Board Game</h2>

<p><em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked </em>leans heavily into the turn-based combat and simplified action economy of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Starting a new area, your party will appear on the edge of the map, and you'll move them one by one, each character being able to take two actions per turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=4oVOoAe2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-character.jpg?itok=ywP2egoe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>You can move, make a simple attack, or use any of the different items or ability cards at your disposal. With <em>Battlemarked</em>, all of the cards have a <em>D&amp;D</em> theme with simple tweaks like Fire Arrows, as well as Lay on Hands and Blinkstrike. Your hand is limited to 10 cards, but as you take out enemies, you'll slowly earn more cards. It's pretty unlikely you'll ever run out.</p>

<p>This action economy did take me a bit to work out, because moving took an action, but using an attack ability could also move you and let you do an attack. Trying to keep the party together, but also dealing damage efficiently was a bit of a puzzle in itself (and one that I definitely lost a few times.)</p>

<p>When you are ready to attack an opponent, you'll be presented with a die to roll. While it is a D20, the dice you roll is made up of a skull for a miss, a single sword for hit, and two swords for a Critical hit. I'm someone who likes seeing high numbers on dice, so it wasn't as appealing to see the attack dice symbol-based, but it definitely speeds up the game. What was incredibly satisfying in the diorama world of the game is that rolling the dice is physics-based, letting you grab and throw the dice, and watching it bounce all over the terrain.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-virtual-reality.jpg?itok=ia-Ep-V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-virtual-reality.jpg?itok=8f2yNEWL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playing on my PC was fun, but Battlemarked is way more engaging in the VR mode</figcaption></figure><p>There are skill checks where you use a D20, these pop up during conversation or when you stumble across random events in a map, that do rely on your character stats. For the most part, you'll be rolling the Attack Dice though.</p>

<p><em>Battlemarked </em>really has the visuals of <em>Dungons &amp; Dragons</em> down, as someone who plays (way too much) D&amp;D, though it felt like a lot of these systems were a bit too simplified for me. You have a good chance to hit, but you won't always, and your characters' attack stats are all static. It would have been awesome to see some varying damage stats to create more scenarios where you'd go for a risky attack to hope for a high damage roll to finish off an enemy.</p>

<h2>Randomization &amp; Replayability</h2>

<p>When combat is a bit too tough and you fall in battle, you'll get to restart from the beginning of the floor, but the enemies present and their locations will be randomized. This is a fun addition, meaning that no matter how much the environment you move through might be the same, the progression of combat will always be different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-combat.jpg?itok=7wc3YswB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked-combat.jpg?itok=FIHBmyfy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There's further replayability to be had in the game in playing with different people, what class you choose, and how you choose to upgrade your character. Do you prefer that your Paladin takes less damage on low health, or that there is less chance for Poison damage?</p>

<h2><em>Battlemarked </em>Offers A <em>D&amp;D</em>-lite Combat Experience</h2>

<p>From my time with <em>Battlemarked </em>so far, I've enjoyed the story as it has been laid out, and the visual experience perfectly demonstrates a high-quality game with terrain and miniatures.</p>

<p>I do wish that the combat wasn't so dialed back, but there is a lot of replayability in the layout of enemies in a dungeon and how you best use the cards available to you. With how every part of the game is static numbers and grid-based movement, even when not in active combat, the experience honestly felt closer to my recent experiences with HeroQuest.</p>

<p>If you're interested in getting online with friends and throwing some dice in a strategic setting,&nbsp;<em>Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</em> is a fun experience, even more so with the different references that you'll run into. If the simplified combat or very light storytelling isn't for you, then you might need to seek your adventure elsewhere.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-studios-1-3-0-venerator-wall-key-2000645901</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-handgun-wrecking-everyone-in-arc-raiders-has-been-put-in-nerf-jail.1359985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> got a fresh set of <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">patch notes</a> for its 1.3.0 update this morning. The update includes a variety of changes across the board, but perhaps most important are the changes to a two-shot pistol that’s been causing havoc and devastation for anyone on the receiving end of its twin barrels. Here are all the changes impacting in-game weapons and items:</p> <h2>The Venator gets ‘re-tuned’ and explosions are less explosive</h2> <p>A blue rare gun, the Venator is a girl’s best friend as a sidearm and a seriously reliable primary weapon if you like maining pistols. That might change a bit as the gun was previously “capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons,” according to the patch notes.</p>

 <p>The other notable change here is that explosions have been tweaked. To be honest, I kinda saw this one coming as it’s been pretty damn easy lately to take out the larger Arc threats with things that go boom. The most significant of these changes sees the Hullcracker launcher, great for taking down Arc, requiring more accuracy, while explosions on large enemies “deal a bit less damage,” as Embark puts it.</p>

 <p>The cost of ammo for the Hullcracker has also shifted, and arguably not for the better. Whereas you could snag a pack of 10 from the in-game traders for 6,000 Coins, you’ll now get 6 launcher ammo for 4,500.</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1p1z2on/comment/npu81ec/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread on Reddit discusses</a>, this might have the run-on effect of seeing fewer people rushing the Arc Queen as they’ll be a little less equipped, and with weaponry that requires some more careful aiming.</p>

 <h2>Embark takes aim at bugs and wall-glitching, but some issues remain</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ performance is mostly reliable, but folks found some unfortunate bugs that affected bullet collision, as well as exploits that allow players to glitch into rooms that are otherwise locked.</p> <p>The update brings improvements to those bullet issues on the map Blue Gate. It’s a nice start, but I know I’ve seen similar issues elsewhere, too. The patch notes detail “railing props [that] mistakenly blocked bullets” but say that “shots now pass through as expected.” Across the other maps, some other player collision issues were touched up.</p>

 <p>Players have also been exploiting some wall-glitching, allowing them to enter locked rooms without keys or to hide in unreachable ambush spots. Dam Battlegrounds has had an exploit that allowed access to the Control Tower fixed, while a specific wall in Spaceport that players were glitching into to jump unsuspecting players will no longer allow for this.</p>

 <p>Still, I’ve seen all sorts of locked doors bypassed by folks, not just the ones addressed by this patch. Hopefully there’ll be less of this.</p> <p>But perhaps the most frustrating movement issue occurs when trying to access an escape hatch while in a downed-but-not-out status. Normally, until you’re fully knocked out, you can crawl your way to an escape as the game lets you activate the elevator or escape hatch terminals while you’re down. But as documented well in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oxzevn/i_need_to_have_a_word_with_whoever_designed_this/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">this video on Reddit</a>, most hatches seem to sit atop a slope that can’t be climbed while crawling.</p>

   <p>It’s hard to tell if this is intentional or an oversight. But it’s clearly been a frustrating experience for those who’ve tried to make a daring last-minute escape via a hatch, only to find out they can’t crawl over a hump.</p> <h2>Good news (maybe) for duck fans</h2> <p>Lastly, update 1.3.0 will fill your Raider’s room with more rubber ducks, letting them spill over the floor if you have enough in your stash.</p> <p>It’s cute! But if you ask me, those ducks aren’t valuable enough to extract with and are otherwise too pointless for me to have them taking up room in my stash. So fear not, any rubber ducks I come across are deliberately left behind on the battlefield. You’re welcome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today’s Xbox Partner Preview had a bunch of big announcements and trailers like a new look at the upcoming <em>007 First Light </em>and the reveal of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860">follow-up to&nbsp;<em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>, but one of the surprise standouts for me was <em>Zoopunk</em>, a new action game by <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged In Shadow Torch&nbsp;</em>developer TiGames, starring a bunch of anthropomorphic animals in a sort of dark, science-fiction post-apocalypse. However, as more news is trickling out, it’s beginning to look like the game might be using AI generation tools, and that has deflated my interest.</p> <p><em>Zoopunk</em>‘s fast-paced combat looks slick and stylish, but maybe a little stiff at first glance. I’m curious to see how it feels when the controller’s in my hands. Growing up playing&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>made me very picky about character action games in the PS2 era, so if one doesn’t feel good to play, I tend to bounce off of it very quickly. But what TiGames showed in the first trailer has potential.</p>

  <p>However, what didn’t come up during the Xbox showcase was that <i>Zoopunk </i>was also used as part of a Stable Diffusion AI asset generation demo earlier this year. The video, which is currently “unlisted” on the game’s YouTube channel, shows a user drawing simplistic equipment designs, which are then used to generate an in-game model. At the moment, it’s unclear if this is integrated into the game itself, or if <em>Zoopunk&nbsp;</em>was just used as a demo for the AI model. An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-ace-autonomous-ai-companions-pubg-naraka-bladepoint/">NVIDIA announcement</a> from earlier this year also names the game as using AI-powered NPCs. We’ve reached out to TiGames for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</p>  <p>Generative AI is creeping into video games more and more over recent years, with several executives at big companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">insisting it should become the norm within the industry</a>. Despite this, generative AI <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735">has become a legal battleground</a> as these models are being trained on copyrighted works.</p>

I’m grateful to everyone who helped bring it to this moment, especially the teams at Apogee, <a title="Companies > Atari [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a>, and <a title="Companies > Infogrames [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari/infogrames">Infogrames</a>. See you on the island. Listen carefully to the voice you follow.”</p><p>Apogee Entertainment executive producer Jeron Moore added, “<em>Total Chaos</em> is Apogee’s first step into survival horror and a full-circle moment for Sam, whose early love for classics like <em>DOOM</em>, <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</em>, and the horror genre at large helped inspire this original vision. What began as a total conversion mod has grown into a faithful and expanded remake.

Within the chaos lies a hidden silence—an invisible world that cannot be captured by words, but only expressed through sound. It is an experience like a journey where unseen landscapes are felt through the ears rather than seen by the eyes. I hope you enjoy it.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Apogee Entertainment:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

What is Roadside Research? Few things in life are certain, but I feel confident in saying you probably won't guess the hook for this game.</p><h2><strong>What even is Roadside Research?</strong></h2><p>Roadside Research is a 1-4 player co-op gas station simulator. Simulator-type games are everywhere these days, but this one differentiates itself because you play as an alien. More specifically, you're an undercover alien who tries to act like a human and do human-like things that a gas station attendant would do like stocking shelves and assisting customers. "Just don't get caught," reads a line from the description.</p>

Before Roadside Research, the studio made the horror game Order 13, in which players must navigate a dark and scary warehouse as they take on packing orders and try to keep their cat alive.

The new price for Game Pass Ultimate soared by 50% to $30/month. However, most major retailers are not going with the new price, at least not yet, so <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">you can still get Game Pass Ultimate for $20/month or $60 for three months on Amazon</a> and many other stores.</p>

            <p>James Bond is known for its cars, and 007 First Light from Hitman developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> will be no exception.</p>
<p>As shared at this evening's Xbox Partner Preview showcase, the upcoming espionage caper will feature Aston Martin's Valhalla supercar, which is to say Aston Martin's first-ever mid-engine plug-in hypercar.</p>

<p>The car itself was inspired by Aston Martin's Valkyrie, but this chap has been "infused" with advanced Formula 1 technologies. There are only going to be 999 units worldwide, so lucky ol' (actually, make that lucky young) Bond, eh?</p>
<p>"The reveal of Valhalla in 007 First Light marks one of the many steps our team is taking to honour the iconic cars that define the Bond legacy," said Hakan Abrak, CEO of IO Interactive. "Cars have always been at the core of the James Bond experience, reflecting his style, ingenuity, and daring personality.</p>
<p>"With the debut of Valhalla, players will encounter a machine that embodies that spirit, capturing the excitement of Bond’s world and the timeless elegance of his vehicles."</p>
<p>You can see its 007 First Light counterpart in the images below. Obviously, Bond's has a few modcons</p>

            <p>
Rapper Eminem will star in the next Elusive Target mission coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>, with players tasked with eliminating his alter ego Slim Shady.
</p>
<p>
As announced in tonight's Xbox Partner Preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> is releasing a new free mission for Agent 47, along with the paid Eminem vs Slim Shady Pack containing various cosmetics.
</p>
<p>
In the mission, Agent 47 will team up with Eminem - a fellow operative, just like Bruce Lee was recently - in a mission to "untangle the twisted mind of Slim Shady".

<p>
A medical facility in Hokkaido has been reconfigured into the "chaotic" Popsomp Hills Aslyum. It's full of both psychological twists and references to the rapper. Slim Shady is busy delivering erratic live performances to brainwish listeners and weaponise music - because of course.
</p>
<p>
Eminem follows the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-next-elusive-target-is-jean-claude-the-splitter-van-damme">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitmans-agent-47-will-soon-be-able-to-assassinate-casino-royale-baddy-la-chiffre">Bond nemesis Le Chiffre</a> as recent famous faces joining the ongoing stealth action game.
</p>
<p>
The free mission will be available from 1st December on all platforms - that's Xbox Series X/S, PC (Xbox, Steam, Epic), PS4, PS5, and Switch consoles.
</p>
<p>
The Eminem vs Slim Shady Pack will be available from 1st - 31st December for £3.99.

<p>What a combo</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a long-time reader, then you know we love a bit of Jupiter's Picross series. And we're in for a treat on 27th November 2025, as we're getting two brand new Picross games on Switch.</p>
<p>Jupiter has announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_capcom_classics_edition">Picross S Capcom Classics Edition</a> <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/picross_s_snk_classics_neogeo_edition">Picross S SNK Classics &amp; NEOGEO Edition</a>, with both games featuring tons of pixel art puzzles for you to solve from various Capcom and SNK properties. Both titles will cost <strong>$17.99 / €17.99 / £16.19</strong> each.</p>
<p>For Capcom, you've got some familiar favourites such as <strong>Street Fighter</strong>, <strong>Mega Man</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ghosts_n_goblins">Ghouls 'n Goblins</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire">Breath of Fire</a>, <strong>Final Fight</strong>, and other classic Capcom franchises.</p>
<p>SNK's own Picross entry pulls from <strong>Metal Slug</strong>, <strong>Fatal Fury</strong>, <strong>King of Fighters</strong>, and many other titles from its illustrious fighting game history and NEOGEO catalogue.</p>

<p>Both games will include Picross, Mega Picross, Color Picross, Clip Picross, and Extra modes, as well as art galleries and grid guidelines. On Switch 2, both will be compatible with Mouse Mode too!</p>
<p>We've seen Picross team up with Mario, Zelda, Pokémon, Doraemon, Sanrio, Story of Seasons, and many more IPs. We'd love to see even more like Capcom and SNK, too. Spoil us!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Coming from the creator of Turbo Overkill, the survival horror Total Chaos is no longer “coming soon”, it’s out now! Total Chaos is available for PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it’s a day one game for Xbox Game Pass as well. Steam VR support is expected to arrive in Q2 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total Chaos | Available Now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3oMPaRnaiig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It’s an impressive trailer for the game, with some deeply unsettling visuals and perspectives, playing out as a first person horror and lookin to blend both classic and modern horror sensibilities together. </p>
<p>Across the 9 chapters journey through to the heart of Fort Oasis, along the way you’ll be able to lean on both melee and ranged weapons, building new weapons from scrap and scavenging as you go. </p>
<p>Your journey will also be accompanied by a soundtrack that features a new original theme from Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka, and an ambient soundtrack from composers Jason Dagenet &amp; William Braddell, and Apogee’s Tim Stoney, Chipper Hammond, and Mathieu Hallouin.</p>

<p>Total Chaos has its roots in a modern Doom II total conversion. First conceptualised by Sam in 2008 and then developed from 2012 through 2018, Total Chaos has now been completely rebuilt as a fully standalone experience, and expanded from six chapters to nine.</p>

		<p>Eclipse Glow Games shared a big long look at their upcoming action-adventure game, a spectacular visual feast of a boss battle that’s inspired by Arthurian Legend. The game is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though there’s no date set just yet. </p>

<p>Players will step into the role of Gwendolyn, with this boss battle seeing her face off against the witch Tyronoe through multiple realms. This is a Dual Frontline battle, where you battle through a mirrored, folded realm as both Gwendolyn and the knight Sir Lamorak.</p>
<p>There’s a lot going on throughout, from shattering the divide between worlds, to fighting on a lake and within its reflective surface, and to a big fiery ball that you need to blow up before it’s too late. </p>
<p>It really is quite special as a visual showcase, built within Unreal Engine 5.</p>

<p>I also find that it’s quite a satisfying turnabout for the usual game creation tale of Western developers looking to Asian mythology and history for inspiration. Eclipse Glow Games is a Chinese studio that’s borrowed from British myths instead, setting Tides of Annihilation in a devastated and distorted version of London, following an Outworld invasion, and crossing over to the mythical realm of Avalon. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/erosion-is-an-open-world-roguelite-spaghetti-western-shooter-where-your-deaths-advance-time-and-bring-consequences.1359937/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Polish indie developer Plot Twist has unveiled its new open world roguelite game, Erosion, at the Xbox Partner Preview, and it was certainly among the most interesting titles there.</p>



<p>In Erosion, players find themselves in a distant future where a mysterious, sentient rock formation known as the Pillar is consuming civilization, bit by bit. They must descend into the Pillar and battle through chaotic, fully destructible dungeons to get one step closer to saving the protagonist’s daughter or losing her to time itself forever. Every decision alters the course of the story, and every death reduces the time available.</p>



<p>The game can be roughly split into two parts: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dungeon runs, where the focus is on fast-paced, twin-stick roguelite combat in procedural dungeons.</li>



<li>The Overworld, a handcrafted, open world, spaghetti western environment dedicated to exploration, quests, and meta-progression.</li>
</ul>



<p>Erosion was built with a “low voxel” aesthetic, enabling full physics-driven environmental destructibility. Players will encounter a diverse range of biomes, both above ground (deserts, swamps, ancient cities) and below ground in dungeons, each presenting unique atmospheric and enemy challenges. The game features an extensive arsenal of weapons, active/passive skills, and "orbitals" that the player can equip to deal with enemies. Boss design draws inspiration from classic arcade games (Snake, DDR, Pong, Tetris), sometimes blending bullet hell and puzzle elements. Erosion even features side activities such as poker, racing, sand fishing, and hunting.</p>



<p>The game's defining feature, however, is undoubtedly the time jump mechanic. Dying advances time, irreversibly altering relationships and quest outcomes, with branching consequences. Decisions like which factions to help, quests to complete, or bosses to fight have persistent effects; some villages might be taken over by factions or descend into anarchy depending on player actions. Eventually, players can unlock the ability to travel backward in time, undo previous choices, and try alternative timelines, letting them explore different outcomes and ultimately fix eroding timelines.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Plot Twist is planning to kick off early access in Spring 2026 for PC (Steam, Xbox on PC, and Game Pass), with console versions to follow. The developer said the early access period is expected to be short but will include rolling content updates, such as new biomes, skills, and timelines. The devs also plan to explore two-person cooperative gameplay and robust post-launch content inspired by successful roguelites like Dead Cells.</p>

			<p>The Golden Joystick Awards are consistently the awards show to kick off awards season for the video game industry, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-leads-the-golden-joystick-awards-2025-nominations/">not just with how early the nominees are revealed</a>, but with how early the show is. It's not even December, and the popular annual awards show has named its Game of the Year winner, and winner of many more awards. This year, though, several of those awards, along with the Ultimate Game of the Year winner, all have the same recipient: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut title took home seven wins, including Sandfall being named the Studio of the Year, and Clair Obscur swept the performance-based awards as both Ben Starr and Jennifer English won for their performances of Verso and Maelle, respectively. It also won Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, and Best Soundtrack, and was the only game to take home more than two awards, and it won in every category it was nominated for.</p>



<p>Though much of the night was focused on Clair Obscur, it wasn't the only game with a big win in the night. Ghost of Yotei took home two awards, including Console Game of the Year, while Hollow Knight Silksong took home PC Game of the Year and Best Indie Game (Self-Published).</p>

            <p>Biff! Smash! Spear to the groin! Asteroid to the jaw! It must be a new gameplay video for Tides Of Annihilation, the Arthurian fantasy action game from Eclipse Glow Games that's out to steal either <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>'s lunch - do me a favour and pick one, because I can't decide. I can't stop comparing this game to things. I think there's something wrong with me. Help.</p>
<p>The hoity-toity Englishness of it all is somewhat Bayonetta (minus the humour), but the ally-summoning mechanics remind me more of FF16, while lead character Gwendolyn is from the same school of improbably clean-cut beauty as Stellar Blade's Eve. She's perhaps a bit more grizzled than Eve, possibly because she keeps letting witches hit her in the face with small planets.</p>

<p>The video shows us a boss battle against one of those witches, Tyronoe. It appears unedited, so we can get a sense of the ebb and flow of the game's fancier throwdowns. The boss alternates between human-scale punching, valkyrie bombardments from the other side of energy barriers, and a tricksy little moment where she warps through a frozen lake's mirrored surface and starts battering you from inside the reflection. Fortunately, Gwendolyn teams up mid-fight with a Knight of the Roundtable, Lamorak, whose twisty javelin proves super-effective against the hag.</p>
<p>A barrage of background trivia from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">the announcement post</a>: based in China, Eclipse Glow number 100 developers and have people who've previously worked on Yakuza, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, Assassin's Creed, Persona, and Prince of Persia.</p>
<p>Tides Of Annihilation will be 30 hours long, and will have around 30 bosses. Some of the enemies are big enough to be levels, a la Fumito Ueda. Yes, that <em>is</em> Jennifer English of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> fame voicing Gwendolyn. The game is set across post-apocalyptic London and mythical Avalon, and they may have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-tides-of-annihilation-trailer-is-a-buttery-montage-of-bossfights">got the bus routes wrong</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-philips-hue-3-bulb-pack-hits-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-on-black-friday%E2%80%99s-first-day.1359922/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Traditional light switches offer exactly two settings: on and off, which leaves you stuck with whatever harsh overhead lighting the previous homeowner installed. The Philips Hue 3-pack <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> bulbs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/">just dropped to a record low of $69 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from the usual $109 price</a>.</p>
<p>Philips maintains strict pricing on Hue products throughout the year which makes Black Friday the only time these smart bulbs receive meaningful discounts. <strong>Smart lighting completely changes room ambiance</strong> by letting you tune color temperature, brightness and even hue to match your activity or mood rather than accepting whatever your builder-grade fixtures emit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of Colors</h2>
<p>The <em>White and Color Ambiance</em> range reproduces millions of distinct colors alongside the full spectrum of white light, <strong>from 2000K warm amber to 6500K cool daylight</strong>. You can bathe your living room in deep blue for movie nights, shift to energizing daylight white for morning routines or create warm orange tones for dinner ambiance. The color accuracy spans the entire visible spectrum, giving you precise control over the exact shade you want rather than cycling through preset options. Each bulb can display different colors simultaneously, so you might have blue accent lighting in one lamp while maintaining warm white in overhead fixtures. The 60W-<strong>equivalent brightness delivers 800 lumens at full power,</strong> and provides enough light for reading or detailed work rather than just mood lighting.</p>



<p>The<strong> bulbs connect directly to your home Wi-Fi network without needing a separate hub</strong>, but with the addition of a Hue Bridge come more advanced features: remote control from anywhere and more stable connections that don’t tax your router. Matter compatibility integrates Hue bulbs with other smart home devices across manufacturers, creating unified automation regardless of which ecosystem you’ve invested in. You can trigger lights based on motion sensors, door contacts, or time schedules without maintaining separate apps for each device brand. Secure connection protocols block unauthorized access to your lighting system while maintaining responsive control.</p>
<p><strong>Preset scenes</strong> offer one-touch lighting setups for frequent activities and times of day. The 24-hour natural light scene automatically adjusts color temperature throughout the day to simulate sunlight, gradually changing from warm tones at sunrise to bright daylight in the afternoon and back to amber hues at sunset. Such circadian lighting supports your body’s natural rhythm and could give you better sleep quality by reducing blue light exposure before going to bed.</p>



<p><strong>Voice control via Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit</strong> means you won’t have to reach for your phone every time you want to issue basic lighting commands. The voice commands work with individual bulbs, rooms or zones that group multiple lights together. This is pretty handy when you’ve got messy hands from cooking, are settling into bed, or trying to get through the door while carrying groceries.</p>
<p>The <strong>standard A19 form factor fits any fixture</strong> designed for traditional bulbs, from table lamps to ceiling fixtures to bathroom vanities. The bulb screws into E26 sockets designed for standard medium-base bulbs, requiring no special adapters or modifications. LED technology remains cool to the touch and uses a mere 9 watts while delivering <strong>brightness equivalent to 60-watt incandescent bulbs</strong>, and reduces electricity costs while lasting 25,000 hours or roughly 22 years at three hours daily use.</p>
<p>At $69 for three bulbs, this Black Friday deal brings the per-bulb cost down to $23, which undercuts Philips’s regular single-bulb pricing of $49. You’re getting full-color smart bulbs from the industry leader in smart lighting for less than many color-changing bulbs from unknown brands.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change-2000645791</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ugreen-dumps-its-65w-usb-c-wall-charger-with-4-ports-now-going-for-pocket-change.1359919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wall outlets disappear fast when every device needs its own charging brick cluttering power strips and blocking adjacent sockets. The <strong>Ugreen</strong> <em>Nexode</em> 65W GaN charger <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/">just hit a record low of $24 for Black Friday on Amazon, down from its usual $39 price</a>. This four-port charger consolidates multiple charging bricks into a single compact unit that occupies one outlet while powering your laptop, phone, tablet, and wireless earbuds simultaneously. When traveling, carrying four separate chargers involves dedicating a lot of valuable bag space to power adapters, whereas this single charger handles everything. GaN technology keeps the charger cool and efficient while intelligently outputting a total 65W across three USB-C ports and one USB-A port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4472/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W Powers Your MacBook at Full Speed</h2>
<p>The<strong> 65W maximum output is enough to fast-charge a MacBook Air at its full charging rate,</strong> and reach 51% battery in just 30 minutes. This matches the charging speed you’d get from Apple’s own 61W charger, so you’re not settling with the Ugreen as some kind of compromise. Power delivery is via USB-C Power Delivery 3.0 protocol that negotiates optimal charging rates with compatible devices automatically.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-port configuration includes three USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong> that can cover modern devices alongside legacy gadgets. That three-USB-C setup means you can charge your laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously using the same type of cable without hunting for different connectors. This design leaves the USB-A port for older devices, wireless earbuds, smartwatches, and accessories that haven’t transitioned to USB-C yet. Dynamic distribution of the total 65W output by intelligent power distribution allows for the <strong>charger to adjust the output based on what devices you plug in</strong> and their power requirements.</p>
<p>Gallium nitride technology replaces traditional silicon components found in the charger with more efficient materials that conduct electricity much better while generating less heat. This efficiency enables Ugreen to pack 65W of charging power<strong> into a charger that is significantly smaller than older silicon-based 65W adapters</strong>.</p>



<p>At compact dimensions,<strong> it measures just 2.64 by 1.65 by 1.5 inches</strong> and this charger is smaller than Apple’s single-port 67W adapter despite offering four ports and comparable power. This reduction in size matters enormously for travel: the charger easily fits into laptop bags, toiletry pouches, or jacket pockets without consuming excessive space. The foldable prongs collapse flat against the charger body and prevents them from snagging on bag contents or poking holes in pouches.</p>
<p>Universal compatibility includes MacBook Pro and Air series, iPhone 17/16/… series, Samsung Galaxy S25/S24/…, Pixel 10/9/…, iPad Pro, Steam Deck, and quite basically everything that charges via USB. It’s compatible across manufacturers and platforms without the need for brand-specific adapters or configurations. Charge Apple devices from USB-C ports and charge Android devices from the same ports without any compatibility issues.</p>
<p>At $24, this Ugreen 65W charger is 39% off retail while bringing features and performance that are in line with chargers costing upwards of $60 from premium brands.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nuketowns-most-popular-easter-egg-isnt-working-in-black-ops-7/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nuketown%E2%80%99s-most-popular-easter-egg-isn%E2%80%99t-working-in-black-ops-7.1359916/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s preseason content brings Nuketown. The camo grind really begins now, but there’s a distinct lack of Easter Eggs in Nuketown, including the legendary mannequin heads.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 is about to really get going. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> is getting ready to get underway, and this will signal the long-awaited <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 &amp; Warzone Integration</a>. Before this, the preseason has started, which includes the debut (again) of Nuketown. This is the latest incarnation of the decade-old map.</p>



<p>But it’s missing one big thing at launch.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-nuketown-mannequins-can-t-be-shot">Black Ops 7 Nuketown Mannequins Can’t Be Shot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s a waiting game. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The mannequin heads can’t be shot in Black Ops 7’s Nuketown right now. The map is live, it has its own playlist option, but the mannequin heads are very resolute, meaning no Nuketown Easter Egg.</p>







<p>Ordinarily, you can shoot the mannequin heads, and if you pop all of them off, a humorous Easter Egg plays out. It varies from game to game, but there’s no such thing in Black Ops 7 right now.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve encountered this, don’t worry, it’s probably not permanent. This has happened before, and the mannequin Easter Egg—as well as any others—is usually activated once Season 1 begins.</p>



<p>No one knows why this is the case, but it’s usually what happens. So, be patient, and the time will come for you to furiously dislodge plastic heads from idle mannequin bodies.</p>



<p>Have you encountered any other weird occurrences in Black Ops 7? Bring it to everyone’s attention in the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Partner Showcase opened with a brand new game reveal I certainly didn't see coming: it's called Armatus, and it's seemingly being made by the developers of Godfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is a new third-person roguelite shooter set in a fictionalized version of Paris that's looking...pretty messed up. An event called The Vanishing has effectively caused the end of the world, and you're some sort of masked warrior roaming around and fighting demons. That's really all we know for now: the trailer gave us a look at a lot of combat and some pretty cool monster designs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/armatus-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a>, we learned a little more: after the end of the world, four members of something called the Armatus meet and summon the player to fight on their behalf and get them sent to heaven. You're searching for something called The Sunless Gate along The Scoured Path, which is a constantly changing road through a broken Paris, with procedurally-spawned rooms, enemy compositions, and rewards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've forgotten everything about Counterplay's last game, Godfall, here's a refresh: Godfall was an action RPG that came out in 2020, initially just for PlayStation and PC but later for Xbox as well. It was described at the time as a "looter-slasher", heavily focused on finding and collecting better and better gear, and that admittedly had an awful lot of cool-looking weapons to collect. Unfortunately it received pretty mixed reviews, including from us, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/godfall-review">getting an IGN 6/10</a>. As our reviewer put it then: "Godfall can be an enjoyable and lovely gear-based action game while it lasts, but the repetition of its missions wears thin before the end of its campaign, and even thinner in the endgame afterward." Hopefully Armatus fairs better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Armatus is coming out in 2026 for Xbox Series consoles, PS5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gearbox has released a significant patch for Borderlands 4 that makes some quality-of-life improvements such as smarter loot drops and a new Legendary Loot Indicator for your radar. These arrive alongside visual polish and stability updates for a “smoother” experience on Kairos, Gearbox said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Digging into the detail, Class Mods have been adjusted to drop more for your current character, which is a welcome change for those on the hunt for ever-improving builds. The loot feed is now updated to display total current currency after spending or receiving money, and the likelihood of unintended movements or knockbacks while reviving a teammate is reduced. And it's worth noting that the patch adds a new Legendary Loot Indicator to the combat radar for easier identification of high-rarity drops. given how busy with loot Borderlands 4 can get, this is also welcome.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a>, below, Gearbox said it was wrapping up work on Photo Mode, while other updates like support for multiple active Big Encore Machines and more options for scaling difficulty are coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further into the future, Gearbox said it’s looking at ways to improve shared character progression, add additional endgame-focused activities (Takedown), launch cross-save support, and more. Major Updates, which deliver larger-scale changes, are planned to deploy about a month apart.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today’s update launches alongside Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, which is now free for all players. How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is the first of five post-launch DLC Bounty Packs coming to Borderlands 4. While How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is free for all players, Bounty Packs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are included with Borderlands 4 Deluxe Edition, Borderlands 4 Super Deluxe Edition, the Borderlands 4 Bounty Pack Bundle, and will be available for separate purchase.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Borderlands 4 November 20 Major Update Patch Notes:</h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We're stoked for you to team up with Rush and teach Minister Screw the true meaning of Mercenary Day! This being a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, we knew we had to deliver it to you by the end of the year. However, the team realized that there was more mayhem than time when it came to getting as much into Bounty Pack 1 as originally planned while never slowing down in their mission to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> player experience. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in the spirit of the season, we're giving a gift to all <em>Borderlands 4</em> players by making Bounty Pack 1 free! Thank you for all the passion and support you've given us as a community. We're hard at work making sure future Bounty Packs are more fully loaded with the compelling content players have been asking for. In addition, we're now adding a new Bounty Pack 5 (more on that in a bit); there's a lot of amazing stuff coming to <em>Borderlands 4</em>, so stay tuned!</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added support for How Rush Saved Mercenary Day content! Jump into this free content today by finding and interacting with the gift-wrapped present (marked on your map as a new mission) in any major hub, which will initiate the mission to assist Rush!</li><li>Added support for the Bounty Pack 1 Vault Card! Playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> with a Vault Card active gives you more loot and XP via Daily and Weekly challenges, and it can be leveled up at your own pace (no time limits or expiring rewards here). You can activate it via the Vault Card screen in your ECHO menu. Vault Card progression works just like leveling up: it's all driven by how much XP you're gaining. By exploring Kairos, killing enemies, and completing quests, you'll fill up your Vault Card progression in addition to your regular XP!<ul data-cy="list"><li>This includes 4 new pieces of rerollable gear and 24 new cosmetics to earn!</li></ul></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Notable Changes</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We wanted to pull these out specifically as they have been heavily mentioned in the community. </strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Updated the Weekly Wildcard Missions to set additional start points in missions</li><li>Dev Note: This feature will allow future Weekly Wildcard Missions to jump straight to the meat of a mission.</li><li>Class Mods have been adjusted to drop more for your current character</li><li>Converted the Phosphene weapon challenge from character-based to profile-wide progression<ul data-cy="list"><li>Dev Note: This long-term grind is aimed at our most dedicated community members who invest the most time in the game.
